ONCE UPON A BARSTOOL; A DRINKING LIFE: A MEMOIR, BY PETE HAMILL (LITTLE, BROWN 
& CO.: $21.95; 265 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Hemphill, Paul Hemphill's most recent book is the memoir, Leaving 
Birmingham: Notes of a Native Son. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Late in 1969, after five years as a daily newspaper columnist in Atlanta and 
the reward of a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard, I was summoned to New York to see 
if I wanted to take my act to the mother of cities. Jimmy Breslin of the 
Herald-Tribune and Pete Hamill of the Post had been distant models for me -- 
hard driving, hard drinking, macho street poets from the Hemingway School -- 
and now I was being offered a chance to compete with them from Newsday out on 
Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
 As a part of my tour, I was taken into the city by my friend Mike McGrady, a 
fellow Nieman and a Newsday columnist of some note. "Maybe we'll run into the 
Hammer," he said, speaking of Hamill, as we entered the raucous valley of an 
artist-and-writers bar in Greenwich Village called the Lion's Head. Now for the 
big leagues , I remember thinking; and, lo and behold, there was Hamill himself 
alone at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete," said McGrady, tapping Hamill on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Startled, as drunk as any man I had ever seen, Hamill flailed at his attacker. 
Soon he was hand-walking along the back wall, trying to make it to the 
cigarette machine, spilling quarters as he went. "Not a good time to meet the 
Hammer," said McGrady. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons unrelated to the spectacle of seeing one of my heroes wasted in a 
New York bar, I rejected the offer from Newsday -- what I really wanted, at 33, 
was to start writing books -- but that image stayed with me even as I descended 
into alcoholism myself. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hamill, I was the son of a blue-collar drinker, the self-taught boy who 
had found my place as a proletarian prophet in an era when drinking and 
posturing were as much a part of that life as interviewing and typing. We had 
bought into the Hemingway legend without acknowledging that it had destroyed 
Papa before his time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the rest of the story, the grim tale of what led Hamill to that 
night at the Lion's Head 25 years ago, and I'm inclined to ask where "A 
Drinking Life" was when I needed it. "I didn't know it at the time, but I had 
entered the drinking life," Hamill writes of dropping out of high school at the 
age of 16 and taking a job at the Brooklyn Navy yard. "Drinking was part of 
being a man. Drinking was an integral part of sexuality, easy entrance to its 
dark and mysterious treasure chambers. Drinking was the sacramental binder of 
friendships. Drinking was the reward for work, the fuel of celebration, the 
consolation for death or defeat. Drinking gave me strength, confidence, ease, 
laughter; it made me believe that dreams really could come true." Yes. 
Precisely. 
</P>
<P>
 In straightforward candor, with the unflinching staccato hammering that lent 
him his nickname, Hamill shows us that his fate was sealed from the moment of 
his birth in 1935. He was the oldest of six children sired by an immigrant from 
Belfast who spent his days at menial labor and his nights in the bars of 
Brooklyn Irish neighborhoods. It was a classic urban childhood in many ways -- 
playing stickball in the streets, trading comic books, baiting the nuns at Holy 
Name of Jesus elementary school, craning to glimpse the triumphant Dodgers 
parading down Flatbush Avenue, delivering the Brooklyn Eagle -- but it promised 
little future. The routine was to drop out of school, marry a girl from the 
Neighborhood, follow your father into the factories and the saloons, have kids, 
get old and die. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in young Pete Hamill, though, there was a rebel wanting to break the 
mold. Thanks, in part, to a mother who read to him as a child, he became a 
regular at the public library and saw there was a larger world beyond Brooklyn. 
Oddly, his ticket out would be a fascination with art that had begun with his 
boyhood attempts to copy illustrations from the pages of Tarzan and Captain 
Marvel. By the time he was 17 he was working days at the Navy yard and spending 
nights at an art school in Manhattan -- one foot in each of two desperate 
worlds -- and he was hearing imaginary voices from the Neighborhood. Who the 
hell do you think you are?  
</P>
<P>
 He was even juggling two women: a libidinous model in Manhattan and a nice 
Catholic girl in Brooklyn. "I tried to sort out all the different strands of my 
story: art school, the Navy yard, the Neighborhood, my father, my brothers and 
sisters, my friends, drinking, Maureen and Laura. I couldn't do it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The hitch in the Navy during the Korean War was a start, for it was at a base 
library in Florida that he discovered Hemingway and Fitzgerald. The remainder 
of the 1950s would be filled with more drunken meanderings -- most notably a 
nightmarish sojourn at an art school in Mexico City under the GI Bill -- but 
toward the end of the decade he had begun secretly teaching himself to write. 
In those charged political times, with the death of McCarthyism and the 
appearance of young Jack Kennedy, he began to devour the city's seven 
newspapers, especially the liberal tabloid Post. In 1960, at 25, he was hired 
as a night rewrite man there, with the direct result of an impassioned letter 
to the editor, Jimmy Wechsler, challenging the notion that people without 
formal education didn't belong in newspapering. The Hammer was on his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading much of "A Drinking Life" is like gawking at a wreck on the highway. 
Working off and on for the Post, supplementing his income with magazine pieces 
and screenplays, Hamill was forever searching for "the GGP (Great Good Place)." 
Married now, with two daughters, he tried Spain, Ireland, Rome, San Juan, 
Mexico City and countless other stops, until he was summoned back to the Post 
as a columnist in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, he never became a great New York columnist. Unlike Jimmy 
Breslin, who was and sometimes still is, Hamill was weighted with too much 
booze and too little true self-confidence; too often the column was vitriolic, 
angry, stewing with rhetoric, stuck on one note. He was, in many ways 
(especially throughout his long public affair with the actress Shirley 
MacLaine), his own best story. 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding this and sensing "odd little signs of deterioration," Hamill 
quit drinking, cold turkey, on New Year's Eve of 1972. Positive results came 
almost immediately when he wrote "in one miraculous burst" a celebrated 
novella, "The Gift," "full of drinking and love for my father." He has pointed 
out to interviewers that he produced one novel while drinking, and seven since. 
He would go by the Lion's Head, to test himself: "The sensation of performance 
ebbed. . . I started hearing stories I'd heard many times before . . . I was 
polite. I listened. I laughed at the punch lines. But I didn't drink." 
</P>
<P>
 The story ends in the mid-70s, with a ceremonial visit to the old Neighborhood 
in Brooklyn, indicating that the door might be open for a sequel. In recent 
years the sober Pete Hamill has been writing better than ever in places like 
Esquire and New York and the Village Voice -- impassioned pieces with an 
old-fashion liberal attitude about everything from AIDS to rap music -- and he 
truly roared back into the city's consciousness last year when he strode 
heroically into the newsroom of the embattled Post to take over as editor of 
every liberal's favorite tabloid. Under the glare of television lights, to a 
standing ovation from colleagues too young to remember pint bottles in the 
bottom desk drawer, a relic of newspapers as we once knew them had returned. 
Hello, sweetheart, give me Rewrite.

SPIELBERG'S 'LIST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did author Diane K. Shah see the same film I did ("Steven Spielberg, 
Seriously," Dec. 19)? "Schindler's List"was one of the most indulgently 
sentimental movies I have ever seen, ending as it does with a historically 
inaccurate and anachronistic group hug, followed shortly thereafter by a coda 
-- with real Schindler survivors and the actors who played them -- that is one 
of the most manipulative, exploitative and embarrassing set of moments ever 
recorded on film. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as offensive sentimentality goes, Disney and Capra have nothing on 
Spielberg.

 Why is Spielberg not recognized by his peers for his magnificent work? He is a 
major talent who has a keen insight into people's lives and can treat a wide

 Spielberg chose to film a story about the disenfranchised of a generation 
past, but the real story is about the present-day dispossessed, the poor. We 
saw evidence of their story during the April, 1992, rioting, not in black and 
white but in black, white, brown and yellow. It was magnificent in its scope 
and sickening in its content, but it was real and it was America. Ironically, 
Spielberg's film about the past generation's experience cannot be seen by many 
of today's disenfranchised generation because they can't afford the price of 
admission.

REDEFINING WELFARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for the grim but all-too-accurate portrayal of the West L.A. welfare 
office ("Just Another Day in Paradise," by Michael J. Goodman, Dec. 19). The 
writer's next assignment should be to try to get through to a worker by 
telephone. You may only call your worker during a two-hour period each day, 
during which time the lines are constantly busy. Answering machines, where they 
exist, may not allow you to leave a message, may answer only in English and may 
not list your worker at that phone number, even if it is, in fact, your 
worker's number. 
</P>
<P>
 For applications for health-care coverage (Medi-Cal only), there is an 
alternative. Families in which there is a pregnant woman or in which there is a 
child born after Sept. 1, 1983, may apply at certain community for-profit and 
free clinics in California -- if they go there for health care. It is a program 
that is underutilized in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 For a list of such clinics in Los Angeles County, send a self-addressed, 
stamped envelope to Children's Advocacy Institute, 1010 S. Flower St., No. 500,

 I was on welfare for almost three years and observed Officer David Gatlin once 
every month. I now have a job, for which I'm thankful. To people who behave 
properly, Gatlin is one of the kindest guys you'd ever meet. But big Dave knows 
how to quickly encourage those who act up to return to normality. This is a man 
who respects all who walk into that office -- provided that they respect 
themselves. He's one of the best.

 The tragic flaw in redistributing tax dollars is that it enervates welfare

REFLECTIONS OF A WITTY TRAVELER; HENRY JAMES: COLLECTED TRAVEL WRITINGS, EDITED 
BY RICHARD HOWARD (THE LIBRARY OF AMERICA: TWO VOLUMES, $35 EACH; 845 PP., 846 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Miranda Seymour, Miranda Seymour's most recent book is Ottoline Morrell: 
Life on the Grand Scale (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not the least astonishing thing about these two beautifully produced and 
edited books is how well they stand the test of time. Few writing markets have 
expanded so dramatically as that of the travel guide. There are books in the 
hundreds ready to tell you where to eat, shop, sleep and be seen; I defy you to 
name any which will provide better company than these two have given me for the 
last fortnight. And yet the last piece was written in 1912 and the first in the 
1860s. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry James was not, in the usual meaning of the word, an adventurous 
traveler. Enthralled by Pierre Loti's accounts of Morocco, he would no more 
have gone there himself than to the moon. James, like his characters, was 
willing to absorb all that America and Britain could expose to his inquisitive 
stare but, even in westernized Europe, he drew the line sharply after Italy and 
France. Intensely social, he saw no point in going to a country where he could 
not communicate with confidence. His French and Italian were excellent. He had 
no other languages, which explains why there is nothing here to assist the 
visitor to Spain, Greece or Scandinavia. But do not, if you are contemplating a 
visit to Rome or the Adriatic, deprive yourself of the pleasure of being 
accompanied by such an observant, good humored and, unexpectedly, witty 
companion. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the earlier pieces were written as part of commissioned series for 
American magazines. The intention, James declared, was only to offer a series 
of impressions, "immediate, easy and consciously limited." What gives them 
their singular charm is the character of the observer, as presented in his own 
gently self-mocking prose. In Britain, we see him scrambling stoutly up the 
wind-lashed side of a Welsh mountain, "very much in the attitude of 
Nebuchadnezzar," or rejoicing at having escaped the obligatory tour of Windsor 
Castle in a party envisaged as "shuffling in dull, gregarious fashion over the 
miles of polished floor." Who else would have seen gregarious as just the word 
for the ceaseless mumble of tour parties? The sober observer looks on, 
fascinated, in another, marvelously funny, account of a carriage of cockney 
revelers at the races, in which "opulent young men" and "exhilarated" girls 
with "gilded" hair (for which, in less diplomatic language read drunk and 
bleached), derive loud and unending pleasure from the plight of one of their 
friends, "a pretty young man so drunk that nobody can lift him off the ground." 
Who, James asks in a more serious vein, "shall resolve into its component parts 
any impression of this richly complex English world, where the present is 
always seen, as it were, in profile, and the past presents a full face?" 
</P>
<P>
 James is magnificent on England and connoisseurs of his work will enjoy 
identifying the scenery and characters of some of his best-known works. But 
anyone who imagines that the novelist spent most of his free time dispensing 
witty badinage in the drawing-rooms of the grandest families will be astonished 
to find out how much of the travel writing is devoted to life at a less exotic 
level. There are accounts of derelict country houses abandoned by ruined 
owners, of overworked porters and sad receptionists in dingy hotels, of the 
black procession of grime-soaked warehouses along the Thames. Less zealously 
public-spirited than, say, Dickens, in his response to poverty, James only 
attempts to romanticize it on one occasion, when he grieves that the 
picturesque country tramps cannot be tethered to the turf on which they sleep 
so colorfully. Even here, it is probable that the writer is gently mocking his 
own insouciance. 
</P>
<P>
 I would be sorry for anyone to miss the passage in which a sodden Henry James 
confronts the Palais des Papes from under his umbrella and roundly abuses it 
for being "a very dull monument." James on France, however, is no more 
illuminating than a packet of matches when set beside the brilliant fireworks 
display of images, responses and perceptions that he bestows on Italy. Earlier 
Americans had been unable to set foot in Rome without being overwhelmed by 
their horror of the Catholic faith, an aversion which had a dismal effect on 
their prose. But James, having poked fun at those of his compatriots who had 
been in the habit of remarking that the Colosseum "will be a very handsome 
building when it is finished" then dares to suggest that there is a lot more 
fun to be had at a Roman carnival than in praying for the sinful masqueraders. 
Demurely eyeing "a handsome, opulent-looking nun" as she listens to the choir 
in a particularly sumptuous church, he wonders if her thoughts are not more 
occupied by the mellifluous baritone than by God. Seated at the opera, he 
declares himself amazed that the audience should applaud when Othello shows his 
anguish "by seizing Iago's head and whacking it half-a-dozen times on the 
floor, and flinging him 20 yards away." Can this, he wonders, be what they 
consider a great performance? 
</P>
<P>
 Closest of the travel writing to James' fiction is the ravishing collection of 
pieces on Venice, some of them written at the Palazzo Barbaro, where "The Wings 
of the Dove" was composed. Venice is the city in which James seems most 
serenely at his ease, evoking and representing every aspect of the city in 
prose, which shimmers like sunlit water. Here, most clearly, we see the 
novelist himself, admiring the majestic chastity of his favorite churches, 
shaking his head over Ruskin's lamentations for a lost city, climbing into a 
closed gondola to be taken out for tea with a venerable relic of aristocratic 
society. James in Venice is a man radiant with pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American Scene" has its admirers, and it is properly included here. I 
wish it was not. Published in 1907 after James's last visit to his own country, 
it seems to me only to show the failure of the writer's convoluted late style. 
All the freshness, the intelligence and life of the earlier travel writing has 
been replaced by a groping procession of tortuous sentences in which everything 
is sacrificed to nebulous sensation. Confronted and not attracted by modern 
culture, James stumbled in his search for an adequate response. New York was 
first a series of "extravagant pins in a cushion already overplanted" and then 
a semi-toothless hair comb. Neither image had the panache that the city 
deserved and business was not successfully apostrophized as a "great black 
ebony god." 
</P>
<P>
 The failure was, perhaps, one of discomfort; it is not an easy assignment to 
view your own land with the untutored eyes of a tourist. It was in Europe that 
James felt familiar by 1907; in America, he was almost a stranger.

RICHARD EDER: IRONY INCARNATE; THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS CHRIST, BY JOSE 
SARAMAGO . TRANSLATED FROM PORTUGUESE BY GIOVANNI PONTIERO (HARCOURT BRACE: 
$23.95; 384 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gospel according to Jose Saramago begins with the author contemplating a 
painting of the Crucifixion and, in a kind of mock gravity, subverting its 
iconography. Which of the figures is Mary Magdalene? Surely, the one with the 
plunging neckline; on the other hand, one woman is blond. There is, after all 
"the popular belief that women with blond hair, whether it be natural or dyed, 
are the most effective instruments of sin." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the two thieves. Why should one be called "the good thief," 
simply because he repented? Surely the honest thief is the one "who did not 
pretend to believe that sudden repentance suffices to redeem a whole life of 
evil." Most important, there is the receding figure of a man looking back over 
his shoulder, and carrying a bucket and a sponge. Through two millennia he has 
been reviled for offering vinegar to a thirsting Jesus. But in those days, 
vinegar and water was a recognized thirst quencher, Saramago insists, and he 
continues: 
</P>
<P>
 "The man walks away, does not wait for the end, he did all he could to relive 
the mortal thirst of the three condemned men, making no distinction between 
Jesus and the thieves, because these are things of this earth, which will 
persist on this earth, and from them will be written the only possible 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the tone that launches Saramago's New Testament reworking. It is a 
special blend of irony and innocence, of playfulness and melancholy; a 
disputatiousness that mocks not only received doctrine but its own mockery as 
well. It marks Saramago, Portugal's most distinguished living writer, as it 
marked his literary predecessors, Eca de Queiroz and Machado de Assis. It 
sounds a note as rooted in Portugal's character as Hemingway's clipped bark or 
Whitman's unclipped yawp were rooted in America's. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the voice of a country whose long-departed imperial unboundedness left 
it bound in a misty veil that has kept it oddly out of modern history. No 
dialectical confrontations for Portugal; no French or Russian Revolution nor 
even a Spanish-style civil war. At most the oddly pleasant Revolution of 
Carnations in the early '70s that slipped away the remains of the Salazar 
dictatorship much as a sleeper half-awakens to shrug off an unneeded blanket. 
When Germany, Italy and Spain were tyrannized by uniformed dictators, Portugal 
was tyrannized by a professor of economics. Imagine John Kenneth Galbraith 
ruling the United States for 40 years with the aid of a ubiquitous, dark-suited 
or -- more likely -- tweedy secret police. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gospel According to Jesus Christ" is likewise oddly out of its time. It 
is a skeptical, paradox-laden fiction about the meaning of Christ's 
incarnation, of God and the Devil, of good and evil, and of the grounds and 
purposes of human destiny. Following the bewildered wanderings of St. Joseph -- 
around whom God and Satan buzz like invisible gnats -- and the even more 
bewildered wanderings of a highly irritated Jesus, it has its grand climax in a 
boat on the Sea of Galilee where God, Satan and Jesus sit for 40 days in the 
fog and argue. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the kind of bravura cascade of philosophical quizzicality and ingenious 
reversals that were featured a century or so ago in such varied writings as the 
Grand Inquisitor scene in "The Brothers Karamazov," Mark Twain's "The 
Mysterious Stranger" and Shaw's "Don Juan in Hell." It is not much practiced 
nowadays -- C. S. Lewis's "Screwtape Letters" was 50 years ago -- but perhaps 
that is a Portuguese writer's privilege. Saramago is fully conscious of his 
national voice; at one point, referring to 2,000 Jews crucified by the Romans 
after a rebellion, he observes that, if placed a mile apart, the crosses could 
circle Portugal, "which is not large." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nativity part of the story is told with a lovely, displaced tenderness 
that focuses on Joseph rather than Mary. The young carpenter awakes in their 
hut -- "an oil lamp is burning, but its flickering flame, like a small, 
luminous almond, barely impinges on the darkness" -- goes outdoors to urinate, 
sees the sky blaze oddly, is aroused and returns to make love to his wife. In 
Saramago's "Gospel," which caused considerable scandal in Portugal, not only is 
Mary not a virgin but the conception of Jesus is a commingling of her husband's 
seed with God's. Saramago's Jesus is fully sexual; later he will become, in 
effect, Mary Magdalene's husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, this Jesus bears his own version of Original Sin. Joseph, hearing 
of Herod's plan to kill the first-born male babies, is too intent on saving his 
son to warn others. From that time until he redeems himself by a supreme act of 
charity that will get him crucified at the age of 33 -- another displacement -- 
he will dream that he is leading soldiers to kill Jesus. Jesus will dream that 
his father is coming to kill him. It foreshadows the climactic argument in the 
boat when God, his other father, tells him of his mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Satan appears early, as an angel attending the nativity. Later, as a 
mysterious shepherd, he will employ Jesus for four wilderness years, 
discharging him only when the young man sacrifices one of the sheep to God, who 
appears as a column of smoke. Satan, unlike his rival, is strictly 
anti-violence. Jesus's story skips along. He settles down with Mary Magdalene, 
goes out with the Galilee fishermen, begins to perform miracles. They are 
awkward and comic; he has no idea what they are for or what he is supposed to 
be doing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Galilee fog-summit -- one more of Saramago's nicely implanted ironies -- 
will clarify matters. God tells Jesus that He is tired of being worshiped only 
by the Jews. He has created a Son to be a divine victim whose death will vastly 
enlarge the numbers of the faithful. Satan sits sardonically silent; his 
presence is required since whenever God's kingdom is enlarged, so is the 
devil's. Jesus objects vigorously but he has no choice. He does get God to list 
all the agony that will ensue from his own sacrifice. We read a three-page list 
of martyrs, followed by mentions of religious wars and the Inquisition. "One 
has to be God to countenance so much bloodshed," Satan mutters, and offers to 
repent, give up his power and become an angel again. Evil will end and 
sacrifices will not be needed. God refuses "because the good I represent cannot 
exist without the evil you represent, if you were to end, so would I. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The notion is hardly new. Saramago spins his web around what is by now a 
venerable paradox. The results are not always good; quite apart, of course, 
from the fact that he is playing exclusive left field in a wider 
literary-philosophical stadium where the devil has some of the best lines but 
not all of them. Sometimes Saramago's disputations seem forced. His narrative 
can be original and resplendent -- Joseph is a rare and luminous creation -- 
but it too can seem forced. We may realize, in fact, what remarkable 
story-tellers Matthew, Mark and Luke were. Over the centuries, their stories 
have allowed all kinds of illuminating variations. And despite its sporadic 
creaks, Saramago's contrarian version, beautifully translated by Giovanni 
Pontiero, is illuminated by ferocious wit, gentle passion and poetry.

NOVELS THAT REACH FOR THE STARS; DECORATIONS IN A RUINED CEMETERY, BY JOHN 
GREGORY BROWN (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $19.95; 244 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Margaret Langstaff, Margaret Langstaff is writing a book about the spiritual 
dimension of work. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wish more people today would attempt books like this one, novels that take 
on the big questions, the eternal verities, and, without pretense and a whole 
lot of claptrap, address the difficulty of finding meaning and significance in 
life. For this is the stuff of which classics are made and what literature, 
certainly, is all about. That John Gregory Brown had the nerve to square off 
before such issues in his first novel is by itself laudable. The fact that he 
wrote a fine story with believable, memorable characters in the process is 
reason for applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, not yet 40, writes out of the Southern tradition in fiction, and is 
midway, in terms of depth and accessibility, between Faulkner and Walker Percy, 
(sort of a Lite-Faulkner or a Percy au jus.) Race, family, heritage, faith, 
good and evil are the obsessions in question, and the plot turns on critical 
choices having to do with one's understanding of the difference between 
virtuous behavior and cowardice, and one's courage to do the right thing. More 
readable than Faulkner, less comedic than Percy, Brown is nonetheless in their 
direct line of descent, their natural heir, without any obvious imitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Decorations in a Ruined Cemetery" concerns the Eagen family of New Orleans 
and its immediate vicinity, Irish Catholics whose lineage is made more 
colorful, if not more difficult, by containing within it a black matriarch who 
mysteriously, in midlife, disappears, leaving her husband and small son to 
continue their lives without her. The legacy of this racial intermarriage and 
the mystery of Molly Moore Eagen's disappearance -- unsolved until the book's 
final pages -- haunt and twist the lives of three generations of Eagens. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the central narrator is Lowell Henry Eagen's granddaughter Meredith, 
the story is told through the three alternating voices of Meredith, her 
step-mother Catherine, and Eagen's black servant of 40 years, the elderly 
Murphy Warrington, all of whom come at the same sequence of events from 
different angles and interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 Patriarch Eagen, a devoutly religious Irish immigrant, had set things in 
motion by choosing as a wife a woman of mixed blood, the comely spirited and 
very light-skinned Molly Moore, and bringing her to his new home in the deep 
South, Mandeville, La. Grandfather Eagen was a good and saintly man who 
maintained the difference between black and white "was not an issue." In 
practice, of course, it was, and his more worldly descendants were left to 
grapple with the fact that they carried black blood in their veins while for 
all intents and purposes they lived the privileged life of whites. 
</P>
<P>
 A quiet unprepossessing man who made garden statuary of the saints and Christ 
for a living, Eagen bequeathed to subsequent generations not only an impossible 
model of behavior, but also a cursed constitutional sensitivity to moral 
questions, including an extreme sense of responsibility and a penchant for 
soul-searching. Eagen's son, Dr. Thomas Eagen, orthopedist, shapes this legacy 
into a professional life of caring for the poor and destitute and a private 
life of trying to reconcile his father's surreal goodness with his mother's 
apparently heartless abandonment so many years ago. Meredith and her twin 
brother Lowell inherit this thorny situation through their father who, as 
inexplicably as his own mother had left him, decamps on his second wife 
Catherine, the only mother Meredith and Lowell have ever known, taking the kids 
with him. As Meredith says early in the story, "It's complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's also very real and credible just because it is so messy. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is rife with miscues and misunderstandings, and an almost consistent 
misreading by the narrators of the prima facie evidence concerning everyone 
else's decisions and motives, and in this regard the choice of multiple points 
of view in relating the events is both inspired and apt. None of the voices is 
completely reliable, given everyone's prejudices and predilections, and for 
most of the book all three have only partial information on which to base their 
decisions and judgments. Ultimately it is Meredith's understanding of things, 
and what she does with it, in which we are interested, for she is the 
contemporary representative of the Eagen line. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is a very moving one, and sorrowful because so ordinary and so 
familiar. It's about the search for something to believe in, a lifelong effort, 
if I read this writer aright, and what we inherit from our forebears and what 
we are to make of it. The characters are tormented by garden-variety suspicion, 
deceit, betrayal, adultery, shame and guilt, and know fleeting moments of 
faith, hope and love. The struggle that ensues is not glorified as heroic or 
apocalyptic; it is rendered in a quiet heartfelt way that lends it 
universality. 
</P>
<P>
 The refreshing thing about the book, in addition to the timelessness of the 
situation the characters find themselves in, is that implicit in their struggle 
is the assumption that all the effort is worth it, that there are such 
absolutes as right and wrong, and that locating oneself in this common grid of 
guilt and forgiveness is incumbent, part and parcel, of finding out who you 
are. In a word, redemption.

COVER STORY: SPACE, 2258, IN THE YEAR 1994; 'BABYLON 5' PRODUCERS SAY THEY GET 
MORE BANG FOR THEIR BUCKS WITH DESKTOP TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Producing the newly syndicated sci-fi series "Babylon 5" has practically been 
a sci-fi adventure in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are on the cusp of being completely revolutionized," says producer John 
Copeland. The elaborate special effects are created by desktop computers. The 
series' Hollywood-based composer conducts his European-based orchestra on an 
interactive video feed. And the entire show is shot in a huge warehouse in the 
San Fernando Valley, far from any studio's watchful eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the action in the one-hour adventure show, set in the year 2258, is on 
a vast United Nations-like space station, Babylon 5, which serves as neutral 
territory for humans and aliens alike. The series premieres Wednesday on PTEN 
(the Prime Time Entertainment Network), a consortium of 177 stations covering 
93% of the country. It will be carried in Los Angeles on KCOP. PTEN series, 
which also include "Time Trax" and "Kung Fu: The Legend Continues," are 
supplied by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Sci-fi fans got their first taste of "Bab 5" almost a year ago as a two-hour 
TV movie. The ratings were good enough for Warner Bros. to give it the go-ahead 
for the weekly series. 
</P>
<P>
 Having several months from the completion of the movie to starting up the 
series gave the creative team an opportunity "to do a soul-searching postmortem 
on the movie," says Copeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all made a pact that we would do everything we could to make the series 
better than the movie and to make every episode better than the previous one," 
Copeland says. 
</P>
<P>
 They did a bit of recasting and fleshed out the cast. Tamlyn Tamito ("'The Joy 
Luck Club") played the station's Lt. Commander in the pilot movie. 'She didn't 
come off as a commanding presence," Copeland acknowledges. "So we recast that 
role with a different character played by Claudia Christian. We added Richard 
Biggs as a new doctor, and each one of our ambassadors has a diplomatic 
attache." 
</P>
<P>
 Also discarded were the puppet-type alien creatures. "We felt they were more 
like very surreal-looking Muppets," Copeland says. "We wanted to move away from 
that. We wanted to have aliens who were performers. We also wanted to have a 
larger representation of (aliens). We broadened the kind of United Nations 
aspect of the station." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-executive producer Doug Netter, creator and co-executive producer J. 
Michael Straczynski and Copeland began working on the series six years ago. "We 
almost had (a deal) together with Warners, United Television, a Japanese group 
and a German group," Netter recalls. "It was about to either happen or not 
happen when along came the Prime Time Network." 
</P>
<P>
 Producers who are taking advantage of current technology say it costs them 
less to produce "Bab 5" than the Paramount syndicated sci-fi series "Star Trek: 
The Next Generation" and "Deep Space Nine," which are in the per-episode range 
of $1 million to $1.5 million. Netter says the production saves money by not 
shooting at Warners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We built these stages in nine weeks," Netter says. "We speak to one creative 
person, one lawyer and one business affairs person. We don't have many people 
coming over here." 
</P>
<P>
 From the very outset, "Bab 5" has been designed for the TV screen. "We haven't 
let that be a limitation," Copeland says. "We don't have to approach things -- 
like the way we do our effects -- how they do it in movies. We can look at 
doing them different ways." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, composer Christopher Franke of Tangerine Dream writes the 
original music in his studio in the Hollywood Hills. "His orchestra is in 
Berlin," Copeland explains. "He creates a score, faxes that over to Berlin and 
he conducts the orchestra on an interactive video feed. They're sitting on a 
recording stage in Berlin and the music is coming back to him on fiber-optic 
cable. This stuff is pretty much immune to power shortage." 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation Imaging, the company that received an Emmy for visual effects on 
the "Babylon 5" pilot, consists of just seven people. "Our effects' animator, 
the guy who does all of our guns blasts, works on a Macintosh," Copeland says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Babylon 5" premieres Wednesday at 8 p.m. and repeats Sunday at midnight on 
KCOP.

THREE ON THE TOWN: WHAT ELSE IS NEWS?; WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET, BUT 
THERE'S ALWAYS MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patt Morrison 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was a kid, I had to go to bed before it came on, but I could hear the 
theme song to "Car 54, Where Are You?" jangling from the television in the 
living room: 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a holdup in the Bronx, Brooklyn's broken out in fights, there's a 
traffic jam in Harlem that's backed up to Jackson Heights, there's a Scout 
troop short a child, Khrushchev's due at Idyllwild . .. Car 54, where are you?" 
 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm not in New York, and it isn't 1963. L.A.'s police scanner sings less 
innocently of killers and kidnapers. Its thin blue line is spread like peanut 
butter before payday. And 911 will have to start charging $3.99 a minute, same 
as the Psychic Friends Network. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about us, the thin news line? The LAPD numbers about 7,400; the LAPC 
-- Los Angeles press corps -- is just over half that. The urban journalist's 
predicament is akin to the urban cop's: only so much time and only so many 
bodies to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembling a day's newspaper is no formula; it's a painterly rendering of a 
few scenes culled from many. Contenders pour in by fax, phone, mail and wire 
service. Speeches. Seminars. City Council meetings. Hollywood premieres. Like 
caged puppies at the pound, PR people clamor to catch the editor's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Women in a self-defense course will be "mugged" to raise money so poor and 
abused women can also get the training . .. Paleontologist-to-the-stars Robert 
Bakker leads a staged dig for dinosaur bone replicas to promote the Rose Parade 
float theme . .. Burbank police have surrounded an apartment building where 
neighbors have complained about a woman who hasn't committed a crime but who 
won't come out of her apartment .  
</P>
<P>
 Enough real and contrived news for 10 cities. Too much of any of it -- like 
too much red or blue on a canvas -- and the day's paper can tip out of scale. 
Take crime. For all the public mutterings about too many crime stories, we 
report only a fraction of all that happens. To load every page with crime sagas 
would benumb readers. To underplay them would be to lie. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't give much credence to media-conspiracy theories. The truer failing is 
the frustration that comes from riding the hamster-wheel that is the nature of 
the news beast: This is a newspaper, not a census, and we can't write about 
everybody every day. So we may end up writing about one homeless woman, one 
unemployed aerospace worker or one plucky store owner -- as being emblematic of 
many. One day's story about one suffering family may bring the TV cameras, the 
checks and the jobs, while the equally deserving family next door gets nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, every time a child younger than 15 was killed in Chicago, the 
Tribune wrote a major story about it. Did people get angry or bored? I'm afraid 
if we covered everything, stories would cease to mean anything. Look, here's 
another story about a promising kid killed by a gang on the steps of the public 
library -- which was closed from budget cuts -- as he waited with his little 
sister for their unemployed but undaunted father to pick them up to take them 
to their grandmother's 90th birthday party. Why can't the news media give it a 
rest? Pass me some more French toast . 
</P>
<P>
 That's another thing: It has pained me to watch the city's tolerances, like 
its defenses, ratcheting upward over the years. What used to be shocking is now 
commonplace -- and that fact, too, is newsworthy. Ten years ago, a teen killed 
in gang cross-fire was a story. Now it takes a girl carried off from a slumber 
party in her own bedroom to get seen and heard and read above all the other 
mayhem that has become ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 And being new is a relentless part of being news . Like cops at a crime scene, 
when the phone rings or the alarm summons, we may be sent off to another story, 
sometimes before every question can be answered about the last one. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, we build from zero again, stirring the doings of the powerful, 
the criminal, the unfortunate, the brave, the humble and the quirky into the 
mix. One day's newspaper is layered atop the previous day's, and over time, we 
hope that it begins to look, sound and read not like some court docket or movie 
script or video game, but like a city, the one we live in.

BOOKS BEHIND THE FILM; 'SHADOWLANDS': A BOOKISH FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM GRIFFIN, William Griffin is author of the 1986 biography Clive 
Staples Lewis: A Dramatic Voice. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Shadowlands," a film about a late-blooming romance that is being touted as an 
Oscar contender, sports three characters who are bookies, not just readers of 
books, but writers of books. Clive Staples Lewis, lecturer in Medieval and 
Renaissance literature at Magdalen College, Oxford, and later at Magdalene 
College, Cambridge, had 50 books to his credit, some published posthumously. 
Warren Lewis, his brother, a retired Army officer, did five books. Joy Davidman 
Gresham Lewis, the woman who walked into C. S. Lewis' life, had four books 
published. 
</P>
<P>
 So bookish were the three that in December, 1957, some months after Joy had 
moved into the Lewis household, Jack, as Clive was called by his friends, was 
thinking of having a plate installed on the front door reading "Lewis, Lewis, 
and Lewis, Inc., Book Factory." 
</P>
<P>
 The film is so rich in reference to these books that anyone captivated by the 
film might long for a "Shadowlands" library to browse in. An annotated 
bibliography for such a collection follows. 
</P>
<P>
 Words and sentiments taken from Lewis' "The Problem of Pain" (originally 
published in 1940; available today in Macmillan paperback, $4.95), in which he 
tackled "the intellectual problem raised by suffering," seem to frame the 
film's argument. By film's end, after his new wife has succumbed to bone-eating 
cancer, Lewis' proud intellect has been brought to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the agony of "Shadowlands," now for the ecstasy. In his "The 
Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition" (1936; out of print now, but a 
ground-breaking study when it first appeared), the 38-year-old scholar wrote 
about "the birth of the romantic conception of love and the long struggle 
between its earlier form (the romance of adultery) and its later form (the 
romance of marriage)." Courtly love was a sort of French literary confection, 
Lewis argued, but in his own life, as least with Joy, love was no allegory; he 
was as antsy as any courtier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chronicles of Narnia, a series of seven children's books published from 
1950-1956, are featured prominently in the screenplay. Magdalen faculty member 
Christopher Riley (a fictional character mouthing Tolkien's oft-expressed view 
that any book written faster than his own books couldn't possibly be good -- 
and Tolkien wrote slowly, very slowly; he never did finish the dictionary of 
Icelandic he promised for decades to Oxford University Press) rails against 
what he felt was the superficiality of the Narnia books (boxed set available 
from Macmillan, $22.95). 
</P>
<P>
 If a distraction to Riley, then the first Narnia books were a positive 
attraction to Joy's son Douglas, who had read the first one before visiting 
England; at their first meeting, he asks Lewis to autograph his copy of "The 
Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe." In real life, Lewis dedicated the fifth book 
of the Chronicles to Douglas and also to his brother David, who does not appear 
as a character in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of meeting Joy worried Jack, for he had legions of American 
admirers of his literary and spiritual works. His brother Warnie, however, 
thought she was a good risk; after all, she was a poet. Indeed in one of their 
first meetings, Jack asks Joy to recite a poem of hers. She picks "Snow in 
Madrid," which appeared in "Letters to a Comrade" (Yale Series of Younger Poets 
No. 37; reprint of 1938 edition, $18, AMS Press). 
</P>
<P>
 At a Magdalen Christmas party, Jack introduces Joy around. When asked by a 
faculty member what she's doing in England, she replies that she's looking for 
a publisher. Her manuscript, "Smoke on the Mountain," which was an 
interpretation of the Ten Commandments, was indeed published in 1954 in both 
England and the U.S. (Westminster, paperback, $11.99); it was dedicated "to 
C.S. Lewis." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Four Loves" (published in 1960; available in a Harcourt paperback, $6.95) 
is another of Lewis' books made use of by screenwriter William Nicholson. The 
relationship with Joy began, wrote Jack to a correspondent, "in Agape, 
proceeded to Philia, then became pity, and only after that Eros. As if the 
highest of these, Agape, had successively undergone the sweet humiliations of 
an incarnation." Such distinctions appear also in talks Jack recorded for the 
Episcopal Radio-TV Foundation in Atlanta (1958); these talks make up the text 
of "The Four Loves." The book, by the way, was copyrighted in the name of Joy 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 As Joy's cancerous agony and Jack's spiritual darkness increased, he turned to 
prayer, much of which in the film takes place in the chapel at Magdalen 
College, where the massive reredos is a dovecote whose niches are filled, not 
with birds, but with saints -- saints seemingly deaf to Jack's petitionary 
prayer. "I pray because I can't help myself," he admits in the film. "I pray 
because I'm helpless. I pray because the need flows out of me all the time, 
waking and sleeping. It doesn't change God -- it changes me." Much of Jack's 
real-life theorizing about prayer, the fruit of many decades of practice, 
appears in a work published just after his death in 1963, "Letters to Malcolm, 
Chiefly on Prayer," which is as fine a treatise on prayer as ever written 
(1964; available as a Harcourt paperback, $6.95). Like "The Screwtape Letters," 
it is an instructional work in the form of an epistolary novel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dark night of the soul after his wife's cremation, Jack penned in a 
journal that God also had disappeared, and so did Christ; the whole Christian 
house of cards came tumbling down. The work was eventually published as "A 
Grief Observed" (1961; available as a Bantam paperback, $4.50). He put on the 
title page the pseudonym N.W. Clerk; the wife in the journal he referred to 
only as "H."; Joy's first name was Helen. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the film's end, mourning in the attic in front of the wardrobe that 
appears on the first pages of the Chronicles of Narnia, young Douglas says he 
doesn't believe in heaven anymore. Jack has to agree. They both bawl. At this 
juncture, Jack might have said something contained in Letters to Malcolm: "Joy 
is the serious business of Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Showdow-Lands," as Lewis wrote the word, it appears at the end of "The 
Last Battle," seventh and last of the Chronicles of Narnia. The three children 
-- Peter, Edmund, and Lucy -- after having died in a railway accident, leave 
behind their earthly lives in the Shadow-Lands and begin their new life in 
sunlit Narnia. "The term is over: the holidays have begun. The dream is ended: 
this is the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as (Aslan) spoke, He no longer looked to them like a lion; but the things 
that began to happen after that were so great and beautiful that I cannot write 
them. And for us this is the end of all the stories, and we can most truly say 
that they all lived happily ever after. But for them it was only the beginning 
of the real story. All their life in this world and all their adventures in 
Narnia had only been the cover and the title page: now at last they were 
beginning Chapter One of the Great Story, which no one on earth has read: which 
goes on forever: in which every chapter is better than the one before." 
</P>
<P>
 When all is said and done in the film there lingers a finely wrought 
sentiment, first uttered by a student of Lewis' at Magdalen, and later assented 
to by the master himself: 
</P>
<P>
 "We read to know we're not alone."

A GALAXY OF CHARACTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the dawn of the Third Age of Mankind, a decade after the Earth/Minbari 
war that nearly destroyed humanity. The Babylon Project was created to 
establish peace among earthlings and aliens.The first three Babylon stations 
were sabotaged and destroyed. The fourth one disappeared without a trace. 
Babylon 5, which is under the jurisdiction of the Earth Alliance, has survived 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are its architects, commanders and foes? 
</P>
<P>
 Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (Michael O'Hare): The reluctant hero of the Earth 
Alliance must maintain peace among the once-warring interstellar governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Talia Winters (Andrea Thompson): A telepath who uses her powers to negotiate 
business deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassador G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas): The calculating, reptilian-appearing 
leader of the aggressive Narn Regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassador Londo Mollari (Peter Jurasik): The rather excessive representative 
of the once- powerful Centauri Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Susan Ivanova (Claudia Christian): Sinclair's newly appointed 
second-in-command. Ambitious and no-nonsense, Ivanova oversees the space 
station controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Steven Franklin (Richard Biggs): The ship's chief medical officer who 
tends to the needs of the multitude of life forms inhabiting the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassador Deleen (Mira Furlan): The stoic representative of the Minbari 
Federation. Once a homogenous culture, the federation is in the midst of 
political and social upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle): Sinclair's trusted protector 
of the ship. Garibaldi, though, has a troubled past.

FOR THE LOVE OF SCI-FI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J. Michael Straczynski had a personal agenda when he created the syndicated 
science-fiction series "Babylon 5." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you first watch the pilot you think, 'This is the good guy and this is 
the bad guy.' Then what we do in the series is a gradual move-around of the 
chairs. No one is what they appear. I don't believe in one-dimensional 
characters." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime-time sci-fi series that have failed ("Space Rangers" and "V"), 
Straczynski says, have made the mistake of stressing razzle-dazzle special 
effects over characters. Sci-fi fans "tune in to watch characters. You have to 
give your characters and your actors multidimensionality." 
</P>
<P>
 The other reason the co-executive producer created the series is more 
nebulous. "People of my generation," says the baby boomer, "often have the 
sense they have gotten off the merry-go-round somewhere. Whether it was 
Kennedy, Vietnam, King, or Watergate. Something went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost that infatuation with the future and got bogged down with what 
is happening now," Straczynski says. "We have forgotten that we are part of the 
grand parade that's building the future everyday." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of his mission with "Bab 5" is to instill a sense of wonder about the 
future and remind people "we are building something. There will be a future. 
You can't tell me in 2million years of evolution that the culmination is Beavis 
and Butt-head. There must be something grander going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Straczynski says he believes what distinguishes "Bab 5" is that members of the 
creative team are fans of the sci-fi genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up on such black-and-white horror flicks of the '50s as "Attack of the 
50 Ft. Woman," Straczynski also voraciously read sci-fi literature. "The first 
books I read of the genre was Ray Bradbury's 'The Martian Chronicles' and 'The 
Shrinking Man' by Richard Matheson. I sold short stories and novels in the dark 
fantasy, science-fiction genre." 
</P>
<P>
 What Straczynski hopes to achieve with "Bab 5" is to take what he learned from 
that literature and apply it to the series, "particularly the epics like 
'Dune,' 'Martian Chronicles" and Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings.' They are large 
sagas. They have a beginning, a middle and an end." 
</P>
<P>
 So does the series. "It covers five years of storytime and with luck, we will 
run five years. Then that's the end of the story. The way it's structured is 
that each episode stands alone, but the more you watch, the more you will see a 
larger story." 
</P>
<P>
 Straczynski wanted to avoid the problem that he said David Lynch's cult series 
"Twin Peaks" had. "I loved that show dearly, but if you missed one show, you 
were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 22 first-season episodes of "Babylon 5," Straczynski has written 12. 
"It is constructed like a novel, so that every episode for about five years has 
been blocked out." 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of the series' bible is in his computer and another is in a safety 
deposit box. "This thing means a lot to me," Straczynski acknowledges. "This is 
what I have been working for all my life. Once I've done this, I will have said 
all I wanted to say in television." SUSAN KING

 THRESHOLD OF FIRE: A Novel of Fifth-Century Rome by Hella Haasse (Academy 
Chicago: $19; 246 pp.)Those eager for parallels between the fall of the Roman 
Empire and the imminent demise of our own will be disappointed.Hella Haasse's 
Rome of 380-412 AD is indeed in its death throes. There is an ongoing Cold War 
with the East (we won ours); there are barbarians at the gates (not pertinent, 
unless you want to count rock and rap); the West's capitol has been relocated 
to swamp Ravenna (Foggy Bottom doesn't count), where the regent for a weak 
emperor is a Vandal general soon to be assassinated (Constantinople's regent is 
a eunuch). Haasse's real villain, though, is Christianity, Christianity of a 
hypocrisy and rigidity hard to duplicate this side of the auto-da-fe. 
</P>
<P>
 The gifted hands of Haasse, grande dame of Dutch letters, rescue the era from 
the flaking pages of history texts. Plausible people, by turns flawed and 
worthy, stand in for opposing views. Representing the new Establishment is 
Hadrian, the city's top magistrate, who was born an Egyptian heathen and thus 
is more Roman and Christian than Caesar's wife. On trial before Hadrian is 
Claudius, avatar of enlightened paganism (historically, Claudian, last of the 
great Latin poets). Linking the two is Eliezar -- Hadrian's mentor and 
Claudius' illegitimate grandfather -- whose example makes a compelling argument 
for Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a trial of ideas, and ideals, one made more poignant by hindsight: These 
are "twilight men in a twilight time."

Q & A: HARRY MORGAN & WALTER MATTHAU; NO SMALL INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar- and Tony-winner Walter Matthau returns as the rumpled but savvy lawyer 
Harmon Cobb in Sunday's CBS movie "Incident in a Small Town." Matthau 
introduced the character four years ago in the Emmy Award-winning "The 
Incident," in which Cobb defended a German POW in a murder trial during World 
War II. The second in the series, "Against Her Will: An Incident in Baltimore," 
aired two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran character actor Harry Morgan, best known as Col. Sherman Potter on 
"MASH" and officer Bill Gannon on "Dragnet," reprises his role as Cobb's friend 
and partner, Judge Stoddard Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 In person, Matthau, 73, and Morgan, 78, were anything but "grumpy old men." 
They seemed to genuinely enjoy each other's company over a recent lunch at the 
Beverly Hills Tennis Club. Though Morgan seemed a lot like Sherman Potter in 
civvies, Matthau loved to shock his unsuspecting luncheon guest with his ribald 
sense of humor. He concluded the lunch by unbuttoning his shirt and showing off 
a scar from recent pacemaker surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Staff Writer Susan King, who blushed a bit more than normal during an 
interview, talked with the two about their friendship, "Incident in a Small 
Town," canned salmon and homemade ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you two ever work together before doing "The Incident"? 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Morgan: No, but we used to meet at Dick Widmark's Christmas party. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Matthau: We used to sit near him because you could hear his voice. It 
was very soothing. 
</P>
<P>
 You have a great rapport. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: That word is not rapport. It is rappaport. We have a great rappaport 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 HM: The last picture was just fantastic, I thought. Everything was great. 
</P>
<P>
 What made it great? 
</P>
<P>
 HM: The location. We worked out on a farm for a couple of weeks. It was just 
delightful. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: We passed a place where we got homemade ice cream every day. 
</P>
<P>
 HM: It was about an hour outside of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: Magnificent countryside. You can just taste that cherry vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
 HM: That's right, but they had other flavors. We just had a great time. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: (As lunch arrives, Matthau looks at his guest.) Aren't you going to eat 
anything? 
</P>
<P>
 No. I'm fine. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: We are going to eat and you are not eating. You can't eat this marvelous 
can of salmon? I love it. (Matthau breaks up the salmon the waiter gave him 
with his fork and puts it into his salad.)  
</P>
<P>
 HM: I love it, too, but I don't eat it very often. I like it better than fresh 
salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: It's delicious. My mother used to give me 16 cents to get a can of salmon. 
Bumblebee. I'd go downstairs (to the grocery store) because I was afraid to 
walk three blocks to get it. It wasn't safe. So, I would have a few pennies, 
and I would put in my own penny so I wouldn't have to walk three blocks. It was 
17 cents downstairs. (Matthau glances over). Are you married? 
</P>
<P>
 No. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: Why don't you start eating? You'll get married if you start eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmm. Going back to the movie, "Incident in a Small Town" takes place in 
1953, six years after "Against Her Will." 
</P>
<P>
 HM: We seem to be very amicable when this thing starts. We have a good 
relationship and this time I have a problem. So I want to set out to solve it, 
and Walter insists on coming along with me to help out. And we go from there. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like an old-fashioned mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 HM: It's more of a whodunit. Walter figures it out. It gets very complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: Why do they say whodunit? Shouldn't it be, whodidit? 
</P>
<P>
 HM: Yeah. It should be. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: But whodunit is better. But it do not sound good to me. 
</P>
<P>
 What drew you both to the first "Incident" movie? 
</P>
<P>
 HM: It was a terrific story. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: I liked the author's perception that most Germans were no good and that 
some were OK. That interested me. Usually, people try to palm off on you that 
Germans didn't want the Nazi regime. They embraced it -- 88% of them. Well, we 
need that escape hatch. You can't blame your lack of happiness on the majority, 
you have to blame it on some tiny minority like the Jew. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter, what makes Harry such a great actor? Harry, what makes Walter so 
special? 
</P>
<P>
 WM: I kept thinking he's Jack Lemmon. And then I look up and he's Harry 
Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 HM: And he's Jack Webb. (laughs). No, I don't really think that. Walter's just 
a delight. He's a wonderful actor and a passable human being. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: I love not only working with Harry, I can't wait to go to dinner with him. 
</P>
<P>
 HM: We just have a great time. Often it's unspoken. Correct? And we both love 
Italian food. We had to up in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: There are 500,000 Italians there and a million and a half restaurants it 
seems. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of you have done comedy and drama. Do you have a preference? 
</P>
<P>
 WM: My preference is non-comedic roles. They are so easy. Comedy is tough. 
Very hard. You notice I don't say serious roles. 
</P>
<P>
 HM: I didn't notice that. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: I will point it out to you. 
</P>
<P>
 HM: I've played everything you can think of. I used to do a lot of heavies, 
which I always enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think the quality of TV and features have gotten better or worse over 
the years? 
</P>
<P>
 HM: I think things have gotten worse. Much worse. 
</P>
<P>
 WM: Technically, it's better. But the story. They had stories. Stories about 
relationships between people. They didn't have "The Terminator 4." I saw that 
"Terminator" the other day. I couldn't believe that I was watching it. (Matthau 
looks over at his guest ) . Do you want a cookie? 
</P>
<P>
 "Incident in a Small Town" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

 NOAH'S GARDEN: Restoring the Ecology of Our Own Back Yard by Sara Stein 
(Houghton Mifflin: $21.95; 294 pp.) Workers of the 'burbs, unite! Lay down your 
leaf rakes.Muzzle your mowers. Kick back and pick up "Noah's Garden" by Sara 
Stein, a feisty, iconoclastic self-described "non-gardener" with the soul of 
Thoreau and the pen of a poet. Stein proposes to do for the back yard what the 
EPA cannot begin to accomplish nationally. Let things be, she says. Nature is a 
helluva lot smarter than we are. Leaves left on the ground break down into 
sustenance for shrubs and trees, which in turn feed and house bees and birds 
and beasties, which return the favor by spreading the seeds and pollen of the 
shrubs and trees, which . . . As for lawns, they're anachronisms, leftovers 
from the large estates whose vast, manicured greenswards simply declared: I'm 
rich enough to hire an army of gardeners. Meanwhile, all the critters that 
fueled the engines wouldn't be seen dead on a lawn -- which they would be, 
exposed to predators. And we, in our wisdom, break our backs and our banks on 
pesticides, sprinklers, mulches, aerators, "whereas before, (nature) managed 
all these things itself" -- and for free. Stein is no anarchist, encouraging us 
to let things go to pot. She loves flowers and grasses and butterflies. What 
she suggests is that we have "unplugged the connections" among our local flora 
and fauna, and that we hook them up again to the greater glory of the planet, 
no matter how small our holdings. "Fling wide the garden gate," she says, 
"loosen the land's aesthetic corset, let it be more blowsy and fecund, allow it 
to bed promiscuously with beasts and creatures of all sorts."

 LIFE INTO ART: Isadora Duncan and Her World edited by Doree Duncan, Carol 
Pratl and Cynthia Splatt, text by Cynthia Splatt (W. W. Norton: $40; 199 pp). 
As one of the most fascinating woman artists of this century, Isadora Duncan 
danced life with equal measures of strength and courage as well as 
impetuousness and foolishness in her bare feet and Greek togas.She is the 
figurehead for the birth of modern dance (as opposed to pointed shoes and 
tutus) as well as an exemplary feminist who pursued her dreams and ideals 
regardless of social condemnation or approval. There have been any number of 
books written about Duncan (as well as her flamboyant autobiography "My Life") 
but this particular work has the added advantage of dozens of photos never seen 
before from the Duncan family archives. And the text, wonderful in its obvious 
warmth toward its subject as well as its wealth of research, also focuses on 
the work and influence the other Duncan siblings had on Isadora and each other. 
(She had two brothers Augustin and Raymond and a sister Elizabeth). Ah, but it 
is Isadora's image: zephyr, bacchante, earth mother and tragedian that 
permeates the book. Born in San Francisco, she is the ultimate example of free 
spirit, from a city that became famous for them. Sue Martin

 MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL by John Berendt (Random House: $23; 
390 pp.) Smart people, the Savannahians. When Sherman's Civil War 
scorched-earth march fetched up on their doorstep, they immediately surrendered 
on condition that the general spare their city.He did, and Savannah never 
looked back -- or forward. Sherman spared what the French, among other 
connoisseurs, call the most beautiful city in America. Also, John Berendt 
relates, America's most insular, inbred, eccentric, estranged, albeit 
enchanting city, resisting any change, spurning all suitors, asking only to be 
left alone. City of cotillions and chilled martinis, where a rare stranger is 
not asked what he does or where he's from but what he wants to drink. And a 
city of secrets as well. "You mustn't be taken in by the moonlight and 
magnolias," Jim Williams tells Berendt. "Things can get murky." Not least murky 
is Williams himself. In his opulent, lovingly restored mansion one fragrant May 
night, Williams shoots to death Danny Hansford, 21, his sexy, violent, volatile 
"assistant." Berendt, who seems congenitally unable to write a dull paragraph, 
spins out Williams' lengthy murder trial with exquisite suspense, but his real 
subject is Savannah: its rhythms, its mores, its foibles, its gentilities.

 THE ERA, 1947-1957: When the Yankees, the Giants and the Dodgers Ruled the 
World by Roger Kahn (Ticknor & Fields: $22.95; 372 pp.) I was there, and he has 
it just right. New York was the capital of the universe, "a cosmic town." Its 
kings were Willie, Mickey and the Duke, "speed, power and grace," monarchs of 
all they surveyed from deepest center field. Jackie introduced the era, leading 
the league in everything but hotel reservations. Walter O'Malley -- "an 
ingratiating hustler," "venal and mendacious" -- ended it, ripping the guts out 
of the city and burying them in a nicey-nicey plastic plot called Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 You didn't need last names then, or even first names. Everybody knew who they 
were. Snuffy, Superchief, Skoonj, Schoolboy. The Barber, the Cricket and the 
Man. The Splendid Splinter, the Hondo Hurricane, the Naugatuck Nugget. Even 
stately Joe DiMaggio. whose devoted teammates called him Daig, which you 
couldn't get away with now. Nor were the owners -- a drunk, a dilettante and a 
genius -- immune; they were the Roarin' Redhead, the Mahatma and Big Oom. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody does baseball like Roger Kahn, he of the immortal "The Boys of Summer." 
Nobody better tells you stuff you already knew and makes it fun again. (Pee Wee 
was named for his prowess at marbles, not his 5-10 height.) Nobody better 
unearths new nuggets. (Alistair Cooke reported on the World Series for the 
Manchester Guardian.) Nobody better re-creates the transcendent (the moment 
after the Staten Island Scot hit the homer in 1951, when the cosmos thundered 
and the unbaptized thought war had been declared), better resuscitates the bon 
mot (DiMag's first wife: "Spring training for Marilyn Monroe"). It's all there, 
the racism and the venality along with the power and the glory; the apotheosis 
of all that is sacred and profane. You could look it up.

 LETTERS OF A LOVE-HUNGRY FARMER by John B. Keane (St. Martin's: $10.95; 88 
pp.) Meet John Bosco McLane, Irish farmer, 52, named for a soon-to-be saint. 
Unmarried. Very unmarried. "An innocent sort of a man," they say in the hill 
country between Kerry and Cork. A chastitute. That's what Father Kennerley 
calls him. "The whole countryside is reeking of chastitution," snorts the 
parish priest. "There isn't the making of a dacent sin in the entire doings of 
the lot o' you." 
</P>
<P>
 Meet John B. Keane, if you haven't already (your loss). Novelist; playwright; 
publican; sage; bard of the bittersweet and the bawdy. A man who knows. It's 
taken 20 years for "Letters" to reach these benighted shores, and it's been 
worth the wait. Not for John Bosco, though. "He is without a wife, mistress or 
regular copulatory companion." He needs a woman. Now. A friend advises him to 
dig deeper for the local potatoes. Another suggestion: observe the greasy city 
Lotharios in action: "That's how Dempsey became world champion, watching others 
when he was a gorsoon. And there's the local matchmmaker, a many-splendored 
fellow named Dicky Mick Dicky O'Connor, who signs his correspondence "Courtesy 
and Civility assured at all times." 
</P>
<P>
 John Bosco's luck remains rotten. One prospective companion, having divorced 
an impotent cawboge , demands a photo of Bosco in the buff, to assure that 
"your natural belongings are intact." Another, this one with all her teeth, 
turns out to be pregnant, by her brother, who also fancies hens. A third, 
finding the farmer too timid, delivers the Gaelic equivalent of Dear John, to 
wit: "Shag you from a height." Will John Bosco find a woman? Is the Pope 
Italian? More important, will St. Martin's release some more Keane? Please?

 THE BOOK OF THE PEARL: The History, Art, Science and Industry of the Queen of 
Gems by George Frederick Kunz & Charles Hugh Stevenson (Dover: $17.95; 548 pp., 
illustrated). Although shifts in fashion and the rise of the cultured pearl 
industry have rendered some sections outdated, this erudite treatise, 
originally published in 1908, still provides a good deal of valuable 
information. The illustrations include a portrait of an uncomfortable Duchess 
of Marlborough weighted down with strands of pearls and a multi-row "dog 
collar," and Empress Eugenie's fabulous pearl necklace, which looks like Ali 
Baba's jump rope.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's long been a cliche to gripe about "car chase" movies -- when it's 
actually been a long time since anyone really attempted one. Seventies 
revivalists will be happy that the genre's commercial apex, Smokey and the 
Bandit (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 8 p.m.), is back for another 
wheelie. Wistfully relive those days when CB radios -- not E-mail -- were 
America's trendiest semi-personal communication, and when Burt Reynolds -- not 
Ice-T -- represented state-of-the-art law-defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 That spotty 1977 comedy spawned two awful official sequels. Get ready for a 
third with the brand-new Bandit: Must Be Country (KTLA Wednesday at 8 p.m.), 
from Hal Needham, the stuntman-turned-director responsible for the first couple 
of "Smokey" movies. It's Burt-less, of course; Brian Bloom steps in as the new 
trucker who can't drive 55. 
</P>
<P>
 Run (KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a 1990 vehicle for Patrick Dempsey to be on 
the sprint, but from mobsters, not the law, after he accidentally kills the son 
of a local gang lord. Forgettable, but fast enough to cover a multitude of 
sins, it's MTV meets "The Wrong Man." Kelly Preston provides the complementary 
good looks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 Tough Guys (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.) gets by as a rousing tribute to 
Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, cast as a pair of veteran bank robbers, but 
isn't quite tough enough for non-sentimentalists to chew on. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be fooled by the title: Titicut Follies (KCET Friday at 11 p.m.) is a 
harrowing documentary, briefly seen in 1967 and then suppressed for a 
quarter-century before getting a hailed theatrical re-release. Frederick 
Wiseman's black-and-white visit to a Massachusetts mental hospital unveiled 
abuse and negligence so shocking a judge ordered all negatives and prints 
destroyed on the basis of privacy violation. Fortunately, cooler heads, and, 
one presumes, better institutional conditions -- have since prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 See No Evil, Hear No Evil (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) wasn't the last film comedy 
Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder would team up for. There was one more after this 
1989 effort, but this was the last funny one and having Arthur Hiller (who 
first matched the duo in "Silver Streak" at the helm helped. A few 
disability-related activist groups objected to the high jinx of Pryor's blind 
and Wilder's deaf heroes as they lean on each other's senses to solve the 
murder they're accused of, but the humor is far more sweet than demeaning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wind (KCET Saturday at 10:30 p.m.) is a spectacular way to wind up the 
week, albeit pre-sound-era spectacle. Lillian Gish stars in this landmark 1928 
silent film as a virtuous young woman stranded without means in a Dust Bowl 
town. She has plenty of trouble with men and, of course, the elements. 
Repression and volatility prevail: There's rape, murder and a climactic dust 
storm that couldn't be better if it were in Surround Sound.

 FRANKLY, MY DEAR: More than 650 of the Funniest, Smartest, Gutsiest, Nastiest, 
Sexiest, and Simply Greatest Quotes in Celebration of Women in the Movies 
compiled and edited by Jeff Bloch (Citadel Press: $9.95; 180 pp., illustrated, 
paperback original). This anthology contains some classic lines: "As long as I 
know how to get what I want, that's all I wanna know," (Judy Holliday in "Born 
Yesterday," 1950); "I need him like the ax needs the turkey," (Barbara Stanwyck 
in "The Lady Eve," 1941). But Bloch omits all mention of the men and women who 
wrote those lines; Mae West's, "Beulah, peel me a grape," is probably the only 
ad-lib in the book.

 BONE by Fae Myenne Ng (HarperPerennial: $11; 194 pp.). Ng's gracefully written 
first novel examines the conflict between two generations in the restricted 
world of San Francisco's Chinatown.Leila Leong narrates the unhappy saga of her 
mismatched parents and her sisters. Ona, the middle sister, committed suicide 
for unknown reasons; Nina, the youngest, has abandoned her family obligations 
for the freedom of New York. Left to herself, Leila slowly pieces together her 
family's struggle to preserve their traditional beliefs while taking advantage 
of the opportunities America offers. Ng deftly sketches a moving portrait of a 
family as unit and as a collection of individuals, united by affection, toil 
and blighted hope.

 FINDERS, KEEPERS: Treasures and Oddities of Natural History: Collectors From 
Peter the Great to Louis Agassiz by Rosamond Wolff Purcell & Stephen Jay Gould 
(Norton: $24.95; 160 pp.) . Gould traces the evolution of natural history 
collections from princely Kunstkammers, or chambers of curiosities, to modern 
museums. Peter the Great had agents gather objects throughout his empire for 
his personal horde, which included teeth the Tsar had extracted himself; the 
gentle Lord Walter Rothschild used his vast fortune to assemble an unparalleled 
collections of exotic birds of paradise. Purcell's dramatic photographs provide 
a striking counterpoint to Gould's engaging text.

 MARTIN AND JOHN by Dale Peck (HarperPerennial: $11; 228 pp.). Peck's powerful 
first novel takes the form of a series of eerie fragments depicting disparate 
lives: loving families and abusive ones; wealth and poverty; sophistication and 
naivete.Only the names Martin and John link these diverse scenarios. In a 
dramatic coup de theatre, Peck melds his vignettes into a devastating portrait 
of a lonely man struggling to preserve love and hope in the era of AIDS. To 
exorcise the specter of that relentless killer, the unseen narrator declares, 
"I tell myself that by reinventing my life, my imagination imposes an order on 
things and makes them make sense."

 ONE MAN'S OWL by Bernd Heinrich, abridged and revised by Alice Calaprice 
(Princeton Paperbacks: $12.95; 186 pp., illustrated). Heinrich didn't realize 
what he was getting himself into when he adopted an owlet orphaned by a winter 
storm. The endearing little ball of fluff grew into a majestic bird, and 
Heinrich found himself caught between his efforts to raise a self-sufficient 
wild creature and his desire to preserve the affectionate responses of a pet. 
His warm memoir offers pleasant reading, as well as information about the 
anatomy and behavior of the Great Horned Owl.

 VENUS ENVY by Rita Mae Brown (Bantam: $5.99; 388 pp.). Brown's comic tale of 
love and honesty recalls her previous novel, "Bingo."When Mary Frazier 
Armstrong, a wealthy, bisexual art dealer, learns she is dying, she writes 
series of brutally frank letters to her family and friends -- only to discover 
she isn't really dying. Her efforts to cope with the aftermath of her honesty 
are often funny, but life is a little too easy for the rich and beautiful 
Frazier; unlike the feisty Bingo, she has no real stake in her small Virginia 
town. Brown doesn't seem to have known how to end her story: An incongruous 
coda, in which the Greek gods proclaim the beauty of ambisexual passion, falls 
flat.

 LIFE, DEATH AND AID: The Medecins Sans Frontieres Report on World Crisis 
Intervention edited by Francois Jean, English version by Anne-Marie Huby & 
Alison Marschner (Routledge: $14.95; 160 pp., illustrated, paperback original). 
Founded in 1971 by a group of French doctors opposed to political restrictions 
on relief missions, Medecins Sans Frontieres ("Doctors Without Borders") 
bluntly condemns world leaders for paying lip service to human rights while 
routinely allowing those rights to be violated in Sudan, Cambodia and 
Tajikistan and seven other regional wars.The politicization of relief efforts 
in these struggles has exacerbated the plight of noncombatants. Nowhere are 
these conditions more evident than in the former Yugoslavia: Drawing on 
first-hand reports, the authors conclude, "The Bosnian disaster has not only 
done serious damage to the credibility of the United Nations and its 
law-enforcement and security instruments, it has also seriously eroded the 
principles of the Geneva Conventions. . . . It has flouted all the ideals on 
which the European democracies were founded in the aftermath of the Second 
World War."

REAL OR IMAGINARY 'TALES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Tales of the City" (PBS): I certainly hope that the author and 
producers of this miniseries don't think that his view of the '70s was how it 
was for everyone. I lived through the '70s during my 20s and there wasn't 
anything portrayed in this series that was even remotely like my life.Certainly 
not everyone was smoking marijuana, sleeping with the same sex and splattering 
conversations with four-letter words. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara George, Arcadia 
</P>
<P>
 What a laugh! With all the gore and mayhem and meanness on television, it has 
been decided to pixillate a view of a bare bottom so viewers can't see it on 
"Tales of the City." 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I find the sight of a killer's bare chest infinitely more 
repugnant than a bare bottom on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Sipolski, Palm Desert No Salvation for Parade Rerun 
</P>
<P>
 I was disappointed with the 7:30 p.m. rebroadcast by KTLA of the Rose Parade. 
I thought it would be commercial-free just like the parade aired at 8 a.m. The 
station had one of its commercial breaks during the Salvation Army Band. Bad 
timing.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; HERE'S A SHOW WITH PIRATES, NEON 
AND A CLASSIC STORY TOO

<P>
 What if Robert Louis Stevenson had known in 1883, when he wrote "Treasure 
Island," that his book's treasure hunt would take place more than a hundred 
years later in a casino hotel in a desert resort town called Las Vegas? 
</P>
<P>
 He probably would have gambled, as NBC has, that it would attract an audience. 
The network's hourlong adaptation airs Tuesday with many of the swashbuckling 
chararacters intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Carrier, who played Young Indy in ABC's "The Young Indiana Jones 
Chronicles," stars as 12-year-old Robbie (Jim Hawkins in the book) who, while 
on a vacation with his parents at the hotel, meets the legendary Long John 
Silver (Anthony Zerbe). After finding a magical treasure map, Robbie and Long 
John team up to find the loot before the bad pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Treasure Island owner Steve Wynn is executive producer, some viewers 
may deem the adventure a long commercial for the elaborate resort. But 
producer-director Scot Garen, who previously directed Disney specials, 
including "Mickey's 60th Birthday," insists that Treasure Island was used 
"merely as a setting. We got to use literally $50 million worth of sets to 
convey our story." 
</P>
<P>
 Those "sets" include two full-scale 90-foot ships, the pirates' Hispaniola and 
the British frigate HMS Royal Brittania, both capable of ear-shattering cannon 
and musket volleys. The ships sail on Buccaneer Bay and Skull Point, which 
surround the hotel's 1 3/4-acre frontage. Last year's big-bang demolition of 
the Dunes Hotel -- another Wynn project -- is incorporated into the story line. 
</P>
<P>
 For Corey, 13, it was the lure of swordplay that drew him to the telefilm. 
It's also what he thinks will appeal to most to his peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got pirates," he says enthusiastically, "And it's in Las Vegas, which is 
as bright as it looks on television. The whole theme, though, is that if you 
can dream it, it can come true. The adventure and the sword fighting are what 
kids are going to like." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the swordplay, the underlying story focuses on Robbie's 
relationship with his father, Garen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the arc of the story is where Robbie learns that the real treasure 
lies in your imagination," he says. "The child's spirit in his father is 
released and the two of them experience a new relationship by the story's end." 
</P>
<P>
 "Treasure Island: The Adventure Begins . . . " airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on NBC. 
For ages 10 and up. MORE FAMILY SHOWS 
</P>
<P>
 The Higgins family discovers a piano in the basement of the roommates' 
apartment on Disney's live-action/puppet series Piano Lessons Under the 
Umbrella Tree (Sunday 11:30 a.m.-noon). Thinking it'll be easy to learn to play 
piano, Holly begins to take lessons with Jon Kimura Parker, a concert pianist 
who lives nearby. Meanwhile, Malcolm, a little mouse who lives in the piano, 
encourages Holly by telling her tales of her Higgins relatives who played the 
piano in the past. The roommates attend Parker's concert and his performance 
inspires Holly to continue practicing. For ages 2 to 8.  
</P>
<P>
 Nickelodeon presents the premiere of two new miniseries installments of The 
Tomorrow People (Saturdays 6-6:30 p.m.), which began last year as a five-part 
miniseries. The kiddie sci-fi-adventure show focuses on a group of telepathic 
kids who have the power to "teleport" -- use their minds to transport their 
bodies from one place to another -- and "mind merge," which is the ability to 
holographically re-create a moment in time. For ages 6 and up.

COMMENTARY; THE DAN AND CONNIE SHOW CONTINUED... 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRAZIER MOORE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anything, they bring out the worst in each other on "The CBS Evening News 
With Dan Rather and Connie Chung." 
</P>
<P>
 Chung, with her coquettish flair and once-upon-a-time way of reading her copy, 
seems all the more lightweight beside the hardy Rather. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for Rather, whose taut, white-knuckle style worked fine in his past 
life as a full-time correspondent but has never served him well as an anchor, 
Chung crowding his left elbow seems only to heighten his unease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dan and Connie Show" is distinguished by how it detracts from the process 
of reporting the news. 
</P>
<P>
 With a partner -- a woman partner, at that -- beside him at the anchor desk, 
Rather himself seems distracted. Should he be warm? Chivalrous? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he has pushed to the limit the chief asset of any journalist: 
credibility. Despite an understandable desire to do more on-the-scene reporting 
after a dozen years solo in the anchor chair, his claim of being "a very happy 
and very excited Dan Rather" just didn't wash when the Rather-Chung team was 
announced last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In second place behind ABC's "World News Tonight" when Chung came on board, 
"The CBS Evening News" quickly dipped to third place, where it currently 
resides. 
</P>
<P>
 But here a destroy-it-to-save-it sort of rationale takes over. Numbers suggest 
that since Chung arrived, the broadcast has shed older viewers (many welcomed 
by "The NBC Nightly News," now No. 2), while strengthening its audience in the 
25-to-54 demographic many advertisers prefer to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the long-term news-viewing audience of the future," says David 
Poltrack, CBS' top research executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Chung is indeed the cure CBS is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, it remains to be seen whether she will have a remedial effect on 
Rather's lapses into wackiness. She was off one night a few weeks ago for a 
particularly odd outbreak of what has come to be called "Dan Rather-isms." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently feeling the urge for a little Catskills humor, Rather came out of a 
3 1/2-minute report on attention deficit disorder with this crack: " 'CBS This 
Morning's' going to have a lot of good stuff tomorrow," he deadpanned, "but for 
the life of me I can't remember what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 But seriously, folks, Rather knows well the difference between glitz and solid 
journalism. And in a much-reported speech to the Radio and Television News 
Directors Assn. last September, he called both his colleagues and himself on 
the carpet for lapses into "fuzz and wuzz." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all succumbed to the 'Hollywoodization' of the news," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 These were strong words, especially from a newsman who considers himself to be 
principally a reporter, yet who retains, even now, the high office, high salary 
and high profile of an anchor. Predictably, he was praised for raising his 
prominent voice -- and also criticized, for blasting the system that gave him 
prominence in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 In giving the news a face and a voice, therefore, the anchor also makes news. 
And not only by making a speech but, sometimes, just by sitting there at the 
anchor desk. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the case, squared, on "The CBS Evening News." An anchor team with scant 
chemistry and minimal journalistic reason for being, "The Dan and Connie Show" 
makes news by distracting its viewers from the real thing.

WORK, FOR THE NIGHT IS COMING; LIFE WORK, BY DONALD HALL (BEACON PRESS: $15; 
132 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Gioia, Dana Gioia's most recent book Can Poetry Matter (Graywolf 
Press), was a finalist for the 1992 National Book Critics Award in criticism. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What is the secret of life?" the poet Donald Hall once asked the 80-year-old 
sculptor Henry Moore. "With anyone else," Hall commented, "the answer would 
have begun with an ironic laugh," but Henry Moore answered the question in 
straightforward, pragmatic terms: 
</P>
<P>
 "The secret of life is to have a task, something you devote your entire life 
to, something you bring everything to, every minute of the day for your whole 
life. And the most important thing is -- it must be something you cannot 
possibly do!" 
</P>
<P>
 Now 15 years after that interview, Hall has attempted to answer his own 
impossible but provocative question. His engrossing new book, "Life Work," is 
difficult to classify but impossible to put down. Part essay, part 
autobiography, part family history, the volume straddles commercial genres. 
</P>
<P>
 Described on its most literal level, "Life Work" is a sustained meditation on 
work as the key to personal happiness. Written over a period of three months in 
1992 (when its author was 63 years old), the book moves forward in undated 
daily entries. Hall discusses his life and work while constantly comparing his 
own activities and attitudes with those of his parents, grandparents and 
great-grandparents. Although the book unfolds like a writer's journal, it never 
feels like a private diary. Indeed the book so successfully creates a sense of 
Hall's inner life in all its intricate dailiness that "Life Work" reads most of 
all like a first-person psychological novel with a poet named Donald Hall as 
its protagonist. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall deepens the novelistic effect by rooting his narrative in a real place, 
Eagle Pond Farm in Danbury, N.H. (The location will be familiar to readers of 
the author's popular memoirs such as "Season at Eagle Pond.") Inheriting the 
family farm from his grandparents, Hall moved there in 1975 with his second 
wife, the poet Jane Kenyon. Giving up the security of academic tenure, Hall 
took the opportunity to reinvent his life. Content in a small circle of friends 
and family, he centered his new existence on the labor he loved most -- 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many men attempt to create new, more fulfilling lives in middle age -- usually 
with unimpressive results. In Hall's case, however, something marvelous 
happened. In New Hampshire his work deepened. Long an accomplished poet, he now 
became an irreplaceable one. By 50 most poets have their best work behind them. 
Hall's verse grew better with each volume, culminating in "The One Day" (1988), 
a book-length poem published on his 60th birthday, which ranks as one of the 
few unquestionable masterpieces in contemporary American poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's prose also developed. Always a smart and snappy stylist, he now seemed 
to slow down his narrative line slightly -- just enough to catch the often 
evanescent human sense of each situation. His incisive literary essays 
continued to be required reading for poets, but Hall's particular talents 
ultimately proved to be for the memoir, a genre in which he has few living 
equals. In his hands the memoir is only partially an autobiographical genre. He 
pours both his full critical intelligence and poetic sensibility into the form. 
His best books, such as "Fathers Playing Catch With Sons" (1985), a celebration 
of baseball; "Seasons at Eagle Pond" (1987), a mixture of nature writing and 
autobiography, and "Their Ancient Glittering Eyes" a 1992 expansion of his 1978 
collection of literary portraits, "Remembering Poets," are all surprisingly 
different. Hall broadened his range as well as achieved greater depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life Work" is not only the latest in this distinguished series of memoirs: it 
is also the book that shares the secrets of how Hall managed his midlife 
transition from minor to major artist. As the book's title suggests, part of 
his secret is hard work -- passionate, constant and uncomplaining. The other 
was the good fortune or good sense to plant his new life on his grandparent's 
farm where nature, memory and tradition nourished his imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's considerable literary skill is demonstrated in how appealing he makes 
his unabashedly workaholic life appear. He is by any standard a driven man. He 
rises at 4:30 a.m., and by 10:00 a.m. he has spent at least four hours writing. 
With occasional breaks and brief recreations, he spends the rest of the day 
reading, revising, proofing and writing. In the evening he watches baseball via 
satellite dish while dictating into a small tape recorder some of the 5,000 
letters he writes every year. A life of extraordinary discipline? Definitely 
not, Hall insists. His life is one of happiness and self-indulgence. Early on 
he realized that "because I loved my work it was as if I did not work at all." 
</P>
<P>
 When genuine artists discuss their working lives, they often alternate between 
sublime speculation and practical specifics. Hall proves no exception. "Life 
Work" intermittently grapples with ideas about work's place in society at 
large. When Hall examines his native New England, he weaves his family history 
into a broader historical fabric. Occasionally, however, Hall unexpectedly 
lurches into ideological issues. A well-intentioned digression on feminism, 
Emile Durkehim and Karl Marx founders, overloaded with unassimilated data and 
windy generalizations. 
</P>
<P>
 More convincing is Hall's practical advice on how he manages to publish a 
yearly average of four books ("counting revised editions of old books," he adds 
mostly) plus numerous poems, essays, articles and book reviews, not to mention 
the 5,000 letters. Productivity is in itself no recommendation for a writer; 
most hacks are prolific. But Hall's ability to write splendidly as well as 
plenteously makes his candid advice worth noting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love being a writer," the late novelist Peter DeVries once quipped, "what I 
can't stand is the paperwork." Hall would agree. Two secrets of his 
productivity are delegation and dictation. He delegates the inessential but 
time-consuming paperwork -- typing, fact checking and the like -- to free up 
more time for real writing. He dictates whatever possible and employs two to 
three typists at a time to transcribe it. All writers will find his remarks on 
dictation -- the technique by which both Stendhal and James created some of 
their best work -- particularly interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through "Life Work" the high-spirited narrative takes a sudden turn. 
Hall discovers he has liver cancer. We share the agonizing tests and diagnosis. 
The book stops for 2 1/2 weeks while he recuperates from surgery. Faced with 
the news that his chances of living five more years are only one out of three, 
Hall's tone becomes more urgent. His meditations and memories darken. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet what one notices most vividly is how consistent Halls' ideas and 
attitudes are both before and after this death sentence. His commitment to work 
always came from a sense of his own mortality. The book's epigraph from the 
Gospel of John summarizes his theme, "We must work . . . ," Jesus said, because 
"night comes, when no man can work." "Life Work" is in prose, but the book 
reflects a lyric poet's sense that time and death are always a writer's real 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's stark confrontation with his own mortality, however, does not leave him 
self-absorbed. The prospect of his own extinction increases rather than 
contracts his humanity. His imagination and memory turn increasingly to other 
people, especially his 89-year-old mother, who defiantly keeps her own house 
despite multiple infirmities. On an earlier, happier visit, when Hall first 
described "Life Work" to her, she responded, "I think your book will be 
inspirational to people." Few will disagree.

PALM LATITUDES: MELTING POT; TOWING THE ORTHODOX HEMLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ivy Brown 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jean-Paul Gaultier's " shmata chic" might have made fashion-mag headlines last 
year, but Orthodox Jews who really live by the ancient rules of dress often 
have a hard time finding something kosher and contemporary. That's where Miss 
Irene comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing mysterious about how Orthodox Jewish women dress," says Miss 
Irene, owner of the eponymous West Los Angeles boutique that mainly serves an 
Orthodox clientele. "It's a matter of modesty." Which means keeping knees, 
elbows, collarbones and the head (if married) covered and no trousers, no 
revealing slits, sheer materials or tight-fitting apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 That might sound like a formula for fashion monotony, but for 22 years, Miss 
Irene's boutique -- which is really her converted garage -- has offered racks 
of stylish and colorful dresses, stacks of sweaters and hats. Nothing unusual, 
just carefully chosen garments that tow the Orthodox hemline. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the same brands can be found at department stores, but, as Adair 
Klein, director of library and archival services at the Simon Wiesenthal 
Center, puts it: "I like shopping here because of Irene's warmth and her 
patience when I'm looking for an outfit. And the personal attention I get with 
her, no one gets that kind of care and concern anymore at the big department 
stores." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Irene, who uses no last name, came to the United States from Hungary in 
1956. She is a former Hebrew-school teacher who turned to the rag trade "so I 
could stay home and make money. It paid the tuition for my (three) children to 
go to Hebrew school," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jewish women are not different from other women," Miss Irene stresses, as she 
shows how a few stitches can take the sin out of a slitted A-line dress. "They 
want a good buy and to look modern and stylish." Ivy Brown

PALM LATITUDES: CLIQUES; TOONED IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Raphael

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave and Debbie Spafford's neighbors have gotten used to the noise and the 
laughter and even the occasional limo. They know that every Friday night, a 
corner of their quiet neighborhood becomes the center of the world -- well, the 
animation world. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past five years, the Spaffords' Friday night house party (or 
"animation roadhouse" in Debbie's words), has drawn animators from all over the 
city, with W.O.M. spreading as far as Europe and Australia. Recent guests have 
included "Nightmare Before Christmas" director Henry Selick, Ralph ("Fritz the 
Cat," "Cool World") Bakshi and John Kricfalusi, creator of "Ren & Stimpy." 
</P>
<P>
 A sign in the back yard reading "Pago Pago" offers a clue to the party's 
origins. "It used to hang outside this bar across from the Disney studios, in 
Burbank, where the old-time animators met and drank," says Dave Spafford, a 
Disney vet himself before forming Spaff Animation with Debbie in 1989. Among 
their credits: "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and Woody Woodpecker's Oscar 
presentation for Best Animated Short Film of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the parties came out of the Spaffords' experience in England, 
when they were working on "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." (Dave drew the piano duel 
between Donald Duck and Daffy Duck.) There, animators socialized at a local pub 
after work, connecting with the film -- and each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home though, animation get-togethers didn't seem to work. "We tried 
sitting over margaritas at this Mexican restaurant, but it wasn't the same," 
Dave says. So the Spaffords decided to do it at home -- with its 
Alice-meets-Haight-Ashbury decor, a cartoon fantasy of weird fiberglass horses, 
spinning mirror disco balls, four pinball machines, a pool table and a '30s-era 
jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no football bar," says Dave. "After a few beers, we put out grease 
pencils and draw on the table, so our whole bar ends up being one big cartoon! 
We're all freaks. Who else wants to do cartoons?" Judy Raphael

L.A.: SALON CENTRAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here in Los Angeles talented resident poets are usually found presenting their 
work in quite modest circumstances, whereas poets who fly into LAX and rent a 
car may be seen at high-profile series in venues that feature comfortable 
chairs. Interestingly, the poetry series just begun at Arundal Antiquarian 
Books is committed to poets of both national and local reputation. Poet and 
series director Laurel Ann Bogen inaugurated the reading with familiar Los 
Angeles names and then, in a turn that has dazzled some, lined up Mark Strand, 
William Dickey and Philip Levine for February, March and April. "I want to 
present the most important voices in America," states Bogen emphatically, 
"whether they're from New York, L.A. or Fresno." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Bevis, owner of Arundal Antiquarian Books (8380 Beverly Blvd.), 
acknowledges that this combining of the famed with the under-recognized springs 
from a "utopian view" and adds, "I want to help develop a serious audience for 
poetry and in order to do that the focus of attention must be the poets, not 
the espresso machine sputtering in the background." 
</P>
<P>
 It's Jan. 13. All seats are claimed in this small-to-medium-size space where 
the shelves rise from floor to ceiling. The occasion is a rare L.A. visit from 
Diane DiPrima, the doyenne of the Beat generation and author of the collection 
"Revolutionary Letters." Curiosity about her is running high. Many know only 
bits and pieces: She wrote an extremely ribald autobiography. She wrote a 
one-line poem: "Get your cut neck off my knife." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight DiPrima does not deliver any such disarming lines but instead gives a 
pleasant, composed reading of poems that reflect her interest in Tibetan 
Buddhism and the ideas and imaginings of older cultures. Of a goddess called 
Innana she writes, "From the steppes she came/From the place of tall grass she 
came/From the island desert she came/She rode a lion." 
</P>
<P>
 After the reading many linger on to have their books signed, to talk. There is 
something of a salon atmosphere here; moreover, it is Thursday, the exact day 
of the week the Bloomsbury Group gathered. Someone asks Bogen to reveal how she 
manages to secure commitments from such luminaries. "I write a good letter," 
she replies mysteriously. Pressed further she admits laughingly: "I prostrate 
myself before them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arundal Antiquarian Books readings are held on the second Thursday of each 
month at 8 p.m. Seating is limited, so come early. Admission is $5. For more 
information, call 213-852-9852. Suzanne Lummis

THE KNOWLEDGE OF MEN; THE LAWS, BY CONNIE PALMEN . TRANSLATED BY RICHARD 
HUIJING (GEORGE BRAZILLER: $18.50; 200 PAGES)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ursula Hegi, Ursula Hegi's latest novel, Floating in My Mother's Palm, is 
set in postwar Germany. A sequel, Stones in the River, is forthcoming. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This first novel by Dutch author Connie Palmen won the 1992 European Novel of 
the Year award and sold over 150,000 copies in the Netherlands alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in Amsterdam in the 1980s, "The Laws" explores the search of a philosophy 
student, Marie Deniet, for her personal vision. In a voice that is cocky, 
curious, defiant, perceptive and daring, Marie begins to reveal herself. There 
are certain things she knows about herself: "I can only lie when I have 
prepared myself for it days in advance"; "I am used to having secrets"; "You 
must do the thing you fear, for that's the safest." She knows she wants to 
write books. And she is studying philosophy "in order to learn to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Although at times "The Laws" reads more like a philosophy text than fiction, 
relying on explanations and theories, it is successful as a novel because 
Palmen establishes a sense of adventure and discovery right from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie tries to learn exclusively from men about what it means to be human. Her 
opinion of women is low: Based on her own uneasiness when around women, she 
believes that they, too, will only say words to her that she wants to hear. 
When it comes to Marie's perceptions about what it means to be female or male, 
the author has drawn rigid gender boundaries, and it is not surprising that 
Marie's conclusions about what it means to be a woman -- to bear children, to 
exist within the love of a man -- are naive and limited. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth, she thinks, comes from men. They are the ones who make the laws, 
write books. Her apartment is filled with the books of men. But she wants to 
get beyond printed words, into a living, breathing philosophy, and her urge to 
know and understand leads her to seven different men, most of them 
substantially older than she. 
</P>
<P>
 With each of these men, Marie enters his territory, his power, ready to have 
him change her entire life. "I will listen to him for as long as it takes until 
I know everything about this way of looking and judging." She likes to come to 
him as if totally untouched by previous mentors and, like a chameleon, imitate 
his thought patterns, his physical movements, his style of clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven chapters of the novel are named after the men: the astrologer relies 
on signs outside himself for decisions and calls her a "philosophical 
whore-angel"; the epileptic's most passionate relationship is with his illness; 
the philosopher teaches her that "to know how to die is the final secret of 
every initiation"; the grotesque priest shares her interest in the link between 
literature and philosophy and seduces her by evoking her pity and revulsion; 
the married physicist becomes her lover and teaches her about the "law of 
increasing chaos"; the artist draws her from her intellectual shell and becomes 
the target of her obsessive love; and the psychiatrist guides her in her search 
for her core as she finally rejects "too many masters, too many languages." 
</P>
<P>
 The most fascinating of her mentors is the epileptic who felt fragmented until 
he was seized by his illness and became "the focal point of his own life and 
his principal object of study." What draws him to Marie is her ability to 
listen with a passion that matches his own when it comes to his epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Her childhood has trained her for absolutes. Raised as a Catholic with the 
capacity to embrace one concept totally, Marie left her earliest belief just as 
totally when, as a 14-year-old, she read Sartre for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 But gradually her old ways of learning no longer apply. "My spirit has been 
raped in fact. And I just let it happen, invited it. . . . I want to recover 
from the thoughts of others." By dismissing other women, Marie has invalidated 
herself. When she is ready to confront that emptiness with the psychiatrist, 
she can begin the true journey. 
</P>
<P>
 What is most interesting about this journey of knowledge is that, ultimately, 
Marie needs to meet up with the woman in herself. All along her role models 
have been men. She has tried to think in the most traditional of men's 
approaches, to compartmentalize information. Her ultimate frustration and 
triumph are that she absorbs these insights as a woman, bringing the different 
strands intoone.

SHELF LIFE; HOW DID AREA BOOKSTORES FARE IN LAST MONDAY'S EARTHQUAKE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Santa Monica Bookstar location Monday morning, at left above, many 
aisles were knee-deep in fallen books, most of the plate glass windows had 
shattered, and the darkened store stood open to Wilshire Blvd. Further west, on 
4th St., the sidewalk in front of Eric Chaim Kline Rare and Used Books, above, 
was cordoned off where the brick facade of the building had collapsed; workmen 
were busily breaking down the upper floors before aftershocks could do the job 
less predictably. 
</P>
<P>
 A short distance away at Dutton's Brentwood Bookstore, Doug Dutton reported 
that "a lot of our books were on the floor, but the only case that fell over 
was the case that holds the Bibles. It's either an act of God or a heathen 
saboteur." When we finally got through to the Dutton's in the Valley, where all 
the cases were off the walls, Carol Hoffman said, "This is much worse than 
anything you've seen on TV, much worse than the '71 quake, we'll be closed all 
week." Volunteers were helping to pick up books. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chevalier's in Larchmont Village, Phyllis Winthrop noted that passers-by 
had stopped to help, but store owners felt it was better to clear up 
themselves, since volunteers wouldn't know where to put books. She added, 
"We've been selling a lot of earthquake-related books, particularly kid's 
books, like 'Earthquake' by Jay Gilligan (Bantam Books)." At Rizzoli Books in 
South Coast Plaza, the big seller on Monday was "Peace of Mind in Earthquake 
Country" by Peter Yanev (Chronicle Books), while at Waldenbooks in the Glendale 
Galleria the word was: "Everyone's buying Thomas Bros. Guides so they can 
figure out how to get to work!" 
</P>
<P>
 Staying Power: What stuck on the shelves? At Midnight Special (left below), on 
the Santa Monica Promenade, the curiously symmetrical arrangement left standing 
featured Arthur Ashe's memoir "Days of Grace," "The Judas Factor: The Plot to 
Kill Malcolm X," "Climbing Jacob's Ladder" and "Having Our Say: The Delaney 
Sisters' First 100 Years." (Perhaps this is commentary from Above on our 
readers' debate over specialty bestseller lists?) At Arcana, across the 
Promenade, which specializes in photography books, the lone book left vertical 
as the broken display window was boarded up was Richard Avedon's autobiography.

STYLE / GARDENS; UNITED THEY STAND

<TEXT>
<P>
 Flowers and picket fences enjoy a symbiotic relationship: While fences protect 
blossoms against bikes, tykes and wandering dogs, flowers make even the most 
forbidding barriers appear downright friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kris and Jim Valentine began planting their San Fernando Valley front 
yard five years ago, they installed a prefab picket fence and garden designer 
Jack Wheeler of Woodland Hills put in full-blown flower beds behind it. Each 
year, the curved beds get a little bigger and the lawn a little smaller. 
Coreopsis peek out near the bottom of the slats; Dainty Bess, Kathleen and Don 
Juan roses are trained to grow over the top. Inside, along with towering 
foxgloves and other perennials, grow several white Iceberg and salmon First 
Kiss roses. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, Cathy and Joel Gabik of South Pasadena seem to have planted 
their perennials on the wrong side of the pickets. But Cathy Gabik says the 
fence serves as an ideal street-side backdrop: "Delphiniums and other tall 
flowers look great in front of it." Though their house is only 7 years old, it 
was designed to blend in with the vintage homes in their historic neighborhood 
-- and the picket fence completed the picture. Says Gabik: "Isn't it every 
girl's dream to live in a cottage with a picket fence and flowers?" 
</P>
<P>
 Along a driveway in La Jolla, Del Mar designer Linda Chisari used an existing 
picket fence as a backdrop as well as a prop for tall plants that might lean 
into the neighboring yard. The fence enables Helen and Arthur Dawson -- 
characterized by Chisari as "consummate gardeners who spend up to 90 hours a 
week in the garden" -- to unify perennials of many different colors, including 
phlomis, verbena, lavender, salvia and alstroemeria. "The fence was begging for 
a perennial garden," Chisari says. Its sharp verticality also complements spiky 
flowers and contrasts with mounded foliage -- more reasons this classic 
combination of picket fence and flowers has endured for centuries. ROBERT SMAUS

 Clothing designer Rachel London admits that she's no gardener -- "I have a 
black thumb," she says -- but her Malibu Beach atelier overflows with roses 
anyway. Her secret? Chinese-made polyester flowers, as many as 10,000 of them, 
hung from the ceiling, swagged over doorways and windows, attached to furniture 
and strewn across an espalier out on the terrace.Says London of the eye-popping 
floral flourishes: "They never die, they hold their shape and they're always in 
bloom." 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old designer, whose fans include Madonna (she wore London's pink 
"floral fur" bolero to the Tony Awards six years ago), Demi Moore, Roseanne 
Arnold and Naomi Campbell, has always "adored wild clothes and colors." So it's 
not surprising that she was originally inspired by Elsa Schiaparelli and 
Christian Lacroix, or that her creations for adults and children -- hot pants, 
jean jackets, coats, stoles, boleros, shirts, mini-dresses, platform shoes -- 
bear flowery patterns to rival the interior of her studio-apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, London has stapled roses to the walls, glued them to 
sofas and riveted them to bathroom shower curtains. She's also sewn petals onto 
poplin sheeting to form what she calls her "rainbow rug." Even bath towels and 
washcloths haven't escaped a pink peppering of blossoms. What's left? Lately, 
she's begun adding birds and butterflies: "They're a natural with flowers."

EXOTIC RIFFS; JOHN SEDLAR IN HIS BIKINI: PAINTED PLATES, CHICKEN FEET, CHATEAU 
D'YQUEM ON TAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The last great restaurant to open before the recession hit Los Angeles was 
probably Bikini, which debuted two years ago in a posh office building near the 
Santa Monica Greyhound station. It's run by John Sedlar, who brought the world 
New Southwest Cuisine before he chucked it for the Expanded Pacific Rim thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bikini may be the most eclectic restaurant in California, a lushly modern 
place with a two-story Eric Orr waterfall sculpture and a chef who is unafraid 
to riff on exotic dishes such as the banana-leaf-wrapped Nicaraguan tamale 
nacatamal and the spiky Thai-style dumpling. Sedlar pipes varicolored sauces 
into abstract sunsets and garnishes the skyscapes with medium-rare, grilled 
salmon. He serves chicken legs with the feet still attached. He stencils snide 
mottoes, such as "The Melting Pot Is Full," in turmeric or paprika on his 
plates in the sort of up-yours, Eat the Rich spirit that was largely, if 
erroneously, supposed to be the force behind '80s cuisine. A neon sign above 
the upstairs bar says "Chateau d'Yquem on Tap," which it is, at $32 and $40 a 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Although less well known than many of his contemporaries, Sedlar was among the 
most influential L.A. chefs of the '80s. You indirectly have Sedlar to thank 
each time you nibble on a blue-corn tortilla chip or eat a chile-rubbed steak, 
each time you encounter a plate painted with brightly colored squirts of sauce 
that might have delighted a Fauve. The move to Santa Monica from Manhattan 
Beach, where his landmark Saint Estephe was located, seems to have done 
splendid things for Sedlar's career. Sedlar has now become the latest 
California sensation on the celebrity-chef circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meals at Bikini open with a doll's teacup full of tarragon-scented custard, 
unmolded onto an enormous painted plate emblazoned with a Roy Lichtenstein-type 
cartoon -- "Blam Blam," the plate says -- and drizzled with a gram or so of 
rice vinegar and sesame oil. The effect is dramatic. Next comes a warm, 
hand-patted tortilla and slabs of butter crusted with cracked black pepper and 
herbs; then, perhaps, a basket of freshly fried sopapillas : a solid "A" before 
the first course even arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be most famous for his Southwestern cooking, but Sedlar seems to be at 
his best when his food cleaves closest to nouvelle French cuisine. There is a 
gorgeous composed salad, almost Art Deco in its formality, with soft, luxurious 
smoked eel, a mound of vinegared, julienned root vegetables and thinly sliced 
Asian pears, nearly transparent and glazed with sesame oil, overlapped into a 
Machine Age-perfect circle. A dish involving sheets of cilantro pasta -- "open 
ravioli" -- draped over stewed snails and a wash of the deepest-green cilantro 
puree, garnished with leaves of fried cilantro, is a somber meditation on that 
herb. 
</P>
<P>
 Egg foo yong, soft scrambled duck eggs tucked back into their shells with bits 
of shrimp and crunchy chunks of ginger, is less a pun on the faux -Cantonese 
from which it takes its name than on the custardy eggs with caviar served at 
L'Orangerie; Oaxacan sopes seems less like the classic Mexican antojito than 
like a very French spiced-clam tart with a masa shell where you might expect 
puff pastry. The Provencal-inspired rare roast lamb with three kinds of 
eggplant is among the best lamb dishes in town. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the half-dozen or so best restaurants in Los Angeles, Bikini can also 
be among the most problematic, from the uninteresting, overpriced wine list to 
the indifferent greeting at the door. While Sedlar is among the most inventive 
chefs in the world, sometimes, frankly, his ideas don't work -- and in a great 
restaurant, they should, every time. It isn't easy to run a serious restaurant 
in Los Angeles right now.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, Tlatlan painted-duck enchilada is basically smoked slices of duck 
breast, rather rare, arranged on top of a sweetish trated sauce based on 
tamarind. The richness of the chile-tinged sauce suggests almost a mole ; the 
sweet pepperiness against the smoke of the meat suggests barbecue; the 
sweet-and-sour taste suggests the classic Chinese duck sauce. The cultural 
resonances seem to clash with one another where you would want them to 
harmonize, and the dish -- the "enchilada" part of the name seems to refer to a 
tortilla-type object emblazoned with a traditional Mayan design and perched 
atop a sweet vegetable puree -- is more confusing than delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 And though most of the food here is terrific, sometimes when Sedlar roams the 
globe, the results can be all over the map. A "schnitzel" of whitefish, 
essentially a filet coated in bread crumbs, fried and served with little 
dumplings in tart lemon butter, is ironically heavier than the veal dish it's 
punning on; an air-dried duck taco with radicchio and arugula in a red-chile 
tortilla had none of the crisp skin that you might be looking for when you 
order, say, air-dried duck.  
</P>
<P>
 While user-friendly to chocolate freaks, dessert can prove the oddest course 
of all: A chocolate-truffle "tamale" served on a plate emblazoned with an image 
of the Virgin of Guadalupe might sit across the table from a round of molten 
chocolate cake on a plate with the word Lust stenciled in cocoa. 
</P>
<P>
 Bikini might be expensive -- prices were lowered last year, a recessionary 
concession -- but it tries hard to prove that it is not bourgeois. 
</P>

JAZZ SPOTLIGHT

 SONNY ROLLINS 
</P>
<P>
 "Old Flame" 
</P>
<P>
 Milestone  
</P>
<P>
 At his best, Sonny Rollins has one of the most luxurious sounds in all of jazz 
-- a richly variegated expression that moves with astonishing fluency from 
intimate whisper to passionate shout.Sadly, that sound rarely makes its 
appearance on this new collection, in which he works with a quintet and -- on 
two tracks -- a brass choir performing Jimmy Heath arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rollins sometimes reveals the extraordinary harmonic imagination that 
has long characterized his improvisations, more often he seems to be looking 
for a focus and never quite finding it. His closing cadenza on "Darn That 
Dream" is typical -- starting off with some promising melodic variations, then 
losing its way into random riffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Solos on such ballads as "Where or When," "My Old Flame" and "I See Your Face 
Before Me" (taken at a painfully slow tempo) are similarly flawed, declamatory 
without substance, exploratory without a destination. Nor is Rollins aided much 
by the faster tempos of "Delia" and "Times Slimes" -- the kind of grooves that 
would in the past have triggered his finest playing. Here, pianist Tommy 
Flanagan and (occasionally) trombonist Clifton Anderson generate the few 
flashes of energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Further compounding the problem, Rollins is not well served by the rhythm team 
of Jack DeJohnette and Bob Cranshaw, who appear to have different perceptions 
of where the heart of the rhythm is beating. DON HECKMAN

WITH AN EYE ON ...; TELMA HOPKINS, THE ACCIDENTAL ACTRESS WITH A MESSAGE TO 
TELL

 "I still get mail from people who have been watching me since 'Tony Orlando 
and Dawn' who were maybe in their 20s then, and now their kids are watching me, 
but their kids don't know anything about (the group)," Telma Hopkins says, 
talking about her beginning in show biz. 
</P>
<P>
 Her success didn't really hit her until years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it was happening, it was almost like it was happening to someone else. 
You get overwhelmed when there's so much going on, and later, you think about 
it and go, 'Wow. That was really something.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins also thinks her latest TV stint with Cindy Williams on NBC's "Getting 
By" is really something too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's nice to remind people that a family isn't necessarily a mom, 
dad, two kids and a dog, especially in this day and age when economically we 
have to lean on other people for support," Hopkins says of the series. "This is 
certainly an example of one, and it's nice that the family is of Caucasian and 
African-American descent. I think it's nice to see people getting along." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Louisville, Ky., and raised in Highland Park, Mich., near Detroit, 
Hopkins as a child knew she wanted to sing. "I never really entertained the 
thought of acting or being a comedian, probably because Detroit was such a 
record town. That's what everybody wanted to do, that's what I wanted to do," 
she says. "I think if you weren't building a car, which is what most folks were 
doing, you were making records." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins got her big break in the 1970s when she became one of the founding 
members of Tony Orlando and Dawn. The group's Grammy Award for "Tie a Yellow 
Ribbon 'Round the Old Oak Tree" catapulted the group to a TV musical-variety 
show in 1974 and, soon enough, she was starring in her own special. 
</P>
<P>
 "Acting was a fluke," Hopkins says. "I think rather than trying to make us 
into actors (CBS) did the smart thing and wrote from what they saw. I was the 
one that was standing around, ready to burst Tony's bubble any chance I got, 
and Joyce (Vincent Wilson) was the quiet one. It worked because that's who we 
were: We really didn't have any experience on camera. You could see us learn on 
the air ... and then when I understood that you could actually get paid for 
being silly, I said, 'Heck, I knew I was silly for a reason.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After landing roles on several television series, including "Bosom Buddies" 
and "Gimme a Break," Hopkins played Rachel Crawford on "Family Matters" for 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with "Getting By," Hopkins finds her career mirroring more of herself. A 
single parent on the show, as she is in real life, Hopkins manages to find time 
for children in her spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to do things like Career Day because I feel someone looking at me 
might think, 'Oh, her life must've been so this and that,' but I made my share 
of mistakes growing up. So when I look at these kids in school, I feel like I 
have something to offer to them because I didn't come from a well-to-do 
background," Hopkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got married too young, pregnant, and divorced, but I never let that be my 
excuse for not getting on with my life and trying to shoot for whatever goals I 
had. You can make mistakes and you can fall down, but you can dust yourself off 
and not let those stumbling blocks be permanent, too. I feel very strongly 
about that so I enjoy sharing my history in that way with kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the few things that makes being a celebrity about something: It 
gives it some real meaning," she says. "I love the money, and I love the glory 
most of the time, and I love the work -- that's the most fun for me, but it's 
nice to be able to actually be effective at something other than making people 
laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting By" airs Saturdays at 8:30 p.m. on NBC .

ON THE SET; REMAINS OF THE PLAY; A WRITER'S HUMOROUS JOURNEY BEGINS IN THE WEST 
END AND STOPS AT A&E 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's bad enough that playwright Hamish Partt must take time from rehearsals 
and rewrites to lunch with pompous twits at a trendy L.A. eatery. What's worse, 
what's almost unbearable, is that he can't even get his waiter to find the 
right kind of Scotch to help him through the long afternoon's blather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," Partt says in a barely contained frenzy of polite frustration, "I'll 
just have an ordinary Scotch whiskey, please. Large, with two lumps of ice. An 
ordinary whiskey! Eh?" 
</P>
<P>
 And then, just when Partt appears ready to lunge for the throat of his 
departing waiter, someone shouts, "Cut!" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that's right, it's only a movie. Or, to be more specific, a 
made-for-television production, "Unnatural Pursuits," co-produced by Britain's 
BBC and America's A&E network. But it's not Los Angeles. Rather, it's Cent'Anni 
Ristorante in Houston, gussied up for the afternoon with just a touch of West 
Coast ambience, and crowded with the cameras and lighting equipment of an 
Anglo-American production crew. 
</P>
<P>
 The director is Christopher Morahan, whose credits range from the tony 
literacy of "The Jewel in the Crown" to the droll lunacy of "Clockwise" (with 
John Cleese). The playwright's table companions are actors Bob Balaban and Paul 
Guilfoyle. And that unshaven, unmade bed of a fellow who can't get his Scotch, 
is Alan Bates, the formidable British actor who, at 59, still has the twinkle 
in his eye and the fire in his gut of a thoroughgoing professional who loves, 
and lives for, his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates is especially pleased to once again savor dialogue provided by Simon 
Gray, the playwright who gave him one of his finest roles, the droll but 
dissipated university don of "Butley," which Bates played to great acclaim on 
stage and screen in the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, this is the seventh time I've done one of his scripts," Bates says 
during a break between camera setups. "I love his language -- there's a 
lightness that hides a lot of comment, a lot of depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one, it's a very humorous journey. But all along the way there are 
certain little signs that all is not as it should be. ... The darkness creeps 
up on you. It's always lurking, until it suddenly shoots forward." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unnatural Pursuits" is at least partially autobiographical, inspired by 
Gray's international misadventures while struggling to mount a production of 
"The Common Pursuit," his West End and off-Broadway triumph of a few years 
back. (The play, and the people involved with it, have been given different 
names in the teleplay.) The drama begins with Partt reacting to the London 
opening of his latest play, "Unnatural Pursuits," which is damned with faint 
praise by critics and largely ignored by audiences. Naturally, Partt jumps at 
the chance to continue working on the play at a small, Equity Waiver theater in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. production is a success, sort of, but not entirely satisfying. So 
Partt moves on to Dallas, where a major regional theater wants to mount 
"Unnatural Pursuits." After that, it's off to New York, where Partt hopes to 
take off-Broadway by storm. 
</P>
<P>
 At each stop along the way, however, the playwright's drinking gets worse, and 
his alcohol-enhanced hallucinations become more vivid. He moves closer, and 
closer, to the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like the most about this character," Bates says, "is his ability to 
enjoy even the most desperate situations. Simon manages to invest his 
characters with such mischief, a mischievousness that I love. An ability to 
appreciate the ridiculousness of it all, if you like. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think it's a very pleasurable thing to act: a character with an 
awareness, who can apply wit to a situation. Sometimes it's a despairing wit, 
but, oh well ..." 
</P>
<P>
 Budget limitations forced producer Kenith Trodd ("The Singing Detective," 
"Pennies From Heaven") into, if not despair, then desperately inventive 
dollar-stretching. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time that A&E has participated with the BBC in something 
that has such a large American content," Trodd says. But even with the A&E 
investment, making a three-hour production with locations in London, Los 
Angeles, New York and Dallas proved to be too much of a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really couldn't afford to go to L.A.," Trodd says, "because of the 
horrendous cost of filming there." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Trodd discovered it would be easy to capture what director 
Morahan calls "the mall feeling" of L.A. in the Texas metropolis of Houston, 
just 250 miles away from Dallas. Which is how Houston, which often is faked in 
Los Angeles, wound up doubling for L.A. -- for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 True, there were the pressures of financial and temporal limitations. "But I 
have found, very often, that pressure works," Bates says, "as long as it isn't 
too relentless. It sharpens people's wits, and makes you think on the spot. You 
do not indulge yourself, you don't waver between two attitudes. You trust your 
instincts." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unnatural Pursuits" airs Sunday at 5 and 9 p.m. on Arts & Entertainment.

RETRO; STILL IN A 'FAERIE TALE' WORLD; DISNEY REPEATS SHOWTIME'S ADAPTATIONS OF 
FAMOUS FABLES 
</P>

<P>
 Barney the Dinosaur doesn't appear in any episodes of Faerie Tale Theatre, one 
of the most delightful and innovative family series ever to hit cable 
television. But there are wolves, pigs, frogs and mermaids galore. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeats of the award-winning series recently began on the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Faerie Tale Theatre" is the brainchild of actress Shelley Duvall, best known 
for her offbeat roles in such Robert Altman films as "Popeye" and "Thieves Like 
Us." Not only was she executive producer of the series, Duvall wore the hats of 
host and guest star. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 27 episodes, which originally aired from 1982 to '87 on Showtime, 
took a unique, quirky spin on venerable fairy tales. Knockabout humor, music, 
innovative sets and stellar casts were the series' calling cards. The show 
doesn't talk down to children and is sophisticated enough for adults to 
appreciate. Among the more notable episodes were "The Tale of the Frog Prince," 
with a high-flying Robin Williams, and "The Three Little Pigs," with Billy 
Crystal hamming it up with glee. 
</P>
<P>
 The series also attracted major film directors. Francis Ford Coppola directed 
"Rip Van Winkle," with Harry Dean Stanton, and French director Roger Vadim 
helmed "Beauty and the Beast," starring Klaus Kinski and Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
 Duvall has also had great success with her two subsequent series for Showtime: 
"Tall Tales and Legends," and her current animated show "Bedtime Stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming episodes of "Faerie Tale Theatre" on Disney include: 
</P>
<P>
 Monday: "The Boy Who Left Home to Find Out About the Shivers," starring Dana 
Hill, Peter MacNicol, Christopher Lee, Frank Zappa and David Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 31: "Sleeping Beauty," starring Christopher Reeve, Bernadette Peters, 
Beverly D'Angelo, Sally Kellerman, Carol Kane and Rene Auberjonois. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 7: "Cinderella," starring Jennifer Beals, Matthew Broderick, Jean 
Stapleton and Eve Arden. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 14: "Beauty and the Beast," starring Klaus Kinski, Susan Sarandon, 
Anjelica Huston and Stephen Elliot. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 21: "Puss in Boots," starring Gregory Hines, Ben Vereen, George Kirby, 
Alfre Woodward and Brock Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 28: "Rumpelstiltskin," starring Shelley Duvall, Ned Beatty, Herve 
Villechaize and Bud Cort. Emile Ardolino ("Sister Act," "Gypsy") directed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Faerie Tale Theatre" airs Mondays at 7 p.m. and repeats Saturdays at 6 p.m. 
on the Disney Channel.

ART REVIEW; MAKING MAGIC FROM THE MUNDANE; TERRY FOX'S WORK IS SPIRITUAL WITH A 
SECULAR SLANT, EXPLORING THE ORDER AND MEANINGIN OUR SEEMINGLY RANDOM EXISTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, Christopher Knight is a Times art critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an artist, Terry Fox has always seemed to be a European who happened to be 
born American (in Seattle, to be precise, in 1943). His work addresses matters 
of great philosophical complexity, which are most often suggested by objects 
and drawings of spartan simplicity. A spiritual dimension is at his art's core, 
but in a manner that chafes against material limitations without getting 
unctuous or affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, whose touring 20-year survey of Conceptual art is currently at the Otis 
Art Gallery, has in fact spent a good deal of time in Europe. He went to Rome 
shortly after high school to study at the Accademia di Belle Arti. He was in 
Paris in 1968, where his participation in the dramatic student uprisings had a 
profound effect on his artistic direction. His first European gallery shows 
were in 1972, and he's had more one-person exhibitions in galleries and museums 
in Italy, Germany, France, Belgium, Austria and Switzerland than in the United 
States. In 1980, he became a full-fledged expatriate -- moving from San 
Francisco and New York first to Berlin, then to Naples, on to Florence and, 
since 1988, to Liege, Belgium, where he currently resides. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey exhibition's useful catalogue, written by art dealer and former 
curator Constance Lewallen, pointedly notes that Fox chose to leave the United 
States for good "just after President Reagan had taken office." It's easy to 
see why: A spartan aesthetic concerned with issues of spiritual and 
philosophical moment is hardly compatible with a period whose profile is most 
vividly marked by consuming greed and debilitating political duplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, the Otis show was organized by Elsa Longhauser at the Moore College 
of Art andDesign in Philadelphia and will travel next to the University Art 
Museum at UC Berkeley. American art schools and universities, unlike most 
American museums, have always been more open to exhibiting artists whose 
concerns are not manifest in the fabrication of traditional objects. At Otis, 
Fox's spare materials include some piano wire, a couple of ordinary drinking 
glasses, four beer bottles, a button suspended from a pencil by a piece of 
string, a few ladders, long strips of paper marked with ink and pencil, a pair 
of battered stools -- the stuff of everyday usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is there much to look at. The show features almost three dozen works 
dating from 1972 to 1992, following a five-year period devoted to site-specific 
performances that cannot be reconstructed; but none is what you might describe 
as "visually compelling." As with other American and, especially, European 
Conceptual artists who emerged from the crucible of the 1960s, Fox employs the 
simplest materials necessary to his task. 
</P>
<P>
 If Fox's spare objects aren't visually compelling, many are nonetheless 
engagingly curious. You want to puzzle them out. Unassuming but oddly inviting 
-- and sometimes eccentrically witty -- the best of them sneak inside your 
consciousness and cause a gentle ripple in the cerebral cortex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry Fox: Articulations (Labyrinth/Text Works)" begins with the artist's 
preoccupation with the metaphoric possibilities of a pre-existing structure -- 
namely, the famous, medieval labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral in France. 
Descriptive of a facet of medieval cosmology, at Chartres the labyrinth is 
about 43 feet in diameter and composed of rough, flat, blue-and-white paving 
stones embedded in the cathedral floor. It is not an object but an articulated 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 An articulated path is also perhaps the most succinct way to describe Fox's 
approach to the relationship between art and life. For the labyrinth, designed 
as a pattern of 11 concentric rings winding through 34 turns along 552 steps to 
its inevitable center, is plainly a metaphor for life's circuitous journey. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chartres the journey is endowed with a particular religiosity: Believers 
would get on their knees and recite specific prayers at each step along the 
path. But Fox attempts to untangle it from rigid doctrine. The mundane ma 
terials he chooses suggest a secular spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 The labyrinth turns up in the exhibition at least a dozen times. A small 
plaster model is placed on a pedestal, its material suggesting the origin from 
which future repetitions of the object could be cast. Nearby, a plan of the 
labyrinth is scratched into the black, painted surface of a sheet of glass, 
allowing flickers of light to pass through while creating a reflective surface 
in which you glimpse your face through the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawings project the flat pattern of the journey into three dimensions, 
creating a surprising sequence of cruciform shapes. One drawing, made on a tube 
of clear plastic, rests inside a large glass jar. Air holes punched in the lid 
trace the winding path, while allowing oxygen for an (unseen) butterfly that a 
kid might capture in such a jar. The principles of Fox's cosmography apply to 
all things -- great and small. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plan of the labyrinth, drawn in black ink on a circle of paper, is 
suspended on a string stretched taut between two wooden stools that stand atop 
one another, feet to feet. This rudimentary object is in fact an unlikely model 
of the great cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 The top stool rises above the conceptual plane of the cathedral floor, 
coincident with the surface of the Earth. It is mirrored by the stool below, 
which descends to a level equal to an underground water-table that, according 
to Fox, became the actual cathedral architect's measurement for the height of 
the building's tallest spire. Suspended between the secret "river of life" 
below and the soaring heavens above, the labyrinth goes round. 
</P>
<P>
 If Fox's use of the labyrinth as metaphor, which he explored for a half-dozen 
years, suggests a doctrinaire view in which all life's seemingly random 
movements are in fact worked out in advance, step by step along a predetermined 
road, the artist quickly cautions about who is truly in control. He does it 
with a little game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experiment in Autosuggestion" is an unassuming work that includes 
instructions for a parlor game in which you hold a button, suspended by a piece 
of string from a pencil, over a simple diagram. By moving your eyes in 
proscribed patterns, the button miraculously follows suit, shifting directions 
at your eyes' command. 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously, that is, until you realize that your eyes and mind have 
imperceptibly conspired to direct the subtle movements of your body's central 
nervous system. This little demonstration of the unconscious power lurking 
within sight and mind is both amusing and sobering -- and especially revealing 
for an artist who had given up painting, with its emphasis on the visual, in 
favor of an artistic focus on ideas, which is the basis of Conceptual art. 
</P>
<P>
 A kind of "Mr. Wizard" quality permeates works like these, which use laymen's 
materials -- a glass jar, a button, bits of string, kitchen stools -- to 
demonstrate philosophical rather than scientific principles that give order and 
meaning to the otherwise seemingly random twists and turns of life. ("Is that a 
science experiment?" a child at the gallery suddenly asked out loud, when 
looking at a lead pendulum slowly revolving around a half-filled water glass.) 
A spirit of playfulness is one source of the engaging curiousness of Fox's art, 
in spite of its minimal visual pull. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplicity of materials put at the service of a secular spirit links Fox's 
work to such contemporaneous European movements as Arte Povera , in Italy, 
where he'd spent much of his artistically formative life, or the performance 
"actions" of Germany's Joseph Beuys. However, its quirky and demonstrative 
tenor is also the specifically American half of this expatriate artist's 
equation, with its down-home suggestion of the artist as committed hobbyist or 
exalted tinkerer. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing traditionally "professional" about Fox's approach -- no 
academic expertness that would otherwise separate the artist from the audience 
into a simple hierarchy of the skilled and the unskilled. For instance, having 
stretched two piano wires the length of the gallery, with one end attached to a 
sounding board, the artist has made a walk-in musical instrument that anyone 
can play simply by sliding the rosin-covered wire through clenched fingers. 
You're invited to pick up a chopstick and a sardine can, with which the 
instrument's low, resonating sound can be dramatically altered, and to play 
your own improvisational concert for time and space. 
</P>
<P>
 As with many other notable artists of his generation, Fox gives up a 
prevailing, popular view of art as the objectified manifestation of an interior 
self that is alienated from the world. Instead of a masculine, painterly 
tradition -- Rembrandt to Van Gogh to Pollock -- his quietly eccentric work 
simply attempts to externalize the mystery of consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is that effort more wittily in evidence than in a recorded and 
amplified soundtrack that echoes continuously through the exhibition's rooms. 
With the twisting labyrinth at Chartres here extrapolated into the pattern of a 
musical score, the low rumble of 11 cats purring in pure contentment improbably 
conjures the music of the spheres.

ONE FINAL KVETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sorry to grouse, but the Jan. 9 Sunday Calendar was a real drag with stories 
featuring those world-class malcontents Larry Kramer and Bill Bushnell. Now, 
it's my turn to kvetch. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer vilifies "Philadelphia" because it isn't the film he wants it to be. 
You're a writer, Lar, write your own damn AIDS movie! 
</P>
<P>
 And crybaby Billy blames everyone but himself for the failure of the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center. He's bitter because he and The Times' critics couldn't 
get L.A. theatergoers to succumb to his cesspool school of drama. Not to say 
LATC didn't do good work. As a subscriber, I saw several extraordinary 
productions there, including "Tartuffe," which I paid to see four times! 
</P>
<P>
 But too much of his season consisted of the "Bogeyman" ilk -- plays only a 
critic could love. How the hell could he possibly keep the public coming back 
when most of us hated a good deal of what he produced?

AIDS, HOLLYWOOD AND THE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I find myself in the highly unusual position of defending the movie industry's 
take on reality (which seems a little surreal in itself). As to Larry Kramer's 
assertion that "the very notion that a Main Line law firm would fire this guy 
(with AIDS) is ludicrously unbelievable," he should check out Cavagnuolo vs. 
Baker & McKenzie, recently settled in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, a Chicago-based law firm was ordered to pay the estate of one of 
its lawyers, who apparently was fired because he had AIDS, $500,000 for what 
was described as "mental anguish and humiliation," in addition to back pay. 
Officials described the law firm's behavior toward the lawyer as "devastatingly 
cruel." It was also noted that he had received a favorable job evaluation and 
overall positive performance marks just before his firing in May, 1986. Sound 
familiar? 
</P>
<P>
 MATTHEW KNIGHT 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I'm surprised by two of the reasons Kramer -- as a former Columbia Pictures 
executive, if for no other reason -- gives for disliking the film. 
</P>
<P>
 One, that it's "put together like a by-the-numbers painting." Surely the man 
knows that the overwhelming majority of "major" films made in this city are put 
together in a similar formulaic manner. 
</P>
<P>
 And two, his shock at the absence of any reference to Reagan, Bush and 
Clinton's inaction in the face of the AIDS epidemic. How many feature films can 
he name that take a living President or ex-President to task, by name, for 
anything significant? 
</P>
<P>
 For a screenwriter to do so in this city is to be labeled "political" (of the 
non-Rambo variety) and to be accused of being "preachy." 
</P>
<P>
 BILL BLUM 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood could have taken the budget for this boring disease-of-the-week 
courtroom drama and made six or seven good movies like "Longtime Companion" or 
even "Peter's Friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Hollywood debates in public how to cram this awful product down the 
public's throat. Here, take your medicine, it's good for you. Surely there is 
enough gay talent in Hollywood to make their own movies. Give the money to 
them! "Philadelphia" is like making "The Joy Luck Club" with white people. It 
just doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Westerns are casting Native Americans in Native American roles. 
Occasionally, Latino actors get cast in movies. So if you are going to make a 
gay movie, it only makes sense to have more gay people involved in making it. 
Tom Hanks, Antonio Banderas, Joanne Woodward and Denzel Washington are all 
well-meaning liberals. Unfortunately, that alone does not guarantee a good 
movie. Like other roads to hell, the road leading to the multiplex in Hell's 
Mall is paved with good intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 DICK CHESTER 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 Memo to Larry Kramer: The Holocaust, Vietnam and Watergate are just now 
"having their films," by which I guess you mean "being told in a more honest 
light." This, after more than 20 years for Vietnam and Watergate and more than 
50 for the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that these were all "events" that had a beginning and a perceived 
end. So look for a film in general release that deals openly and honestly with 
AIDS a generation or three after AIDS has been eradicated or become an accepted 
part of our culture and history -- which, at the earliest, will be sometime 
into the next century, if ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philadelphia" can only represent a knock on the door. Protest if you must, 
but don't get your hopes up too high. Welcome to America. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID MARTIN 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for publishing Kramer's remarks on "Philadelphia." Said film is an 
embarrassing and shameful cop-out. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if only someone would stand up and admit that "Schindler's List" is corny 
and poorly crafted. . . .

WHY THEY HATE (OR LOVE) LARRY KRAMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 L arry Kramer's commentary "Why I Hated 'Philadelphia' " (Jan. 9) produced an 
unusually heavy response from readers. A sample of their opinions: DID WE SEE 
THE SAME MOVIE? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm angry too, Larry -- at you for being so oblivious to what "Philadelphia" 
really is, what director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Ron Nyswaner have so 
lovingly created. The audience I was with, at the movie I saw, was moved beyond 
emotion. A woman was found in the restroom afterward, beyond consolation. The 
entire audience sat motionless for minutes after the final credits rolled in 
total silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Beckett's death was certainly not medically inaccurate. My brother would 
gladly dispute Kramer's inaccuracy, if only he hadn't died the very same way. 
</P>
<P>
 At fund-raising screenings of the movie, audiences have felt compelled to 
donate thousands of dollars to AIDS charities. That certainly goes a much 
longer way toward helping the cause than the misrepresentation of Kramer's 
unbelievable critique. 
</P>
<P>
 If his commentary misguides just one potential viewer to not see the film, 
Kramer has done his part at setting back the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his "fury is directed at the third silent President," I'd strongly 
recommend that Kramer wake up and direct his anger in that direction, and not 
at what is one of the most socially important and compassionate films ever 
made. 
</P>

 Kramer has overlooked the purpose of "Philadelphia." The film wasn't made to 
speak for him, or even to him. He is already so hyper-aware of the AIDS crisis, 
on a personal and political level, that it's doubtful a six-hour documentary 
could adequately address his anger and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philadelphia" was made to speak to a much broader audience, as yet untouched 
by AIDS and still anxious to ignore the subject. This it does exceedingly well, 
and many of the film's strengths become apparent only after one considers 
director Demme's narrative options and choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Of necessity, the target audience for "Philadelphia" is overwhelmingly 
heterosexual, and rather than provoke and agitate, Demme chose to involve them 
with familiar, mainstream characters and situations. This was in fact the same 
approach employed, with great success, by "An Early Frost" and "Longtime 
Companion." The bottom line is that a great many people are deeply and 
privately moved by the film. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, appreciated Tom Hanks' morally centered, ambitious, cultured, 
successful, monogamous and, yes, straight-acting character, especially the way 
he integrated his life into a supportive and accepting traditional family. 
There are a great many gay men who find a flagrantly sexual lifestyle 
self-destructive, and who are angry about being a minority within a minority. 
"Philadelphia" speaks to them as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In its own strange way, Kramer's pronouncement on "Philadelphia" is as 
arrogant and narrow as any made by the Catholic Legion of Decency during the 
1940s and '50s. I suspect his real complaint is that he wasn't approached to be 
consultant emeritus on the production. I'm curious to know who solicited his 
opinion, and why The Times ran it just as the film is opening wide.

<P>
 As a gay man living with AIDS, I was disgusted by Kramer's comments concerning 
"Philadelphia." As the self-anointed, all-knowing guru of AIDS activism, Kramer 
expects to be taken seriously by spewing forth nothing but mean-spirited 
diatribe. 
</P>
<P>
 His anger and resentment toward all who will not portray AIDS only as vile 
killer does nothing but a disservice to the brave individuals, like myself and 
those around the globe, who are struggling to come to grips with an early 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Demme rightfully made "Philadelphia" as "mainstream" because 
Americans don't need to be confronted with images of young men and women 
suffering as their bodies, and often their minds, waste away. 
</P>
<P>
 I live with AIDS every day, as does Kramer. But I live with hope for a better 
tomorrow. Kramer lives in an AIDS-induced chamber of horrors wherein everything 
and everyone is wrong -- except him. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kramer is indeed the world's angriest and saddest man. 
</P>
<P>
 SCOTT PIAZZA 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 As usual Kramer is the angriest dog in the world. That "Philadelphia" was 
produced at all is a miracle! 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, character development might leave something to be desired, but this 
occurs in many American movies, whether gay or straight. Let's face facts -- 
the name of the game in Hollywood is money. Maybe "Philadelphia" will lead to 
more movies addressing the issues of gays and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer ends his diatribe blaming Reagan, Bush and Clinton for AIDS. Every 
piece he writes ends with the same old chestnut. Larry: Get a life. It doesn't 
matter who is President. More money is being spent on AIDS research than on any 
disease in history. We are no closer to a cure or vaccine than five years ago. 
Maybe there will never be a cure or prevention. Who are you going to blame in 
10 years? 
</P>
<P>
 JOSEPH W. KRAATZ 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Kramer's commentary ranks right up there with his last snitty tantrum about 
Barbra Streisand's failure to produce his "masterwork," "The Normal Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that his problems with "Philadelphia" stem from the slightly 
unrealistic notion that one movie should serve as a vehicle to vent all of his 
venom toward our "silent" Presidents and somehow change the entire country's 
opinion about AIDS and the gay community. It's only a movie. It does not claim 
to be the definitive manifesto on AIDS or gays or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Kramer's desire to see Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks naked in bed, 
embracing and talking to each other in an adult fashion, has kept him from 
appreciating Jonathan Demme's courage in resisting such "fortune"-making 
banalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprising that Kramer, in his cliche-ridden diatribe, did not yearn to see a 
naked homosexual couple lighting up a pair of cigarettes at the end of a 
passionate sex scene. 
</P>
<P>
 NICK PACCIONE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I find great irony in the fact that Larry Kramer found that the story of one 
rich white gay male "doesn't bare any truthful resemblance to the life, world 
and universe" in which he lives. I was unaware that Hollywood was supposed to 
have been making "The Larry Kramer Story" -- that of another rich(er) white gay 
man with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of the world in which Kramer lives, I can certainly say that it 
bears no truthful resemblance to the world in which I live. If Kramer believes 
that the Americans With Disabilities Act has indeed ended all discrimination in 
the workplace on the basis of HIV, then he lives in an even greater fantasy 
world than the "ludicrously unbelievable" one he accuses Hollywood of creating. 
</P>
<P>
 I have read both of Kramer's autobiographical plays, and although I found them 
more dramatically and emotionally satisfying than "Philadelphia," they are 
again but one personal story that could easily be condensed into one film 
possibly titled "New York"! 
</P>
<P>
 As a gay man whose life has been transformed by HIV and who actually is from 
Philadelphia, I cannot say that the movie namesake of my hometown is my story, 
nor that of countless other men and women across the globe whose lives are 
affected by HIV. However, for Kramer to state that the film is "simply not good 
enough and I'd rather people not see it at all" is narcissism at its highest. 
</P>
<P>
 TONY ZIMBARDI 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles WAIT . . . HE'S RIGHT 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kramer is right on target. The makers of "Philadelphia" probably thought 
that the notion that Tom Hanks' character could not find able representation 
was a dramatic conceit upon which an ennobling story could be built. Wrong. 
This miserable plot device implies that we queers lack the will and talent to 
take care of our own. 
</P>
<P>
 These filmmakers were so busy trying to demonstrate that they had "heart" that 
they failed to notice that their entire plot rested on a homophobic absurdity.

 Bianchi is a lawyer and the author of "Out of the Studio" and "Extraordinary 
Friends."  
</P>
<P>
 What an honest, insightful and powerful commentary. Kramer's anger regarding 
how AIDS and being gay are so inadequately presented in the media, especially 
in "Philadelphia," is inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 And how fortunate that the gay community has a spokesman who challenges all of 
our attitudes about AIDS and being gay. I am also very impressed with The 
Times' willingness to print such a provocative, non-mainstream commentary. It 
is refreshing to read commentaries that provoke thought, enlighten and 
challenge us to go further with respect to our treatment of one another. 
</P>
<P>
 TERENCE RICE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In his blessedly loud and abrasive manner, Kramer has zeroed in on the 
lamentable deficiencies of Hollywood's long-delayed depiction of the AIDS 
crisis in "Philadelphia." In their nervous attempt to appease the widest 
audience possible, the filmmakers have created a message movie that ultimately 
speaks to no one -- a plea for tolerance so timid as to be insulting. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, hope that Kramer can keep up his shouting long enough to ensure 
that the film version of his AIDS play "The Normal Heart" retains its fury, 
outrage, love and passion -- aspects of humanity that when presented honestly 
and without apology speak to all peoples.

ON A CLEAR DAY, OPERATION DEEP FREEZE PILOTS CAN SEE NOWHERE; ANTARCTIC: U.S. 
NAVAL SUPPORT FORCE FLIERS MUST BE READY FOR ANYTHING FROM ZERO-VISIBILITY TO 
UNEXPECTED AND TERRIFYING VOLCANIC ERUPTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Sometimes it's like flying inside a giant Ping-pong ball. Pilots can't tell 
where sky ends and land begins. 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, they can see forever in the cleanest, driest, coldest air on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 With almost no warning, a clear day can become a zero-visibility white sheet. 
At all times, the pilots of Operation Deep Freeze, Antarctica's U.S. Naval 
Support Force, must be ready for anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place will take your life in a heartbeat if you don't pay attention," 
said Lt. Dennis L. Alston of Lake Charles, La., a helicopter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep Freeze is a "one-of-a-kind" flight service, boasts Capt. Jack Rector, its 
commander. The only passengers and cargo come from the National Science 
Foundation, the federal agency that oversees American research on this frozen 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
 The workhorses of the operation are two types of aircraft: seven 1960s-vintage 
ski-equipped, four-engine turboprop LC-130 Hercules transport planes and six 
twin-engine UH-1N Huey helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Flights are scheduled around the clock during austral summer -- winter in the 
Northern Hemisphere -- when the sun shines overhead 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of February, the last Hercs fly to Christchurch, New Zealand, 
abandoning McMurdo Station, the South Pole and their permanently iced runways 
to the dark austral winter. In midwinter, a lone U.S. Air Force C-141 
Starlifter drops long-awaited supplies by parachute to the few die-hards on the 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep Freeze's home base is McMurdo, the logistical center for Antarctica's 
largest scientific community. The skull and crossbones flies below the Stars 
and Stripes atop the helicopter hangar. The chopper pilots are nicknamed "ice 
pirates." A sign in the hangar humorously identifies them as "a subsidiary of 
Penguin Airlines." 
</P>
<P>
 Ice pirates like Lt. John E. Dell of Redding, Calif., routinely have 
terrifying tales to tell. His worst experience occurred in October 1992 while 
searching for an overdue Huey near Mount Erebus, a 12,448-foot active volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature was 5 degrees F. Winds of 30 to 60 knots whipped the snow to 
zero visibility. The search team had to land in conditions far beyond the 
safety margin. Dell found the bodies of two New Zealand scientists. Three men 
had died; two survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear I just aged another five years," the young pilot wrote his fiancee. 
"I had never seen a dead body before this accident. I wish I never do again." 
</P>
<P>
 Adverse weather has forced virtually every helicopter crew member at McMurdo 
to stay overnight at some field camp. All passengers on Hercs and choppers are 
weighed down by a bulky orange bag containing extra clothing. The aircraft 
carry survival gear and food. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way you can really train people for these conditions," Rector 
said. "It's probably fairly impressive how good the safety record has been." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1946 and 1992, aircraft accidents related to the U.S. Antarctic 
program have killed 35 people, according to National Science Foundation 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the LC-130 flights regularly shuttle equipment and passengers the 
2,377 miles between Christchurch and McMurdo, and the 840 miles between McMurdo 
and the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual mean temperature at the pole is minus 56 F. To prevent freezing, 
transport engines are never turned off during unloading, refueling and 
reloading. 
</P>
<P>
 More challenging to the Herc pilots are runs to distant scientific field 
camps. "I have landed the Herc in places where no man has ever set foot 
before," Rector tells National Geographic. 
</P>
<P>
 Blown snow can conceal the deep crevasses that split the Antarctic ice. To 
learn how to read subtle shadows, LC-130 pilots receive the same type of 
instruction as astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, this is the largest bush plane in the world," said Navy Lt. Cmdr. 
Guy Esten of Oxnard, Calif., a Hercules commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the helicopters, which rely mainly on visual flight rules, instrument 
landings aren't uncommon for the Hercs. In whiteouts, when ice and sky merge 
into one white mass, pilots can experience a kind of vertigo. "It's like a milk 
sea," Esten said. "You have to trust your instruments." 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopters and most of the Hercs are manned by crews from Point Mugu 
Naval Air Station in California. National guardsmen from Stratton Air Base in 
Glenville, N.Y., are at the controls of the other Hercs. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally the durable transports are used for emergency missions. The most 
recent was in late December, when a Norwegian adventurer fell to his death in a 
deep crevasse about 575 miles from the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
 When an LC-130 was unable to land, a de Havilland Twin Otter bush plane, flown 
by Canadian pilots under contract to the National Science Foundation, landed 
two miles away and evacuated three survivors to the pole. 
</P>
<P>
 In November 1992, Lt. Harrison Heysel had to fly across the continent to 
rescue a man who had broken his leg in a tractor accident at South Africa's 
research station. After landing in drifting snow where no plane had ever 
touched down, Heysel needed 10 tries to take off from the frozen terrain with 
the injured man. The battered plane required extensive repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The shorter-range, versatile Hueys ferry supplies and scientists to field 
camps closer to McMurdo. Flying them is one of the coveted assignments for Navy 
helicopter pilots, who typically serve three-year Antarctic tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the last frontier, a unique place on Earth," said one of the pilots, Lt. 
William W. Riley of New Orleans. "That's what really draws a lot of us down 
here. You have to become a better pilot to exist here."

A RIDE-ALONG FINDS OUT WHY THEY CALL IT A BEAT

<P>
 They promised a night of cruising, a night of excess, a night of crime. They 
came through on all three. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of State College police officers -- service revolvers strapped to their 
hips, 21-speed mountain bikes beneath them -- permitted me to pedal along one 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 8 p.m.: I arrive at station on 12-speed road bike. Officers Rob Keen, 29, and 
Brian Hosterman, 33, make me sign a waiver of liability for accidents, flat 
tires or gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 8:26: Keen radios he's about to set out with a ride-along. Hosterman corrects 
him: "Pedal-along." 
</P>
<P>
 8:40: We head to an apartment complex the hard way, down a 45-degree bank with 
a 6-inch curb at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 8:55: First crime of the night. Keen chases down a bicyclist without a 
headlight and writes him a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 9:05: Best news of the night so far. "We'll stay on level terrain now," Keen 
says after three miles. 
</P>
<P>
 9:14: So much for that. Hosterman chases a biker downhill, as Keen and I 
follow, but he turns out to have headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 9:49: To Penn State's fraternities. Illegally parked cars are like fish in a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 9:56: Keen gets driver with expired registration and inspection sticker. The 
driver slows, then takes off after Keen gears down. Hosterman pursues and pulls 
him over at the corner. "You looked right at me but didn't see me?" Keen asks 
the driver. The driver gets cited for both violations. 
</P>
<P>
 10:15: Girls mimic siren noises in alley as we ride by. 
</P>
<P>
 10:56: Approaching seven miles, and looking for lunch. Town's only doughnut 
shop doesn't have a bike rack, so we think of someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
 11:15: While Hosterman gets hoagies, Keen tickets man for having an open can 
of beer on the sidewalk in front of the sandwich shop. "You can't solve the 
drug problem, but you're busting me," the man complains. 
</P>
<P>
 Midnight: Lunch over. Hosterman doesn't know whether the ban against tobacco 
in police vehicles applies to bicycles. He puts a pinch between cheek and gum. 
</P>
<P>
 12:27 a.m.: Students continue to over-imbibe, and we encounter more rude 
people. "You can't swing a dead cat downtown and not hit a jerk on a Friday 
night," Hosterman observes. 
</P>
<P>
 12:50: Disturbance in park behind football coach Joe Paterno's house. Keen 
takes off, Hosterman follows. I catch up eventually. No one is found. 
(Tremendous guilt here. Did I slow them down?) We pass the 12-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
 1:32: Head to convenience store for refreshments. Keen gets hiccups after 
draining 16-ounce Hawaiian Punch in near-record time. 
</P>
<P>
 2:00: Bars close, pedestrian traffic increases. 
</P>
<P>
 2:36: Keen spots two people carrying a giant garbage can filled to the brim 
with cans of beer. They're only 20; they say they were asked to carry the beer 
from one fraternity party to another. Both fraternities deny it. 
</P>
<P>
 3:15: Back to station to count beer and prepare report. (It's 143 16-ounce 
cans of Busch.) 
</P>
<P>
 4:00: Shift over after 17 miles, a dozen citations for no lights on bicycles, 
a smattering of alcohol violations and scores of parking tickets. Hosterman 
heads home. Keen has newspaper delivery job in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't deliver papers by bike.

BICYCLE POLICE RIDE HIGH IN THE SADDLE, BUILD SUPPORT IN NEIGHBORHOODS; LAW 
ENFORCEMENT: SMALL TOWNS LIKE STATE COLLEGE, PA., AND BIG CITIES LIKE SAN 
FRANCISCO PUT OFFICERS ON BIKES WITH THREE MISSIONS -- COMMUNITY RELATIONS, 
CRIME DETERRENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.

<P>
 It's a little bit "Adam-12," a little bit Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more cities and towns are putting police officers on bicycles, 
letting them feel neighborhoods as though they're walking a beat, but giving 
them transportation in case they're needed to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flatfoots on bikes," said Carol Juth, a criminologist at Hope College in 
Holland, Mich. "They get to know a small area. Trust starts to build up. It has 
a very good psychological advantage for the neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also gives police a better sense of who belongs in the neighborhood and 
who doesn't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Small towns like State College and big cities like San Francisco have put 
officers on bicycles with three missions -- community relations, crime 
deterrence and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers buckled into a cruiser are handcuffed in their attempts to accomplish 
the first two. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that people see with cruisers are anonymous cops driving 
from Point A to Point B," said Capt. Tim Hettrich of the Potrero Station on San 
Francisco's south side. "When they see the bike officer, they all recognize, 
'That's our officer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "A foot patrol officer would go by a place one or two times a day. These 
officers are there 20 times a day," said Hettrich, who replaced all of his foot 
patrol officers after the community donated money to buy six bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco started its bike patrols in 1991; State College began its 
version last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Before them, Ft. Worth, Tex.; Seattle, and Tulsa, Okla., already had 
self-powered police vehicles. Las Vegas, Newark, N.J., and several cities in 
Pennsylvania already have them. Hilly Pittsburgh is considering the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The custom-fitted mountain bikes with police gear bolted to the frames are 
automatic conversation pieces -- and the summertime shorts help break down 
barriers too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children come up to them," Hettrich said of the pedaling officers. "There's 
none of this, 'You're the pig. You're the foe.' It's all, 'What kind of bike 
are you riding, officer?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dozen cyclists pulled over for not having headlights in a recent 
State College patrol -- a $74 offense -- more than half had questions about the 
officers' 21-speed bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hettrich has a small percentage of his officers assigned to bicycles -- six of 
118 -- and uses them only until 9 p.m. Busy streets and rough city 
neighborhoods make it unsafe for 24-hour bicycle patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 But in small towns, particularly college communities, it's natural for anyone 
to be on a bicycle anytime, since there are no major highways or high-crime 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can have them out all hours of the night," said Tom King, State College's 
police chief. "We want the officers to get out into a particular neighborhood 
-- particularly downtown and where the residential areas merge into downtown -- 
and do a good job interacting with the citizens and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's better than foot patrol," he said. "They're still accessible to 
the public, but they can cover more territory quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 And the mountain bikes cost less than $1,000. A fully equipped cruiser costs 
near $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Juth believes the burgeoning trend of police officers on bikes gives residents 
a sense that police are a part of the community and not just bystanders until 
something happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's there, he can talk to them and let them know what to watch for," she 
said. "If he's not, no one gets involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The bicycle officers haven't been relegated to chasing down wandering drunks 
or writing scores of traffic citations -- although that's what they often do. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco bike officers fight a crack cocaine problem some days and, on 
others, look for ticket scalpers at Candlestick Park. And State College bike 
officer Rob Keen on an overnight shift nabbed a drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "He saw a car go through a red light, caught him at the next red light and 
stopped him," King said. "He handled it like a regular violation." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, all except for the fact that no bicycle built for two is assigned to the 
department, Keen noted. Since no officer was free to bring a cruiser to take 
the 20-year-old driver to the hospital for a blood alcohol test, Keen left his 
bicycle with the suspect, walked to headquarters, picked up a car and finished 
the arrest himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The bikes' mobility provides some advantages, too, that you just can't get 
with a cruiser. A San Francisco officer nabbed three purse snatchers by 
relentlessly pursuing them on city streets, through an alley and around a fence 
until the youths tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "They finally said, 'We give up. We can't outrun you,' " Hettrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers find their quarry a little embarrassed, no matter the charge, 
since many of those stopped aren't used to seeing a self-powered police 
vehicle. 
</P>

GM RECALLING 120,000 TRUCKS THAT COULD EXPLODE IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. is recalling 120,000 new compact pickups that could 
explode in a side-impact crash. The company blamed short cuts taken by the 
supplier of a fuel system part for the danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's recall of the fast-selling new Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma trucks 
raises the question of whether aggressive price cuts demanded of suppliers are 
leaving GM stuck with shoddy parts and mediocre workmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 GM has said its crusade to save money has cut $4 billion from its $35-billion 
annual parts budget since the end of 1991, and it expects more savings this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident it (the defect) is not because of pricing, but because of a 
lack of communication," GM spokeswoman Linda Cook said. She refused to identify 
the supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 GM learned of the safety defect earlier this month from the National Highway 
Transportation Safety Administration, which performed a routine side-impact 
test on one of the trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said the fuel system survived the impact but leaked more fuel than 
allowable under the federal standard when it was rolled over. 
</P>
<P>
 NHTSA and GM traced the leak to a joint in the fuel system. The problem had 
not occurred when GM had a prototype of the truck certified earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook said the supplier switched the method of making the joint, using silver 
solder instead of a slower brazing method. Solder withstands less heat than 
brazing, Cook said. She did not say why the supplier changed its manufacturing 
method. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like a supplier made a miscalculation . . . maybe to save costs," 
said Joseph Phillippi, an analyst for Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 If cost was not the issue, the change in manufacturing process could have come 
from a team of GM efficiency experts that has visited thousands of suppliers to 
suggest manufacturing changes that can save time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon discovering the problem, GM halted production of the trucks at plants in 
Shreveport, La., and Linden, N.J., on Wednesday. Production resumed Thursday 
with parts that use the brazing process. 
</P>
<P>
 GM also told dealers to stop delivering the 1994 trucks to customers until 
repairs, which take less than an hour, could be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the 53,000 trucks already sold are being notified by mail of the 
recall. The other 67,000 trucks are on dealer lots or on their way to them. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual step, GM is providing free vehicles for some customers to use 
while their trucks are being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety of the compact trucks is not related to an ongoing federal 
investigation into the safety of GM's pre-1978 full-size pickups. NHTSA is 
expected to decide soon whether to order a recall of 6 million of those trucks 
or to rule that there is no defect and close the investigation.

RIVER FOLKS FIGHT HAZARDOUS WASTE PLANT; 'CANCER ALLEY': POOR RESIDENTS ALONG 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER SPURRED TO ACTION BY PLANS FOR NEW SOURCE OF TOXIC 
EMISSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GUY COATES, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To be poor is bad enough. To be forced to choke on industry's fumes while 
doing without is just too much, say residents fighting the creation of another 
chemical plant in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 With a sigh, 66-year-old carpenter LeRoy Alfred says it's no coincidence that 
the poor along the lower Mississippi River are also black. Their forefathers 
were the slaves who built the planters' mansions. Their descendants became 
sharecroppers who were slaves to the company store, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of the mansions still exist, draws for tourists. But the beauty of 
the once-lush stretch of the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New 
Orleans is marred by smokestacks and vast docking structures. Toxic emissions 
around Carville are more than three times the state average. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call us Cancer Alley now," Alfred said in an interview. "We got 100 
plants between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. There's 10 in a 6-mile area around 
my house." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of plans for an 11th plant finally stirred Alfred to ask the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to investigate possible civil rights 
violations. Supplemental Fuels Inc. is still in the state permitting process, 
hoping to operate a plant in nearby St. Gabriel that incinerates hazardous 
waste in a cement kiln. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has agreed to investigate whether certain plant 
locations in the nation violate the Civil Rights Act. In Mississippi, residents 
of Noxubee County, whose population is 68% black, hope to block a $100-million 
hazardous waste landfill and a cement kiln. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do they have to build them in poor, black communities?" Alfred asked. "If 
that's not racism, what is? We've just traded one form of slavery for another. 
We're no better off than our granddaddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we had food, our own gardens. Thirty years ago the chemical plants 
came. Our gardens die; we all cough and drink water we think is poisoned. We're 
poor and we can't move. On top of that, I don't think 25 black people in this 
community work in those chemical plants." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Louisiana's state committee for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights 
investigated complaints and said it could find no evidence that plants handling 
hazardous materials are located near minorities for racist reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, which has several minority members, did acknowledge that black 
communities are "disproportionately impacted" when permits are issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Borne, president of the Louisiana Chemical Assn., further acknowledged 
that the industry had not adequately addressed residents' "anxieties, fears and 
complaints." The industry is now establishing committees that include residents 
to discuss those fears "and work out any problems." 
</P>
<P>
 As for locating plants near black communities, Borne said, "Industry locates 
for business reasons only. We needed the natural gas, the Mississippi River for 
transportation and large acreage at a reasonable price. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, representing residents in both the 
Mississippi and Louisiana cases, does not allege intentional discrimination, 
but contends the states' permitting procedures lead to discriminatory results. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred said he knows only "that black folk are trapped in this polluted 
environment. The plant managers don't live in our communities. Most of the 
employees don't live in our communities. Thirty years ago they promised us 
prosperity. We're still poor. We still don't have enough jobs. That's the 
bottom line."

WORLD OF NATURE ALTERED UNDER BIOSPHERE 2 DOME; SCIENCE: PROTOTYPE SPACE COLONY 
IS EVOLVING. NOW THE QUESTION IS WHETHER TO TINKER -- OR JUST WATCH IT GROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One native ant lords over other insects. And the desert got so wet, it's 
shrubby with chaparral. Life in Biosphere 2, the domed prototype space colony, 
has changed in unexpected ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Now those who run it are debating how much they should tinker with it or 
whether they should let nature keep taking its course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we want to make drastic changes right now, or do we want to . . . see what 
happens?" said Linda Leigh, a botanist and member of the crew of four women and 
four men who in September ended a two-year stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Until earlier this month, she was also among initial crew members helping 
scientists take an inventory of how their small world changed in those two 
years, when the inhabitants grew most of their food and recycled most of their 
air, water and waste. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also deciding what modifications to make before a second crew is 
sealed in the three-acre complex for several months, probably starting next 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 The $150-million project owned by Space Biospheres Ventures, a private 
company, is intended to develop technology for a self-sustaining Earth-like 
environment in space. But a second objective is to use Biosphere 2 to study the 
environment of what the project refers to as Biosphere 1: Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the project -- paid for largely by Ft. Worth, Tex., billionaire 
entrepreneur Ed Bass -- say the complex is intended to operate for 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Biosphere 2 consists of several "biomes" meant to replicate various 
ecosystems: rain forest, ocean, desert, marsh, savanna and farm. 
</P>
<P>
 John Corliss, scientific director of the project in the desert north of 
Tucson, said changes could be expected as the sealed environment moves toward 
ecological equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
 While some species died out -- notably hummingbirds and many kinds of insects 
-- others, including corals in the miniature ocean, are reproducing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That things are reproducing answers questions about long-term 
sustainability," Corliss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Insect life is now dominated by an ant believed native to Arizona but never 
studied before, said Leigh, who helped survey plants in the rain forest. She 
left the project in mid-December to write a book and earn a doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
 The ants seem to be altering the rest of the insect population -- probably, 
Leigh said, by eating the adults and eggs of other bug species. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar phenomenon has been observed on islands, among them Hawaii, where 
ants were introduced and eventually controlled the evolution of other insects 
by eating their eggs and larvae, Leigh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very interesting. And the question is, where do we go from here?" she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the biome designed as a coastal fog desert, like that in Baja 
California. The desert turned out wetter than planned. Although this caused 
small succulent plants to die out, faster-growing, thorny shrubs thrived in 
their place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're deciding how we want to manage that situation, and there are different 
possibilities: transforming it, letting it develop the way it is, putting some 
new plants in," Corliss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some decisions about tinkering have already been made. Before the air lock 
closes on the next crew, banks of lights will be installed above the farm to 
boost production, and tamarisk trees will be planted in the desert to increase 
its diversity.

TREK TO ALASKA'S CAPITAL DAUNTING FOR LAWMAKERS; JUNEAU: GETTING THERE BY WAY 
OF AIR AND FERRY HOLDS ARCTIC CHILLS AND THRILLS FOR THOSE WHO ATTEMPT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual commute for Alaska legislators who insist on driving to the state 
capital is an Arctic wilderness adventure, two or three days of travel in 
subzero temperatures over icy, twisting roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel fortunate every time I make it down here," said state Rep. Ron Larson 
of Palmer. "You never know what could happen. You could drive into a ditch, you 
could get caught in snow in one of the passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Juneau, on the rugged coast of southeastern Alaska, is accessible only by 
plane or the state ferry. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstate lawmakers who wanted to have their cars during the annual 121-day 
legislative session in January had to drive the Alaska Highway into Canada's 
southwestern Yukon. From there, they took the Haines Highway south through the 
northwestern tip of British Columbia to Haines, Alaska, to catch a ferry for 
the five-hour sail to Juneau. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive from Anchorage, the state's largest city, is nearly 800 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Juneau's isolation has been an issue in attempts to move the capital to the 
Anchorage area. An initiative petition to move the capital to Wasilla, 
northeast of Anchorage, was submitted to state elections officials earlier this 
month.  
</P>
<P>
 Capital-move bills also are pending, but legislative leaders say they would 
rather avoid the issue this session and leave it to voters to decide through a 
ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 State Rep. Bill Hudson of Juneau says that even if the capital were moved 
north, it would still be relatively far from many Alaskans. And it would not be 
worth the economic havoc it would cause Juneau, where nearly 15% of the 
residents are state employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 January is perhaps the worst month for driving Alaska's roads. Daylight lasts 
only five or six hours, and temperatures in Alaska's interior and the Yukon can 
dip to 60 below. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are few and far between on the two-lane highways. A breakdown can 
prove fatal if a motorist is unprepared for the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Most lawmakers spend the night in remote Destruction Bay, Yukon, after an 
all-day drive from Anchorage or Fairbanks. They often travel in convoys for 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 State Rep. Mark Hanley of Anchorage and two legislative aides traveled in a 
three-car convoy. Despite the ice and snow, they drove a steady 70 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy," Hanley said. "These trips become an annual race to get to 
Destruction Bay before night. We're going 70 in the dark and snow. I mean, even 
on a four-lane highway in the daytime I don't go 70 miles an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a reason for hurrying to Destruction Bay. The only place to eat 
and sleep is the Talbot Arms roadhouse, and the kitchen closes at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There's camaraderie and fun along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice vacation for three days," said state Rep. Terry Martin of 
Anchorage. "You're away from everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers and aides swap road stories: Repairs at 40 below. Missing a crucial 
cutoff. Scraping ice from the windshield -- on the inside. Cars in a convoy 
blindly following the lead vehicle off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 For some lawmakers, the road from Destruction Bay through the Wrangell-St. 
Elias Pass to Haines is worth the dangers just for the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the most beautiful four hours of driving you could imagine," said state 
Rep. Cynthia Toohey of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who don't share her opinion, flying into Juneau in winter is no 
treat, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Bev Long, a state Senate aide, tried to fly to Juneau earlier this month and 
ended up going to Seattle, back to Anchorage and then to Sitka before her plane 
could land in Juneau.

COALITION A 'CONNECTION CENTER' FOR LAGUNA FIRE VICTIMS; AID: GROUP OFFERS 
COUNSELING, CLOTHING AND OTHER ESSENTIALS TO THOSE STILL STRUGGLING WITH 
DEVASTATING LOSS.

 Surrounded by piles of donated supplies at the Laguna Beach fire relief 
center, John Velasquez stood clutching a box of oatmeal and a sack of pasta to 
his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 minutes later, he was wrestling with a large box filled with goods, 
including bathroom tissue, a hair brush and a new sweater. Almost everything he 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably have to go to Sav-On for the sponge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez, whose home burned to the ground in the massive Oct. 27 fire, is one 
of the about 400 survivors who have signed up for support with the Laguna Fire 
Relief Coalition, a group formed after the blaze that destroyed 366 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Vowing to stick together for as long as needed, the coalition opened its new 
headquarters recently and soon afterward launched its first project of 1994 -- 
distributing identification cards to fire survivors that may help them get 
discounts from local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we realized the recovery was going to take more time and mean a lot more 
effort than feeding people and handing out food in the immediate aftermath, 
everyone involved realized we better dig in for the long haul," said Anita 
Mangels, director of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is composed of representatives from community, church, business and 
artist groups that began meeting at Laguna Presbyterian Church two days after 
the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of the devastating 1991 Oakland fire showed the demand for relief 
services did not peak until about seven months after the disaster, Mangels 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition secretary Doug Landrum said the Laguna group's food and supply 
distribution center in the Boat Canyon shopping center, which now serves as its 
headquarters, has become a regular stop for fire survivors who need continuing 
support 2 1/2 months after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some come in daily, others come in every three or four days," he said. "There 
are people who just have not gotten to the point where they feel like they can 
deal with all the issues they're going to have to deal with to recover their 
lives after the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the center helped distribute Christmas toys and about 90 turkeys, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez said stopping at the relief center fills a variety of needs for fire 
survivors like him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come here there's a sense of respect and a sense of courtesy. You 
feel welcome. . . . A lot of it is psychological. Coming here (is) much easier 
than going to a grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just the material things but the connection," he added. "It's become 
kind of a connection center." 
</P>
<P>
 Also stopping for supplies one day last week were Brenda Kirby and her 
husband, who lost their Mystic Hills home in the blaze and are renting an 
apartment in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been down here quite regularly, usually about once a week," she said. 
"We've been given T-shirts, food, clothing. At Christmas, they gave us turkey 
and ham. The people have been very generous and very wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition board member Joe Orsak, who is also this city's Chamber of Commerce 
president, hopes to involve all city businesses in the relief group's latest 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been soliciting our members and requesting they offer some kind of 
discount to fire victims if they shop in their stores," Orsak said. "We will be 
putting out a flyer to all the businesses asking they do this for our residents 
and our neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Sauls, an environmental consultant who helped found the coalition, said the 
group's "unmet needs committee" is evaluating how to help survivors in the 
future. "We're going to consider what those needs might be over the next 12 to 
24 months and direct the organization to provide those services." 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members say those who require ongoing help include victims who had 
no insurance or were underinsured, those who need temporary housing and those 
struggling to qualify for loans or grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have close to 400 families and individuals signed up for fire relief," 
Mangels said. "They may not need to go into facilities on a frequent basis, but 
they're certainly availing themselves of the services on a consistent basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the relief effort, professional counselors are continuing to 
staff a hot line for fire survivors. But counselor Judy Albert said calls have 
dwindled since just before the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones we get are really worthwhile and needy, but they're few and far 
between," she said. "It's a proud community, so it's hard to know if people are 
just getting good neighborhood support." The telephone number for both the 
coalition center and crisis counseling is (714) 376-9288. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, a nonprofit group which incorporated last month, also has in 
place a "survivor care program" under which volunteers "adopt" several families 
or individuals, making sure they know when new help becomes available and are 
kept abreast of information such as the dates of insurance seminars or 
deadlines for filing claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect that, judging by the Oakland experience, we will probably continue 
for about two years to provide various kinds of assistance," Landrum said. 
</P>
<P>
 While a federal grant helps provide the crisis counseling, Mangels said the 
group will hold fund-raisers and solicit grants to help pay for other services, 
which they estimate will cost about $800,000 in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire victims can also get help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
and the state's Office of Emergency Services, which has an office next door to 
the coalition's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most valuable things Velasquez has collected from the coalition's 
center were two philosophy books. Velasquez, a philosophy instructor at Rancho 
Santiago College in Santa Ana, said he lost all of his books in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I discovered one day, 'I have no books,' and I felt so impoverished," he 
said. "It's not just food for the body but food for the soul we get from a 
place like this."

WHAT WAS THIS MAN THINKING?; LUCIANO BENETTON'S CLOTHES AND ADS WORK IN EUROPE. 
BUT THE 'ZEN-TREPRENEUR' BEHIND A GLOBAL EMPIRE JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO GET 
AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A full moon nuzzles the blond villa where Luciano Benetton houses his company. 
The rooms are brightly lit, anticipating his return from Rome, an hour's flight 
to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finally arrives, close to 8 p.m., Benetton enters a whitewashed room, 
sits at the head of a vast, dark table and joins his hands on the surface. He 
seems benignly formal and remote, nodding politely to his press director and a 
translator, stopping far short of chitchat. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a chilly scene, perhaps understandably so. Benetton, after all, supplies 
600 administrative jobs for the towns around this villa, 4,400 more worldwide. 
He oversees a $2-billion global company and has gone beyond it into the fiery 
field of Italian politics, as a senator. 
</P>
<P>
 If he behaves like a head of state, setting a news conference tone when a 
casual conversation would do, seeming to dash from one hushed meeting to 
another, shadowed by a hovering staff, transported by private planes and 
chauffeured cars, he's entitled. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it makes an American wonder whether the remote aura of the man explains 
his company's loss of touch with its U.S. following. 
</P>
<P>
 The Benetton name is golden in Italy; it has been from the start. In 1965, 
Luciano Benetton was selling sweaters made by his sister, Guiliana. The 
business grew into a knitwear company, then a garment industry empire, with 
complete clothing collections for women, men and children. About 40% of sales 
come from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the United States, the company is in danger of a fate worse than 
failure, by fashion world standards. It is on the brink of becoming irrelevant. 
The label appeared here in 1979 and within five years Benetton had about 700 
U.S. stores. But lately the number has plunged to less than 200. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong is easy to see, in hindsight. Overexpansion and fashion styles 
that failed to keep up with the tastes of teen-agers, the primary U.S. 
customer, presented problems. And the company's licensing system, in which 
private investors own individual stores, has made it difficult for shoppers to 
purchase items in one spot and exchange them in another. The system works in 
Europe, but the company was slow to concede that it didn't work here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Benetton has been very stubborn," says New York apparel industry consultant 
Alan Millstein. "The attitude is that the world comes to them. They tell the 
world what to wear, the consumer doesn't tell them." 
</P>
<P>
 Stubborn is not the first word people who know Benetton, 58, use to describe 
him. But it does come up. His son Mauro says: "Ask me about my father, that is 
the most complicated question of all. He is a simple man who uses simple words. 
But you are not sure if he is saying what he means or thinking something 
different.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is always right, because he is Mr. Luciano Benetton," says Mauro, 31, 
marketing director for the company's U.S. operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luciano is a modern Medici," says Oliviero Toscani, a longtime friend and 
creator of the company's incendiary ad campaigns. "He goes on instinct. He'll 
say, 'Let's try it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude has led to the banning of some Benetton ads in Europe. One 
potent image shows an AIDS patient near death. Others depict a priest and nun 
kissing, an infant attached to the umbilical cord and body parts rubber-stamped 
HIV , like cuts of beef. Nowhere do clothes appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Toscani says such "shock advertising" aims to evoke an emotion, not a Benetton 
outfit. "Luciano doesn't ask me to sell product, he asks me to communicate." 
</P>
<P>
 If Toscani sees Benetton as a Medici-like arts patron, Peter Fresola, the 
company's director of communications for North America, views him as a showman: 
"He makes things happen, like P.T. Barnum." 
</P>
<P>
 Benetton opened a store in Moscow's Red Square soon after glasnost , in 1987. 
And he has moved into other territories largely untouched by European 
companies, among them Cuba, Korea, Argentina and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to find new markets," Benetton explains simply.  
</P>
<P>
 Sports are another of Benetton's passions, not one he turns to exclusively for 
pleasure. In the past four years, he has added 10 sporting goods firms to the 
company holdings, including Rollerblade skates, Prince tennis equipment and 
Nordica ski equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is a Zen-trepreneur," Fresola says, explaining Benetton's acquisitions. 
"Work and play are seamless. He makes no distinction between one and the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 That was once apparent in his dress. When Benetton visited his first Rodeo 
Drive shop in 1985, his long and shaggy hair was already streaked with silver. 
He wore khaki pants and said his favorite U.S. label was Timberland. He looked 
more like a backpacking college professor than a business tycoon. Riding the 
youth wave, dressed for the part, Benetton had been compared to a Boy Scout by 
the American press. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, a turtleneck sweater or a blazer and tie are his style. His hair 
is shorter and less shaggy. But youth still seems to be an obsession. "The 
average age of (Benetton) employees is 30 years," notes Marina Galanti, the 
company's press director. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrative office, built beside the villa in Ponzano, is a high-tech 
chalet where informality rules. Employees hang their jackets on a coat rack 
near the door. A frizzle-haired bicyclist rides into the office and nobody 
blinks. These young employees may have little contact with Benetton, but they 
know his reputation as a self-made man. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a family man in the Italian tradition. He was born in Treviso, where his 
father owned a bicycle shop. Luciano built his clothing business with his 
brothers Carlo, now general manager for North American operations; Gilberto, 
vice chairman of the company; and his sister, Guiliana, who oversees the 
fashion collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Mauro, another son, Alessandro, helps run the business. He is 
president of communications for Benetton Sportsystem, the athletic equipment 
division. Only Benetton's wife, now estranged, has stayed out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Luciano Benetton says he never envisioned his current life. As a boy living in 
this small town north of Venice, "I was to become a physician," he recalls. But 
he never went to college. "There is no planning."  
</P>
<P>
 It was the same when he entered the Italian senate in April, 1992. "Six months 
before, I hadn't thought of it," he says. "I was never interested in politics. 
But our country was in a bad situation, all Italians felt we had to do 
something. We couldn't just criticize." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time he stepped into his five-year term last spring, the Italian 
government was embroiled in a kickback scandal. Corporations had paid off 
public officials in exchange for construction contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Government work is erratic. Senators meet in Rome three times a day or three 
times a month, depending on the number of bills they need to vote on. Benetton 
says he doesn't plan to make a career of it: "I feel much more comfortable 
working in my own company." 
</P>
<P>
 If he has a vision for his government, it is to make Italy's business laws 
part of an international system. Promoting world harmony has long been the 
subtext of Benetton's company. Its slogan, United Colors of Benetton, suggests 
united cultures as well. "Without an understanding of people in various 
cultures, everything seems meaningless," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The words sound practical and logical, not particularly high-minded. Benetton 
may be a dreamer, but he comes across as a doer. Yet, he has been slow to do 
what it takes to perform well in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Benetton started out in America, the idea was, if you make it, here 
you've made it," Fresola says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Benetton suggests that his attitude has changed. "I am not disappointed," 
he says of the store closings in recent years. "We know the myth of the U.S. 
and it will last. Now, though, we believe 700 stores is too many, because of 
the number of strong cities in the U.S. Two-hundred-fifty stores is our goal."  
</P>
<P>
 "That's garbage," says Neil Thall, an Atlanta-based retail consultant. 
"America is still the largest consumer market in the world. Saying 'I'm not 
interested' (in growing) is sour grapes." 
</P>
<P>
 Thall attributes the company's drop in U.S. sales to the merchandise and the 
ad campaigns. "Benetton started out with a great concept and didn't evolve. And 
they got very preachy."  
</P>
<P>
 Others agree that Benetton missed the beat by holding tight to knit sweaters 
and T-shirts when that look gave way to baggy overalls and denim shirts in the 
mid-'80s. "The clothes had enormous snob appeal among the prep school set," 
industry consultant Millstein says. "But Guess replaced them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People still think of Benetton as a sweater store," he notes. "The problem 
with that is, the knitwear market has collapsed in the past five years. 
Consumers want more structured clothes, like you see at the Gap."  
</P>
<P>
 "When the look went to oversize, inner-city styles, Benetton was left in the 
dust," says Janet Orsi, a Los Angeles fashion publicist who worked for the 
company in the late '80s. "They were still making smaller, more fitted tops to 
wear under jackets." 
</P>
<P>
 The company has moved into structured clothing, but too often the styles seem 
matronly compared to the increasingly casual fashion tastes of American 
shoppers in the '90s. A recent Benetton store window in New York featured 
Alpine-themed riding skirts and fitted jackets. Even by East Coast standards, 
outfits looked overly coordinated, too fitted and formal. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Rossetto, who opened a Benetton shop in Beverly Hills last fall, says 
the company is making fashion changes. It has shifted its target audience from 
teen-agers to working women. A collection of looser structured styles in 
lighter-weight fabrics and more resort-friendly colors is in the works. The 
line is geared toward the Sunbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, prices have dropped 15% to 20%. Jackets sell for about $225. 
Sweaters, $45 to $90, account for 50% of business in the West, says Rossetto, 
who oversees 37 stores as the company's West Coast agent. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major concession to the American market, Benetton has started to feature 
clothing in its ads. "Our ads confused people who didn't recognize the product 
behind them," Mauro Benetton says. "Americans don't know Benetton as well as 
European consumers do." 
</P>
<P>
 The company also relaxed its return policy to move it closer in line with U.S. 
department stores. Sales increased about 8% nationally in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the company's overhaul) will work," says Bijan Khezri, who owned the 
first Rodeo Drive shop and several other L.A. sites, but closed them when the 
recession took hold. "But it will be a while before they can regain what they 
had in the mid-'80s." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say those times may never come again. "At this point, the best they can 
hope for is a continued paring down, until there are a small number of stores 
in a small number of cities," Millstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Luciano Benetton's interests lie closer to home. He plans to 
open a school in Ponzano for fashion design, advertising, media and technology. 
Students will receive scholarships for three- to six-month stays. Last summer, 
Benetton wrote to Fidel Castro, Cuba's president, asking him to direct the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "A serious offer, yes," Benetton says. "It could lead to several solutions. It 
might get Castro out of Cuba, for one thing."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: OFFERING AN EXIT FOR WOMEN ON A DEAD-END STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophia used to work Sepulveda Boulevard. She says she has been arrested half a 
dozen times, beaten by tricks, handcuffed by a customer posing as a cop. At 19, 
this young woman with luminous brown eyes and dark hair that falls in corkscrew 
curls around her face seems tough, but the facade is as fragile as porcelain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I have a little girl inside of me saying, 'I can't do this anymore,' 
" says Sophia, who grew up in a small Northern California town. "I want to be a 
normal person. I want to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 One morning last November, she says, after spending the night with a trick who 
told her that she just didn't belong on the streets, something clicked. She 
sneaked away from her pimp and took a cab to a homeless women's shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the shelter, she found the Rev. Ann Hayman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayman is a Presbyterian cleric -- her ministry is the Mary Magdalene Project, 
a home for women ready to come in off the streets. She becomes a surrogate 
mother to the former prostitutes, who spend up to two years in the comfortable 
four-bedroom Reseda house. Women are required to attend therapy, to learn a job 
skill that will allow them to sustain themselves when they leave, to work at 
least part-time and to save 80% of what they earn. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out, though, that two years in the home is not always enough to 
prepare for life in the straight world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become obvious to us in the last several years that the women who leave 
here continue to need some support from us," says Judy Ames, the project's 
executive director. She and Hayman hope to purchase an apartment complex 
nearby, a place where project graduates can make a smoother transition, where 
rents will be set according to their ability to pay. Ames estimates the new 
place will cost $1 million; $300,000 of that has been raised and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake hit the Reseda house hard -- windows blew out, pipes snapped, 
the water heater jumped off its base. Hayman was badly bruised when a bookcase 
fell on her as she lay in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Ames and project volunteers will spend the foreseeable future 
rustling up donations and labor to repair the house, which is privately funded 
and costs about $350,000 a year to run. 
</P>
<P>
 In 13 years, Hayman reckons, nearly 130 women have turned turn their lives 
around with the Mary Magdalene Project's help. Hayman knows, she says, because 
they stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames says that even the ones who return to drugs and alcohol don't usually 
return to prostitution: "As Ann likes to say, 'We've ruined them for the 
streets.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange of sex for money resonates deeply and uncomfortably in our 
society -- witness the extraordinary over-coverage last year of Heidi Fleiss, 
alleged mother hen to a flock of high-priced call girls. With that kind of 
story making headlines -- women servicing politicians and entertainers for 
$1,500 a night -- it's easy to forget the plight of the those who walk the 
streets, risking health, safety and arrest to earn money they will never see, 
money that enriches only their pimps. 
</P>
<P>
 How do they get there? 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our women have been victims of child abuse and most of them victims of 
incest," Ames says. "Not everyone abused as a child becomes a prostitute, but 
every prostitute has been abused as a child." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be hard to verify, but certain other characteristics are not. For 
instance, Ames says, most of the project's clients are in their mid-20s and 
have been usually been working the streets for about 10 years. More than half 
have drug and alcohol problems. Probably 70% have children they have no claim 
to anymore. All are burned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them have tried marriage to get out, but they end up marrying tricks 
and this does not make for what I would call healthy, wholesome marriages," 
Hayman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue, really, is low self-esteem. Prostitution deals more with women's 
dependency issues than anything else. We live in a culture that says if you 
don't have men in your life, you're nothing, and some of us have seen that 
modeled by our mothers in ways that just kind of take your breath away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story Sophia tells, Hayman says, is similar to the ones she hears every 
day from women who come to her for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophia's parents divorced when she was 8. She says she remembers an uncle 
molesting her when she was 11 or 12. The following year, she says, she 
discovered sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real sexually active my freshman year in high school," she says. "We 
used to hang around a park that was near a bar. A man just approached me one 
day about turning tricks. I was 14 or 15. I ended up going with him, he gave me 
$50. My friends didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, she says, she quit school and began fighting with her mother, even 
once pulling a knife on her. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she moved in with her father and went back to school. But they fought, 
and eventually she moved out. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend, she says, introduced her to a pimp in Oakland. Homeless, she moved 
in with the pimp's sister, she says, who shared the same line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, she says, she met the pimp who brought her to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had seen him around. He has a Rolls-Royce, a Cadillac. I was really 
attracted to him. If I ever choose a pimp, I thought, that's who I'm choosing. 
I spent a whole day with him and I was, like, instantly in love. He never 
bad-mouthed me or hit me. I went to work for him in Oakland, on San Pablo 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "He bought me all these clothes. . . . Things were cool. Then he got in some 
trouble, and some guys were trying to shoot us and stuff, so we had to fly to 
Van Nuys." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Sophia says, she has a hard time liking herself, a hard time 
thinking of herself as a good person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am violent and aggressive," she says. "There is just a lot of anger." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Sophia tells me her main problem is that she is "addicted to 
this dream of being in love forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The next two years will be long and scary for this young woman, as she tries 
to face herself in therapy, get a high school diploma and settle on a new 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets still hold an allure for her that she recognizes and resists. But 
if she hangs on, she may find what she seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, maybe, she'll look in the mirror and find the love that she craves.

UP ALL NIGHT / HILLARY JOHNSON: JAZZ SETS TONE FOR CITY'S 'RENAISSANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sika, owner of Bak-Tu-Jua gallery and a regular at 5th Street Dick's Coffee 
Co., declares: "Leimert Park is the epicenter of the new renaissance in Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance is a word heard often among the sharp crowd at 5th Street Dick's, 
by night the hub of this bustling South Los Angeles neighborhood. It's a place 
where neighbors and a growing number of in-the-know Angelenos gather for 
coffee, conversation and inspired jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded on a shoestring 18 months ago by Richard Fulton, 5th Street Dick's is 
a growing phenomenon whose word-of-mouth reputation has spread across the 
country through musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I've been thinking about for 20 years," Fulton says. "Music, I 
feel, knits the community together and jazz knits it together with 
intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 The repertoire at 5th Street Dick's has expanded to include weekly sessions of 
poetry, comedy and the blues, as well as a regular conversational menu of 
passion, politics and culture. It's the kind of inspired creative venue without 
which no city can claim to be cosmopolitan. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd, like the music, is deeply stylish. Patrons turn up in everything 
from mud-cloth jackets to fur coats and Dickensian tweed knickers -- and not a 
fashion victim among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here four or five nights a week. I've swallowed it hook, line and 
sinker," says Lissa Washington, an elementary schoolteacher. "Lots of people 
are here just kicking it, whether they're doing their homework or having an 
intellectual discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's mother, Val Luchetti, is just as enthusiastic. "People come here 
for spiritual nourishment. And I never have to worry about Lissa. They always 
see her out to her car at the end of the evening." 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in a tall, narrow space with a faux cloud ceiling, Dick's serves 
lasagna, cakes and coffee downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the coffee, Washington says: "The Kenya AA will take you through the 
all-night jam session very well." 
</P>
<P>
 For $5, you can take your cup and climb to a second-floor loft where serious 
musicians play to a seriously attentive audience, often until 5 or 6 a.m. A 
sign on the stairs advises: "Support jazz and jazz players. This is your music. 
Only you can let somebody else own it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone who turns up at 5th Street Dick's strolls around the corner to 
the World Stage on Degnan Boulevard. It serves no food or drinks -- just music, 
thank you. The spartan 50-seat concert space is more like a storefront church 
than a boite.  
</P>
<P>
 For a $5 cover, this is the place for no-nonsense jazz without distractions. 
And you need not leave the kids at home. On a recent weekend, the Richard Davis 
Quintet played to an audience that included Davis' 8-year-old son, Richard Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saturday afternoon jam session, hosted by the owner, drummer Bill Higgins, 
regularly brings out local talent as well as big-name artists in town to 
perform at more glamorous mainstream clubs, such as Catalina and the Bel Age 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Between sets, the musicians take the time to shake hands and ask the audience 
members if they're enjoying the show. Then everyone strolls over to 5th Street 
Dick's to refuel on Kenya AA. 
</P>

 In Death Valley, the sand ripples at sunset like molten bronze and copper 
against a backdrop of rough and craggy verdigris with not a human in sight. 
Just the magically uniform tracks of tiny creatures scaling a polished dune.In 
moments the desert wind will have repainted the scene, never to repeat the same 
pattern. Such images suggest a version of that age-old question of the tree in 
the forest. When it falls, does it make a sound if there is no ear to hear it? 
In this case, is it beautiful if no eye beholds it? Perhaps it was just for 
God's enjoyment and left for us ordinary folk to wonder. It is a celebration of 
life in a valley called Death.

CLEANLINESS A 'DARK LEGACY' MOTHERS PASS ON TO DAUGHTERS; FAMILY: THE ATTITUDES

 The allergist said dust mites were causing asthma in my son. And then he 
showed me a picture of a dust mite. 
</P>
<P>
 Big picture. Huge picture. The dust mite that ate New York City. Then he told 
me that they are everywhere. Millions of them. You can't see them. And they 
live off flakes of your dead skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 He's talking about furnace filters and pillow covers, and wrapping mattresses 
in plastic and pulling up the carpet and stripping the child's room of 
everything, all his models and his sports trophies and his skull from a dead 
fox. All the dust catchers. All the dust mite havens. 
</P>
<P>
 He's talking about washing walls and vacuuming three times a week, and about 
washing the bedclothes once a week in very hot water. But I have stopped 
listening. 
</P>
<P>
 All I can hear is this: My son's ability to breathe is directly related to my 
ability to clean. Talk about pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 For women, cleanliness has nothing to do with godliness. It is a dark legacy 
from our mothers. Either they cleaned or they didn't, but their attitudes and 
their compulsions have been passed on to us, have marked us. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us are clean freaks who hide our midnight scrubbing fanaticisms from 
even our closest friends, breezily dismissing the subject with an offhand 
gesture and a lie. "My kitchen floor? The only way you could eat off of it is 
if you were hungry for something the kids dropped." 
</P>
<P>
 Others of us couldn't care less. Fingerprints on every surface. The bedrooms 
and the bathrooms are chaos. The kitchen always looks as if it is in the middle 
of holiday meal preparation. "But she's great with those kids, isn't she?" 
others say about her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still others of us want the house to be clean -- we just don't want to do it. 
Cleaning services are a booming business, but the cost is more than financial. 
A woman gives up part of her privacy when she hires someone to come in and see 
her dirt. And she is admitting that she can't do it all. 
</P>
<P>
 One friend nearly had a breakdown trying to pick up after her kids the day 
before the cleaners came. She finally fired them after a tearful confession to 
her husband that she'd rather do it herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me a long time to get comfortable with the fact that they changed my 
bed," another friend said. "And then my mother would come over, give everything 
the white-glove test, and say she couldn't believe I was actually paying 
someone to do this bad a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Our mothers. They are the source of this. I scrub the backs of dressers and 
headboards because my mother did. My sister vacuums her mattresses and box 
springs because my mother did. "I can smell the dust when I'm sleeping," she 
used to say, scarring us both. 
</P>
<P>
 Another friend awoke to find her visiting -- and insomniac -- mother Windexing 
the face of the alarm clock beside her bed. Another had a grandmother who cut a 
cardboard template so she could polish the picture hangers without getting the 
polish on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 I bleach my kitchen counters every week to kill germs. When my sister's 
children were toddlers, she used to wash her kitchen floor -- by hand -- after 
every meal. Another sister responded one day to the stress of two small 
children and a return to college by ripping up her dining room carpet and 
throwing it away so she could clean under it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women who have small children often do their housework at night. "No point 
doing it during the day," a friend said, "the kids tear up as fast as you clean 
up." So she would start at 7 p.m. and clean until midnight. "Then I'd go to 
sleep happy, knowing my house was clean for at least seven straight hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Women who work clean at night, too. How many of us are starting loads of wash 
at 10 p.m? A friend can be found scrubbing her toilet when the rest of America 
is getting ready for Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take the baby out of here," she said, scolding her husband as she knelt on 
the bathroom floor. "I don't want her to ever see me like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanliness. What a trap. Women are driven to their knees -- or to pay through 
their noses -- for a state of grace that lasts only until the kids get home 
from school. And we know that no child ever loved her mother more just because 
the box springs were vacuumed regularly. What dark compulsion are we imprinting 
on our daughters? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know. I can't even think about that now. There are dust mites 
everywhere and I have to kill them.

HANDS-ON HOUSE HUNTING; COMPUTER REPLACING 'THE BOOK' AS TOOL TO FIND RIGHT 
HOME

 Ain't technology grand? Never grander than in the new, computerized MLS 
(multiple list ing service) systems that are making their way into real estate 
offices across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a house? Got your list of requirements? Price range, area, number 
of bedrooms? Maybe you want to be in a specific school's boundaries. Or you 
insist on hardwood floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Just sit down in front of your real estate agent's computer screen and you're 
just a few keystrokes away from seeing every property on the market that meets 
your needs. A complete listing, even a color photo, a map, the tax records. 
</P>
<P>
 Ain't technology grand? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you have your heart set on a Monterey Colonial? Or something high-tech? 
Easy. Hit a few keys. And you'd like a covered patio, a breakfast room, a 
detached garage, a city view? Voila! The matches appear. 
</P>
<P>
 MLS is the centralized listing service run by local and regional realty boards 
to notify agents of all properties for sale (except those offered by private 
parties). The computerization of real estate information began around 1980, 
gathering momentum as data bases expanded, modems got faster and photo 
capabilities were incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
 The MLS for the Westside (or CLAW, for Combined Los Angeles-Westside, which 
includes the realty boards of Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Malibu, 
Culver City and the Southwest area) uses the Boris Systems computer program. 
</P>
<P>
 Boris has almost 300 ways to categorize a listing: 26 architectural styles, 
eight flooring types, 13 kinds of fireplaces, 17 possible parking situations, 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't like old houses? Tell Boris to show you only homes built after 1980. Or 
looking for a small condo complex? Instruct Boris to show you complexes with 
less than 10 units. Or, if you'd rather have a high-rise condo, that's fine 
with Boris. It's got a list of them too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you've got an unusual request, something beyond the basic 300 categories, 
shady landscaping, for example, type in the key words and Boris will search the 
remarks section of every listing. If there's any house on the market with lots 
of shade trees (that the agent has bothered to note, of course), you'll know in 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The old way -- and it took more than seconds -- was to consult "the book." The 
MLS for each area has always published a thick book listing all the properties 
on the market. Most MLS's still publish their books -- usually every two weeks 
(although some parts of Orange County have dropped the book and are solely on 
computer) -- with small, fuzzy black-and-white pictures, 12 to a page. For 
example, the Westside of Los Angeles is in one book, 18,000-20,000 listings 
arranged into 30 areas and then broken down by price. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the book, the only way to find all the homes with hardwood floors, a 
fireplace in the master bedroom or a three-car garage is to scan the fine print 
page after page. And then keep track of them with little bits of paper wedged 
in the right pages. Doesn't it sound archaic? 
</P>
<P>
 Some agents are clinging to the book, however, refusing to learn on the 
computer. But Ron Lepp, of Beaumont/Lepp Realty in Sherman Oaks and Beverly 
Hills, thinks "the book is a thing of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Most agents do keep the books in their cars for quick reference out in the 
field. But even quicker, the computer data can be downloaded to a palm-top, the 
newest rage among computer-savvy agents. Drive by a new "For Sale" sign, punch 
up the address and the latest info appears on the tiny screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents can also access the systems on their home computers. This greater 
accessibility at home and at every office desk (rather than one terminal for an 
entire office) is "the most dramatic change in the Greater South Bay MLS," 
according to Vince DeLuca of Re/Max Realty in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time the book comes out, it's already outdated," said Dennis Briley, 
general manager of CLAW's Boris system. Miss the deadline by a day and 
information an agent is using could be almost a month old. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The computer is updated 24 hours a day, every day, with three times the 
information that's given in the book. New listings, price reductions 
areavailable almost instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a new listing at 4 one afternoon, it was in the computer by 5 and I had 
an offer by 6," said Barbara Gardner, a broker with Coldwell Banker in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's more: 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you're interested in buying a condo in Century Hill in Century City. 
You've seen a unit you like but don't know what to offer. An agent can hit a 
few keys and a list of every condo in Century Hill that's been offered for sale 
in the past six months appears on the screen: 28 units for sale, sold or in 
escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanning the screen you see how many bedrooms, baths, the asking price, the 
selling price. Agents could always do this comparative market analysis by hand 
but this is on the screen instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 And more: 
</P>
<P>
 Say you want to make an offer on a house with an asking price of $325,000. 
It's a 40-year-old house. Maybe the owners have paid off the mortgage and would 
be willing to take a low offer. Maybe not. In today's market, who knows? Hit a 
few keys and the financial status fills the screen. You'll see what's owed and 
to whom. It may show you that the owners refinanced two years ago and owe 
$300,000 on the property. No way they'll take $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it might seem unfair for buyers to know so much about sellers' 
finances. The information was always available ("You had to order it," said 
Gardner) but not nearly so accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tells you where the owner is coming from," Gardner said. It eliminates a 
lot of time-wasting, low-ball offers and therefore helps the seller as well as 
the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most agents are using the computerized MLS programs as a preparation tool, 
rather than sitting every client down in front of the screens. Before meeting 
prospective sellers, they call up comparable listings in the neighborhood, 
print up the listings (photos and all) in a booklet. Working with a prospective 
buyer, they punch in the client's specifications and come up with a booklet of 
hot prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gardner insists that the computer is no substitute for an agent who is 
familiar with area properties, she admits that "it makes agents look more 
efficient, much more articulate." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Lepp had one day to work with a buyer here from Sydney, Australia, who 
wanted to see small residential income property. Lepp punched the parameters 
into the computer: Beverly Hills, less than six units and the price range. 
"Sometimes you get three or four matches, sometimes you get 20." 
</P>
<P>
 When he met the client for breakfast, Lepp presented a slick booklet of every 
available property. The client eliminated some by photo and they spent the day 
inspecting the serious possibilities. No wasted effort for broker or buyer. "It 
made us look really organized." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sampling of what a few keystrokes can do on these new computer 
systems: 
</P>
<P>
 -- See a listing of all 579 condos currently for sale in Beverly Hills. A few 
more strokes and you can arrange them by street, rearrange them by price, then 
by number of bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Check the latest mortgage rates, which are updated daily by lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Figure out probable closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- See a list of all foreclosed properties. The new Federal Information 
Network software offers information that previously was available only by going 
from agency to agency for lists of their foreclosed properties. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Check the tax records for square footage and lot size, information 
typically left out of listings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- See the ownership history of a property, not just the current owner. It may 
reveal that the property has sold and resold five times in 10 years -- or 
offered for sale and then withdrawn several times. 
</P>
<P>
 How soon this dazzling technology comes to your neighborhood depends on your 
local multiple listing service. Some are on the bandwagon, some are watching 
from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are four major software vendors in the United States. Boris and PRC 
Realty System have pretty much carved up the Southland. There are also smaller 
companies that produce auxiliary software such as maps that show nearby 
earthquake fault lines and flood zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors has had its computerized system up 
and running for some time but they won't have photos until February. When they 
do, brokers will be permitted to include up to 10 photos per property, allowing 
potential buyers to "walk through" a house or condo. (CLAW uses only one photo 
per property.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Greater South Bay MLS is in the process of upgrading the transmission 
speed and clarity of photos. Most real estate offices have or will have color 
monitors, but use black-and-white printers. 
</P>
<P>
 Multi-Regional MLS, whose area covers much of north and northeast Los Angeles, 
hasn't made a decision yet. "We're still talking to board members to find out 
what they want," said Gary Stein, executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomas Guide (and other map-book systems) are being incorporated into many 
computer systems. A map page appears on the screen; the property you're 
interested in is noted. The program can then point out where nearby parks, 
schools, churches or synagogues, etc., are located. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new software program: 
</P>
<P>
 Say you'd like to live in a very specific area. Not just Mar Vista but that 
hill section of Mar Vista just east of Santa Monica Airport. With a little 
Etch-A-Sketch technique you will be able to outline that area on the screen map 
and all the properties for sale in that area will appear on a list on the 
screen. Then you can highlight the hot prospects, look at the photos, read all 
the information. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, how did people ever sell houses before computers?

REAL ESTATE AND THE LAW; ATTORNEY KNOWINGLY SELLS DEFECTIVE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R.J.B., Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald and Patricia filed for divorce. When they couldn't agree on how to sell 
their house, the court appointed Joel, an attorney, to act as a receiver to 
sell the house. He listed the house for sale with a realtor at $539,500, then 
reduced the price to $499,500, and then to $469,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel accepted an offer of $355,000 from Timothy whose purchase offer was 
contingent upon a satisfactory professional inspection. But the inspector found 
structural defects, including a defective beam, so Timothy canceled his 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Victor and Heidi made a $350,000 purchase offer, which Joel accepted, 
contingent upon a professional inspection. However, their inspector didn't 
mention the defective beam and they proceeded with the purchase. However, soon 
after closing the sale and moving into the house several structural defects 
became obvious, including a sagging and progressively collapsing roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyers sued Joel for intentional misrepresentation, intentional 
concealment of material facts, negligent misrepresentation and attorney 
malpractice. But he argued he has judicial immunity, the same as a judge, since 
he was appointed by the court to sell the house. 
</P>
<P>
 If you were the judge, would you rule attorney Joel has judicial immunity from 
liability and the lawsuit against him should be dismissed? 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said no. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two possible viewpoints, the judge began. One is to treat attorney 
Joel as a representative of the sellers and the other is to view him as a 
court-appointed administrator with judicial immunity, the judge explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Joel was acting like a receiver for the sale of the house, the judge 
continued, he became an alter-ego for the disputing sellers. Joel was paid for 
his services but he failed to inform the buyers of defects in the house of 
which he was aware from the first inspection, the judge emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 The high standards governing court-appointed receivers in the sale of property 
should be applied to Joel, the judge ruled. Therefore, he does not have 
judicial immunity and is liable if he breached his duty to disclose the house's 
defects to the buyers, the judge concluded.

FIRST-TIME BUYERS ACCOUNT FOR MAJORITY OF HOME SALES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First-time buyers accounted for 57.4% of home purchases in the Los Angeles 
area last year, according to Chicago Title's 18th annual survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Los Angeles statistics from the study, "Who's Buying Homes in America," 
which samples 18 metropolitan areas across the country: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never-married single buyers in Los Angeles accounted for 36.2% of 
first-time purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The median L.A. home price for first-time buyers declined from $183,600 in 
1992 to $174,200 last year. For all L.A. buyers, the average home price fell 7% 
to $235,700 in 1993 from $253,200. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Average monthly mortgage payment in Los Angeles was $1,335, the highest in 
the nation, but down significantly from $1,611 in 1992. The nation's lowest 
average monthly mortgage payment was $659 in Cleveland. Average monthly 
mortgage payments for all U.S. buyers dropped to $1,015 from $1,064 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 36.4% of Los Angeles buyers chose adjustable-rate mortgages, outpacing the 
national average of 22.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 32.8 years of age, first-time buyers in Los Angeles were slightly older 
than the national average, 31.6 years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 87.5% of L.A. home buyers were two-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Angeles buyers looked at an average of 13.3 homes before making a 
purchase, fewer than the 14.4 homes buyers viewed nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The median income of Los Angeles home buyers declined to $61,800 from 
$67,700. Nationally, the median household income of home purchasers climbed in 
1993 to $60,800 from $58,800 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found that home sales in the United States grew to 5.1 million 
units in 1993, just 5% below the all-time record high of 1978.

POINTERS ON WHAT TO LOOK FOR WHEN SELECTING THE RIGHT LENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN JAMES MARTIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Distributed by Universal Press 
Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the industry, it's known as the "front office from hell." It's the mortgage 
company with the rude receptionist and the loan officers who couldn't care 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What you want are mortgage people who will love your loan," says Stuart 
Tyrie, an office manager with GMAC Mortgage, the nationwide lender. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't buy your black Cadillac Seville from a salesperson who treated 
you badly. And your mortgage involves a lot more money than a Cadillac," Tyrie 
observes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage specialists say there are many reasons to exercise caution in 
selecting a lender -- whether for a home purchase or refinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of horror stories out there about bad loan servicing," notes 
Paul Havemann, a vice president at HSH Associates, a New Jersey firm that 
tracks mortgage rates for consumers throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the selection of a mortgage lender all the more difficult is that 
the several waves of refinancing booms have brought a sudden influx of 
newcomers to the field who are trying to take advantage of the strong demand 
for home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the upstart firms have been created by seasoned loan officers who spun 
off from larger companies, but others are much greener. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mistake to shop for a mortgage lender on the basis of rates alone. You 
have to think about service too," GMAC's Tyrie says. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are pointers on how to pick the right lender: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Look to real estate agents for the names of trustworthy lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every agent knows a couple of lenders who are very reliable and won't run you 
down the road," says Jack Bateman, who sells homes through the Re/Max realty 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that real estate agents count on dependable lenders or their 
deals won't go through. And a lost deal means a lost commission for the agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing you want is a cockamamie story from the lender about why he 
can't get the papers to the closing table in time," Bateman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are real estate agents a good source of referrals, but using an 
agent's name can give you more clout with a lender. That's because a lender 
knows the agent can be a source of repeat business. Chances are, he'll try to 
please customers the agents send his way. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have the power of numbers working for you. A lender wants to keep his 
referral base going," Tyrie says. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pick the brains of friends who have taken out a mortgage lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Probing questions about how a lender handled past loan applications can help 
you select the right firm, mortgage specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
 GMAC's Tyrie suggests you pose questions such as these: Did the lender fulfill 
his promise on how fast the loan would be processed? Did he stand by his rate 
and point guarantees? Did he handle papers in an orderly way without you having 
to make repeated requests for the same documents? Did he return your calls on a 
same-day basis? 
</P>
<P>
 "Your friend will tell you whether his experience with the lender was a piece 
of cake or a nightmare," Tyrie says. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't rule out a lending company on the basis of size or age alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is suspicious of little start-ups. But every firm was new at one 
time," says Havemann, of HSH Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not how long a mortgage firm has been around but how experienced 
its principals are. In the same way, the size of the firm is not the key but 
whether it is competent, honorable and motivated to make your loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should a borrower take time to investigate a small lending company? 
Because the smaller firm, with slightly lower overhead, may be in a position to 
offer a better deal on mortgage terms, to be more flexible in qualifying 
standards or to be more user-friendly, according to Havemann. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a small lender, you might just get exemplary service," he says.

IN THE GARDEN: IT'S TIME TO CUT BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The planting and pruning of roses may get all the press in winter, but there 
are other things that need doing at this time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to plant those tulips (and maybe hyacinths) that have been cooling 
in the frig. It's time to spray deciduous fruit trees, especially peaches, with 
a dormant spray and fungicide. It's also time to prune these trees. 
</P>
<P>
 And, it's time for cutting back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cutting back" is gardening jargon for the pruning down of herbaceous 
perennial plants. Herbaceous perennials are those that more or less die back to 
the roots each winter, sprouting anew in the spring. It's one way plants 
survive the cold of winter, where it gets cold. 
</P>
<P>
 In our climate these perennials may not die back completely. They look only 
half-dead, the leaves worn out and ragged, the old flower spikes brown and 
stiff. If you do not cut them back, they simply make new leaves and flower 
above the old come spring, but pruning them back tidies the garden and gives 
these plants a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
 What are some of the plants that can be cut back? Chrysanthemums, columbine, 
coreopsis, gayfeather, some true geraniums, ornamental grasses that look tatty, 
evening primrose, physostegia, rehmania, many salvias, Shasta daisies, Verbena 
rigida , and most yarrows are some common ones. 
</P>
<P>
 You can do this cutting back any time in late fall or winter, before February, 
which is when some perennials begin to actively grow again in our benign 
climate, but right now is a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 You need to be careful because many plants sold as perennials in Southern 
California are not herbaceous and do not like being cut back. Cut back coral 
bells, those handsome perennials with the roundish leaves and delicate stalks 
of frothy flowers, and you will probably kill them. All you need to do is cut 
off the old flower spikes and remove dead leaves as they appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Many perennials are not herbaceous. Even if they look shabby in winter, you 
must simply put up with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Helianthemums, or sun roses, are another example of something often called a 
perennial, but actually is not. They are technically subshrubs, and should 
never be "cut back," though you can certainly prune them like any shrub, to 
encourage new, less rangy growth. But cut them back too far and you may finish 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Alstroemerias need to be cut back, but this is not the time. They're on a 
different cycle and should be cut to the ground in late summer when the plants 
are almost dormant. 
</P>
<P>
 Other perennials we grow here are on similarly different cycles. Japanese 
anemones, on the other hand, thrive when cut to the ground in winter and 
rebound quickly, even though they are not technically "herbaceous." These 
flowers that thrive in partial shade and flower in fall, look pretty ratty by 
this time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people just wait until the new spring growth covers the old, but I 
hack them right to the ground and within weeks, new growth sprouts and the 
plants look brand new. 
</P>
<P>
 My choice of weapons is a Corona No. 5 pair of shears, the ideal tool for 
"cutting back." They are actually made for edging the lawn, but are sturdy 
enough to slice through a whole handful of stems. I grab a handful of stems and 
cut as close to the ground as I can, though on some perennials you must leave 
several inches of stubble. 
</P>
<P>
 You can put all this in the compost pile or simply keep cutting the old leaves 
and stalks until they make a nice mulch, leaving them around the base of the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The more-or-less green foliage and brown stems look a little messy for a few 
days, but then the cut pieces turn brown and then they look like the leaf 
litter found on a forest floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Never send these cuttings to the dump. It makes little sense to send natural 
organic matter to a landfill one week, then buy bags of bark or soil amendment 
the next.

KYOTO: THE ULTIMATE JAPANESE EXPERIENCE; A CITY FOR ALL SEASONS; CELEBRATING 
THE TIMES OF THE YEAR IN JAPAN'S CAPITAL OF TRADITION 
</P>

 There is probably no other culture in which the changing seasons are so 
sensitively and fully celebrated, both in life and in art, as in that of Japan. 
The association of a particular place with the beauties of a certain season is 
described in Japan's earliest poetry, and the customs that grew out of this 
sensibility are still very much in evidence. Since an excursion to one of these 
famous scenic spots often requires the better part of a day, eating and 
drinking have come to be regarded as basic elements of the day's festivities 
rather than mere concomitants. The food is always something appropriate to the 
time of year, and often the cuisine itself has become associated with the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1,100 years, Kyoto was the capital of Japan, the seat of the imperial 
court and the center of Japan's traditional culture. Although the emperor and 
the government moved to Tokyo (then called Edo) in the late 19th Century, Kyoto 
remains the conservator of the arts associated with the court aristocracy as 
well as of the military and clerical elites that grew up around it. Ironically, 
perhaps, my favorite places in Kyoto are not embedded in the urban patchwork of 
post-war concrete boxes, traditional houses and tile-roofed temples and gardens 
surrounded by mirror-faced high-rises, but in the hills to the east, west and 
north of the city proper, where snow lies deeper and longer in winter, and cool 
air hangs in river gorges and in wooded shade in summer. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-April the cherry blossoms have scattered elsewhere in Tokyo and Kyoto, 
but at the temple of Ninnaji, between the city center and the Takao area to the 
northwest, the famous Omuro cherries, a pale pink grove of more than 200 trees, 
are in full bloom. The trees branch out directly from their bases in low mounds 
of earth -- as you walk among them you are surrounded by clouds of blossoms 
rising like pink mist from the ground. The gracious extent of the temple 
precincts and the 17th-Century garden reflect Ninnaji's long association with 
the imperial family. For two weeks each year, low wooden platforms covered with 
straw matting are set up under the cherry trees. From early morning until late 
in the afternoon people flock to Ninnaji, paying their regular admission fee 
plus a small surcharge for a day's occupancy of one platform plus a pot of weak 
tea. Friends old and new, three generations of family members, cozy couples and 
company parties growing increasingly merry as the day wears on occupy the 
platforms, spreading their picnics among the cherry trees, often bursting into 
song inspired by the luminous blossoms and the sustained imbibing of sake.  
</P>
<P>
 Stalls on the temple grounds sell warmed sake and snacks, but the customary 
way to enjoy the outing is to bring a Japanese-style packed lunch ( obento ). 
Some of the most elegant come from Kyoto's department stores (usually found on 
the basement level). Packed in individual wooden (or Styrofoam stained to look 
like wood) boxes, these may include rice formed into a five-lobed cherry 
blossom shape, prawns and vegetables cooked in broth, fish paste (colored pink 
and flower shaped), a few pieces of sushi and pickles.  
</P>
<P>
 In the dog days of summer, Kyoto steams under hot, hazy skies. The city's 
denizens while away their leisure hours in icy coffee shops, or sit at home in 
their special summer crepe underwear, fanning themselves with elegant folding 
fans in one hand, mopping their streaming brows with small, neatly folded 
cloths in the other. Against the blazing sun of shadeless streets, parasols of 
cloth or paper are more than elegant affectations. The fall of night, when the 
temperature often holds in the 80s (called nettaiya, or "tropical nights," on 
the weather report) offers little respite. Real relief is found only at the 
water-cooled elevated edges of the Kyoto basin. Rushing through a green cleft 
between Mts. Kurama and Kifune, the Kifune River cools the narrow valley. Here 
in the hills north of the city, knowing Kyotoites cool their feet and enjoy 
somen, threadlike fine wheat noodles, served over crystal-clear lumps of ice. 
By the first Sunday in May, the inns and restaurants along the river have built 
platforms out over the water, just inches above the swirling stream (the better 
to dangle your feet in the water when no one is looking). 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 minutes on foot upstream, the restaurant Shinshin'an straddles the 
pavement. Sunlight filters through screens of golden reeds, set up to shield 
guests from sun and stares of passersby. Clear water pours over the rocks, 
cooling the air and inviting dipping of exposed parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinshin'an, a branch of the restaurant Toriijaya farther upstream, is one of 
Kifune's more elegant places to have somen as part of a full kaiseki meal 
(multi-course formal meal). Lounging in the speckled shade, gazing at the mossy 
rocks and trees on the opposite bank, all memory of the heat and the city 
fades. A meal might include hamo arai, slices of hamo eel dipped briefly in ice 
water to firm the flesh and dull the characteristic eely odor; a chilled 
blue-stemmed goblet of gooey grated tororo yam mixed with broth to a 
vichyssoise consistency, sparkling with junsai, the buds of a freshwater plant 
enveloped with a natural colorless jelly; and cold somen in dashi broth, served 
in a frosted glass bowl with shiitake mushrooms, seeds of aromatic prickly ash 
and a cold poached egg to provide a richer sauce when the yolk breaks.  
</P>
<P>
 When the mid-August Bon Festival has passed, the autumnal voices of insects 
make the air vibrate, and a cool clarity, unfelt a few weeks earlier, presages 
the coming of fall. The first leaves to put on a glowing display of color are 
those of the same cherry trees whose blossoms will be admired in April. But it 
is not until the maples begin to change, in the second half of October, that 
the Japanese really celebrate autumn. The blazing foliage of the hills rising 
steeply from either side of the Kiyotaki River have, since the early 9th 
Century, drawn visitors and pilgrims to Takao, about an hour by bus northwest 
of downtown Kyoto. 
</P>
<P>
 Three temples spread along the western bank of the river, but it is to the 
oldest, Jingoji, founded in 824, that the first-time traveler should turn. One 
of the most powerful Buddhist sculptures in Japan, the 9th-Century wooden image 
of the Buddha of Healing, Yakushi Nyorai, is always on view above the altar of 
the Golden Hall, or Kondo. The calm of Jingoji's spacious grounds; an ancient 
pond dark with centuries of silt and decomposed leaves glimpsed between tall 
cypresses; conjure up the secluded mountain temples of the Heian period 
(794-1185), when the imperial court drove the powerful Buddhist clergy into 
areas remote from the center of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The hundreds of worn stone steps leading from the Takao bus stop down into the 
ravine of the Kiyotaki River and up to the gate of Jingoji provide the best 
stage for viewing the turning maple leaves. From Oct. 10 (a national holiday) 
until mid-November, a number of stands sell -- believe it or not -- maple-leaf 
tempura. Even for the Japanese, the pleasure must surely be conceptual rather 
than gustatory (try instead the fresh-roasted gingko nuts, pale yellow-green 
within their papery skins). 
</P>
<P>
 For more substantial refreshment, stop at one of the restaurants along the 
river, where you can warm yourself with sake heated to blood temperature and 
one-pot dishes (nabemono) cooked at your table by lantern light on long 
verandas or right on the stony riverbed. When winter comes to Kyoto, except in 
centrally-heated public and commercial buildings, few concessions are made to 
the drop in temperature. To sit and gaze at a frosty garden, now silenced by 
the cold, hovering over a brazier or an ineffective electric fire, is still 
considered an elegant pastime. The chilly pleasures of a winter landscape can 
be savored at any number of Kyoto's great temples, but not all offer the 
compensation of yudofu (literally, "hot water bean curd"). One of the head 
temples of the Rinzai sect of Zen Buddhism, Nanzenji was established in the 
13th Century in the heart of Kyoto's Higashiyama ("eastern hills") area. Some 
of the surviving buildings date from the early 17th Century and reflect the 
original architectural style imported from China.  
</P>
<P>
 Aside from immersing yourself to the chin in scalding water at your inn, the 
best way to warm up after or during sightseeing is by eating a dish cooked at 
your table over a charcoal brazier or, more often these days, an alcohol flame 
(if your table is outdoors, so much the better to disperse the unpleasant 
fumes). The most classic of such dishes is yudofu, snowy cubes of bean curd in 
hot water or a clear, seaweed-based broth, dipped in diluted soy sauce on the 
way to your mouth. Because of its high protein content when combined with rice, 
tofu is an important part of the Buddhist diet, which is vegetarian and was 
brought to Japan from China by Buddhist monks. 
</P>
<P>
 On the quiet street that runs along the northwest border of the compound, a 
number of small temples and other commercial establishments offer yudofu and 
more elaborate meals. The Choshoin, set in a lush garden, is one of the most 
appealing.  
</P>
<P>
 As the days lengthen, sliding doors are thrown open to the warming sun, and 
Kyoto's cycle of seasons and celebrations starts again. GUIDEBOOK

 Getting there: Northwest flies non-stop to Osaka (the nearest airport to 
Kyoto) from Los Angles for about $930, advance-purchase, round-trip. United, 
Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways also have connecting flights to Osaka. 
Buses run frequently to Kyoto Station (about 90 minutes). From Tokyo station, 
the bullet train takes about 2 1/2 hours to Kyoto Station.

TRAVEL INSIDER: PROBING THE PROS AND CONS OF CITY RESERVATION SERVICES; 
LODGINGS: THESE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES ARE AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION -- BUT NOT ALL OF 
THEM DELIVER WHAT THEY PROMISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here, if you're a city traveler on the way to a strange town, is a seductive 
prospect: 
</P>
<P>
 A citywide hotel phone reservation service has gathered a wealth of background 
data on local hotels. It gets deep discounts and makes bookings at no cost to 
the traveler. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds wonderful. So it's not surprising that over the last decade, 
reservation services have arisen and grown in most major American cities. Many 
are efficient, knowledgeable and prosperous -- but they're not all alike. The 
city hotel reservation service remains a ragged industry with no national 
network, widely varied standards and styles of business, and enough potential 
pitfalls to scare away some tourism professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's labor-intensive, it takes start-up capital, and it takes a real 
commitment to providing service," says Jill Gustavson, who co-founded San 
Francisco Reservations seven years ago. If a traveler lands in the hands of a 
sub-par agency, Gustavson says, he or she might miss out on a discount or 
"might not get information that you would want to know, such as what that 
(hotel's) neighborhood is really like." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the coordinating of citywide hotel reservations seems like a 
natural undertaking for a local convention and visitors bureau. The problem 
there, says Michael Collins, senior vice president of the Los Angeles 
Convention and Visitors Bureau, is "who's included and who's not." Since hotels 
are dues-paying members of convention and visitors bureaus, Collins says, "the 
fastest way to get a bureau person fired is to have them recommend a particular 
hotel" over another. 
</P>
<P>
 A reservation service that is an independent business, of course, has no such 
problem, and can use honest information as a selling point. If you're 
considering booking rooms through a city reservation service, keep these 
questions in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 How many hotels does the agency take reservations for, and what kind of 
discounts does it get? How often do agency representatives visit the hotels?  
</P>
<P>
 Be sure the reservationist asks enough about your preferences. If you know one 
hotel in the city, ask about that property to see if the agency's assessment 
matches what you know. If you don't know any hotels -- or you don't know of a 
reservation service -- call the local convention bureau or chamber of commerce 
and ask. Any effective service is likely to have a good relationship with those 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most reservation services never take payment from travelers; they pass along 
your credit-card number to hold reservations in your name, and are paid 
commissions by the hotel after guests arrive. Here's a test: Suggest to the 
service's reservationist that you'll call the hotel to pass along your 
credit-card number directly. At most well-run services, that should be no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 After a reservation is made, most services send written acknowledgments, 
including the hotel confirmation number. Call to reconfirm, and while you're at 
it, ask about rates to check the size of your discount. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here are three reservation services that serve four key U.S. cities: 
</P>
<P>
 * New York and Los Angeles. Express Reservations (telephone 800-356-1123), 
though based in Boulder, Colo., specializes in these two cities. The company 
started in 1987 and handles a clientele of roughly 85% business travelers. 
Steve Cornwell, president, says the firm concentrates on about 25 hotels in New 
York and 15 in Los Angeles, thereby allowing "constant feedback from clients" 
on the properties. (Beyond that, Cornwell says, each of the company's 26 
employees makes a round of hotel visits every nine months in either New York or 
Los Angeles.) Express customers usually pay $130-$140 nightly in New York, 
$110-$115 in Los Angeles, though the service usually can find rooms beginning 
at $70 in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Diego. San Diego Hotel Reservations (tel. 800-728-3227) started doing 
business in January, 1991. President Matt DeLine says the company offers 
reservations at about 250 hotels throughout San Diego County and sends 
reservationists on regular inspections. DeLine estimates that 60% of his 
customers are leisure travelers and that most pay $60-$80 nightly, though he 
handles hotels whose rates typically range from $40 to $150. DeLine also says 
business is good; he booked about 50,000 room-nights last year, up about 
one-third from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Francisco. San Francisco Reservations (tel. 800-677-1550), an 
independent company that opened in 1986, says it makes reservations for more 
than 200 hotels in the Bay Area, including all major properties in the city, 
and many bed and breakfasts and selected motels. Co-owner Jill Gustavson says 
prices are usually substantially below those available to walk-in guests, and 
generally range from $50 to $250 nightly for double rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Washington, D.C. Washington, D.C. Accommodations (tel. 202-289-2220) says it 
will make reservations at virtually any hotel in the city (there are an 
estimated 25,000 rooms), but it uses a shorter list of preferred properties, 
usually obtaining substantial discounts. The service, an independent company, 
was founded in 1984. Co-owner Nancy Riker estimates that clients are 60% 
business travelers, 40% leisure. They usually pay $90-$140 per night during 
peak-rate seasons of spring and fall, $60-$100 during the less busy (and more 
humid) summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds travels anonymously at the newspaper's expense, accepting no special 
discounts or subsidized trips. To reach him, write Travel Insider, Los Angeles 
Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.

DECOMPRESSING, DESERT-STYLE; A WELCOMING INN WAS THE UNPRETENTIOUS KEY TO THIS 
THREESOME'S GETAWAY

 Owning a dog falls somewhere between a cat and a kid: You can leave a dog 
alone all day, but you can't leave it for the weekend, which is possible with a 
cat. OK, a dog is a lot closer to a cat than a kid, but you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 When my husband, Rob, and I do short trips, we're always on the lookout for 
nice places that welcome our enthusiastic 65-pound Australian shepherd, Alice. 
That's one reason, but far from the only reason, we return again and again to 
the 29 Palms Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the allure of nearby Joshua Tree National Monument, which, for 
the price of driving only an hour beyond Palm Springs, offers a complete 
release from urban pressure -- captivating geology, very few people, a rich 
history -- and, of course, the ugly-but-gorgeous "forests" of Joshua trees 
(which aren't trees at all). 
</P>
<P>
 Rob and I planned a three-day weekend of total decompression, one or two 
challenging but not life-threatening hikes, a massage, maybe even some lazy 
hours around the pool. We got the decompression, but the weather wrought some 
surprising changes in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On a gray and cloudy Saturday morning, we bought sandwiches at the deli and 
headed out in our rented Ford Explorer (a real indulgence at $69.95 a day from 
Enterprise Car Rentals, but a necessity for reaching some otherwise 
inaccessible places in Joshua Tree). It was nearly noon when we hit the 
Interstate 10 freeway headed east, mostly because any vacation story that 
begins with "We rose at dawn" isn't one I want to emulate. When traveling with 
a dog, you can't be sure of finding a fully shaded parking spot at a 
restaurant, so pack a picnic. Otherwise, you get to eat drive-thru fast food in 
a vehicle with a drooling, greedy animal. 
</P>
<P>
 We turned north on California 62 near Palm Springs and pulled into the 
high-desert town of Twentynine Palms about 30 minutes of steady climbing later. 
"Twentynine" is best known for the enormous Marine base of the same name five 
miles north of the town center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The inn is a throwback sort of place. Zero glitz. No room service, golf, 
tennis or manicured lawns. Old bathrooms and questionable water pressure. No 
room phones. No color TV (just a grudging little 13-inch black-and-white. How 
1950s.). 
</P>
<P>
 But here's what it does have: One-room guest cottages of hand-cut adobe 
bricks, each with a fireplace. Poems (Pablo Neruda) painted on the outside 
walls. Handmade wooden doors, Mexican tile floors, bent-twig headboards on the 
beds. Hand-decorated textiles. A genuine palm-ringed desert oasis. A flock of 
geese. A huge vegetable garden. Ownership by the same family since 1928. Kids 
and pets welcome. Free homemade muffins and coffee for breakfast. And best of 
all, the romantic little "adobes" go for $60 a night ($85 weekends). 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we were settled, it was windy and chilly and late in the day. 
Instead of a hike, we went for a quick drive into the Joshua Tree National 
Monument, 870 square miles at the junction of the Mojave and Colorado deserts, 
encompassing terrain from lowland desert to high-altitude forest and the 
largest expanse of Joshua Trees anywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 If the pending Desert Protection act is made law, Joshua Tree will become a 
national park, with a bigger budget and eventually more visitor services. Now, 
there is not a single place to buy food, gas or lodging inside the park, though 
there are several small campgrounds. Another consequence of national park 
status will be the barring of dogs (which are currently welcome, leashed, on 
nature trails but not in the back country). Poor Alice. 
</P>
<P>
 We paid homage to the sunset at Keys View (a 5,000-foot viewpoint named after 
Bill Keys, a rancher whose 1930s holdings form the core of the monument). We 
hopped out for an admiring gaze as the sun dropped behind the San Jacinto range 
and, teeth chattering, raced back to the car and downhill 3,000 feet in 
altitude to the inn.

 Michelle, the bartender, handed us the key to the Japanese-style shoji-screen 
gazebo that houses the hot tub, tucked in a grove of trees at the edge of the 
Oasis of Mara (a desert treasure that the inn shares with the monument's nearby 
visitor center). Most of the inn's business is conducted at the bar and 
restaurant, next to which, in warmer weather, is a very inviting pool. 
</P>
<P>
 During our visit, the inn was full to the last bed with fashion shoots. One 
for French Elle (shooting winter wear), the other for Eddie Bauer (summer 
clothes). OH OH. This unpretentious, ingratiating little place is getting 
awfully discovered, which means reservations are advisable on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Our bed was a cramped standard double, with the saving grace of a really good 
mattress. Restless sleepers should ask for twin beds. In the middle of the 
night, we were awakened by pouring rain, with thunder and spectacular 
lightning. The next morning, temperatures were near freezing with a brisk wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast at the inn, which comes with the room, is informal: Go into the 
kitchen, nab some of whatever muffins the cook is baking, and pour your own 
coffee. By midmorning, we were ready to climb out of the cocoon and itching to 
get to Pleasant Valley, a vast, sloping alluvial plain in the craggy embrace of 
desert peaks. It's reachable only by way of the 18-mile loop of the Geology 
Tour Road, a corrugated dirt road that encapsulates the geologic history of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 As we passed the 4,000-foot altitude mark, the chilly gray drizzle turned to 
snow. The snow deepened as we gained altitude, and by the time we reached the 
Geology Road turnoff, it was a good four inches under the tires. We headed into 
the slush. 
</P>
<P>
 On the far side of the valley we stopped at one of the trails, actually an old 
mining road. About 100 yards from the car, we turned around. Too cold, too 
windy, snow driving horizontally into our faces. Back on the main road, the 
full campgrounds were emptying of bone-chilled rock climbers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We were back at the inn in time for a noon brunch, a terrific bargain at $7.95 
a person. The food at the inn is arguably the best in town, meaning that it is 
fresh, hearty and generally well-cooked. Brunch choices included baskets of 
warm homemade breads, fresh juices and fruit, and half a dozen variations on 
the egg. 
</P>
<P>
 I had planned a massage in late afternoon, but the inn's massage table is in 
another enclosed gazebo near the hot tub. Highly romantic and convenient in 
decent weather, unthinkable in a wintry drizzle. With a cold bottle of 
Chardonnay in hand, we returned to the hot tub, and had it to ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, the sun returned. The snow in the monument was turning to 
slush and temperatures were climbing into the high 40s. The sky was purple-blue 
and the vistas unlimited -- from one high spot, the white peaks of both San 
Gorgonio and San Jacinto were visible. We got in a couple of short hikes, to 
the old cattle-rustler's hide-out of Hidden Valley and to the boulder-ringed 
pond behind Barker Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 Wet of foot and renewed of spirit, we changed shoes and headed back to the 
city. But we were already thinking about the desert in springtime, those few 
astonishing weeks of April and May when the desert floor is covered in bloom.

BOOKS TO GO: GLIMPSES OF BRITAIN AND OTHER DESTINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More brief notices of worthwhile travel books that have appeared in recent 
months: 
</P>
<P>
 THE BEST OF BRITAIN'S COUNTRYSIDE: The Heart of England & Wales; THE BEST OF 
BRITAIN'S COUNTRYSIDE: Northern England and Scotland, and THE BEST OF BRITAIN'S 
COUNTRYSIDE: Southern England, all by Bill & Gwen North (The Mountaineers, 
$12.95 each, paper).  
</P>
<P>
 The idea of the Seattle-based Mountaineers' "Two-Week Traveler" series, of 
which these volumes are part, is to offer detailed two-week (actually 15-day) 
driving-and-walking itineraries of specific regions of the world. It's a good 
concept, lending direction and shape to what might otherwise be just 
miscellaneous touring tips. These particular titles are chatty, fact-packed and 
pleasant to read; no doubt they would be even more pleasant to use. 
</P>
<P>
 EXPLORING BRITAIN'S COUNTRY GARDENS by Michael Wright and EXPLORING BRITAIN'S 
VILLAGES by Susan Gordon (Hunter Publishing, $14.95 each, paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Created and published in England by Britain's Automobile Assn., these are 
attractive large-format paperbacks full of handsome photographs and brief 
descriptions of picturesque gardens and villages, respectively, all over 
England, Wales and Scotland. No detailed maps, itineraries or hotel and 
restaurant information are offered, but the text and photos may well inspire 
the reader to seek these out on his or her own. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CHARLESTON, SAVANNAH & COASTAL ISLANDS BOOK: A Complete Guide by Cecily 
McMillan (Berkshire House, $14.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 This latest addition to Berkshire House's useful "Great Destinations" series 
explores the fabled Lowcountry between Charleston, S.C., and Savannah, Ga. 
There's no particular depth to the book's approach to the region, and you'll 
have to look elsewhere for an evocation of the sensuality and romance of this 
stretch of coast -- but practical matters, from hotels to beachfront rentals, 
restaurants to fitness centers, are dealt with thoroughly and well. 
</P>
<P>
 NORTHWEST BEST PLACES, 20th anniversary edition, by David Brewster and 
Stephanie Irving (Sasquatch Books, $18.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 The latest update of the definitive guide to hotels, restaurants and tourist 
attractions in Washington, Oregon and British Columbia. Because the authors 
specialize in this region and have been covering it for so long, their 
guidebook is an unusually trustworthy traveling companion. 
</P>
<P>
 SANTA FE, TAOS & ALBUQUERQUE ACCESS by Robert Mayer, La Donna Mayer and 
Carmella M. Padilla (Access Press/HarperPerennial, $18 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Hip, multicolored, full of miscellaneous facts and observations, easy to use 
-- the usual Access package, here encompassing the three most famous towns in 
New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK: A NATURAL HISTORY GUIDE by Jeremy Schmidt 
(Houghton Mifflin, $14.95 paper) and GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK by 
Rose Houk (Houghton Mifflin, $14.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 These two thoughtful, nicely crafted books, each devoted to one of America's 
great natural wonders (or rather complexes of natural wonders), aren't 
hard-core guidebooks so much as readable backgrounders, personal and 
knowledgeable in tone. Both have clutches of first-rate color photographs in 
their midsts. 
</P>
<P>
 COSTA RICA'S NATIONAL PARKS AND PRESERVES: A VISITOR'S GUIDE by Joseph Franke 
(The Mountaineers, $16.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Yet another book on this hottest of destinations for the ecologically inclined 
-- straightforward, conscientious, very specific in the information it 
provides. 
</P>
<P>
 DUBLIN by Tony Wheeler (Lonely Planet, $9.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 The latest of Lonely Planet's little city guides, literally pocket- or 
purse-size, with small type, plenty of photos, accessible maps and a wealth of 
both information and insight. 
</P>
<P>
 FLORENCEWALKS, revised edition, by Anne Holler (Henry Holt & Company, $14.95 
paper) and ROME, second edition, by Dana Facaros and Michael Pauls 
(Cadogan/Globe Pequot Press, $14.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Holler provides well-informed walking tours of the great capital of the 
Italian Renaissance in a volume that is perhaps not quite as stylishly written 
as some other "CityWalks" titles, but that nonetheless covers its ground 
compellingly. Facaros and Pauls tackle the great, sprawling, chaotic, 
multilayered city of Rome with energy and flair. Theirs is one of those 
guidebooks, all too rare, which is both good reading and of real practical use. 
</P>
<P>
 DIVING CLUB MED by Michel Verdure (AquaQuest Publications, $18.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Descriptions of 10 Club Meds, most of them in the Caribbean or Mexico (the one 
exception being the Club in Moorea, in French Polynesia), with firsthand tips 
for scuba diving off their respective shores. Richly illustrated with the 
author's own photographs; he is both a master scuba instructor and professional 
photographer. He has also worked as director of several Club Med villages, so 
you may want to take some of his glowing prose with a grain of (sea) salt. 
</P>
<P>
 AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, third revised edition, by Michele 
and Tom Grimm (Clarkson Potter, $14 paper) and QUICK ESCAPES IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA by Eleanor Harris (Globe Pequot Press, $13.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 The Grimms, well-known local travel writers (and authors of this section's 
"Trip of the Week" column for some 16 years), here suggest 52 weekend 
itineraries, with appropriate prices and phone numbers, within 250 miles of Los 
Angeles. (They stray as far north as Yosemite and the Sequoia and Kings Canyon 
national parks and as far south as Ensenada -- destinations not quite in 
Southern California.) Harris outlines 21 weekenders (again south to Ensenada, 
and in this case north as far as San Simeon, and north and east to Las Vegas 
and Laughlin, Nev.), a bit less thoroughly than the Grimms, but still with 
plenty of good tips dispensed.

BACKPACK & BUDGET; CUTTING COSTS IN UNIVERSITY RESIDENCE HALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One way to cut overseas travel costs during holiday periods and the summer 
months is to stay at universities and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers should be aware that you don't have to be a student to stay in a 
university residence. Some also welcome families. However, you should be 
prepared for certain trade-offs in the process. For example, you may be sharing 
a washroom down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Residences are often quite economical for solo travelers who want more privacy 
than a hostel dormitory room can offer, but who can't afford the rates at 
foreign hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tourist information offices can provide information about university 
residences in their areas that welcome visitors. Guidebooks geared to 
student-style travelers are another good source. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60 British universities offering visitor accommodations have 
produced a brochure with details on their facilities. Per-person, double 
occupancy rates begin at about $23 per night. In Britain, school-vacation 
periods usually cover three weeks during the Easter break, three weeks at 
Christmas, and July to September. 
</P>
<P>
 The brochures are available by writing British Universities Accommodation 
Consortium Ltd., Box 846, ATW, University Park, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England. 
For more information about travel to Britain, contact the British Tourist 
Authority, 350 S. Figueroa St., Suite 450, Los Angeles 90071; telephone (213)

 "Kilroy was here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a phrase that has appeared in some of the most obscure areas of the 
world, but where did it originate? 
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy Travels, an international travel agency, was named in honor of James J. 
Kilroy, the man generally credited with creating the Kilroy legend. 
</P>
<P>
 According to "A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English" and other 
sources, Kilroy worked in the Bethlehem Steel Co. shipyards of Quincy, Mass., 
in the early 1940s. Among his duties, Kilroy loaded boxes onto steamships 
traveling to far corners of the world. On one particularly cold November day, 
when he didn't really want to be working outside, and with his foreman nagging 
him, Kilroy came up with an idea to offset his frustrations. He took out a 
piece of chalk and wrote on each box: "Kilroy was here." 
</P>
<P>
 The cases showed up in ports all over the world, with the words often 
accompanied by a sketch of a man, or at least his nose peering over a wall. 
Perhaps Kilroy wasn't able to travel, but his spirit did -- and continues to do 
so -- to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy Travels is geared toward independent travelers between the ages of 16 
and 34 with limited means but a spirit of adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are traveling in Scandinavia and need assistance with making onward 
plans, you can find Kilroy Travels offices in the following locations: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Denmark: Skindergade 28, Copenhagen; from the United States, tel. 
011-45-33-11-00-44. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Finland: Kaivokatu 10 D, Helsinki; tel. 011-35-80-680-7811 
</P>
<P>
 * In Norway: Blindern, Universitessentret, Oslo 0313; tel. 011-47- 22-85-32-00 
</P>
<P>
 * In Sweden: Universitet Frescati, Allhuset, Stockholm 104 05; tel.

PARTY PERFECT IN THE BIG EASY; THIS REVELER'S TOUR THROUGH CLUBS, RESTAURANTS 
AND JAZZ SPOTS IS JUST A PRACTICE RUN FOR MARDI GRAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HERNDON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Kick it into neutral and let it happen," said a fellow named Bob I met 
someplace along the line on New Year's Eve in New Orleans. If this is neutral, 
I remember thinking, it's scary to imagine what this town's like when they get 
around to putting it in gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyplace else you'd have to call the same behavior an all-out mass bender, but 
in New Orleans, the New Year's Eve weekend celebration is just the gateway to 
the party express, now steaming toward Mardi Gras on Feb. 15. After that, it 
slows a bit, only to rev up all over again at the end of April when it's time 
for 10 days of the Jazz & Heritage Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison to sustained blowouts like Mardi Gras and the Jazz Festival, New 
Year's kind of pales. The crew I was hanging with, for instance, had no 
particular place to go, so it rallied in this great big old former brothel 
where I was staying. The host and hostess served duck soup, which quickly gave 
way to a split-sized bottle of a Swedish concoction called glogg, which is made 
with stupid quantities of flaming grain alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we piled into a couple of cabs, destination the Howlin' Wolf, a rock club 
in the Warehouse District downtown (828 S. Peters St.), not far from the French 
Quarter. The quirky and delightful singer-songwriter Victoria Williams was 
onstage backed by the Continental Drifters, a pedigreed band -- composed of a 
dB, a Bangle, a Cowsill, a couple of Subdudes and a guy from the Dream 
Syndicate -- that has taken up residence in the Big Easy. 
</P>
<P>
 High spirits and cigarette smoke had no place to go in this low-ceilinged 
club, and as 2 a.m. approached, I rounded up a quartet of open-minded 
fun-havers to migrate over to GiO's late show on Bourbon Street in the heart of 
the Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 As these things go, the Bourbon Burlesque is a clean, well-lighted affair. 
Arriving a bit late, we took one of the few remaining tables, and by this time 
the stripping portion of GiO's performance was history. Supremely 
self-possessed, generous, gymnastic, capable of doing things you probably 
haven't seen before and pierced and tattooed in ways you probably haven't 
thought of before, GiO has been called by Esquire magazine "the premier 
stripper of her generation." Seeing is believing. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman like GiO, who has gained local celebrity as a legit stripper with her 
own radio show and national exposure with her video "How to Strip for Your 
Man," has secrets to reveal about her adopted hometown. If you're fortunate 
enough to have been referred as a friend-of-a-friend, as I was, she'll tell 
you, for the price of a lunch, "how to have more fun in 16 hours in New Orleans 
than you can possibly imagine." Not just a bunch of naughty stuff, either: 
She's a real N'awlins booster. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus we had met 13 hours earlier at a very popular lunch spot called 
Uglesich's (1238 Baronne St.) in a slightly out-of-the-way neighborhood. ("It's 
not just unsafe," GiO said of the area, "it's ugly.") 
</P>
<P>
 We ordered raw oysters, barbecued oysters, crawfish etouffe, crab cakes, a 
softshell crab po' boy, a couple of Barq's root beers and a couple of Buds. 
(Uglesich's is the unlikeliest little lunchbox you ever did see. It's got a 
badly weather-eaten wood plank exterior, neon beer signs, hand-scrawled notices 
on the walls, three kinds of hot sauce on the Formica table tops.) Seats about 
30, max, with standing room for about 20 waiting on line. A very yeeee-haaa! 
buzz was alive in the place, which inspired the 70-ish proprietor to every 15 
minutes or so put his tape player on one of the tables and sing along with "You 
Made Me Love You," complete with the full Jolson repertoire of knee bends and 
arm gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 GiO took out a list of places to go and things to eat. She'd also brought 
along a copy of the Lagniappe, the Times-Picayune's Friday entertainment guide 
that helps negotiate the ridiculous bounty of musical offerings in town on any 
given weekend. Eats 
</P>
<P>
 I'm no foodie, but I know what I like, and I like spicy seafood. I put salt 
and pepper on just about everything before I even taste it, but in New Orleans 
that's not necessary. What's necessary is to eat lots, because it's so good and 
because, let's face it, partying in New Orleans usually includes more than the 
usual amount of drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the buzz restaurants in town is Emeril's (800 Tchoupitoulas), in the 
Warehouse District. The airy, expansive feel of the room is very Downtown New 
York (minus the attitude), but the menu is very New Orleans eclectic. Emeril 
used to cook at the more traditional Commander's Palace and his own menu is 
rather more . . . exotic. For starters, you might have tried Emeril's savory 
cheesecake of Louisiana lump crabmeat with a New Orleans style ravigote sauce 
and garnishes, or perhaps a caramelized medallion of gulf yellowfin tuna with a 
sesame ginger vinaigrette and fried squid ink noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grilled gulf escolar with a saute of Louisiana crawfish sauce was almost 
too spicy, which is to say, just right. A dining companion ordered the roasted 
south Texas antelope venison chop with a kasha pilaf, haricot vert, sweet 
potato gaufrette and a natural reduction sauce. Road-kill by any other name, 
but tender and delicious just the same. Banana cream pie and chocolate pecan 
terrine for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 But while there's no good reason not to indulge, it's not necessary to make a 
steady diet of such haute cuisine to have a wonderful eating experience in New 
Orleans. Many of the more down-to-earth Cajun, creole and soul food restaurants 
put out meals that are as satisfying as the fare in the fancy joints. An oyster 
is an oyster is an oyster, and they're plentiful and cheap all over town. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd recommend a luncheon excursion up to Bucktown on Lake Pontchartrain; it's 
sort of like going out to City Island, only it's not in the Bronx and the food 
is better. At Fitzgerald's Seafood Restaurant, here's what you get with the 
special seafood platter ($16.95): Bucktown soups sampler (Creole turtle, file 
gumbo, seafood), crawfish pie, oysters bordelaise, stuffed mushrooms, sauteed 
crab fingers, grilled shrimp, fried softshell crab. The barbecue seafood plate 
consists of shrimp, oysters and trout in a spicy Cajun sauce. Bread pudding for 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd also recommend a couple of late-night places to go after a night of 
carousing. The Clover Grill (900 Bourbon St.) is an old standby (pecan waffles 
with eggs and sausage hit the spot), and La Peniche (1940 Dauphine St.), in a 
neighborhood called the Marigny, not far from the French Quarter. It's the sort 
of place that fills up at 3 a.m. with cops and night revelers, and is 
contra-indicated for those with an intolerance toward homosexuality. The grits 
and biscuits are a big hit. While we're in the neighborhood, one more 
suggestion: the Praline Connection (542 Frenchmen St.), a straight-up New 
Orleans soul food place that won't do you wrong. Tunes 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists commonly make the mistake of confining themselves to the French 
Quarter, and it's an easy one to make, since the official law 
enforcement/tourism line is that most of the rest of the town is too dangerous. 
Crime is on the lips of all the natives, and for good reason; New Orleans 
shares with Washington, D.C., the highest murder rate among the nation's 50 
biggest cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearing this in mind, and exercising extreme caution -- calling United Cabs 
(tel. 522-9771) even when destinations were within a New York definition of 
walking distance -- I moved around to the various nightclub districts (Uptown, 
the Warehouse District, Midtown and the Marigny) without difficulty. And even 
though I was traveling solo most of the time, people are so friendly that I 
never felt alone. Cover charges are cheap as well, sometimes nonexistent.  
</P>
<P>
 New Year's night, for instance, I didn't even go out until midnight and still 
hit three gigs. First stop was the Mid-City Bowling Lanes (4133 S. Carollton), 
the home of Rock 'n' Bowl, to catch George Porter's band. Porter is the bassist 
for the Meters, a group that's been on-again-off-again since the mid-'60s and 
which helped write the book on sophisticated funk. A banner over the bandstand 
reads "Bowl Lang Syne '94." The souvenir shirt slogan: "Rock & Bowl Will Never 
Die." The place is a hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, around the back of a bail bondsman's storefront, the 
semi-legendary soul singer Irma Thomas keeps an intimate little club called the 
Lion's Den (2655 Gravier St.). It's perfectly tacky. Thomas and her sax player 
sang a ballad that brought the small but diverse audience of down-homers, local 
hipsters and trendy Euro-tourists to its feet, before she closed with 
"Respect."

<P>
 I piled into a cab with a foursome bound for Cafe Brasil (2100 Chartres St.) 
in the Marigny, where local favorites the Iguanas were playing. Brasil is known 
for its eclectic, quality booking policy and the knowing, nice-looking crowd it 
attracts. The Iguanas play the kind of Tex-Mex border music and roots-rock of 
which Los Lobos are the foremost exponents. 
</P>
<P>
 It just might be worth extending a weekend visit to New Orleans until Monday, 
partly because you're going to need an extra day for re-entry, and so you can 
hit the Cajun dance Uptown at Tipitina's (501 Napoleon Ave. at Tchoupitoulas). 
Probably the most famous New Orleans club, Tips is good-sized, with corrugated 
tin siding on the walls, beer signs and gig posters for decorations. It was a 
jes' folks crowd that had turned out, with the convivial feel common to places 
where regulars get together for the intent purpose of social dancing.  
</P>
<P>
 On my last legs, I booked over to the Maple Leaf Bar (8316 Oak St.) for 
another gander at the Continental Drifters.  
</P>
<P>
 As I left town, the taxi went down St. Charles Avenue. Workmen were setting up 
bleachers, a sign that parade season would be starting momentarily. New Orleans 
was just getting ready to party. GUIDEBOOK

 Getting there: Several airlines, including American, Continental and United, 
are offering restricted round-trip coach fares from LAX, beginning at $320 for 
travelers who book at least 21 days in advance, based on availability.

THINKING YOUNG AT MARDI GRAS; RIBALD REPUTATION ASIDE, NEW ORLEANS' BIG EVENT 
IS GREAT FOR KIDS, TOO. HERE'S A PRIMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX MARTIN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My 4-year-old son cried pitifully one night last February because the next day 
was Ash Wednesday. Not that he was moved by its penitential significance. Not 
that he dreaded the solemnity of Lent. Not that he even knew the next day was 
Wednesday, much less Ash Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As Will lay in my childhood bedroom in New Orleans, he just knew that when he 
awoke the next morning it wouldn't be Mardi Gras anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that Mardi Gras. The one with the reputation for drinking and naked 
dancing. But to New Orleans natives -- and those who have taken children to the 
pre-Lenten blowout -- it's always been a family party of lawn chairs and 
blankets, picnic baskets and coolers, homemade costumes and motley face paint. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that Mardi Gras in New Orleans can be all things to all people. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are parts of some beaches that you would never take your kids to, but 
as long as you know the right place to go there's no problem," said John 
Hurstell, a New Orleans native with two young daughters. "It's the same thing 
with Mardi Gras. When I think back on it, there's never been an incident at a 
parade when I've been with my kids. Ninety percent of the parade route is fine; 
it's 10% that isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids find the same attraction in Carnival in New Orleans that adults find: a 
loosening of rules, a shedding of inhibitions. They can eat cotton candy and 
caramel corn on the soft grass of a median -- known as a neutral ground in New 
Orleans. They can stay up late. They can dress in costumes or get their faces 
painted. They can scream until they're hoarse, demanding that masked riders on 
the brightly decorated floats throw them trinkets. It's this last thing that 
especially interests Will, now 5, and his brother Sam, 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about Mardi Gras is all the stuff they throw you," Will said. All 
the stuff is anything from strings of plastic beads to aluminum coins called 
doubloons to cups emblazoned with the parading group's theme and crest. Be 
warned, there is the occasional ribald throw, such as women's underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea behind Mardi Gras is that it's a time when everybody can be 
kids again," said Arthur Hardy, publisher of the invaluable Mardi Gras Guide, 
available at local drug stores and newsstands for $2.99. "Anybody who would 
view it as strictly an adult celebration would be missing the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Carnival, the roughly two weeks of parades, balls and dances, ends with Mardi 
Gras, Fat Tuesday, a movable feast that falls 46 days before Easter. My sons 
have been almost every year and I've gone every year save one since 1960. A few 
tips will ensure that the familial traveler will fully enjoy what local 
boosters like to call the greatest free show on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 On Mardi Gras itself, this year Feb. 15, the drinking and the outrageous 
behavior are generally found on or near Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, 
where no parades go. That area is just a pulsing blob of humanity in outlandish 
costumes -- such as an anatomically correct Big Bird -- begging for beads and 
trinkets from folks standing on filigree balconies above. Stick close to the 
Mississippi River, venturing no closer to Bourbon Street than Royal Street. 
Don't forget the riverfront streetcar, an easy way to skirt the Quarter and 
ride from Esplanade Avenue to the Riverwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 When going to parades, check routes in the Mardi Gras Guide or in the 
Times-Picayune, the city's daily newspaper. The rule of thumb is to see parades 
that start in Uptown New Orleans -- especially on Mardi Gras itself -- 
somewhere on St. Charles Avenue between Napoleon Avenue and Lee Circle. See 
parades that start near City Park on Carollton or Orleans avenues. If you're 
staying in a hotel downtown, it might be worthwhile to see parades on Canal 
Street near your lodgings, but don't venture there without asking the hotel 
desk for advice on crowds and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option is to contact Ticketmaster in New Orleans for tickets to 
city-operated reviewing stands along St. Charles Avenue -- a humane, somewhat 
sanitized way to join in the fun. And unless you're in the stands with smaller 
kids, you probably should avoid one of the rowdier parades: Bacchus on Feb. 13. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Taxis are useful to get close to where you want to be on parade routes. The 
Riverwalk at the foot of Canal Street and the Jax Brewery complex across from 
Jackson Square in the center of the French Quarter offer food, places to rest 
and bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also provides portable toilets all along the routes -- look for 
clusters near Lee Circle and near Gallier Hall on St. Charles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Mardi Gras delights for children: 
</P>
<P>
 Lundi Gras: At the foot of Canal Street on Feb. 14, a celebration honors the 
arrival of Rex, the king of Carnival. And the Zulu Golden Nugget Festival at 
nearby Woldenberg Memorial Park trumpets the arrival of the king of the Zulu 
parade.  
</P>
<P>
 Blaine Kern's Mardi Gras World: A free ferry ride across the river gives you a 
behind-the-scenes view of Carnival. Kern builds about 70% of the parades in the 
city. A free shuttle picks up patrons at the ferry landing; telephone (504) 
362-8211.

HIKING: DEATH VALLEY: DOIN' THE DUNES AT STOVEPIPE WELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-square-mile field of dunes and some bizarre geology are attractions of a 
visit to the Stovepipe Wells area of Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiking the dunes is most fun in the cooler morning and late afternoon. At 
those hours, the dunes are most photogenic, too; the light is softer, the 
shadows longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Death Valley's dunes are formed in much the same way as the mega-dunes in the 
deserts of the Middle East and North Africa. Nature's recipe for making dunes 
is fairly simple: a source of sand, wind to separate the sand from gravel, more 
wind to roll the sand along into drifts, and still more wind -- perhaps in the 
form of a back draft -- to keep the dunes in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Death Valley's dunes lie between Towne Pass on the west and Daylight Pass to 
the east; there's quite a sand-laden draft between the two passes. These dunes 
are sub-barchan, or crescent-shaped. The sand dunes actually consist of tiny 
pieces of rock, most of them quartz fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 The slip face of the dunes (away from the wind) is very steep, but never 
steeper than 34 degrees. This is known as the angle of repose: If the dune is 
steeper than this, a slide occurs, thus reducing the angle a degree or three. 
</P>
<P>
 As you hike the dunes, you'll notice blow sand (loose, very fine particles) 
piled on the leeward side of plants; these piles are known as sand shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the dunes are some weird natural features. Those surrealistic-looking 
cornstalks you see across California 190 from the dunes are actually clumps of 
arrowweed. The Devil's cornstalks are perched on wind- and water-eroded 
pedestals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fringing the dunes are expanses of dry mud that have cracked and buckled into 
interesting patterns. These mud sink areas and the edges of the dunes 
themselves are good places to look for the tracks of the few desert creatures 
able to survive in this harsh environment -- most notably rabbits and kangaroo 
rats. 
</P>
<P>
 Start this hike by taking California 190 six miles east of Stovepipe Wells 
village to the signed turnoff for the dunes. Turn north on the good dirt road 
and follow it a short distance to the dune picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
 Just up the dirt road is the historic site of Stovepipe Well. During pre-auto 
days, old stove pipes were sunk into the sand to form walls for a well. An old 
hand pump marks the spot of this once-famous water hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Your hike into the dunes is exactly what you make of it -- short or long, a 
direct or indirect route to the higher sand formations. Figure four miles 
maximum to climb up, down and around the taller dunes and then return. Remember 
that "doing the dunes" means a two-steps-forward-one-step-backward kind of 
hiking, so pace yourself accordingly. Dune Trail

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: FIRE SAFETY FOR HOTEL GUESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When guests book a hotel room, most ask about rates, beds and check-out time. 
Often neglected is the potentially life-saving question: Are the rooms equipped 
with sprinklers and smoke detectors? 
</P>
<P>
 If this is a question you ask regularly, you greatly increase your chances of 
surviving a hotel blaze. When used in tandem, sprinklers and smoke detectors 
can prevent up to 90% of fire deaths, according to the U.S. Fire 
Administration, the fire safety branch of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early 1980s, the number of U.S. hotel and motel blazes has dropped 
by half, due to improvements in building codes and better design of combustible 
materials such as mattresses. Still, about 33 people die each year in U.S. 
hotel or motel fires, according to Julie Reynolds of the National Fire 
Protection Assn., a Massachusetts-based nonprofit fire safety organization, and 
another 362 are injured. From 1987 to 1991, the number of hotel/motel fires 
averaged 7,000 blazes annually, ranging in intensity from smoldering 
wastebaskets to major fires. 
</P>
<P>
 To further ensure travelers' safety on the road -- in part spurred by recent 
legislation -- hotels are becoming increasingly safety-conscious.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990, hotels and motels that do 
not install smoke detectors and sprinklers can miss out on business from 
federal employees, since the measure restricts federal business travel to 
complying facilities. At the moment, government employees are only encouraged 
to stay at approved hotels and motels, but by 1996, 90% of employees will be 
required to do so. And effective Monday, federally financed meetings and 
conferences can take place only at hotels and motels in compliance with the 
act, unless a waiver is obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 The other good news is that more than 98% of 12,000 U.S. hotels and motels 
surveyed in a 1992 study already had smoke detectors (sprinkler use was not 
surveyed), according to the American Hotel & Motel Assn. study. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkler installations are also becoming more common, said Ray Ellis, an 
American Hotel & Motel Assn. consultant who said most major chains install 
them. While the Fire Safety act requires sprinklers for hotels of three stories 
or higher, Ellis said the trend is to equip lower floors, as well. When asking 
about a hotel's sprinkler systems, he advises travelers to find out if the 
entire facility is equipped, since fires often start in meeting rooms and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Information about fire safety is often included in guidebooks. For several 
years, the American Automobile Assn. tour books have noted the presence of 
sprinklers and smoke detectors in lodging listings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire safety measures are gaining steam in overseas hotels, too, said Ellis, 
citing the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands as particularly 
safety-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of other ways travelers can minimize fire risks, according 
to suggestions from the National Safety Council, the American Hotel & Motel 
Assn. and the National Fire Protection Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * "When you check in, ask what the fire alarm sounds like," said Reynolds. Ask 
if the facility has an evacuation plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once at your room, find the two exits nearest your room. Note whether you 
turn right or left when leaving the room to reach each exit. "Count the doors 
between your room and the exit," said Reynolds. That way, if fire breaks out 
and the hallway is smoke-filled, you can crawl low (to minimize deadly smoke 
inhalation) and count doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find the fire alarm on your floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Examine the windows in your room to see if they can be easily opened. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep your room key and a small flashlight at bedside. Practice unlocking 
your door from the inside in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't smoke in bed or carelessly in any other way. A third of fatal hotel 
fires are traced to careless smoking, according to the National Fire Protection 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * If fire breaks out in your room, grab the key and leave, closing the door. 
Sound the fire alarm or alert hotel workers and notify neighboring guests. Walk 
to safety. Never use an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you hear a fire alarm and your door is not hot, call the front desk for 
information about exactly where the fire is or check the hallway for smoke. If 
there isn't any, leave. Grab the key and flashlight and close the door securely 
before walking to the nearest exit. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you hear a fire alarm and your door is hot or there is smoke in the 
hallway, stay in the room and await rescue. If the telephone works, call for 
help and give your room number. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fill the bathtub with water to wet sheets and towels, then use them to seal 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your window opens, hang a sheet out to let rescuers know your location, 
but don't climb down the sheet. Listen closely for firefighters' instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 * If smoke invades the room, use another blanket or sheet to make a tent over 
your head. Stand by a window, if possible, to breathe smoke-free air.

ERIC LLOYD WRIGHT SEEKING AN ORGANIC WAY IN ARCHITECTURE -- AND LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt is a producer at Fox News and a contributor 
to National Public Radio's Morning Edition and All Things Considered. He spoke 
with Eric Lloyd Wright at the architect's home in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Eric Lloyd Wright was drafted into the Army during the Korean War, he 
applied for service as a noncombatant. On his application forms, he was asked 
for the name of his priest, minister or rabbi. Without hesitation, he wrote the 
name of his grandfather, Frank Lloyd Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Frank Lloyd Wright, the premier figure in 20th-Century architecture, 
who taught Eric the value of understanding nature and working within it. The 
senior Wright created the theory of organic architecture. His buildings were 
meant to merge with their environment, in both the way they were designed and 
the materials used to construct them. And his designs have proved durable as 
well as aesthetic. When a huge earthquake leveled Tokyo in 1923, killing some 
143,000 Japanese, one of the few buildings left standing was the Imperial 
Hotel, designed in 1914 by Frank Lloyd Wright.  
</P>
<P>
 Frank's son, Lloyd Wright, was also an architect. He designed the original 
Hollywood Bowl shell, and created the landscaping for the Dodd House, today the 
site of the Bel-Air Hotel. Lloyd came to Los Angeles in 1919, to help his 
father with the construction of the Hollyhock House, in what is now Hollywood's 
Barnsdall Park. He stayed and built a home on Doheny Drive, between Santa 
Monica and Sunset. His son, Eric, grew up there, playing in a bean field on the 
west side of Doheny. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric raised chickens and ducks, loved working in the family victory garden and 
wanted to be a farmer. Then, when he was 15, he spent a summer in Wisconsin, at 
his grandfather's studio, Taliesin. He decided then to follow in the family 
tradition of architecture. As soon as he graduated from Hollywood High, he 
returned to Taliesin, where, from 1946 to 1954, he was an apprentice to his 
grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright then returned to Los Angeles to work with his father's firm, which he 
took over upon his father's death in 1978. He has spent a considerable amount 
of time supervising the restoration of his grandfather's structures, including 
the Storer, Hollyhock and Ennis houses in Los Angeles. He's currently working 
on a Philadelphia conference center and a pair of housing developments in 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 64, Wright lives with his wife, Mary, a painter, in a temporary structure 
on a hillside in the Santa Monica Mountains overlooking the Pacific. He's 
building a home there. Made of reinforced concrete, with sod roofing, it 
epitomizes his interpretation of organic architecture, and is designed to 
withstand quakes and canyon fires. A large man, with a gentle and thoughtful 
manner, Eric Lloyd Wright has taken his grandfather's principle of uniting the 
elements of nature in design, and applied that dictum to the way he lives his 
life.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: We've just watched one of our great technical achievements -- our 
freeway system -- buckle and collapse. Have we been hubristic in thinking we've 
learned to conquer nature?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is a tremendous power there that we just really don't 
understand. Perhaps we never will understand it, but our great mistake is that 
we have been unwilling to work with nature and are always trying to work 
against it, to dominate it. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of our problems come from the fact that there are just so many of us. 
The population pressure forces us to create these gigantic, monumental 
constructions that grow beyond human scale. We have lost that sense of 
proportion to human scale -- it's gone from our buildings, we've lost it in our 
education system. Everything has become mechanized, and we put too much faith 
in that mechanical side, and not nearly enough in the spiritual and emotional 
sides of our nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it possible for people to apply your family's principles of organic 
architecture to a structure like a freeway -- or is a freeway, by its nature, 
anti-organic?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, we can apply those principles to freeways. Technology is a wonderful 
tool, and we don't want to throw out the baby with the bath, but I think what's 
happened is that we've allowed the tool to tell us what to do. Technology is 
controlling us; we don't control technology. What has to happen is that human 
beings have to apply their creative and artistic sides. Those have to be the 
moving forces, not the mechanical side. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With all the talk about how we've been rudely awakened from the California 
dream, what's your sense of the collective Southern California psyche right 
now?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There is, right now, a slight sense of despair. We're living in a very 
difficult area, in a very difficult time. I'm speaking not just of the 
earthquake and the fires, but also of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a sense of loss there as well. I suppose what we have lost is a sense 
of stability. But that will not last. Our memories are short. We move on, and 
seem to forget what has happened. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, we will beef up the building codes and try to make things 
stronger, but more people will come in, and we will huddle more, and build more 
high-rises. There will be more freeways, because we keep pushing in more 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The people will keep coming, in spite of earthquakes, in spite of fires. And 
that is because of this unique situation we have here. The earthquake -- the 
very thing that is so damaging -- is also the thing that makes California so 
attractive. It's what creates our mountains, the physical environment that is 
so lovely and that surrounds us. And the same with fire. Fires are created by 
our weather, but everybody comes out here because they love the weather. They 
are all interrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 So if we love this climate, and this natural terrain that is here, we have to 
learn to live with it, and to live within it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Having grown up here and watched the city evolve, how could we have done a 
better job of designing our environment, and how can we do better in the 
future?  
</P>
<P>
 A: One of the first things that comes to mind, and it always sticks in my 
craw, is the way we've treated our open space. Take, for instance, the Los 
Angeles River. Here we are living in a desert, and here is this unique thing -- 
water -- that is worth more than oil or anything else in this climate. And what 
have we done? We've concreted, channeled the river, all because of real-estate 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody just had to build right up to the creek beds and we didn't give a 
damn about the water. Instead of making beautiful parks along our waterway, we 
put our factories and freeways right up against it.  
</P>
<P>
 We should have allowed those waterways to be open park space. Then you 
wouldn't have to worry when you had a flash flood. The park would have been the 
only thing to be flooded. It would have woven through the whole Southern 
California area a wonderful park system, which would have been natural and 
given us open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing is the freeways. I would have actually made them wider than they 
are, and had rail lines right down the center divider in every freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 People love to complain about the sprawl in Southern California, but I think 
these earthquakes prove that it is a difficult thing to build up vertically and 
pile a lot of people on top of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that we can technically build our tall buildings now so that they 
can resist the earthquakes -- but we've never had the really big one that we're 
all waiting for, so we don't know how these buildings are going to stand up. 
But what happens when you are on the 40th floor of a building, and the building 
survives a quake? The whip action could throw you right out a window, or throw 
a desk against you and pin you to a wall. The building survives, but can the 
human beings? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as my grandfather used to say, there's monotony in the difference here. 
He was referring to the architecture in Los Angeles. Not that everything should 
be uniform, but there should be a stronger character. We opted for the cheapest 
form of architecture, which is very boring, just all those apartment buildings 
in the Valley and storefronts along Pico. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the earthquake provide us with any opportunities to correct some of 
the things that are wrong with the way we've designed our cities?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's difficult, and I don't know if there is much opportunity. I think 
people will simply say, "Well, we've gotta build our freeways stronger and 
we've gotta make these buildings tougher." They're not looking at the real 
issue -- which is how do we create a more beautiful life here. The earthquake 
may even sidetrack us from that issue. We may become more involved in 
engineering things, rather than looking at how we make this a more beautiful 
environment, and by making it more beautiful, also make it safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've said that in the '90s, we're finally catching up with a lot of the 
things your grandfather was espousing in the '30s. What was it he was espousing 
then that resonates now?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The primary thing he said is that we have to work with nature and not 
against it. He always said it should be Nature -- with a capital "N." He said a 
building should take its form from nature, so that we should look at trees, at 
sea shells, at other natural forms, in creating designs. 
</P>
<P>
 He believed we should build to a human scale, and I think today people want 
that -- they are asking for things to be more human. People are finally 
beginning to recognize that things are getting out of proportion, that we need 
to construct our enterprises on a human scale. We keep moaning about how 
inhumane we've made our cities. That was something he was talking about years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He believed that natural materials should be used, and that they should appear 
natural, not painted-over or disguised. This is something that has begun to 
catch on in the last 30 years -- but he was talking about it in 1905. So it may 
take a century for us to fully appreciate his idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond architecture and design, he used to talk about the way we should 
live. For instance, my grandfather was very much a proponent of natural foods 
and always had a garden to grow his own organic vegetables. And he believed, as 
more and more people do now, that it's up to us to create our own culture -- 
and that includes our work environment as well as our home and social 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 We now routinely talk about preservation and how we care for the land -- 
things that were of great concern to him. And in the schools today, there is a 
great emphasis on our relationship to nature. We had nothing like that 50 or 60 
years ago, when my grandfather was talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The earthquake has sparked new proponents for accelerating the trend toward 
telecommuting. Do you think our electronic technologies can help us create a 
more harmonious relationship between work and home?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Very much so. I think it is one of the keys to being able to disperse, and 
not have to concentrate ourselves in cities. We don't really have to have all 
these conferences and meetings. Yes, I think technology can allow people to 
work more efficiently and give them the opportunity to develop a more fully 
integrated life. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the lessons that you have learned personally from nature over 
these past few months?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The basic one is the awesome power of nature. It is a force beyond our 
reckoning. And yet it's a force and power we can work with. And by working 
with, and not against it, we can create a beautiful environment. There's no 
reason why we can't live in the Santa Monica Mountains. It's how we live there 
that is important. 
</P>
<P>
 There is going to be more. This movement is a continual thing here. It's 
always changing, always in flux. This is another lesson of nature. Nothing is 
static, and you can't hold on and try to make something stay the way it is. 
It's always going to change. Often those changes are cataclysmic, and we have 
to learn to work with that, and understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, the people who came out here did so because they wanted to start a 
new way of life. This is sort of like the end of the road. Here's the Pacific 
Ocean, and you can't go any farther. This is where you have to make your stand, 
and live the way you want to live. Southern California has always meant that. 
It's tried to break away from things that were on the East Coast, or Europe, or 
wherever you came from. Southern California was a new chance, a new 
opportunity. It's still a new chance. I just hope that we can understand and 
work with this wonderful environment, and continue to create our own ways of 
living, and our own way of life.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FILLMORE STILL HOPES TO REVIVE DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took less than a minute for Fillmore's future to crumble to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's earthquake crippled the city's commercial core, an historic 
business district at the root of an ambitious redevelopment effort aimed at 
reviving the once-withering farm town. 
</P>
<P>
 Now merchants and city officials are talking about rebuilding. They say that 
now more than ever, the city needs to push forward with plans to resurrect the 
downtown district and fashion it into a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "That resolve is still alive," said City Councilman Roger Campbell, whose home 
was destroyed by the quake. "We'll survive. We'll do it. We'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also much worry in the city of 12,000. There is the fear that 
merchants -- too scared or too tired or too broke to rebuild -- could simply 
abandon the downtown, sinking plans to bring the area back to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just finished restoring the downtown businesses and now the whole thing is 
a disaster area," said Ruben Segovia, co-owner of a downtown market so heavily 
damaged that re-entry has been prohibited. "If government and the community do 
not get behind the rebuilding effort, this is going to become a ghost town." 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore had staked its future on re-creating its past, pouring hundreds of 
thousands of dollars during the past three years into refurbishing the 
turn-of-the-century buildings that make up the central business district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had mapped out a redevelopment strategy aimed at rejuvenating 
the local economy by tapping into tourism as a revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that our town was going downhill and we needed to do something to 
bring it back," said Dorothy Haase, executive director of the Fillmore 
Historical Museum and a member of a task force established to guide downtown 
redevelopment. "We had great plans for our town." 
</P>
<P>
 Banking on Fillmore's roots as a railroad center, city officials purchased 
from Southern Pacific Transportation Co. a 13-acre right of way near the 
downtown district. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hoped to transform the property into a railroad-themed development 
that would attract tourists from throughout Southern California. The attraction 
was to include a dinner train, operated by Short Line Enterprises, that would 
chug through the fruit orchards of the Santa Clara Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's centerpiece would have been the refurbished central business 
district and a newly constructed Main Street promenade of quaint boutiques, 
restaurants and cultural attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment project was expected to generate 250 jobs and an estimated 
$268,000 a year in tax revenue for the city. It was scheduled for completion by 
the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the eve of adoption of the redevelopment plan, last Monday's violent 
earthquake jolted the city and sent brick and masonry crashing onto downtown 
sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake caused more than $200 million in damage to Fillmore, most of 
that in the downtown business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Grocer Richard Gonzalez, owner of Richard's Meat Market on Main Street, said 
he was driving to work when the earthquake hit and stirred up a giant dust 
cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, 'There goes the redevelopment,' " said Gonzalez, chairman 
of the task force that designed the blueprint for it. "It's still a good 
project, but it's going to have to be put on the back burner. We can't go after 
a tourist economy right now when we don't even have an economy for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 By week's end, 40 downtown buildings were still considered unsafe and unable 
to open for business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a very optimistic view of what we would be able to accomplish this 
year," City Manager Roy Payne said. "We've been working very diligently on 
bringing the downtown back to life. Now we're back to square one." 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment effort could suffer if earthquake damage causes property 
values inside the project area to decrease. That decrease could mean that the 
city will receive less "tax increment revenue" -- the increased tax paid on 
property within a redevelopment area as its value increases -- than anticipated 
to use to pay for downtown improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is possible that assessed value in the Fillmore redevelopment project will 
decline," said David A. Wilcox, senior vice president with Los Angeles-based 
Economics Research Associates, which performed an analysis of the city's 
redevelopment program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Fillmore has taken a body blow," he said, "but it is very resilient." 
</P>
<P>
 For many downtown merchants, the biggest question is how many buildings will 
be torn down and how many business owners will be willing to endure what 
promises to be a lengthy reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Foy, owner of Fillmore Flower Shop on Central Avenue, said she believes 
the business district will bounce back, but only if it receives federal 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really will make or break what we're trying to accomplish down here," said 
Foy, whose shop suffered moderate damage. "Even though I might be able to move 
back in, what's downtown going to look like if a lot of owners can't afford to 
rebuild?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Mayor Linda Brewster is optimistic that federal help will arrive 
soon, but she wonders how much aid is available in the wake of riots, floods 
and fires throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, she said she believes that one way or another the community will 
continue to support the effort to revitalize downtown Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fillmore will never be the same," Brewster said. "But it doesn't mean that we 
can't be great. We will just be different." 
</P>
<P>
 If federal aid comes through in a big way, some see opportunities not only to 
restore the downtown district but to make it better and more earthquake-proof. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most forward-thinking small towns I've ever seen," said 
Jim Clark, co-owner of Short Line Enterprises, which owns railroad engines and 
cars that play an important role in the city's downtown redevelopment effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a small town with a lot of grit trying to accomplish something nice, 
only to be dealt a hard blow," Clark added. "Of all the communities, this one 
deserves some help." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some merchants wonder how long they will be asked to hold on before 
federal assistance is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Segovia has spent every day since the quake nervously waiting behind 
yellow police tape as building inspectors and structural engineers evaluate the 
safety of his 100-year-old building. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday, Segovia had not been able to determine the extent of the damage 
to his building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to go forward, I don't see where we have any choice," he said. "I 
just hope we're not busted by the time help arrives."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DIARY OF A DISASTER; RESIDENTS STRUGGLING TO 
PUT LIVES BACK IN ORDER ONE DAY AT A TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 DAY 1 
</P>
<P>
 Darkness. Then, abruptly, a jolt. A crash. Rumbling, screaming, shattering, 
tumbling. Panic. And again, darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone before dawn on Monday in a hilltop parking lot in Simi Valley, nighttime 
security guard Mike Tam watched the shuddering earth heave through the San 
Fernando Valley and on toward Ventura County. One by one, lights flared and 
went dim, as transformers blew. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hell of a show," Tam said. "I could have used my surfboard up there 
on that ridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Across Ventura County in Fillmore, Roger Campbell wasn't so sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell is a city councilman. A deputy fire chief. And Fillmore's only 
emergency medical technician. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the initial trembling stopped, he sprang into action. Jumping into 
his firefighter's boots, stashed as always by his bed, Campbell stumbled 
through the house, grabbing shoes for his family and clearing a path through 
the rubble. He ripped the front door off its hinges and hurried his wife and 
two teen-age children outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the dark, Campbell had an inkling that the quake had shoved his 
90-year-old house off its foundation. But when he dashed off to the fire 
station at 4:40 a.m., he shelved all thoughts of his personal tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the start of a selfless -- and hectic -- week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've mainly been working on solving other people's problems," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 So have Julie Merich and Nan Thompson, emergency room nurses at Simi Valley 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 They were nearing the end of their graveyard shift Monday, helping physician 
Pam Biren deal with two patients who had just come for aid when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceiling tiles smashed to the floor. A big glass sliding door exploded. 
Medicine and supplies tumbled off shelves. Sugary-smelling slicks of liquid 
Tylenol and Motrin oozed across the floor -- yellow and red pools snaking 
around the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as it started, we looked at each other and said, 'Earthquake. Big 
earthquake.' Then we ran to the doorway," Merich recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shaking subsided, Biren ran to check on the patients. Then, fearful the 
whole building could collapse, the three emergency room staffers shuttled their 
two patients -- a man with a sore back and an asthmatic woman -- out the door. 
Merich guided them to the parking lot and sat them down in the chill, still 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone and in clusters, huddled under blankets or shuffling in slippers, the 
wounded, the scared and the dazed began to arrive within 10 minutes of the 
fearsome jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Most were bleeding from lacerations, suffered as they tripped through 
rubble-filled hallways or lay stunned under falling objects. A few had more 
serious injuries -- fractures, chest pains, panic attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 As her watch inched toward 5 a.m., Thompson held a flashlight in the hospital 
parking lot while Biren stitched up a gash on a young man's face. 
</P>
<P>
 With that first, nerve-racking operation, they launched a primitive, open-air 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of off-duty doctors and nurses, some from neighboring cities, came by 
in sweats and sneakers to offer their services. They quickly set up an assembly 
line to suture wounds in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the hospital's emergency generator had kicked in immediately after 
the quake, no one wanted to go back into the building. Not with ceiling tiles 
on the floor and aftershocks on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like we took care of at least 50 or 60 people by flashlight," Merich 
recalled. "I had them lined up on the curb. I was running around like a chicken 
with my head cut off." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Campbell in Fillmore and Julie Merich in Simi Valley were among the 
first to aid others when the earthquake rocked Southern California with 
horrific force at 4:31 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although centered in Northridge, the magnitude 6.6 quake -- sent devastating 
tremors throughout Ventura County, shattering lives in Fillmore and Simi Valley 
and wrecking buildings in Moorpark and Thousand Oaks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The force of the quake bounced Larry Perillo -- a 6 foot, 2 inch, 280-pound 
quality control worker -- clear out of his bed in Simi Valley. He flipped in 
the air, landed face down and hit his head on a table, leaving him bruised and 
disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away in northeastern Thousand Oaks, Anne Weidenweber was jolted 
awake and tried to warn her husband that the heavy mirror behind their bed 
could come flying down on top of them. But he couldn't hear her shriek -- just 
then, the mantle piece and chimney came plunging down, bricks cascading in a 
thunderous crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a Von's supermarket in Simi Valley, Robert Moss found himself pinned in 
an aisle when the quake toppled a huge Coca Cola display he was stocking. It 
took him 90 minutes to extricate himself and slither around the debris to 
freedom, using the light on his pager to guide him down the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the noise and destruction, Mary Beth Wolford, superintendent of the 
Simi Valley Unified School District, slumbered -- tucked into a comfortable bed 
in a guest room at a friend's house in Sun City West, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 But her oblivion ended with a scare almost as frightening as the quake itself. 
Wolford awoke to a television news account of the disaster, featuring an 
interview with a Simi Valley resident. Trembling, he described the fear. The 
chaos. The wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The personal side of me was saying, 'I'm glad I wasn't there at 4:31 a.m.,' 
but the professional side was saying, 'What a lousy day to be gone,' " Wolford 
recounted. "The more I heard, the worse I felt." 
</P>
<P>
 Frantic to return and investigate the damage to her schools, Wolford scrambled 
to get a ticket -- any ticket -- to Southern California. When she finally got 
aboard a flight to Burbank, she found it filled with other nail-biting 
travelers desperately anxious about whether their homes, businesses and 
relatives had survived the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolford arrived in Simi Valley about 3:30 p.m., took one look at the broken 
glass littering her living room, and headed straight out on a tour of the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them looked bad. And three -- Township Elementary School, Valley View 
Junior High and Simi Valley High -- looked downright dangerous. Wolford's 
succinct assessment: "It was a total mess." Day 2 
</P>
<P>
 As Tuesday dawned in Fillmore, Roger Campbell still had no clue about the 
earthquake's total punch. He had heard vague rumors about crumbled freeways, 
collapsed apartment buildings, crushed bodies. He knew the epicenter was 
somewhere in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, he didn't know much. And he didn't much care. 
</P>
<P>
 Every last ounce of Campbell's energy was focused on his city, its three 
square miles of territory and its 13,000 anxious residents. 
</P>
<P>
 And he had more than enough to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Fillmore's downtown district was destroyed. Bricks were scattered, 
helter-skelter, across cracked streets. Homes had crumpled like paper. Hundreds 
of people had jammed into a makeshift shelter at the San Cayetano Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Like scores of other firefighters and city officials, Campbell was working 
frantically. After just two hours of sleep, he was coordinating the response to 
Fillmore's trauma. His employees were supervising building inspections, 
organizing the shelter, preparing an ordinance declaring a local state of 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 No time to listen to the radio. No place to plug in a television set. No idea 
where to purchase a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to know what was going on in my own town, and I didn't pay attention 
to anything else," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also didn't pay attention to his own family's plight, focusing instead on 
those worse off. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, about noon, he managed to wrangle a short break from his post at the 
command center. He rushed to his home -- just three blocks away -- and saw, for 
the first time, the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The lime green, two-story house that he had lived in for 20 years now tilted 
several degrees to the west. Cockeyed and slumping, it looked about to 
collapse. But despite the obvious danger, dozens of Campbell's friends were 
traipsing through the off-kilter door, carrying his furniture to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the county, other quake victims spent Tuesday performing 
similarly grim tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 They cleaned their homes or tried to salvage cherished possessions. They stood 
in 30-minute grocery store lines for water, flashlights and canned food -- in 
at least one case, ignoring a sign that warned "Shop at Your Own Risk." They 
consoled distraught friends and called worried relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, council members showed their congressman, Anthony Beilenson, 
their quake-ravaged library, picking their way around fragments from the metal 
ceiling that had blasted loose during the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like Beirut," City Manager Grant Brimhall said. "Or worse." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, Supt. Wolford strode through the city with building inspectors 
and held conference after urgent conference to decide which schools could 
reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in her home just blocks from the Simi Valley Hospital, nurse Merich tried 
to relax after the most hectic 15-hour shift of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many, Merich could not find peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they tried to nap on Tuesday afternoon, many Ventura County residents 
found themselves twitchy and tense. Even lying in bed, their muscles stayed 
taut, their hands reached out toward flashlights and hard-soled shoes, their 
minds ran through an endless catalogue of objects broken and friends left 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to go to sleep because I was so afraid the Big One would come," 
13-year-old Sarah Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others shared her fear -- and wondered how to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mexico, we all have the idea that we should run outside as fast as 
possible, but here, they tell us to stay inside and get in the doorway," 
immigrant Jose Lopez, 31, said. "But there's not enough room in the doorway for 
all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday evening, those who survived the quake with homes and possessions 
intact felt ready to get their lives back to normal. Some even felt relaxed 
enough to make a few earthquake jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Thousand Oaks council meeting marked by three small aftershocks, council 
members expressed gratitude that their city had suffered less than nearby Simi 
Valley. Councilman Alex Fiore chuckled and said: "This time, I guess it just 
wasn't our fault." Day 3 
</P>
<P>
 The sign in Fillmore on Wednesday seemed pitifully inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire downtown district was cordoned off, sheriff's deputies were 
patrolling homes and shops to prevent looting, and volunteer firefighters were 
trying to move the emergency shelter to a bigger location. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the orange sign posted on a traffic cone near Santa Clara Street offered 
scanty news: "Traffic Subject to Delays Due to Special Event." 
</P>
<P>
 For a change, Roger Campbell was free to help his family instead of aiding 
others. He scarcely knew where to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no earthquake insurance," he said. "I am financially devastated. I 
don't know what to do. Except work on cars. I know I can make money working on 
cars. I'll just have to keep working and hope the people who owe me money will 
pay me money." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his resolve, he didn't get much done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put on my coveralls like I'm going to work, but I haven't touched a thing," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others who watched life savings crumble in the earth's violent spasm, 
Campbell got a small measure of support Wednesday, when President Clinton 
declared Ventura County a disaster area, eligible for federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also received some bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech scientists reported that aftershock activity was unusually vigorous -- 
and migrating toward Ventura County. Two strong Wednesday afternoon temblors 
were centered barely six miles northeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Mary Beth Wolford didn't need a degree in geology to figure that out. 
</P>
<P>
 When the floor started pitching shortly after 1 p.m. Wednesday, Wolford dove 
under a table in the district office, where she had been answering press calls 
about school damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right away, I said 'That's a 5.1,' " she recounted. "My colleague said, 'No, 
no, no, that's a 3.2, I'll bet you a dollar.' As it turned out, I was right on 
target. When we heard on the radio that it was a 5.1, everyone in the room 
offered to give me a dollar. And we had a bit of laughter, which we desperately 
needed to break the tension." 
</P>
<P>
 The chuckle might have made everyone feel better for an instant. But within 
minutes the district office was deluged with phone calls from frightened 
students, teachers and custodians. 
</P>
<P>
 No one wanted to go back to school, not even to the schools that had 
previously been declared safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour, Wolford had dashed off a press release canceling school in the 
Simi Valley Unified district for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew immediately that we'd have further damage from those aftershocks," 
Wolford said. "I thought, 'There goes the plan for tomorrow.' " Day 4 
</P>
<P>
 It was Thursday. Three full days had passed. Yet the aftershocks kept coming, 
smaller but still potent in some pockets of eastern Ventura County. And the 
talk kept coming as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For some it was idle chatter. 
</P>
<P>
 How many pictures fell off your wall? How scared was your cat? How long did it 
take you to vacuum up the glass? 
</P>
<P>
 For those most affected, however, the talk was serious, and wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
 Where will I live if it rains this weekend? How can I get loans to repair my 
house? Why won't the building inspector let me enter my shop? 
</P>
<P>
 Federal emergency aid offices opened at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church 
in Fillmore and at the Sycamore Drive Community Center in Simi Valley to answer 
those nuts-and-bolts questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of quake victims lined up at the FEMA centers, some waiting for hours 
in the bright sunshine. But most got no tangible help on Thursday -- just a 
sheaf of papers and an appointment for an individual counseling session later 
in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know what FEMA is," Roger Campbell said, discouraged and 
disconsolate as the magnitude of his personal tragedy began to sink in. "I 
don't even know what they can do for us. All they did was give us pieces of 
paper and tell us to come back tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers of the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- well-versed in 
helping Californians after last fall's disastrous wildfires -- promised to work 
on pragmatic problems soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The philosophical questions, however, were harder to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have lost everything, so they're asking why," said Father 
Norm Supancheck of Fillmore's St. Francis of Assisi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell some of them I don't know -- only God knows. Some, I reassure that we 
can go forward from here. For others, though, that's not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, like every day since the earthquake, more than 200 people 
attended church services at St. Francis of Assisi -- a dramatic jump from the 
normal attendance of about three dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Many were children, who seemed to find peace in the sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful to see how the children who haven't slept for days come to 
church and fall asleep leaning against their parents because they feel safe 
there," Supancheck said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the newly homeless, suddenly jobless and simply shaken sought financial 
aid or emotional support, administrators across the county continued the gritty 
work of assessing damages on Day 4 of Quake Week. 
</P>
<P>
 Building inspectors plodded from door to door, pasting on red, yellow or green 
tags to indicate the state of each structure they investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, many had good news -- at least in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, officials checking out the library concluded that they, too, 
had overestimated the damage. A new computer system, installed the day before 
the earthquake, was working again -- though it had been sprayed with water when 
a sprinkler burst during the temblor. Despite the collapsed ceiling, City 
Manager Grant Brimhall pronounced the library itself structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Although damage estimates topped $5 million for the Simi Valley Unified School 
District, the structural weaknesses were not as bad as they first appeared. 
After another exhausting day of touring schools, conferring with inspectors and 
answering calls, Wolford reported late Thursday that the schools once 
considered ruined could be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the damage we were fearful was structural turned out to be merely 
cosmetic," she said with evident relief. "We'll be able to repair them and the 
buildings will be in good shape. They may not look nice, but they'll be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county in Fillmore, however, the devastation was every bit as bad 
as it had first appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting as usual on Thursday night, the Fillmore City Council decided to take 
control of the demolition bulldozer. Any building deemed a public hazard could 
be razed with 48 hours notice, the council members decided. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the toughest vote of Roger Campbell's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the ordinance we passed was a death sentence for my house," he 
said. "I voted for it. But it was hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The house he had lived in nearly all his married life, the house he had raised 
his two children in, the house he had renovated room by room, would be swept 
away by a city bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
 Logically, Campbell knew he had to tear down the home. Leaning and shaky, it 
clearly jeopardized his elderly neighbor's house. Repairing his house would 
cost $60,000 to $75,000. For that price, he said, he might as well build a new 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 The thought was daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 He had managed to find a temporary apartment for his family -- one bedroom for 
the four of them, "not nearly enough room, but it's a roof over our heads." 
Dozens of tasks still lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 He had to look for a new home. He had to get price quotes from contractors. He 
had to keep up with his City Council and Fire Department chores. He had to earn 
money, lots of money, in his auto repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal life is a shambles," Campbell said. "I'm trying to do a bunch of 
things at once. I have to because I'm in trouble." Day 5 
</P>
<P>
 The portable toilets stank. The lines were long. The paperwork was endless. 
And the check was nowhere near the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many of the earthquake victims waiting for federal assistance Friday 
remained good-natured, patient and even optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were frustrated -- wanting immediate answers when they could get only 
future appointments. But others were glad to be taking some action, glad to be 
talking to people who could help. 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling up and down the line in Simi Valley, distributing flyers and 
flashing his Irish smile, disaster relief worker Michael Kavanaugh tried to 
keep everyone cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are hurting, we're there," said Kavanaugh, a retired police officer 
from Roanoke, Va. "That's the whole point, isn't it? We're here to help and 
we'll be here for as long as we need to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 John Ayers, for one, was glad to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley computer programmer had just experienced a rather traumatic 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been rooting through the Elks Lodge, seeking a wheelchair for his 
injured son, when a series of palpable aftershocks rolled through eastern 
Ventura County about 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubble rained down around him as he dashed for the door. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, he was on a ladder, checking out his chimney, when another 
jolt hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The earth swayed slightly as he clutched the roof in terror. 
</P>
<P>
 Two near-escapes in one day persuaded Ayers to stay outside and on the ground 
-- and the FEMA line outside Simi Valley's Sycamore Drive Community Center was 
as good a place as any. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many, he wasn't sure what he might need from the government. But he 
thought he might as well queue up just in case. Perhaps, he said, he would ask 
for a low-interest loan to fix his cracked foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, though, Ayers couldn't think that far ahead. After four tense 
nights of fitful sleep, he had one main wish. "Let's just have a little peace," 
he said wearily. 
</P>
<P>
 But, even on the fifth day, peace seemed far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Beth Wolford was harried and harassed at the district office in Simi 
Valley, fielding calls from school principals, custodians and worried parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Campbell was harried and harassed at his auto repair shop in Fillmore, 
trying to take care of business and find new lodging for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 And John Dosen was harried and harassed at an industrial building in Newbury 
Park, welcoming a small army of State Farm Insurance claims adjusters from 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 800 out-of-town employees joined the 250 already stationed in State 
Farm's regional office in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they could fan out to handle the claims -- which were expected to reach 
nearly 100,000 -- they shuttled through an "induction center" in Newbury Park, 
picking up maps, flashlights, hard hats, gloves and instructions on how to 
assess earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a casual observer, this may look a little chaotic, but really, it's 
organized," Dosen said as claims adjusters in red "Special Disaster Team" 
T-shirts swarmed through the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced in dealing with natural disasters -- many spoke calmly of having 
"worked Andrew," as in the hurricane -- the claims adjusters nonetheless 
admitted some fear of aftershocks. Yet they all tried to ignore the shakes, 
girding themselves for six weeks of nonstop work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make the Adrenalin rush last that long," said Karen O'Neill, who left 
her husband and 4-month-old daughter in icy Ohio when she flew west to process 
earthquake claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 21 degrees below zero when I left," O'Neill said, marveling. "Here, I 
don't even need a jacket." Day 6 
</P>
<P>
 For Jennifer Jimenez, Saturday meant: 
</P>
<P>
 Another morning of waking up in the Royal High School gym, surrounded by 
crying babies, barking dogs and snoring men. 
</P>
<P>
 Another trip to the smelly portable toilets. Another communal shower in the 
women's trailer. Another pass through the cafeteria line for sticky buns, fruit 
and cereal. Another makeshift day. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 23-year-old mother wasn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 She had slept in her house at the east end of Simi Valley the first night 
after the quake -- or rather, she had stood vigil over her infant's crib, 
fearful that at any moment the creaky old building would cave in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I came here," Jimenez said, gesturing to the Red Cross shelter. "And I 
had my first good sleep. I know this building can hold an 8.9 earthquake. I 
wish I was at home. But I feel safe here." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her fellow shelter dwellers seemed to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the inconveniences, they expressed boundless admiration for the Red 
Cross volunteers and deep gratitude for the temporary housing. Hundreds of 
people have slept at Red Cross shelters in Simi Valley and Fillmore each night 
since the quake, and hundreds more have accepted emergency food and water. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people couldn't be better," said Frances Littlefield, 82, who spent 
Saturday morning reading the paper and joking with the volunteers. "They're all 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 As Littlefield sat in her wheelchair, cozy in a white terry cloth bathrobe, 
8-year-old Jessica Valadez played with her pet rats in the shelter's lobby. 
Meanwhile, Danielle Maston, 12, tried to shush her puppy, which had started 
barking furiously in its tiny carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Their public schools superintendent, Mary Beth Wolford, had just formulated a 
plan that would put them back in the classroom within days -- a plan that made 
neither girl happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by games, pets and potential playmates, Jessica and Danielle said 
they considered life in the Royal High gym even better than summer camp. And 
they wanted the vacation to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually don't like my house much," Jessica said. "It's too boring there. 
Here, they give us lots of activities and it's much more fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The good cheer and hard work of those who had come to Ventura County to help 
the needy also impressed Roger Campbell. After spending three hours with FEMA 
officials, Campbell said he felt optimistic for the first time since he had 
paused to contemplate his plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know financially I've taken a terrible hit, and I lost 21 years of history 
in my home, but I know that FEMA can help me. Not with gifts, but with loans, 
loans that I can pay back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While fellow is that word necessary firefighters escorted merchants into their 
wrecked downtown stores, Campbell stayed in his auto repair shop, tuning up 
cars so his customers could get back to work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a real despair, a really bad depression," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I haven't cried for almost 24 hours." Day 7 
</P>
<P>
 For some, prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week of terrifying tremors, confounding commutes and boggling 
bureaucracy, Ventura County residents plan to take solace today in meditation, 
recreation or vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Dennis Mongrain said he expects hundreds to attend his morning service 
at St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley, looking for answers to that eternal 
enigma: Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Why the floods? Why the fires? Why the quakes? Why me? 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to answer such cosmic questions, Mongrain said he has decided instead 
to remind his congregation of the earthquake's primary lesson: Homes and cars, 
even fat bank accounts, can crumble in an instant, felled by nature's awesome 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus on building spiritual and personal relationships, not on accumulating 
material possessions, Mongrain will urge. After all, he plans to tell them, 
"You can't take your surfboard to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 While some will seek peace in churches, other quake victims will look to 
escape their sorrows and fears by plopping down in front of a television set 
for a day of NFL playoff action. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers, the Kansas City 
Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills sounded like an ideal Sunday to Joe Martini, who 
has spent several nights in Simi Valley's Red Cross shelter, bunking down on an 
Army cot and showering in a trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they'll have the playoffs on TV here," he said. "That really will be 
fun -- something to take our minds off what's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the best diversion will not distract Roger Campbell and thousands of 
other county residents -- still stunned and disbelieving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to start rebuilding a life," Campbell said. "A life that was 
pretty nice last Sunday."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; EAST COUNTY SHIFTS TO LONG-TERM RECOVERY; 
AFTERMATH: TASKS INCLUDE REPAIRING THE THOUSAND OAKS LIBRARY AND EXAMINING 
ROADS IN HARD-HIT SIMI VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With aftershocks subsiding, water flowing to homes and street lamps aglow 
again, quake-rattled east Ventura County shifted this weekend from short-term 
emergency response to long-term recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming week, officials will be scrutinizing damaged roads in Simi 
Valley, a revised disaster plan in Moorpark and repairs to the popular Thousand 
Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the task is largest in Simi Valley, the Ventura County city 
closest to the epicenter of Monday's 6.6-magnitude Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lin Koester already has moved to speed the recovery with an 
emergency order waiving fees for building permits and safety plan reviews that 
residents will need to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Building inspectors are working 12-hour shifts to chip away at the 4,000 
damaged houses, businesses and public buildings that must be certified safe, 
said Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers are patching fragmented sidewalks and buckled roads and filling 
sinkholes created when broken water mains washed away the earth beneath the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Koester and other city department heads are shuffling work schedules and 
budgets to come up with enough staff and money to handle the work, Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detailed bills of earthquake-related repairs must be readied so the city can 
earn the 75% reimbursement of damage costs promised by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. Of the remaining amount, 75% is expected to be paid by the 
state, Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no telling how long all this will take or cost, Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city must carry on with daily duties ranging from preparing the 
weekly payroll to choosing a new police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Monday, Day 1 of the earthquake, 100% of our resources were being devoted 
to immediate damage recovery," he said. "We had to make sure we had power up 
again, we had to make sure we had our emergency services working -- and they 
were working well -- and we had to make sure the roads were open." 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is Day 1 of the recovery process," Sedell said Friday. "We're deciding 
where our people get directed and where our resources need to be put." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley is struggling to regain its daily routine around broken public 
buildings such as the Police Department, where damaged stairways have rendered 
the second floor unsafe for now, and the gymnasium at Simi Valley High School, 
which was made unusable by a cracked roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen city schools are set to reopen Monday and an additional nine are 
expected to follow on Tuesday, said Mary Beth Wolford, superintendent of the 
Simi Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High School will not open until Wednesday at the earliest, a 
district official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A student day off that was scheduled for Friday has been canceled, and all 
classes will meet as usual, Wolford said. In addition, the fall-winter school 
semester has been extended an extra week, through Friday, Feb. 4, so high 
school students will not have to take final exams as soon as they get back to 
school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers will modify lessons to make room for the disaster, handing out fact 
sheets on earthquakes and letting students share their experiences with 
classmates, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs over the weekend should make the schools safe enough to pass 
inspection until the cosmetic touch-ups can be done, Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't look so good, but we expect to get it ready so the kids can use the 
schools," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the district -- which did not carry earthquake insurance -- will be 
deciding how to pay for repairs that will cost an estimated $3 million to $5 
million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, public buildings and private homes fared far better against 
the earthquake, which was damped somewhat by hard volcanic rock beneath the 
city's streets, said City Manager Grant Brimhall. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 15 homes in Thousand Oaks were left uninhabitable by earthquake 
damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a solid rock foundation left the massive new Civic Arts Plaza with no 
damage -- even the scaffolding wasn't disturbed, Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's ever an 8.0 or 9.0 in Southern California, that's where I want to 
be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday is expected to waive permit fees for simple 
repairs such as replacing damaged water heaters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, city officials hope to have cost estimates on the damage suffered 
around Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst of it struck the Thousand Oaks Library, Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake shook loose sharp steel ceiling panels, which crashed to the 
floor and stabbed holes in the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken to calling it the 'Ginsu Ceiling,' " quipped library Director 
Marvin Smith, who said library officials are considering replacing the ceiling 
with something less dangerous.  
</P>
<P>
 Fire sprinkler heads over the children's section were sheared off in the 
temblor, and the resulting cascade of water soaked and ruined half the 
20,000-book children's collection and flooded the main floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the building is insured and structurally intact, and most of the library's 
300,000 books were saved, so the library could be reopened within a month, he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Newbury Park branch will take up the slack, adopting the 
main library's hours of 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith asked that patrons holding Thousand Oaks library books keep them until 
the library is reopened. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The Conejo Valley Unified School District is assessing what looked on Friday 
to be an estimated $300,000 to $500,000 worth of minor property damage, ranging 
from leaky pipes to cracked plaster, said Supt. Jerry Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 Aftershocks measured Wednesday at 5.1 on the Richter scale provided perfect 
earthquake drills, and "the kids responded remarkably," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Simi Valley school district, the Conejo Valley district is 
instructing counselors and school psychologists next week to be ready to soothe 
students' frayed nerves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With quake jitters keeping some students out of school, the district is also 
seeking waivers of state attendance requirements that otherwise could have cost 
the district a total of $20,000 to $40,000 in state funding because of 
absences, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, school officials said they were grateful that the district 
suffered only minimal damage in the earthquake. Though the schools could have 
reopened Tuesday morning, administrators waited until Wednesday to allow school 
employees and students and their families to get their lives back in order, 
said Greg Barker, a member of the Moorpark Unified School District Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's community college campus did not fare as well. Although classes 
resumed Wednesday at Moorpark College, both the library and the gymnasium were 
cordoned off and under repair for extensive quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lighting fixtures and air-conditioning ducts balanced precariously on metal 
beams after tremors loosened them from their moorings in the gym ceiling. 
College officials said the gym basketball court will stay closed about two 
weeks, although dance classes resumed in the gym's classrooms Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The library's classrooms are scheduled to reopen this week, but the college 
library itself will remain closed for weeks or even months, college officials 
said. They said they hoped to move some of the books to another location on 
campus so students can use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark city officials have begun editing their fledgling citywide disaster 
plan to include lessons learned in the Northridge quake, said Mayor Paul 
Lawrason. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellular phones the city bought for emergencies were useless for the first 
hour or so after the earthquake, which knocked out radio transponders 
supporting the system, Lawrason said.  
</P>
<P>
 However, service was restored quickly and the telephones proved vital to 
helping the city respond to the disaster, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lawrason said officials may consider including the city's walkie-talkie 
system in the disaster plan to bolster the communication network. 
</P>
<P>
 They also are reviewing their emergency broadcast system -- particularly in 
light of power outages that cut off information from the city's local-access 
cable to many Moorpark residents.

 Three years in the making, the Moorpark disaster plan should be finished and 
ready to go within six months, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Without any question, we will be doing more desktop simulations (of 
disasters), then some simulations right out there in the community," Lawrason 
said Friday. "This thing brings it right into focus that we really need to be 
prepared."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SIMI VALLEY, FILLMORE VICTIMS SEEK AID AND 
PREPARE FOR STORM; RECOVERY: RESIDENTS HURRY WITH REPAIRS TO BEAT THE EXPECTED 
RAIN. RED CROSS OPENS DISASTER CENTERS IN THE TWO CITIES.

<P>
 As hundreds of quake-shaken Ventura County residents sought help and money 
Saturday at disaster relief centers in hard-hit Simi Valley and Fillmore, 
homeowners patched broken roofs against the expected rain. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a 50% chance of rain by sunrise today, with a storm front that could 
bring up to half an inch moving in from the west, said Stuart Seto, a National 
Weather Service forecaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's rain probably will end tonight, but another storm could bring more 
precipitation to the region Monday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures for Ventura County are expected to be in the mid-60s today and in 
the high 30s tonight, Seto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists recorded a handful of aftershocks Saturday, but all registered a 
magnitude 3.2 or less on the Richter scale, far below Monday's 6.6-magnitude 
earthquake and aftershocks Wednesday that registered 5.1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross opened disaster service centers on the site of federal relief 
efforts at the Sycamore Drive Community Center in Simi Valley and the Fillmore 
Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross centers -- offering food, clothing, medicine, tools and other 
aid to quake victims -- will try to bridge any gaps left at the FEMA centers, 
which are run in the two cities by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
said Dennis Jennings, manager of the Simi Valley Red Cross center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to try to get (people) back on their feet and headed towards a 
normal life as quickly as possible," Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people in the four Red Cross emergency shelters had dwindled 
from 600 to 375, said Mike Goth, Red Cross emergency services director for 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Although water service was back on in both Simi Valley and Fillmore, Simi 
Valley officials issued a plea late Saturday for water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were still advising residents in Simi Valley and those living at 
Eldorado Mobile Home Estates in Fillmore to boil their water for drinking or 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday evening, building inspectors had nearly finished their rounds in 
Fillmore, having slapped red tags onto 236 residential and commercial buildings 
to declare them unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 298 buildings were labeled damaged and off-limits to unauthorized 
personnel or non-residents, Fillmore city building official Kevin McSweeney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday morning in Simi Valley, inspectors had declared 60 residences and 
other buildings -- including four churches and three schools -- unsafe, and 
another 256 buildings damaged, Deputy City Manager Jim Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, Scott and Rod Schrock wrestled thick plastic sheeting onto their 
sister's roof and a neighbor's roof to cover gaping holes left by fallen 
chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have it covered up on the roof with plastic so the rain 
doesn't come in and damage what the earthquake didn't," said Vicki Campbell, 
the men's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the building inspectors' OK to move back in, Campbell and next-door 
neighbor Kelly Scoles had to knock down what was left of the chimneys at their 
houses on 2nd Street. The Schrock brothers sweated away at the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "This old gal came out pretty well," Scoles said, nodding at shattered stucco 
ringing the house's intact foundation, as the men nailed plastic sheeting onto 
its damaged eaves. "These are good guys to do this for us." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, neighbors clambered over Cecile and Leon Crowningshield's 
roof, replacing tile that had slid off and shattered in the shuddering quake 
and aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are appreciating it. We were wondering how we were going to get the work 
done before the rain," Leon Crowningshield said as the work was nearing 
completion Saturday afternoon. "We think we have most of the bad places sealed, 
so we think there'll be no rain coming in to damage the interior." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Fillmore and Simi Valley, people moved out of condemned houses 
and kept appointments made earlier in the week with disaster aid centers in 
their cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The partial collapse of the brick, turn-of-the-century Fillmore Hotel had left 
dozens of migrant workers homeless, and many were afraid initially to seek aid 
at the disaster centers, said Efrain Villareal III, a state disaster worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Many stayed away from the centers "up until the point where they understood 
that we weren't going to ask about their (citizenship) status," Villareal said. 
"We do not ask. We do not care." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the centers have helped about 80 migrant laborers apply for disaster 
aid, he said, adding, "These people lost just about everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Some quake-damaged merchants were wondering whether they should rebuild at 
all, said Mark Frost, who helped hand out 90 applications for low-interest 
residential and business loans from the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had people not sure if they ever want to get into business again," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while other merchants suffered massive structural damage and lost all 
their inventory to the earthquakes, "They're basically positive" about the 
recovery, Frost said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast with the long lines, hot tempers and confusion reported at centers 
in San Fernando Valley, the quake victims were well-behaved in Ventura County, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's very cordial with everyone," Villareal said. "There's no pushing, 
no shoving, no fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday evening, the disaster aid center in Fillmore had processed 224 
applications for help from earthquake victims, said Earl Armstrong of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, the disaster aid center had processed about 600 of the more 
than 3,000 applicants from that city, along with some San Fernando Valley 
residents, FEMA spokesman Hugh Darby said. The center probably will be 
processing aid requests for another two to three weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The applicants' emotions were still scraped raw by their weeklong ordeal, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in several disasters and earthquakes," said Valinda, a state 
Department of Social Services worker who declined to give her last name. "And 
this by far is the most devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still in shock," she said. "Many of them believed they were 
actually going to die. And by the time they get to our table, they're still 
tearful and shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the room at the Sycamore Drive Community Center, men with fresh-combed 
hair mingled with those sporting 5-day beards. Here and there, injured 
applicants cradled fresh wrist casts and thumb splints. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 people have applied so far for low-interest home and business 
repair loans from the Small Business Administration, said its representative, 
Chuck Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hap Phillips was looking for whatever help he could get. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake left the Simi Valley mortgage banker's condo-cum-workplace 
uninhabitable and put him in the line for unemployment benefits as well as a 
small business loan and help with housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way I'd let my family go back in there," he said of his ruined 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Marino dandled 2-month-old daughter Cassandra on her knee while 
seeking government money to pay for her toppled fireplace, ruined air 
conditioner and damaged roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a heating guy check our heating," Marino said. "He put sheet metal 
screws in, and it cost $145, so I think we got gouged. We don't have a lot of 
money as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake victims should be wary with contractors during the recovery and 
avoid those who appear to charge unreasonably high fees, said Allan Widmeyer of 
the Contractors State License Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of opportunists out there trying to make a lot more than 
they're legally allowed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beware of unrealistic promises for quick work or prices that seem exorbitant, 
he said. If rebuilding with a loan, get an estimate from the lender and compare 
it with a contractor's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 And check the contractor's license number and performance record with the 
licensing board by calling 800-962-1125, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors and homeowners alike kept cash registers busy at hardware stores 
such as Home Base in Simi Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 There, customers were buying a lot of plywood, plumber's tape, tarps, 
flashlights, batteries and flexible hookups for water heaters, clerk Bryan 
Sprague said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard stories about people living in their tent, about not being able 
to get assistance fast, about kids being dirty and people being tired," Sprague 
said. "People are frazzled." 
</P>
<P>
 Sprague said two fistfights flared Friday over new water heaters that were 
being held for customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garrity, a Simi Valley contractor, was buying plywood to repair his 
house.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing work for the neighbors over the last few days," Garrity said. 
"Now it's time for me to get started on my own stuff. I came out pretty lucky. 
It'll probably just be a day's work."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; TEMBLOR EXPOSES CRACKS IN CITIES' ABILITY TO 
HANDLE DISASTERS; PREPAREDNESS: WEST COUNTY AREAS THAT AVOIDED MAJOR LOSSES 
GLEANED VALUABLE LESSONS ON HOW TO RESPOND TO CALAMITIES.

 Norm Wilkinson knows Santa Paula got off easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst result of Monday's earthquake was the toppling of a dozen chimneys 
-- and they fell during an aftershock, said Wilkinson, the city's director of 
public works. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own hillside home, just one tiny vase broke. 
</P>
<P>
 But like officials in other Ventura County cities that escaped with only minor 
damage, Wilkinson said the temblor revealed cracks in the city's ability to 
respond to a major disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 And it provided important lessons on how local government can better prepare 
for the next one, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to think we had few problems because of good planning," 
Wilkinson said. "But it was really just good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only by flukes of geography that cities in western Ventura County 
avoided the structural losses and injuries seen in the more easterly cities of 
Simi Valley, Moorpark, Thousand Oaks and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Those cities, closer to the quake's epicenter in the San Fernando Valley, have 
suffered an estimated $1 billion in damage to businesses, homes and government 
buildings, and injury totals have climbed to 800. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard, by contrast, suffered an estimated $100,000 in property damages, and 
Santa Paula counted about $50,000 in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Port Hueneme, Ojai, Camarillo and Ventura, meanwhile, said damage 
to their cities is so slight that no monetary estimate is being made. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the minor damage -- and apparent lack of serious injury -- in west 
county cities, leaders there know that things could be quite different next 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is riddled with more than 300 faults, and seismologists say it 
is ripe for an earthquake. A temblor of magnitude 6 or greater on the Richter 
scale could occur any time, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Northridge quake has taught several valuable lessons, said Tom 
Frutchey, Oxnard's city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we were extremely lucky this time," Frutchey said. "It was a 
wake-up call for us to improve our operations." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest damage to west county cities occurred in Oxnard, where minor 
cracks appeared on arches and exterior columns at the city's newly built 
central library, Frutchey said. Access to Santa Clara Church is being 
restricted because its belfry tilted during the quake, posing a danger with its 
two-ton bell, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And several city office buildings had to be cleaned up after filing cabinets 
and desks were strewn about, Frutchey said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's Fire Department responded to 137 calls on Monday, mostly for minor 
gas and water leaks, fallen chimneys and downed power lines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, no significant damage was reported until Wednesday, when two 
strong aftershocks sent about a dozen brick chimneys toppling over, said public 
works Director Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage in Ventura, Camarillo, Ojai and Port Hueneme was so minor that in some 
cases, officials were not sure whether problems were quake-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found some minor cracks in a pumping station," said Port Hueneme City 
Manager Dick Velthoen. "But it's hard to say whether they were there before or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 Most city officials agreed that that quake showed them they lacked enough 
generators, cellular phones, two-way radios and water tankers -- equipment that 
became essential in more seriously affected areas when utilities gave out. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for more reliable communications became especially clear in Oxnard 
following the quake, Frutchey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatchers sending public works crews to check out areas for structural 
damage were using batteries after the power went out, he said. But the 
batteries soon went dead and the dispatch orders ceased. 
</P>
<P>
 Work crews also wasted time responding to calls about major damage that turned 
out to be false, said Robert Elliott, Oxnard's director of emergency 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott said he will ask the City Council to purchase stocks of cellular 
phones and two-way radios to keep communications flowing during a crisis. He 
will also recommend that Neighborhood Watch patrols be trained to quickly and 
accurately report damage in their areas.  
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo, City Manager Bill Little said that in the first hours after the 
quake, city employees had radio and telephone communication problems. He said 
the city is looking to purchase more walkie-talkies and cellular phones as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, portable electrical generators to power the city's water wells will also 
be bought to assure water delivery to residents in the event of quake-related 
power outages. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities also must push state transportation authorities for money to strengthen 
overpasses and bridges, many local government leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials temporarily closed down the Channel Islands Boulevard bridge 
that spans California 1 because structural engineers noticed new one-inch-wide 
cracks, Oxnard's Elliott said. The California Department of Transportation 
reopened the bridge after inspecting it and determining that it is structurally 
sound but will need work in the near future, Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
 In older cities, special attention also should be paid to structures made of 
unreinforced masonry, considered the most likely to collapse during an 
earthquake, city leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 That point was demonstrated most dramatically in Ojai, where the historic 
downtown arcade rode out the temblor with no more damage than a few plaster 
chips flying off. The city had spent $1.7 million to reinforce the arcade, 
built in 1917, and the effort paid off, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "City staff said if we wouldn't have made (the reinforcement), we might have 
lost it," Ojai Mayor Steve Olsen said. "You'd think that other cities that have 
unreinforced masonry buildings would at least now become advocates for 
reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Less costly disaster preparations that city officials plan to make include 
training Neighborhood Watch patrols to quickly assess and report property 
damage; bolting filing cabinets, bookshelves and other heavy furniture to 
walls, and updating telephone lists for people who must immediately respond 
after a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The point, city leaders agreed, is to be as prepared as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's an 8.0 and we fall off into the ocean, how can you prepare for that?" 
said Port Hueneme's Velthoen. "But we have learned some things."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; COUNTY'S TOP BOOKKEEPER EXPECTS TOUGH FIGHT IN 
JUNE ELECTION; POLITICS: TWO POSSIBLE CHALLENGERS MAY OPPOSE AUDITOR-CONTROLLER 
THOMAS O. MAHON, WHO WOULD RATHER BALANCE BOOKS THAN COURT VOTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas O. Mahon is an unlikely politician. 
</P>
<P>
 A quiet man with a shy smile, Mahon would much rather spend his time combing 
through Ventura County's complicated accounting books than schmoozing with 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is also a man who wants to keep his job as the county's head 
bookkeeper. And he knows he will have to fight for it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in nearly 20 years, the election for the county 
auditor-controller post, which pays nearly $115,000 annually in salary and 
benefits, is expected to be hotly contested. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon, who was appointed by the Board of Supervisors last January to complete 
Norman R. Hawkes' term after Hawkes retired, faces possible challenges from 
Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton and Ventura accountant Scott A. Weiss in the 
June election. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton -- a shrewd politician who has held office on Simi Valley's City 
Council for 14 years -- already has pledged to spend $100,000 on the campaign, 
an unheard-of amount in most county races. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon, who labored for 17 years as the county's assistant auditor-controller, 
says he will try to match that amount in the June election. And at an age when 
most county officials have long since retired, Mahon, 70, said he is hoping his 
accounting experience will help carry him through the election. 
</P>
<P>
 But one county supervisor said Mahon could be vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "He still has to put his own personal stamp on the position," Supervisor John 
K. Flynn said. "He is kind of second in command, still trying to make that 
transition to the top job." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the core of his supporters includes an array of the county's top 
officials, who say the accountant is one of the main reasons the government has 
stayed solvent through the worst financial downturn in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is independent-minded but at the same time very concerned about the 
taxpayer," Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton, however, says the auditor-controller is not free-thinking enough. He 
said he believes Mahon, as the county's top financial watchdog, should be 
taking a tougher look at internal operations and proposing drastic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been an accountant for the county but not an independent accountant," 
Stratton said. "Yeah, you can count the money, but you don't think 
independently and you don't rock the boat. Mahon thinks that's his job and 
frankly, that's the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon agrees that his first priority is to make sure the county is fiscally 
sound. But he says he is not afraid of a fight and will take on the county's 
department heads if it means making operations more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Mahon conducted a variety of audits of county departments plagued 
with financial problems. His most notable report was on the county's Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon found that the Fire Department was top-heavy with managers, spends too 
much on overtime and is lax with sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything is getting out of line, we make sure that we are taking steps to 
correct the situation," Mahon said. "The idea is to be a change agent. It's not 
to go in there and yell at someone who is doing something wrong, but to go in 
there and improve the department." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials complained that Mahon did not have a clear understanding of the 
department's emergency functions. They said he was trying to run the Fire 
Department as if it were a regular county office. But the supervisors praised 
Mahon's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mahon's audit of the Fire Department, the Board of Supervisors agreed to 
form a citizens committee to recommend ways to fix the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows what he is talking about," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. "He gets 
things done accurately. . . . The biggest thing about Tom is he does the job he 
has to do and he doesn't have to be a flashy kind of person." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he could be showy -- if he wanted to, Kildee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at his track record," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon, who has an MBA from New York University, joined the county in 1970 as 
an accountant but was quickly promoted to the assistant auditor-controller's 
position under Hawkes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a week or two it was very obvious that he had a lot more talent than 
just a bookkeeper," said Hawkes, who retired in December, 1992, halfway through 
his fourth term. "Tom had an insight into financial matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said he was simply glad to find a job he liked. 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking a position with the county, Mahon had been running a Chevrolet 
dealership in Ojai, where he and his wife, Mary, were rearing their 11 
children.

 Lured by the warm climate, Mahon -- who grew up in Illinois -- had moved his 
family to Ojai in 1957 after working for two years as a manager in Mexico City 
for Mobil Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't suited to selling automobiles," Mahon said. "Selling is an art, 
a technique. I just wasn't good at it." 
</P>
<P>
 But accounting came easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun," said Mahon, who received his undergraduate education at West 
Point before serving in World War II. "There's a great sense of accomplishment. 
You enjoy coming to work." 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Mahon would often stay late at work to figure out ways the 
county could make the most of its money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never known if he would be home for dinner," said Mahon's wife, to whom 
he has been married for 47 years. "Years and years ago I learned we could be 
sitting here waiting until 10 p.m. "Now I just leave a plate for him in the 
refrigerator. He just microwaves it when he gets home." 
</P>
<P>
 Noticing Mahon's determination to work, Hawkes expanded Mahon's authority as 
assistant auditor-controller. Mahon was put in charge of overseeing the staff 
and giving financial updates to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really a politician," Hawkes said. "I liked to get out and talk to 
people. Tom was the one that ran the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators say Mahon is largely the reason the county has maintained high 
marks with national credit-rating companies, despite state funding cuts and a 
downturn in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lot of accolades over the years," Hawkes said. "I was on state and 
national boards, where a lot of things we did in Ventura County were used as 
models. But Tom was the one who really made that office." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mahon always remained loyal to Hawkes, he hoped someday to have his 
job. When Hawkes decided to step down as auditor-controller in 1992, Mahon was 
anxious to take the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's everyone's goal to go to the top of their profession," Mahon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted unanimously to allow Mahon to complete Hawkes' term, which 
ends in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Hawkes, Mahon has not embraced the political aspects of the office -- 
which some officials say could prove to be a detriment to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said he would much rather make sure the office is running smoothly than 
get embroiled in heated debates and shaking up the establishment, as Stratton 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 He shrugs and adds: "Maybe this is the way you do it in politics, but it's not 
the way I run an office. Maybe I'm too much of an auditor and not enough of a 
politician."

RESTAURANT AND STORE HELD UP IN SEPARATE CASES

 In two apparently unrelated incidents, armed robbers burst into a Thousand 
Oaks restaurant and a Ventura drug store this weekend, brandishing handguns and 
leaving with fistfuls of stolen cash, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, four men walked through the rear door of the Sizzler at 401 
N. Moorpark Road at 11:30 p.m. Friday after the restaurant had closed for the 
night, sheriff's deputies said.Clutching handguns, the men forced the employees 
to a back room and made them lie on the floor, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men then took the restaurant manager to the office and had him open 
the safe, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking an unknown amount of cash from the safe, the four men left the 
restaurant, climbed into a large dark-blue four-door car and drove south on 
Moorpark Road, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local law enforcement agencies searched the area, but the suspects were not 
found, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other incident took place at 10:45 p.m. Friday at Sav-On Drugs on 
Telegraph Road in Ventura. A man walked up to employee Bruce Bennett, who was 
working in the photo department, displayed a handgun and demanded money, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman -- described as a Hispanic male, about 35 years old, 5 foot 10 and 
160 pounds -- fled the store with the cash, said police, who are still 
searching for the suspect.

FEWER STUDENTS REGISTER IN AREA COLLEGES

 Ventura County's community colleges enrolled about 5% fewer students for the 
current term than last spring, college district officials said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials held out hope earlier in the month that enrollment figures 
might be up a bit from last spring -- a rise that would offset a 12% plunge in 
enrollment between fall, 1992, and fall, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But with enrollment numbers down again, administrators said Friday they could 
face cuts of up to $1.25 million from the district's 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Marsee, the district's vice chancellor for administrative services, said 
the district's preliminary enrollment, following mail and in-person 
registration, is 23,749 students for spring, 1994. Final figures will not be 
available until after students finish adding and dropping classes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College enrolled 9,528 students, Ventura College enrolled 9,249, and 
Oxnard College registered 4,972, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's community college districts receive extra funding for each extra 
student enrolled, up to a limit determined individually for each district. The 
Ventura County Community College District, like many districts, has enrolled 
students above its limit for so long that the maximum funding level has become 
a base amount that officials rely upon in planning their yearly budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the Ventura district might fall below its limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsee said administrators will ask district trustees to put at least $1 
million of the district's 1994-95 budget in reserves in anticipation of state 
funding cuts.

ACCORD ENDS FIGHT OVER REDEVELOPMENT

<P>
 A long-running fight over Thousand Oaks' downtown Redevelopment Agency has 
officially ended, as both the Board of Supervisors and the Thousand Oaks City 
Council have approved a contract that allocates some tax money to the county 
and reserves some for city improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement accepted last week, the city will send a certain 
percentage of its redevelopment funds to the county each year.That percentage 
will increase as the Redevelopment Agency collects more money from property 
taxes along Thousand Oaks Boulevard, jumping in stages from 20% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 While sending money to the county, Thousand Oaks will get to keep substantial 
sums for its own improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for building an auditorium at Newbury Park High School, a stadium 
at Westlake High School and affordable housing throughout the city. The city 
also hopes to spruce up landscaping along Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise quick cash for the redevelopment projects, the city will issue up to 
$120 million in bonds, to be repaid by the property tax revenue increases.

CATCH BASINS FOR MOBILE CAR WASHERS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mobile car washers in Thousand Oaks will have to collect all runoff from dirty 
vehicles to comply with a new anti-pollution law -- a requirement that could 
force them to raise prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about grit and grime washing down city storm drains, the Thousand 
Oaks City Council has passed an ordinance requiring all mobile car washers to 
set up special catch basins when they scrub vehicles.The catch basins, which 
resemble vinyl rafts, cost about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to buying the catch basins, each mobile carwash company will have 
to pay the city about $500 a year to cover the cost of enforcing the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've just screwed the customers," Lance Winslow, owner of the Car Wash 
Guys, said after last week's vote. "Now we're going to have to charge $10 
instead of $5." 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow also tried to dissuade the council from requiring catch basins by 
telling them that the vinyl rafts "come in orange and other bright colors, and 
they look terrible in a parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 But several council members said they believed it only fair to impose the 
catch-basin requirement on mobile auto scrubbers, especially since the owners 
of drive-through carwashes have to install similar devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental activist Cassandra Auerbach agreed, telling the council that the 
need for catch basins would become obvious "if you could see some of the gunk 
that's collected off cars -- it's disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance passed last week also restricts mobile car washers from working 
in parking lots in front of strip malls, though they can set up their 
operations in back.

SUSPECT CAUGHT, WITH AN ASSIST FROM POLICE DOG

 Police used a dog to subdue an Oxnard man after the man led them on a 
high-speed chase through Oxnard and Port Hueneme early Saturday morning, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Octavio Morales Rivera, 20, was arrested at 4:20 a.m. after police said he led 
them on a high speed chase, ignoring red lights and exceeding 85 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme police said they initially attempted to stop Rivera because his 
car fit the description of a vehicle used in a shooting on West Juniper Street 
in Oxnard.No one was injured in the shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase ended when Rivera turned onto a dead-end street and stepped out of 
his car. But police said that even after he had been stopped, Rivera refused to 
cooperate with officers. When Rivera reached for his belt, a Port Hueneme 
officer released his dog to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera was subdued by the dog, arrested, and later treated for dog bites. 
Police said they found a sawed-off shotgun near Rivera.

PANEL OKS PLANS FOR NORTHEAST OXNARD PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A blueprint for the long-term development of 737 acres of farmland in 
northeast Oxnard has received the final approval of the city's Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northeast Community Specific Plan, approved unanimously by the commission 
Thursday, will now go to the City Council for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, the plan would allow the construction of 3,075 housing units and 
enough commercial and industrial projects to create 5,057 jobs. Two middle 
schools and a high school also would be built, with the city gaining access to 
the school grounds for use as public parks. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the planning process, an agreement was struck between the three 
school districts and the area's 10 landowners that calls for building fees to 
furnish enough revenues to build the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The extensive plan, which has been under study for three years, regulates 
building design and specifies how public areas will be landscaped and designed. 
The plan also requires that 10% of all housing be for low-income residents and 
another 10% for high-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire project would be built in three phases. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners praised the goals of the plan, which calls for the development 
of separate mixed-use "villages" within the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the plan," said Chairman Ralph Schumacher. "I like the mixed-use 
concept and think it will be good for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 "The northeast community is a milestone for Oxnard and will provide a 
well-balanced community," said Commissioner Arthur Lopez.

OXNARD MAN FINDS BOMB NEAR CAR

 An Oxnard man found a pipe bomb near his car moments after his business' 
pickup truck had burned, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police notified Rodolfo Perez just after 3 a.m. Saturday that the pickup truck 
at Perez's tire business had caught fire.As he walked to his car to drive to 
his business, he noticed a red flame spurting from what appeared to be a pipe 
bomb, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who lives on the 1900 block of Lennox Court, put out the flame with a 
garden hose, then drove to Rudy's Tire Shop at 800 E. 5th St., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Perez told police about the water-drenched pipe bomb, they called in the 
county Sheriff's Department bomb squad, which took the device to the 
department's special "bomb bunker" near Camarillo Airport, deputies said. The 
bomb turned out to be live and was deactivated, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police said they are still investigating the two incidents.

SURFING AMBASSADOR PITCHES SWELL SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From his cramped kitchen that doubles as an office, Bruce Hopping is burning 
the midnight oil, pounding out yet another nightly blitz of faxes. 
Destinations: Rio de Janeiro, Morocco and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nighttime is the only time I get to reach people in other countries because 
of the time differences," Hopping said, "so I rise every day about 10:30 in the 
morning and I don't get to bed till 3 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 His habits are those of an investment banker. But portfolios are not his 
interest. Hopping is Orange County's surfing ambassador. He has spent more than 
two decades as an organizer of international surfing contests and has helped 
introduce that sport to Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, Hopping sent dispatches first to Brazil for an upcoming 
cultural exchange with U.S. surfers and Brazilians scheduled for May, then to 
Morocco, thanking the government for its help during a visit in December, and 
then Greece, where Hopping is sponsoring a trip in August for an all-star water 
polo team from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 At 78, you would think he would slow down. But he hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Hopping accompanied U.S. amateur surf teams that visited Tahiti, 
Bali, Barbados and Morocco. In addition, he scouted surfing venues in Western 
Samoa and visited Florida's International Swimming Hall of Fame, where he sits 
on the hall's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a wealthy New Jersey family, Hopping was vice president of his 
father's lumber company and transferred a portion of its assets into the Kalos 
Kagathos Foundation, a private, nonprofit organization he formed in 1953. Kalos 
Kagathos translates from Greek to "physical distinction, nobility of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my goal when I founded the foundation to put athletic fitness on a 
pedestal, much like the Greeks did," Hopping said. "I'm trying to perpetuate 
something started thousands of years ago in Athens to mix academics with 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
 He is venerated in the sports community. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people like to get excited about organizing these different events 
and then they quit. Bruce doesn't," said Jim Machado, a north San Diego County 
surfing coach who took a foundation-sponsored team on an historic visit to 
Vietnam two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't take no for an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Vietnam, where his parents served as diplomats, Hopping grew up in 
Port Newark, N.J., served as a U.S. Army pilot during World War II, and joined 
the Navy in the 1950s. He was a swimmer and later a swimming coach at the 
Navy's Bainbridge, Md., basic training center. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the Navy, Hopping formed the foundation and moved to Laguna Beach, 
where he has been an outspoken activist and frequently a critic of the school 
district and city over the years. He has, among other things, urged local high 
schools to drop football, which he considers too dangerous, and increase their 
aquatic sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation organizes trips abroad and offers scholarships to athletes who 
can't afford the travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly the foundation's most significant, and controversial, trip was to 
China Beach in Vietnam in 1992. Before leaving, Vietnam veterans and others 
complained that the trip was helping a Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip, with its obvious symbolism for a group of returning Americans, 
received worldwide media coverage and was credited for paving the way for the 
first professional surfing meet in Vietnam, held a year later.

STUFFED SHIRTS FAIR GAME FOR PRANKSTERS; HUMOR: CACOPHONY SOCIETY, FOUNDED 
SEVEN YEARS AGO IN SAN FRANCISCO, RECENTLY FORMED CHAPTERS IN LOS ANGELES AND 
SEATTLE. HOLIDAY EVENTS INCLUDED A RALLY TO SAVE 'FREE-RANGE' CRANBERRIES AND A 
NASAL CHRISTMAS CONCERT BY 'BOB DYLAN HOLIDAY CHOIR.' 
</P>

 A volunteer rings a bell and invites shoppers to help themselves to coins in a 
pot. An "activist" rallies to save "free-range" cranberries. A Bob Dylan 
Holiday Choir brays nasal Christmas carols. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystified? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you're a little too uptight for the Cacophony Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Amused? You may already be a member. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be involved you just do it," said Cacophony Society member Jason Rackerby, 
known in underground circles as Yahoon Doorstop. "There's no membership fees or 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who love a good prank have a home at Cacophony. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thanksgiving in Seattle, Cacophony members held an "Uncan the Cranberries" 
protest at a shopping area, urging shoppers to "save the free-range cranberry." 
Another "activist" urged "adult children of parents" to stay home for the 
holidays to avoid family gatherings that encourage "dysfunctionality and 
substance abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a "volunteer" rang a bell and invited passers-by to take coins from 
a pot -- sort of the Salvation Army in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, the group sponsored a Seattle "Bob Dylan Holiday Choir." 
Singers did their best -- or worst -- Dylan impersonations while braying 
"Jingle Bells," "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" and "Winter Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
 "That was interesting," Rackerby said. "Most people ignored us, but one street 
musician questioned why we called ourselves the Bob Dylan Choir if he (Dylan) 
wasn't there. This guy claimed Bob Dylan could sing." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Founded seven years ago in San Francisco, the Cacophony Society has recently 
formed chapters in Los Angeles and Seattle. It describes itself as "a randomly 
gathered network of free spirits united in the pursuit of experiences beyond 
the pale of mainstream society." 
</P>
<P>
 Cacophony has roots in San Francisco's underground Suicide Club, a group 
founded in the mid-1970s by Gary Warne, a man with a terminal heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before he died, he wanted to experience everything in life, to live each day 
as if it was the last," Rackerby said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of its legendary antics was turning an elevator in San Francisco's posh 
Sir Francis Drake hotel into a "shower." When guests tried to enter the 
elevator, they were greeted by a few nude people, complete with shower caps, 
suds and back scrubbers, feigning horror at someone barging in on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The group disbanded in 1979. Cacophony was formed two years after Warne died. 
</P>
<P>
 "Primarily, we have a great sense of humor and we like to cultivate that. Too 
much of life is just too serious," said a 48-year-old computer consultant and 
six-year Cacophony member who uses the pseudonym Maxwell Maude. 
</P>
<P>
 One time, Cacophony members dressed as clowns and stationed themselves at 
stops along a San Francisco bus route. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every few stops, one or two clowns would be standing at a bus stop. And 
they'd pretend they didn't know each other -- until the bus was half full of 
clowns. The driver got so rattled he failed to stop for clowns after that," 
Maude said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outfit made headlines a few years ago with the Sewer Tour in Oakland. 
Participants dressed in tuxedos or evening gowns and put on hip waders to make 
their way through watery underground passages.

UCLA READY FOR LIFE AT THE TOP; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BRUINS PULL AWAY FROM SUN 
DEVILS, 98-81, TO KEEP RECORD PERFECT AND ASSURE THEMSELVES OF NO. 1 RANKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Better file a traffic report on this one. The Arizona State Sun Devils were 
run over, 98-81, Saturday afternoon at Pauley Pavilion, then picked themselves 
off the floor and had only one question: 
</P>
<P>
 Did anyone get the number of that team? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that would be No. 1, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 In an afternoon of rainbow three-pointers and rim-swaying dunks, UCLA became 
college basketball's front-runner, at least for a week, and assured itself of 
the top spot in the rankings when the new poll comes out Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Shon Tarver believes this can mean only one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just so happens now we're No. 1 officially," he said. "The spotlight is on 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it is, not long after its warm glow had cooled on its previous subjects 
(see North Carolina, Duke, Arkansas and Kansas). 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins await the new Associated Press poll with impressive credentials -- 
a 13-0 record, 6-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference -- and a keen sense of those 
fallen teams in whose sneaker prints they now follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great honor to be ranked No. 1, but you can't get too carried away, 
you know," Charles O'Bannon said. "I mean, it's only January." 
</P>
<P>
 Also lending itself to a sense of caution is the matter of the No. 
1-for-a-week syndrome. Well, maybe, O'Bannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are aware of that, but those are other teams, not us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went in the UCLA locker room, where bravado and good humor abounded, 
qualities that were sometimes in short supply a little earlier on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 All five starters reached double figures -- led by Ed O'Bannon and Tyus Edney 
with 21 points. As nice as that was for the Bruins, they enjoyed equally good 
fortune with a 15-rebound advantage and a bedeviling defensive strategy that 
took away Arizona State's chief weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harrick spread out his defenders to try to limit Stevin Smith, Isaac 
Burton, and Ron Riley, all impresarios of the three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. Arizona State made only seven of 25 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, 6-foot-9 Mario Bennett took advantage of the spread-out 
defense and scored 26 points in 37 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon assessed the strategy: "We won the game, so I guess it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 True enough, although the Bruins weren't able to put some distance between 
themselves and Arizona State until the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA led at halftime, 48-41, behind Tarver's 13 points, but Arizona State tied 
the score, 64-64, with 11:34 remaining on a dunk by Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Up stepped Cameron Dollar, the freshman guard who had exactly one 
three-pointer this season. Dollar spotted up behind the line and calmly made 
his second. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollar had a conversation with himself on the way back downcourt. "I said, 
'Wow, we're up three now,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney made it five on a drive through the middle and, after the Sun Devils had 
scored, kept it at five with a driving layup. 
</P>
<P>
 The game's biggest back-to-back plays were then performed by Ed O'Bannon. 
First, he rejected Dwayne Fontana inside, then raced downcourt, took a pass 
from Edney and rammed the ball through the hoop so hard, the standard swayed 
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to make sure," O'Bannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 And with a victory so close, UCLA made absolutely certain. The Bruins made 12 
free throws in the last 3:47, needing only two field goals, both by Ed 
O'Bannon, to turn a nine-point margin into 17. 
</P>
<P>
 All that was left was to count up the votes and see who is No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see us matching up with anyone in the country, pretty much," said Edney, 
who has 47 points in his last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State Coach Bill Frieder was lavish in his praise of UCLA and how it 
deserves to be ranked No. 1, at least to a limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They beat Arizona decisively and they beat us decisively," he said. "I'm not 
saying they're going to win the national championship and I'm not saying three 
weeks from now they will be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's own critique of the Bruins' ranking was sort of limited, curtailed 
to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told us not to say anything about it," Bennett said. "I don't want to cause 
any controversy. They are a good team that beat us on one of our bad days. 
That's the best way I can put it." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick put it his way. 
</P>
<P>
 "(No. 1) is something we've strived for and it's nice to reach that pinnacle, 
but we've got a lot of work to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the poll comes out Monday night, the Bruins play Thursday at Stanford 
and next Sunday at California. 
</P>
<P>
 "That should be interesting," Ed O'Bannon said. "They're going to be gunning 
for us, plain and simply, because not only are we No. 1, but we've got UCLA 
stenciled on our chests."

IN A 9-8 GAME, GOALIE IS MVP; NHL ALL-STAR GAME: RICHTER STANDS OUT, THWARTING 
THREE BURE BREAKAWAYS. EAST RALLIES TO BEAT WEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stopping 19 of the 21 shots in Saturday's NHL All-Star game was easy for New 
York Ranger goaltender Mike Richter. His real challenge will be finding a 
parking space near his Manhattan apartment for a new truck, awarded him for 
being voted the most valuable player in the Eastern Conference's 9-8 victory 
over the West, played before a sellout crowd of 18,200 at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a car and I can't park it near my place, so I park it in a different 
area," said Richter, whose spectacular second-period performance included saves 
on three breakaways by Pavel Bure. "How much will they charge to park this? 
Probably too much. I don't know. I never won one before." 
</P>
<P>
 Richter's effort kept the game close enough for the East to rally in the third 
period on goals by Pittsburgh right wing Joe Mullen -- who grew up about 15 
blocks north of the Garden -- Quebec's Joe Sakic, former King Bob Kudelski and 
Ottawa rookie Alexei Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 10 chances on him, for sure," said Bure, the Vancouver Canucks' right 
wing. "I think I would need another 10 to score on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kudelski victimized St. Louis goalie Curtis Joseph and tied the score, 8-8, 
with 6:01 to play by converting a centering pass from Mark Messier. Yashin 
scored the decisive goal with 3:42 left, when he beat Joseph with a wrist shot 
from close range. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was better than I ever dreamed," said Kudelski, who was traded from Ottawa 
to Florida after being added to the East team. "I figured it would be a 
high-scoring game, with all the talent we have, but it was competitive all the 
way to the end. Certainly a lot more competitive than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-6 debacle in 1993 spurred cries for change and led to the introduction 
of a $5,000 prize for each member of the winning team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money's money, but you go out there and get in the game and you just want to 
win. It's like when you were a kid and the adrenaline takes over," said Ranger 
forward Adam Graves, who had two assists, as did the Kings' Wayne Gretzky, 
tying Gordie Howe at 19 for the all-time lead. "You don't think about things 
like money in a situation like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barry Melrose of the Kings, the West Conference coach: "The players have 
a lot of pride and they came committed to playing harder. You can still have 
fun, still show their talents and skills, which they did tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 There was little checking -- the hardest hit was an accidental collision 
between Flyer teammates Eric Lindros and Mark Recchi in the first period -- but 
the goalies' acrobatics and the passing of Bure and Sergei Fedorov entertained 
the crowd and the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a joy to just watch those two," said King defenseman Rob Blake, a 
first-time all-star. "That's why the All-Star game is so exciting. You just 
learn so much from watching these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional level and rapid-fire scoring delighted NHL officials. The teams 
alternated goals through the first period, which ended with the West ahead, 
4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh gave the West a 6-4 lead at 14:39 of the 
second period, but the East replied at 15:05, after goalie Arturs Irbe lost his 
footing while leaving the net to clear the puck and left Messier an open net. 
The teams alternated goals again into the third period, until Sakic, Kudelski 
and Yashin scored consecutive goals in a span of 5:37. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't too bad a score, I guess," Joseph said. "I was just trying to get 
out of there with my skin with those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Burke, the NHL senior vice president who had implored both teams to 
avoid another rout, said Saturday's result was close to ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was outstanding," he said. "I don't think it was my appeal to 
anybody that did it, and I don't think it's the money. I don't think that when 
they drop the puck, too many players would think of the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Melrose: "There were good saves, great plays, close calls, a little bit 
of bumping. I thought from the league's point of view, it's starting to go in 
the direction they want to go."

SWITZERLAND SCORES TWO GOALS, ONE FOR UNITED STATES IN 1-1 TIE; SOCCER: OWN 
GOAL OFF DEFENDER EGLI IN 88TH MINUTE BRINGS AMERICANS TO EVEN AT FULLERTON.

<P>
 Much was known but little was revealed Saturday, when the U.S. national soccer 
team tied the national team of Switzerland, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite soccer's taboo against meeting a World Cup opponent before the 
tournament, the two Group A teams played before a capacity crowd of 10,173 at 
Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The players will probably be different when they meet again, in their first 
World Cup match on June 18 at the Pontiac Silverdome, so that all but defused 
concerns about the game revealing too much tactical information about either 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Key players for both teams are still with their European clubs and, with each 
coach making five substitutions on Saturday, little can be gleaned from player 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game has no connection whatsoever with the game in June," Swiss Coach 
Roy Hodgson said. "The American team we will see in June will be totally 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team played tentatively in the first half, giving the Swiss space. As 
the warm day took its toll on the Swiss, the United States attacked in the 
second half for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Americans could not finish the few quality chances afforded them by 
a solid Swiss back line. They tied the score when Cobi Jones chipped a cross 
into the penalty area, in the general direction of teammate Alexi Lalas, who 
was tangling with Swiss defender Andre Egli. The shot went off Egli's head into 
the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Egli accepted responsibility for the goal with grace. Play professional soccer 
for 16 years, he said, and you will probably score an own goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intended to hit the ball into the corner," he said. "But it went into the 
net. Lalas was pushing me from behind, but it was correctly done. Lalas is a 
very competitive guy. He likes to work with his arms and elbows. But it was 
correct. Clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Play was rugged, with four yellow cards. U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel watched 
the shoving and pushing with bemusement. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play in an English style," he said, referring more to the Swiss' feisty 
approach than style. "They were going for a tackle, and they'd give you a stud 
(spike). And it's just friendly. It was like the first round of a boxing 
match." 
</P>
<P>
 With the lineup changes, little rhythm was established in the first half. 
Jones started on the right side but was switched to the left. Lalas was moved 
to central defender, and Desmond Armstrong was moved to the right. Coach Bora 
Milutinovic got another look at Claudio Reyna and Dario Brose. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half was more lively, especially after the Swiss goal spurred the 
United States to take chances. The goal was set up by a shot from Switzerland's 
Nestor Subiat. That was blocked by Friedel, but the rebound was kicked in by 
Sebastien Fournier in the 65th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. goal came in the 88th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 But what was learned? The United States got a good look at a counterattacking 
team that is opportunistic and dangerous. The Swiss saw a team that was fit and 
learning to organize itself more consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the Swiss) react well to changing situations," U.S. assistant Timo 
Liekoski said. "When they get the ball, they love to play it forward quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Tying the Swiss, Lalas said, "shows we can hang."

TENNIS / AUSTRALIAN OPEN; SAMPRAS POWERS PAST LENDL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Sampras praised Ivan Lendl after burying him in a fourth-round showdown 
of big servers today at the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Sampras served 19 aces in a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) victory 
over the 15th-seeded Lendl, then paid tribute to the player who helped him 
develop his physical and mental toughness. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 17, Sampras went to Lendl's home in Connecticut to train with the 
man then ranked No. 2 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ivan will go down as one of the greatest of all time," said Sampras, who 
rallied from a 4-1 deficit in the final set against Lendl. "I used to be in awe 
of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl had 14 aces against Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Goran Ivanisevic also advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 
(7-3) defeat of Grant Stafford. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Steffi Graf dropped only three games in leading three women's 
seeded players into the quarterfinals. Graf took 55 minutes to defeat France's 
Sandrine Testud, 6-1, 6-2. Graf, the only woman in the field who has won the 
Australian Open, is seeking her fourth title at Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf has reached at least the quarterfinals in 30 consecutive Grand Slam 
events, a streak that began with the 1985 U.S. Open. The women's record for 
consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinals appearances is 34 by Chris Evert. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Graf in the quarterfinals was third-seeded Conchita Martinez, who 
overcame an early deficit to defeat 17-year-old American Chanda Rubin, 7-6 
(7-4), 6-3. Rubin led the first set 5-2 and wasted a pair of set points. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez will next play No. 10 Kimiko Date, a 7-5, 6-1 winner over Ginger 
Helgeson, who held her serve only three times in 10 tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-seeded Stefan Edberg dropped only four games Saturday while defeating 
Fabrice Santoro and moving into the fourth round. No. 9 Todd Martin and No. 12 
Alexander Volkov also won, but No. 14 Karel Novacek was ousted by Lars Jonsson.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; WILL THEY STILL BE ABLE TO (LOTTERY) PARTY IN 1999? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The times, they are a-changin'. As a matter of fact, they have already 
a-changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The dynasties of the '80s have been plowed under, the Bulls' dynasty of the 
'90s is on its way out and a new class of budding powers is on its way up. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to guess who the elite will be in five years: Orlando with 
Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee (Penny) Hardaway; Charlotte with Alonzo Mourning 
and Larry Johnson; Golden State with Chris Webber, Latrell Sprewell, Billy 
Owens and Tim Hardaway; Seattle with Shawn Kemp, Gary Payton and Kendall Gill. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in five years, which of today's downtrodden -- teams not now in playoff 
slots -- will be back? Here's how the rebuilding programs look: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Philadelphia 76ers -- Shawn Bradley, 21, will be a force when he learns how 
to play and they get him some muscular help. Clarence Weatherspoon, 23, is a 
big-timer. Plus they have a tradable asset in Jeff Hornacek. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Washington Bullets -- They might cost Coach Wes Unseld his job, but Tom 
Gugliotta, 24, Don MacLean, 24, and reborn prospect Rex Chapman, 26, are the 
light at the end of a long tunnel. If Pervis Ellison, 27, makes it back, so 
much the better. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Minnesota Timberwolves -- They're the only expansion team that still looks 
like an expansion team, but they have two budding superstars, Christian 
Laettner, 24, and Isaiah Rider, 22. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Dallas Mavericks -- Blue-chippers, Jamal Mashburn, 21, and Jim Jackson, 23, 
still figure to be stars. Coach Quinn Buckner won't be around to see it, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Lakers -- They've only begun to rebuild, but Jerry West struck out boldly 
and already has Doug Christie, 23; Anthony Peeler, 24; Nick Van Exel, 22, and 
George Lynch, 23, despite never having missed the playoffs. Vlade Divac is only 
26. This summer, they'll get a lottery pick and will have A.C. Green's 
$1.75-million slot to offer a free agent. However, dynasties are built on 
superstars like Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and West has to find one 
of those. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Sacramento Kings -- They cost General Manager Jerry Reynolds his job, but 
with Mitch Richmond, 28, Lionel Simmons, 25, Walt Williams, 23, and Bobby 
Hurley, 22, they're not far away. Maybe Mitch Kupchak or whoever succeeds 
Reynolds will be luckier in the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Clippers -- They can't start rebuilding until they stop tearing down. Danny 
Manning, 27, is expected to leave. Ron Harper, 29, has vowed to go, but people 
who know him say he'll take the best offer, which may still be here. Loy 
Vaught, 26, and Mark Jackson, 28, are players. Stanley Roberts, 23, remains a 
prospect but has to prove he'll ever see 275 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Milwaukee Bucks -- Mike Dunleavy made them younger in a hurry, but now he 
has to make them better. Eric Murdock, 25, Todd Day, 23, and Vin Baker, 22, are 
prospects but not budding superstars. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Detroit Pistons -- Lindsey Hunter, 23, Allan Houston, 22, Terry Mills, 26, 
and Sean Elliott, 24, are a start, but Isiah Thomas, 32, and Joe Dumars, 30, 
should have been cashed in for prospects two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Boston Celtics -- The Len Bias and Reggie Lewis tragedies leave them with 
a bunch of so-so prospects. Dino Radja, 26, is the only exciting one. 
</P>
<P>
 11. New Jersey Nets -- Unless everyone misses his guess, Derrick Coleman, 26, 
will be gone by the summer of '95, leaving only Kenny Anderson, 23, who will be 
the next one who wants out. GRUMPY YOUNG MAN 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers must be intrigued to hear that a young super-duper like Coleman 
reportedly included them on a list of teams to which he would accept a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Coleman has a bad back, a dour exterior and a history of 
haranguing teammates, showing up coaches and blowing off the press. Whoever 
gives him $69 million or more straps his franchise to the back of a tiger. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after giving teammates T-shirts commemorating the Nets' $69-million 
offer he turned down, Coleman finally consented to make his first comment on 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, he recapped some of the things he hadn't said . . . yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did I ever say I didn't want to stay?" Coleman said. "Did you ever read 
anything in the paper that quoted me as saying I didn't want to stay in New 
Jersey? Then don't speculate." 
</P>
<P>
 Nah, that was probably his agent who planted the story that he would approve a 
deal with the Lakers or the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman hasn't said he wants to stay, either, worrying Net General Manager 
Willis Reed, who doesn't want to speculate, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, Derrick has to say whether he wants to be here," Reed said. 
"He owes that to the fans and the organization. If he legitimately doesn't want 
to be here, he has to say that. I think he's man enough to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Also weighing his options is Coach Chuck Daly, whose contract will also be up 
in the summer of '95. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (losing Coleman) would be a loss of a major piece of property that you 
don't come by very often," Daly said. "I'd have some problems with it. I don't 
know how we could make it up." HERE'S THE WINDUP AND THE PITCH . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Curveball, swung on and missed! If they keep throwing Michael Jordan breaking 
balls, he'd better trade in that bat for a canoe paddle! 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox brass is suggesting politely that Mike's plan to attend their 
spring training is -- how to phrase it? -- a trifle . . . stupid? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Manager Gene Lamont: "I think he knows if spring training started 
tomorrow, I don't think he really thinks (editor's note -- are you still with 
us?) it would be in his best interest or anyone's best interest to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitting is the key. It is with everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will say this, he's working hard, really hard, but he's still a real long 
shot to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Ron Schueler, a 45-year-old right-hander who last pitched 14 
years ago -- the same year Jordan last played baseball, as a high school junior 
-- proposes to settle it by throwing to Mike personally. In his prime, Schueler 
had a good curve, so if he can summon up 70 m.p.h. of heat to go with it, 
Jordan is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been throwing for a few days, trying to get ready," says Schueler. "I 
plan to throw to him around Feb. 7 or 8. I want to see if he can hit a 
curveball." . . . AND A CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM 
</P>
<P>
 Not to put too fine a point on this, since it took an entire organization an 
entire decade to cut the heart out of Clipper morale, but their problem was 
simple: Their playing roster had quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Players went through the motions, some more energetically, sincerely and/or 
consistently than others, but as a team, they didn't exist. Twelve players, 12 
agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why it was so heartening to watch rookie Harold Ellis last week. Unlike 
his teammates, he didn't have a guaranteed multiyear contract. He had a chance 
to be a free agent this summer, too, but he wasn't looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
 He played with so much heart, it must have embarrassed teammates to remember 
that once they were that young and hungry. He was an inspiration in the middle 
of a depression. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 They aim for the moon but sometimes they hit London, or each other: The 
Houston Rockets started 22-1, then went 6-8 and saw their beautiful chemistry 
go right out the window. Said Vern Maxwell: "We've got to stop pointing fingers 
at each other. That's all that's been happening lately and that's why we 
haven't done crap lately." . . . Maxwell, back after having been monitored for 
an irregular heartbeat, has been told to give up alcohol. "Will that change my 
lifestyle? Yeah," Mad Max said. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing fancy: Chris Webber's assist average -- 3.8 -- already matches that of 
Brad Daugherty, generally regarded as the NBA's best passing center. "Think of 
what you'll have some day," Warrior Coach Don Nelson said. "Chris' priority is 
to pass, and how many great passing centers do you have who also have the 
ability to score? When you start with a big man who can pass, there are great 
things in store for your ballclub. We're going to have a lot of fun for a lot 
of years." 
</P>
<P>
 The future just arrived: Penny Hardaway, supposedly being groomed as the next 
Orlando point guard, averaged 43 minutes in a recent stretch while Scott 
Skiles, who is supposedly grooming him, averaged 25. "I'm ready to do whatever 
they want," said the hard-bitten Skiles, more graciously than anyone expected. 
"I always knew Penny would be the point guard. If the time is now, it's now." . 
. . Ron Harper on TNT's Clipper-Celtic matchup: "I was surprised they came. I 
figured once they figured out who was playing, they'd call and say they 
couldn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Ron Grinker on speculation Danny Manning will sign with Orlando: 
"Orlando is one of the teams he likes. The right people know that. Who wouldn't 
want to play on a team with Shaquille O'Neal, Anfernee Hardaway and Scott 
Skiles?" . . . Injured Larry Johnson tried to practice last week but gave it 
up. "We want Larry to come back completely healthy," Charlotte Coach Allan 
Bristow said. "We got a chance to see how he looks and he's still got a ways to 
go."

NBA ROUNDUP; RODMAN'S 32 REBOUNDS POUND MAVERICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman grabbed a team-record 32 rebounds, two short of his career high, 
as the San Antonio Spurs handed the Dallas Mavericks their 13th consecutive 
defeat, 103-83, at San Antonio on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman also set another Spur record with 20 rebounds in the first half. The 
Mavericks, losers of 13 in a row, finished with only 37 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman, who left the game for more than five minutes in the third quarter 
because of a bloody nose, broke his team rebounding record of 29, set against 
Minnesota on Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, the San Antonio club record was 25 by Edgar Jones and 
Artis Gilmore. Rodman's career high is 34 for Detroit against Indiana in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 98, Seattle 91 -- Bryant Stith scored seven of his 14 points in the 
final seven minutes and sparked an 8-0 run that carried the Nuggets at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver, which defeated Houston on Thursday night and now has beaten the NBA's 
top two teams in consecutive games, got 22 points from Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 106, Utah 101 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 25 of his 40 points in the 
second half and made a key steal with 15 seconds to play at Houston as the 
Rockets ended a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 With Houston leading, 100-98, with 15 seconds left, Jeff Malone rebounded a 
missed Houston shot, but Olajuwon slapped the ball into the hands of teammate 
Mario Elie. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 121, Philadelphia 112 -- Shaquille O'Neal was 15 of 16 from the field 
-- mostly on dunks -- and scored 33 points at Philadelphia to lead the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, the league's leading scorer at 28.8 points per game, is averaging 33 
over his last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Shawn Bradley had a season-high 24 points for Philadelphia, which lost 
its fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 118, Portland 117 -- Cedric Ceballos scored a career-high 40 points, 
including two free throws with 6.7 seconds to play, for the Suns at Phoenix, 
helping to end the Trail Blazers' five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trail Blazers had two chances to win in the closing seconds. Rod 
Strickland missed a 15-footer, but Phoenix knocked the ball out of bounds with 
0.7 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford Robinson, who led Portland with 34 points, missed a 12-footer as time 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 124, Golden State 98 -- Kenny Anderson had 20 points, 10 rebounds 
and 10 assists and led an 82-point second half at East Rutherford, N.J., that 
carried the Nets to their season-high fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Armon Gilliam added 23 points as the Nets ended an 11-year, 10-game home-court 
losing streak to the Warriors and handed Golden State its worst loss of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 98, Detroit 93 -- Don MacLean scored 31 points and made the 
go-ahead basket in the fourth quarter at Baltimore as the Bullets handed the 
Pistons their 15th loss in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean's 12-foot baseline shot with 8:28 to play broke a 77-77 tie, giving 
the Bullets a lead they never lost. Pervis Ellison followed with a 19-footer 
from the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 91, Milwaukee 80 -- Dell Curry awakened Charlotte's offense in the 
fourth quarter and finished with 21 points, leading the Hornets at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets rebounded from Friday night's loss at Milwaukee despite losing 
Alonzo Mourning on an ejection and having Larry Johnson on the bench because of 
a lower back sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 90, Indiana 81 -- Scottie Pippen scored 22 points, including a key 
basket with 47 seconds to play at Indianapolis, as the Bulls beat the Pacers 
for the second time in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls didn't need a last-second basket as they did Friday night, when Toni 
Kukoc beat the buzzer with his three-pointer in a 96-95 victory at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 98, Minnesota 81 -- Kevin Willis scored a season-high 34 points, 
compensating for teammate Dominique Wilkins' three-for-18 shooting and leading 
the Hawks at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis made 15 of 21 shots and grabbed 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 119, Sacramento 109 -- Brad Daugherty's 27 points led the Cavaliers 
over the Kings in overtime at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Nance and Mark Price each added 22 points. Spud Webb and Lionel Simmons 
each had 22 for the Kings.

 Darryl Parker tipped in the ball with a just more than a minute to play to 
lift Oregon to a 61-60 victory over Washington on Saturday night at Eugene, 
Ore. 
</P>

ARIZONA'S STOUDAMIRE CAN'T HIT, BUT NEITHER CAN TROJANS IN LOSS; COLLEGE 
BASKETBALL: USC FALLS FOR THIRD TIME IN A ROW, 83-74. RESERVE GUARD RIGDON 
STEPS UP FOR WILDCATS, SCORING 21. 
</P>

 USC Coach George Raveling would have liked the Trojans' chances of beating 
Arizona if he was told beforehand that they would limit the Wildcats' Damon 
Stoudamire to four points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans did exactly that and still lost for the third time in a row, 
83-74, to No. 9 Arizona Saturday before 4,317 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 How, after Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves combined to make only nine of 26 
shots? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that the Trojans' starting backcourt of Burt Harris and Stais 
Boseman combined to make only four of 20 shots for 11 points, and Arizona 
reserve guard Dylan Rigdon scored a game-high 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire made only one of seven shots. But Rigdon tied a Pacific 10 
Conference record by making all 12 of his free throws, and Reeves made three 
key three-pointers in the second half to help the Wildcats rebound from their 
loss to UCLA on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, 14-3 overall and 3-2 in the Pac-10, had to shake free from a 
determined USC team that had to play without starting guards Brandon Martin 
(stomach infection) and Harris, who missed the final six minutes because of 
severe dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
 Another area that hurt the Trojans (10-5, 3-3) was their free-throw shooting. 
They missed nine in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive game, USC played well in the first half only to 
fall apart later. In an 87-62 loss to Arizona State on Thursday, the Trojans 
blew a 10-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Arizona, the Trojans were close, trailing, 36-33, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was displeased coming out of the locker room (at halftime)," Arizona Coach 
Lute Olsen said. "We were jacking the ball up. But finally, we got some good 
looks at some three-pointers and hit them. And they came after we worked the 
ball around and began to play aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
 USC dominated inside with Mark Boyd (18 points, six rebounds), Tremayne 
Anchrum (14 and 11) and Lorenzo Orr (14 and nine), but fell short in the 
backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 USC guards scored only 22 points against the Wildcats, with freshman Claude 
Green scoring eight in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our big guys have a lot more experience than our perimeter guys," said 
Boseman, who made his third start of the season. "Coach (Raveling) wants us to 
pound the ball inside, which we do a good job of, but it hurts when we are not 
hitting our shots." 
</P>
<P>
 USC outrebounded Arizona, 43-39, but made only four of 16 three-point shots. 
Raveling tried several different lineups, looking for offense, but came up 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shooting isn't our problem," Raveling said. "The lack of production on the 
fast break is our Achilles. It puts a tremendous burden on our half-court 
offense." Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 USC will play California at the Oakland Coliseum Arena on Thursday and at 
Stanford on Saturday. . . . USC will be glad to return to home games at the 
Sports Arena. Since March of 1990, USC has a 46-5 overall record at the Sports 
Arena and is 27-3 against Pac-10 opponents, including a 2-0 mark this season. 
The Trojans played at the Lyon Center on Thursday when they lost to Arizona 
State.

ANTEATERS ARE CANNON FODDER, 89-76

 San Jose State guard Terry Cannon scored 10 of his game-high 26 points in the 
final 3 1/2 minutes Saturday night as the Spartans held on for an 89-76 Big 
West victory over UC Irvine in front of 2,789 at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was more than Irvine Coach Rod Baker could bear.The usually composed 
Baker entered the Anteaters' locker room bellowing, and 20 minutes later he 
still had not emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, which came home after a victory at Utah State on a high, hit new lows 
in home losses to Pacific and San Jose. The Anteaters (5-9, 2-4) are headed in 
the opposite direction of San Jose (8-7, 4-3), which picked up its third 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they brought it to six (76-70), we started to execute with the clock and 
with high-percentage shots," Cannon said. "We benefited by using the clock and 
getting baskets." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans, like so many of Irvine's opponents this season, also benefited 
from the Anteaters' poor perimeter defense. Nevada Las Vegas shot 56% from 
three-point range and Rebel outside shooters accounted for 42 points on 
three-pointers. Reno's Preston Johnson and Jerry Hogan combined to make nine of 
15 three-pointers. And Saturday night, San Jose shot 58% on three-pointers, 
including five of seven in the first half. JOHN WEYLER

TITANS OVERCOME IN OVERTIME; BIG WEST: CAL STATE FULLERTON JUMPS OFF TO BIG 
LEAD WITH SEVEN PLAYERS, BUT PACIFIC RALLIES, 76-69. 
</P>

<P>
 It was a close call as to which would evaporate first: Cal State Fullerton's 
meager roster, the Titans' lead or the game clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the choices weren't good for the Titans, and the odds finally caught up 
to them as Pacific scored a 76-69 overtime victory in Titan Gym on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite senior Greg Vernon's career-high 28 points, the Titans watched Pacific 
score the final eight points in overtime to seal its fifth consecutive Big West 
Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
 With a combination of 16 points and 10 rebounds sitting on the bench in the 
persons of David Frigout (foot injury) and Darren Little (flu), the Titans 
(3-12, 1-6) stared at imminent disaster, put the ball in the air and -- 
surprise -- early on, it went in. 
</P>
<P>
 Again and again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, while Coach Brad Holland jockeyed seven players, Fullerton was a step 
quicker and a lot sharper than Pacific most of the way. While the Titans held 
Pacific (11-7, 5-2) to 15% first-half shooting, James French, 0 for 12 in the 
last three games, nailed two jumpers to start, Vernon added two free throws and 
Winston Peterson added three more to make it 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans eventually made it 13-1 and 23-12 before settling on a 34-21 
halftime lead. Short-handed Fullerton, after its most inspired half of the 
season, walked off the court to a raucous standing ovation.

before the Waves' Dana Jones made a basket to narrow the gap back to 78-77.

 Smart and Wilson Stephens each made two free throws in the final seconds to 
put the Dons ahead by 81-77. Damin Lopez made a shot from half court at the 
buzzer for Pepperdine (10-6, 2-2).

 Andrew Magee and Jim Furyk shot five-under-par rounds of 67 -- one better than 
halfway leader Dillard Pruitt -- to move into a three-way tie at the top 
Saturday after three rounds of the Northern Telecom Open. 
</P>
<P>
 They are at 13-under 203. 
</P>
<P>
 Furyk, a former University of Arizona golfer who has played the 7,184-yard, 
par-72 Tucson National course more than 100 times, had five birdies on the back 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I had some good shots on the front nine that I didn't get 
rewarded for," he said. "I made about a mile's worth of putts on the back 
nine." 
</P>
<P>
 Pruitt had an eagle on the second hole and Magee had a seven-birdie, two-bogey 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all great players," said Furyk, who played on the Nike tour last 
season. "I'm not trying to fill any shoes or be the next Phil Mickelson or 
Robert Gamez (both of whom won PGA Tour tournaments as an amateur). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to be Jim Furyk. . . . I'm just going to go out and play a 
good, solid round tomorrow."

SANTA ANITA; WEKIVA SPRINGS WINS EASILY, LOOMS AS A 3-YEAR-OLD THREAT

 One year after having the future book favorite for the Kentucky Derby in River 
Special, trainer Bob Hess Jr. might have a legitimate contender for the race 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has yet to face Brocco and Valiant Nature, the top two Derby 
prospects in California, Wekiva Springs has done nothing wrong for Hess. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned and bred in Florida by Donald Dizney, the gray Runaway Groom colt and 
7-10 favorite tracked the moderate pace set by Dream Trapp, then took control 
early in the stretch and went on to win the $79,650 Santa Catalina Stakes by 
four lengths. It was his third victory in four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Kent Desormeaux, Wekiva Springs covered the 1 1/16 miles in 1:41 
4/5. Gracious Ghost outfinished Dream Trapp, the 3-1 second choice, by 
three-quarters of a length for second. Duca was another 1 1/4 lengths back in 
fourth and Heavely Crusade was last. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get somebody out of Florida to come here during the earthquakes, you know 
we have to love this horse and love California," said Dizney, who was in the 
winner's circle with his wife, Irene. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the (pre-Triple Crown) time of year, and of course your dreams are 
just out of the roof when your horse does as well as he did today." 
</P>
<P>
 The chance to meet Brocco and Valiant Nature could come in the San Rafael 
Stakes on March 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless something unforeseen occurs, that's where we'll go," Hess said. "I 
still think he has to improve to compete with (Brocco and Valiant Nature), but 
I think he has that improvement in him. But he definitely hasn't proven he can 
beat those, and until he does -- and that might be the San Rafael -- I won't be 
thinking Kentucky Derby until then."

 All the upset victory by Hill Pass in the $155,300 San Pasqual Handicap did 
was boost the Santa Anita Handicap stock of Slew Of Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominant in the Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood Park in his last venture to 
Southern California, Slew Of Damascus beat Hill Pass in the William P. Kyne 
Handicap two weeks earlier at Bay Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-longest shot in the field at 15-1 Saturday, Hill Pass beat Best Pal 
by nearly two lengths in 1:41 for the 1 1/16 miles. Besides Best Pal, who won 
the Big 'Cap in 1992, behind the 5-year-old Temperence Hill horse were Santa 
Anita Handicap hopefuls Lottery Winner, Star Recruit and Ibero, the 2-1 
favorite in the San Pasqual. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Jack Van Berg and ridden by Chris McCarron, Hill Pass won for the 
second time in eight California starts since returning from a one-year layoff 
last September at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal, the 2-1 second choice, beat Lottery Winner by three-quarters of a 
length in his first race since finishing 10th in the Breeders' Cup Classic.

 Jockey Pat Valenzuela, who failed to show for his three mounts on Friday's 
card at Santa Anita, was fined $1,000 after meeting with stewards Pete 
Pedersen, Ingrid Fermin and Tom Ward on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela told the stewards he went to San Diego on Thursday night with his 
wife and baby daughter to visit his mother-in-law and ran into severe traffic 
in Del Mar when trying to return home Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat said he tried to contact us (by cellular phone) but was unable to get 
through," Pedersen said. "He did get through to his agent (Tony Matos) and left 
a message on his machine around 11:30 (a.m.), but Tony was at his ranch in 
Lancaster because it had some earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony verified Pat left the message, but he has been advised many times to 
call us and we don't feel he made the proper effort to get in touch with us. 
Pat was upset, but he realized (the fine was justified)." 
</P>
<P>
 Pedersen and Fermin also said Valenzuela was tested negative for drugs.

<P>
 Making his first start since finishing third in the Breeders' Juvenile, 
Tabasco Cat won the $200,000 El Camino Real Derby Saturday at Bay Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 The colt, who ran over assistant trainer Jeff Lukas last month, injuring him 
critically, defeated Flying Sensation by a length in 1:42 3/5 for the 1 1/16 
miles under Pat Day. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Antley and Kent Desormeaux will begin five-day suspensions Wednesday for 
incidents on Friday. . . . Music Merci has been retired. The 8-year-old 
gelding, who made his final start when sixth in the Breeders' Cup Sprint last 
Nov. 6, finished his career with 12 victories in 35 starts and earnings of 
$1,500,710.

ECONOMIC RECOVERY; THE SPIRIT OF HEROIC OVERCOMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joel Kotkin, Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a senior 
fellow with the Center for the New West and international fellow at the 
Pepperdine University School of Business in Los Angeles. He is also 
business-trends analyst for Fox TV.

<P>
 California has made a remarkable transition from Golden State to all-purpose 
"victim state." Yet, in the long run, its recent problems may have less to do 
with disasters, man-made and natural, than with its gradual loss of the sense 
of heroic overcoming that defined its past. "Bring me men to match my 
mountains" are the bold words inscribed on the facade of the state Capitol. 
Today, that imperative, and the ethic it embodies, seem quixotic. 
</P>
<P>
 Disasters, like the Northridge earthquake, certainly create an ideal climate 
for depressing prognostications. So it was, as well, in San Francisco on April 
20, 1906. One-third of the city's built-up area lay in ruins; 500 were dead. 
The local business Establishment was a "thoroughly dispirited group of men." 
</P>
<P>
 But not the owner of the Bank of Italy. Although his building had also been 
demolished by the quake, Amadeo Giannini walked from his home to set up 
operations at the waterfront to serve his customers, mostly Italian immigrants. 
Unlike the old leadership, Giannini, the founder of the Bank of America, never 
lost his confidence in San Francisco's long-term prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Giannini's success also pointedly challenges the pervasive nativism that often 
commingles with today's pessimism about California and, especially, Los 
Angeles. Like today's Asian and Latino immigrants, Giannini's Italian customers 
were seen as threats to an economic future; ridiculed as "the Chinese of 
Europe," they were widely portrayed as lazy, uneducated and immoral. Yet, the 
first section of 1906 San Francisco to spring back to life was then heavily 
Italian North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As Los Angeles begins to rebuild, and the state struggles to regain its 
economic balance, Californians, as did Giannini, must tap their capacity to 
serve, in Carey McWilliams' phrase, as the world's "great laboratory for 
experimentation." This is the California legacy. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gold Rush, an unprecedented "medley of races and nationalities," as 
historian Hubert Howe Bancroft described it, risked all and lost much but 
ultimately transformed the state from a wild, overgrown mining camp into the 
largest capitalist outpost on the Pacific. Many Asians overcame an atmosphere 
of deep-seated prejudice and risked meager savings -- even their lives -- to 
set up the vegetable and fruit farms that put California on a course toward the 
world's richest agricultural region. They and other newcomers -- Yugoslav and 
Italian immigrants, for example -- also developed the fisheries, the craft 
industries and small stores that expanded the new commercial order. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, the state's white elite shared a vision of California's 
"manifest destiny" that transcended short-term profits. Nothing else explains 
the relentless, sometimes fanciful campaigns behind such undertakings as the 
Los Angeles Aqueduct, the state Water Project, the freeway system and the 
Master Plan. These efforts, too, suffered setbacks, man-made and natural. Yet, 
in California, these grandiose dreams became a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians have suffered through other desperate times -- only to emerge 
economically stronger because of their drive to overcome. For example, as the 
Vietnam War wound down, the state's aerospace industry lost one-quarter of its 
employment, with Los Angeles County taking the biggest hit. The Sylmar quake, 
in 1971, deepened and expanded the economic distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, other Californians were starting new businesses at a pace 2 1/2 times the 
national rate. Among them were unemployed technologists and defense workers who 
had moved into commercial fields, notably computers, peripherals and 
semiconductors. As a result of their efforts, several areas of the state -- 
notably the Santa Clara Valley, Orange County, the west end of San Fernando 
Valley -- spawned a crop of soon-to-be high-tech giants, among them Intel, 
National Semiconductor and, later, Apple Computer. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining this remarkable transition, Don Valentine, venture capitalist 
and a founder of Apple, credited a combination of defense downsizing, which 
freed up enormous human and technical resources, and a lowering of 
capital-gains tax rates. Most critical of all, however, was the heroic spirit 
of the place. "This (California) is still the frontier," Valentine said. "It's 
like Frederick Jackson Turner revisited. Substitute computers for land." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, after drought, riot, flood, fire and quake, California's obituary 
writers are again eager to bury the state. Yet, they continue, as always, to 
ignore the evidence that California's heroic spirit -- the energy and 
commitment that moved Giannini to take his five-mile walk -- has survived. 
Indeed, even before the Northridge quake, Southern California's industry was 
convulsing toward new and radically different forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, help from Washington and Sacramento will be indispensable in 
rebuilding the economic arteries of Los Angeles. But even more important will 
be recovering that sense of heroic overcoming that makes us Californians. Only 
by so doing can we live up to their historic obligation to match the grandeur 
of our mountains.

THE VALLEY; VALUES AND VIRTUES OF MIDDLE-AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Starr, Kevin Starr, professor of planning and development at USC and 
faculty member of the USC Embassy Residential College, is author of The Dream 
Endures: California Through the Great Depression, to be published by Oxford 
University Press.

 The Northridge earthquake struck at the very premise of the Southern 
California dream -- the San Fernando Valley. Few places more dramatically 
epitomize the hope of ordinary citizens for a better life than this sprawling 
region that has long since blurred the distinction between city and suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff Street -- honoring journalist Charles Nordhoff (1830-1901), author of 
one of the most influential books in the history of the state -- runs a block 
north of the quake's epicenter. First published in 1872, translated into many 
European languages and frequently updated, Nordhoff's "California for Health, 
Wealth and Residence"' helped fix, in the minds of Americans and Europeans, the 
image of Southern California as a setting for the good life for middle-income 
migrants, with special emphasis upon owning a home in healthy and beautiful 
surroundings. It is a notion severely tested by last Monday's quake and its 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 In every aspect of its history -- Native American life, mission era, rancho 
days, emergence as an agricultural region, explosion as the epicenter of 
post-World War II suburban growth in the Southland -- the San Fernando Valley 
distills and preserves the accumulated memories and social structures, the 
themes and symbols, the successes and failures of the Southern California 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start of the European era, the Valley seemed destined to grow. 
Founded in September, 1797, and named in honor of a 13th-Century king of Spain 
who was raised to sainthood after his death, Mission San Fernando Rey de Espana 
prospered as the largest of the California missions, a combination of church, 
monastery, manufacturing center and rancho. On Dec. 21, 1812, an earthquake 
leveled the mission church. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1845, three Fernandenos -- as the Native Americans associated with the 
mission were called -- received the grant of Rancho El Encino, which they 
subsequently sold to Don Vincente de la Osa, who built his adobe a few hundred 
yards north of present-day Ventura Boulevard. Throughout the 19th Century, well 
into the American era, the Valley remained rancho country, centered on the 
market town of San Fernando, founded in the mid-1870s. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles annexed the Valley in 1915, a move that paralleled the Louisiana 
Purchase in 1803. With its annexation, the City of Los Angeles emerged as a de 
facto city-state, as much a Swiss canton as an American city, with its own 
agricultural region within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles oligarchy had set its sight on the Valley as a prime location 
for speculative development. Among the earlier subdividers and speculators were 
Isaac Lankershim and I. N. Van Nuys, who left their names on the landscape. In 
the early 1900s, the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Co., a syndicate that included 
Harrison Gray Otis of the Los Angeles Times, E. H. Harriman of the Southern 
Pacific and Henry Huntington of Pacific Electric interurban railway, held 
options on huge acreages in the region. In 1913, the Owens Valley Project 
brought water to the San Fernando -- and land values soared. The oligarchy, in 
other words, had put together an unbeatable combination of press, transit, 
water and politics in the service of real-estate speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Water transformed the San Fernando Valley into an agricultural paradise. 
Throughout the 1930s, San Fernando, Burbank, Glendale, North Hollywood, Encino, 
Tarzana, Canoga Park, Newhall, Valencia, Northridge, Chatsworth and Sylmar 
evolved from settlement to market town to planned development. Only Burbank, 
Glendale and San Fernando retained their independence from annexation-hungry 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarzana's founder, Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan, bought 550 
acres from Otis. Contiguous to the Santa Monica Mountains, the land was 
developed as a model ranch. In the 1920s, Burroughs developed a country club 
and subdivided. The Lockheed brothers, Malcolm and Allan, joined by Jack 
Northrop, established, in 1927, the Lockheed Aircraft Corp. in Burbank, thus 
bringing to the Valley a key industry of greater Los Angeles, second only to 
agriculture and motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1941, James M. Cain could describe Glendale, in his classic novel "Mildred 
Pierce," as the paradigm of middle-class Southern California: a city of 
standardized bungalows, each of them furnished in Mediterranean faux and Grand 
Rapids mid-American, with only the Spanish architecture and the avocado, lemon 
and mimosa trees reminding visitors that they were no longer in Kansas. Cain's 
heroine, both in the novel and in the Joan Crawford movie, epitomized the 
mid-America that was beginning to make the San Fernando Valley its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to make the San Fernando Valley my home," sang the Andrew Sisters 
as World War II drew to a close. A million-plus returning veterans and 
resettling defense workers agreed. According to Gregory Hise, the San Fernando 
Valley was, contrary to popular myth, not the exclusive enclave of white folks. 
Already in the 1950s, Hise contends, the San Fernando Valley showed signs of 
the ethnic diversity that would exfoliate in the 1970s and 1980s, making it the 
most ethnically and culturally diverse region of metropolitan Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Identifying with their Westside clientele, the parking valets might well 
snicker, as they did in the Steve Martin film, "L.A. Story," when someone says 
he lives in the San Fernando Valley. Of all the regions of greater Los Angeles, 
the Valley has inspired the least empathy -- and sympathy -- from trendies and 
the pseudo-intelligentsia. They, after all, have long quarreled with the Middle 
America that, before and after the Andrew Sisters, has been calling the San 
Fernando Valley its home. The Valley perhaps lacks the chic of the Westside, 
the clear ethnic definition of the Eastside, or the eclectic contrasts of 
Downtown, Exposition Park and South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 True, there are million-dollar-plus homes in Encino, Sherman Oaks and even 
Tarzana. But they are the exception. Within the context of the overall 
unaffordability of Southern California, the San Fernando Valley remains 
affordable: remains, that is, connected to the hopes of ordinary people for a 
better life, which Nordhoff first proclaimed in 1872 and which, to this day, 
remain the defining dynamic of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for the second time within 25 years, comes the catastrophe of an 
earthquake. In the coping of the people of the San Fernando Valley this past 
week -- in their generosity, their heroism, their good order, their resilience 
-- the values and virtues of Middle America, expressed in scores of languages 
and a myriad of ethnic hues, reassert themselves as the central premise, the 
driving force, the deepest meaning of Southern California in the last decade of 
the 20th Century.

SCIENCE; NEXT TO SEISMOLOGY, ECONOMICS IS EXACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Fallows, James Fallows is the Washington editor of the Atlantic 
Monthly. He grew up near the San Andreas Fault. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I love stock-market analysts. Within minutes of the closing bell, they're on 
the air with a plot line for what has just occurred: "Trouble in Russia lifted 
the value of defense stocks." "Profit-taking drove high-tech stocks down." 
</P>
<P>
 It is all so clear and sensible after it has happened! What had been a 
confusing jumble of buyers and sellers suddenly has a narrative shape. For some 
reason, I never seem to hear these people in the morning, when they could tell 
me whether these same developments were going to move the market up or down 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
 I love seismologists, too. Within minutes of a temblor, they're on the air 
with its size, duration and epicenter -- lending scientific precision to what 
had been formless fear and doubt just moments before. (Here on the East Coast, 
I've even come to love wind-chill readings. With them, I can say, "I'm just as 
cold as I would be if it were 40-below zero," rather than just yelling, "Where 
are those ear muffs?") 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after a quake, the scientists show us the seismographic tapes, with 
their eloquent frenzy of activity when the main shock strikes and the 
subsequent pulses of aftershock. By the next day, seismologists are ready to 
display the beautiful tectonic maps of California, like X-rays of the state, 
with the San Andreas Fault running spine-like down its longitude and the 
delicate web of shatter faults lining the Los Angeles Basin. It is all so clear 
and sensible when we can see that some previously undiscovered fault was 
responsible for the latest damage! The only thing that could possibly top it 
would be if we'd known anything about these "minor" faults before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal compared the six-month record of 
stocks picked by top financial analysts with that chosen by throwing darts at a 
board. The darts won. For its next project, the newspaper might round up a 
group of pigs and rats, which are supposed to be sensitive to pre-quake 
emanations, and match their short-term predictive success to that of an equal 
number of seismologists. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm the first to admit that pigs don't know about the San Andreas Fault and 
that no rat can explain (as a trained seismologist can) why Los Angeles and San 
Francisco have a bigger earthquake problem than Houston or Miami. I would much 
rather be a seismologist than a pig or rat, even if the animals are better at 
sensing when a big quake is on the way. There is a stately majesty to the 
seismologists' studies, as they place geodetic markers on either side of a 
divide and wait to see how far they move. Like anatomy professors, 
seismologists possess a secret, half-tragic knowledge that lets them look at 
the surface of life and see the doom lurking underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 But if I were a seismologist, I'd be working on public relations right now. 
I'd admit I had no idea when or where the next quake might occur -- and would 
say that, nonetheless, there is merit in my craft. 
</P>
<P>
 People have always wanted to know , but the search for knowledge has had two 
distinct aims. We want to impose a shape on what has already happened, and we 
want a grasp on what lies ahead. Some forms of knowledge serve both purposes. 
By learning why people died of smallpox, scientists learned how to prevent 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 But such an iron connection, linking yesterday to tomorrow, is the exception. 
In general, knowing what's happened tells us next to nothing about what lies 
ahead. George Santayana meant well but, on balance, did harm with his war-horse 
adage: "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that even those who do learn from history have no idea that the 
world waited too long to take Adolf Hitler seriously and should have squashed 
him when he was small. Does this make the new Russian kook, Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky, another Hitler? No one knows. Economists can tell us how and why 
certain countries grew prosperous. Do they know how to make all countries 
prosperous? Clearly not. If there is a pattern to history, it is of people 
running into problems they did not expect. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of retrospective knowledge -- making sense of what has happened to 
us -- is, therefore, not its practicality. Rather, we learn about history, even 
the "history" of today's trading on the stock exchange, because our minds yearn 
to fit facts into larger patterns. We want cause and effect; we want stories 
with beginnings and ends. The list of U.S. Presidents is a tedious fact. The 
names Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford are linked in a story. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the need seismologists can fill -- not for forecasts but for patterns 
and stories. As we've been recently reminded, they can give little practical 
guidance that fits the human time scale. They're sure that the San Andreas 
Fault will slip. They just don't know whether it will happen while anyone now 
on Earth is still alive, and what other faults might reveal themselves in the 
meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 But by explaining why something happened even after it is over, as the teams 
of seismologists did this week, they fill an important human function. In the 
olden days, people huddled in caves, and when the mastodons roared and the 
fishing lakes froze, they turned for comfort to shamans who could explain what 
it all meant. We need the same comfort, from our shamans with seismographs.

DISASTER POLITICS; THE CHARADE OF PREPAREDNESS

 How many more Californians will have to die before the Legislature seriously 
debates seismic safety? 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday's earthquake has a political as well as a tectonic history. If 
nature defines the hazard, it is human action -- or inaction -- that translates 
it into risk. People, after all, are seldom swallowed up by the Earth, they are 
usually killed by falling architecture. Design mediates geology and is, in 
turn, supposedly regulated by policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But who determines what are the socially "acceptable" levels of earthquake 
risk? Certainly not the folks who live in $600-a-month apartments in Northridge 
or trailer parks in Newhall. Not even those whose million-dollar homes perch 
precariously on the slopes of the Santa Monicas or the Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, seismic safety is an issue superbly insulated from the 
volatility of democratic politics. Few of us have ever heard a candidate take a 
position on disaster planning or the contents of a building code. None of us 
has ever had the opportunity to vote on the trade-offs between public safety 
and the economic costs of hazard reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 What should be an open arena of public controversy is, in fact, a closed 
circle of collusion between technocrats and the real-estate industry. 
Earthquake engineering and land-use planning pay homage, first and above all, 
to corporate bottom lines. Developers have the majority vote -- if not a de 
facto vote -- over the calculus of risks and expenses. Lives are literally 
balanced against rates of return in equations that radically underestimate the 
restlessness of the Pacific plate. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of official reassurances that California is the "state of the art" in 
comprehensive planning for earthquake survival? Our elected representatives, 
perhaps unwittingly, are living a lie. For every mitigation achieved, public 
policy has also allowed an unnecessary magnification of a danger. Consider the 
four crucial areas of hazard zoning, the building code, disaster education and 
emergency mobilization. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, local and state governments have utterly failed to manage land 
use for public safety. Sixty years ago, the nation's leading expert on urban 
form, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. (whose father designed Central Park), urged Los 
Angeles to adopt "hazard zoning" to prevent the private development of 
foothills, river channels and wetlands. Recognizing that our landscape evolves 
through an inevitable cycle of fire, flood and earthquake, he proposed to 
minimize public risk while simultaneously preserving precious open space for 
future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of following Olmsted's advice, we have foolishly subdivided hither and 
yon -- placing thousands of combustible wooden homes in the hearth of mountain 
wildfires, and hundreds of flimsy concrete boxes in the unstable beds of former 
swamps and lagoons. Like the San Francisco Bay Area (remember the Marina 
District in 1989?), a large swathe of Los Angeles is built on foundations of 
jello. The Times could render a public service simply by publishing the 
official "liquefaction potential" map of the L.A. area. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the seismic provisions of the Uniform Building Code have been 
minimalist, grudging concessions to catastrophe. The bureaucracy usually waits 
until a building type fails in a major earthquake before legislating new rules. 
Reform is driven by body counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, scores of public schools had to be reduced to rubble in the 1933 Long 
Beach earthquake (120 dead) before Sacramento imposed any restrictions on their 
construction. Similarly, Los Angeles procrastinated until slab-concrete 
warehouses, a shopping center and two hospitals collapsed in the 1971 Sylmar 
disaster (64 dead) before addressing elementary deficiencies in their design. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have argued that such grim "report cards" are unfortunate prerequisites 
to understanding the rules of safe construction. This is nonsense. It does not 
take a Cal Tech degree, for example, to understand that homes or apartments 
constructed over garages (like many in the Valley) have little shear resistance 
to shaking. This was a major category of structural failure during the Loma 
Prieta earthquake, and it should have been anticipated in Southern California 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculative building types, by definition, play chicken with seismic forces, 
and Los Angeles has its structural counter-parts to the killer mud huts of 
Third World cities. Was it really so difficult to foresee that shoddily built 
tenements of all ages -- from the brick rent-mines of Hollywood to that stucco 
deathtrap in Northridge -- would fall like dominoes in last week's quake? 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the public has been badly misinformed about the diversity of earthquake 
hazards in the Los Angeles Basin. The disaster bureaucracy has mesmerized us 
with its apocalyptic focus on the Big One, rather than providing detailed 
hazard maps to the faults in our own back yards. If the current tragedy has 
finally produced a televised teach-in about the treacherous jigsaw of deeply 
buried thrust faults, we still only know half the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Division of Mines, the single greatest geological 
threat to the Los Angeles Basin is a repeat of the 1933 earthquake along the 
Newport-Inglewood fault zone that passes directly through the Harbor and most 
of South-Central Los Angeles. A companion study by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency predicts as many as 23,000 dead and $69 billion in property 
damage: "The worst disaster in the United States since the Civil War." 
</P>
<P>
 If we were better informed about these close-at-hand hazards, we might be more 
impelled to take grass-roots action to safeguard our homes, schools and 
workplaces. But -- my fourth point -- our current disaster-management system is 
designed to reduce us to role of passive victims waiting to be dug out of the 
rubble. Our sole responsibility is to hoard toilet paper and bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
 But if tens of thousands of citizens can be mobilized on a block level as 
Neighborhood Watches against crime, why can't they be organized as a pro-active 
network for disaster response? Wouldn't it be a good idea to have neighborhood 
volunteers who know where the senior citizens live and how to turn off the gas 
mains? To help translate live-saving instructions into Armenian or Korean? 
</P>
<P>
 Naive questions perhaps. It is inevitable that people taking an active role in 
their own safety will learn more about the details of the problem. And that 
might lead to a critical view of official policy. From there, it is only a 
short leap to political dissent and public debate -- what the system seems to 
dread most. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a leap we may all have to make. At another hour, on a normal 
business day, last week's casualties might easily have been multiplied a 
hundredfold. Moreover, the Northridge earthquake has had an unexpected, 
leveling effect on our divided city. 
</P>
<P>
 For the emergent paradigm of the Cal Tech professors makes us all more equal. 
Although it still does matter whether you dwell in a dingbat or a mansion, 
everywhere in Los Angeles -- Watts to Beverly Hills -- is now, potentially, 
epicentral.

 Once upon a time, many millions of years ago, the top of Mt. Everest was miles 
beneath the sea and New Jersey was on the west coast of Africa. Those facts may 
seem quite far from the frayed nerves of Ange lenos, weary with loss and 
anxious with aftershocks, but it's worth our time to ask: How did limestone 
from the ocean's depths move thousands of feet into the air and become the 
world's highest mountain? And how did a piece of West Africa voyage across what 
is now the Atlantic Ocean and become -- New Jersey? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: earthquakes. Many, many, many earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 We think of movement in terms of miles per hour, not inches per century, so 
it's hard for us to grasp that it not only took millions of years for West 
Africa to become New Jersey, or for the ocean bottom to become Everest. It also 
took millions (yes, millions ) of earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 What we of Los Angeles need to realize is that earthquakes are one of the 
basic formative activities of the planet, and that the process never stops. 
Geologically, New Jersey and its surroundings are calm compared with Los 
Angeles -- yet New York had a small earthquake only a few years ago. So did 
Maine. And the biggest quake recorded in North America was in the Midwest, 
circa 1812 -- it was felt as far east as Washington. Nobody knows when these 
sites will be active again. But we do know that even the quietest places, 
geologically, can suddenly and violently waken. And we know that, compared to 
other regions, Los Angeles is a place where the rocks never sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists assure us that things are never going to calm down around here, 
at least not for long. This is what the geologist at Cal Tech was referring to 
on Wednesday, when she cheerfully told a rather baffled room of journalists 
that the city of Los Angeles is headed northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 In about 15 million years, she said, we'll be right next door to San 
Francisco. That's because Los Angeles is on a Pacific "plate" or segment of the 
Earth's crust, and SanFrancisco is on a continental plate; and these plates, 
like all the Earth's plates, are always moving and bumping into each other. 
We're going north whether we like it or not. What that geologist didn't 
elaborate on was that it will take several million earthquakes to get us there. 
</P>
<P>
 This poses a problem for Mayor Richard Riordan. And President Bill Clinton. 
Not to mention the rest of us. We can clean up from this quake the way we 
cleaned up from the quake in '71. We can make up new codes (since old ones 
clearly aren't adequate); we can get data about newly discovered faults; we can 
hand out money; help folks, and rebuild. We can do everything but change the 
basic situation. Because we're just cleaning up for the next quake. And the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, can we stand that? As individuals, as a city and as a 
civilization? 
</P>
<P>
 Our recent 6.6 teaches that a 6.6 is about all this area can manage. Some four 
dozen are dead, thousands homeless, millions are nervous and a lot of 
structures are now unusable -- but for the moment we can manage. Yet, what this 
quake indicates is that a larger quake will take down many more structures and 
kill many more people. And the scientists assure us that larger quakes are 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists and seismologists agree that sometime soon, within our lifetime, 
"the Big One" will hit. They expect a 7 or 8 magnitude event that will affect 
most of California. Think: If a 6.6 is giving us magnitude 5 aftershocks, then 
a 7.6 will probably cause magnitude 6 aftershocks; and 8.6, magnitude 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waiting for the Big One" doesn't mean waiting for one major event, after 
which we can breathe easy. It means waiting for a monster quake that will, in 
turn, usher in a storm of shocks on the scale of what we've just gone through. 
You don't need a geology degree to see we haven't the technology to withstand 
that -- all you have to do is drive around Santa Monica or the Valley and see 
how many structures have been declared uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 And after the Big One, and its consequences, what then? If we have the 
resources to rebuild most of Southern California (and we may not), then the 
pressure will build for another five or 10 decades and we'll be right back 
where we started, over and over, until Los Angeles is next door to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 A rational civilization might decide, in its private and collective 
deliberations, that it's time to move the population and industry of California 
to less geologically volatile areas. Plans could be made to do that gradually, 
over the next decade or so. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is expecting too much. No civilization I know about ever behaved that 
rationally. A few will leave. But most will stay, hoping against hope (as the 
strange phrase goes). But hope never stopped an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 All the psychologists can't explain why, though most know the pertinent facts, 
we refuse to save ourselves from what scientists say is a certain cataclysm. If 
these same scientists were telling us a giant meteor was headed toward Earth 
and about to plummet into California, we'd evacuate immediately. But we are, in 
effect, sitting on a giant meteor that's coming at us from out of the ground, 
and, just because we don't know exactly what day it will hit, we stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 We say we want safety, security, good health and a good future -- and in small 
ways most of us try to achieve those goals. But something in us must not want 
these, or we'd get the hell out of here. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a kid, there was a geology book that had maps of the North American 
continent as it had been through all the ages of the Earth. One eon there was a 
Florida, another eon there wasn't. At one time, according to that book, the 
Pacific came all the way in from Baja, cut around the Rockies and didn't stop 
till the Texas Panhandle. (On mesas of Arizona you still find seashells.) 
Sometimes, there was a California, sometimes not. If you flipped the pages, you 
could watch the continent change, just like a cloud in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, we've built this city not on a hill or even on a cliff, but on 
a cloud of illogic and denial. Geologically, this landscape is changing as fast 
as a cloud in the air. We're trying to hang on for dear life -- but you can't 
hang on to a cloud.

THE CITY; TRAGEDY COMES TO THE MIDDLE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Rodriguez, Richard Rodriguez, an editor at Pacific News Service, is 
the author of Days of Obligation (Viking). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suffering does not necessarily "bring us together." The writer, W. H. Auden, 
remarked in a poem how, when one person is dying, "someone else's eating or 
opening a window or just walking dully alone." Last Mon day, when Los Angeles 
was screaming awake, I was asleep in a silent room. A few hours later, I was 
drinking coffee when I turned on the radio to hear about disaster not so many 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Heroes emerge from events like Monday's earthquake. Think of the firemen 
risking their lives, crawling through rubble in response to a stranger's groan. 
The truth of it, however, is that for every hero, there was also probably a 
looter; for every act of neighborly kindness, there was also price-gouging at 
the mini-mall, and people hoarded at the supermarket to make sure they got 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving around the city with a Canadian TV crew one day after the quake, I was 
part of the media circus that had come to town in search of disaster. Some of 
my crew had been in Armenia and Mexico City and had seen thousands dead. They 
were not the only ones of us who were impressed by how much of Los Angeles was 
back in business, back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 For every neighborhood that was hard hit, there were more where one had no 
sense a great earthquake had hit. Even in devastated blocks in the San Fernando 
Valley, a damaged house often stood next to one seemingly untouched by 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffering did not bind Los Angeles together last week. But it interested the 
world that California -- the Golden State -- was again the scene of calamity. 
Thus, the media circus. 
</P>
<P>
 True or not, the impression outsiders took from last week's earthquake was 
that it was fundamentally a suburban, therefore a middle-class tragedy. The 
race wars of 1992 attached to underclass Los Angeles, and the Malibu fires were 
thought by many to have devastated mainly the rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's broken images bespoke middle-class ambition: the crumpled shopping 
center and attendant parking garage, the devastated apartment house that looked 
like every apartment house one has ever seen in the suburbs (2 br., w/w 
carpeting). The epic-disaster photos were of freeways cracked or crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway belongs to California. Freeways are toll-free in California 
because we have assumed our right to the freedom they offer us. Freeways were 
the metaphor for minding one's own business in the Johnny Carson monologue ("I 
was driving along the Santa Monica Freeway the other day . . . ). 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway was California's gift to civic architecture, our reinvented 
sidewalk. But the freeway was always a middle-class construction -- if you had 
a car, then the entire Southland was yours. If you had a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeways allowed us to buy houses far from the center, far from work, where 
land was cheap and we could have three bedrooms and even a pool and shade 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway freed Californians from the inner cities; freeways also freed us 
from our own families. The house in the suburb had a two-car garage; mothers 
knew how to drive in California. At any given hour, members of the same family 
could be 30 or 40 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Morris, the British travel writer, once described L.A. as a city built 
from naive optimism and technology. But what did a fuddy-duddy like Morris 
know? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go to the mountains and ski or you can go to the beaches on a Sunday 
in January." The freeway liberated us from weather. 
</P>
<P>
 But our greatest freedom was that the freeway separated us from one another. 
One could be alone on a freeway. The funeral cortege might float by, headed for 
Forest Lawn, but in one's own car there could be raucous music or Rush Limbaugh 
or French lessons on a cassette. 
</P>
<P>
 By week's end, people were lined up in suburban parks -- lines that went on 
for 12 hours. At the end, there were government forms to complete in 
triplicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to people in line, I was struck by how alone so many people were and 
how close to the edge they had been living. No savings. The credit cards up to 
the limit. Now there was nothing. Middle-class Californians didn't have enough 
money for Pampers or Coca Cola or a motel night. More telling, there were no 
relatives or friends to whom they could go. They were alone in California! 
</P>
<P>
 It is going to get worse, a policeman predicted, anticipating the impatient 
crowds and the possible rains and the mud. By Wednesday, the same journalists 
who had flattered the city for "pulling together" were remarking on how drivers 
were up to their old tricks of trying to get ahead of one another. 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots in South-Central, right-wing politicians warned against 
"rewarding" lawlessness with government-rebuilding funds. After the Malibu 
fires, left-wing environmentalists clucked that the rock stars up in the 
canyons had gotten what they deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 California is essentially a middle-class state. Our middle-class ambitions 
created this place. So, who will say now that it was a foolish middle-class 
ambition to live so far from work, from leisure, from one another and depend so 
much on a freeway for an entire way of life? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the politicians rushed in. Our politicians know that we Californians 
are angry as hell. We have lost patience with the welfare mother. We have lost 
patience with immigrants. We have lost patience with our own children. We have 
lost patience with losers -- "Three strikes and you're out," we demanded two 
weeks ago on the radio call-in shows. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. now has had its three strikes. But a remarkable number of people in 
lines, waiting for vouchers, were impatient waiting for the government to fix 
their lives. We, middle-class Californians, it seems, are full of a sense of 
entitlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Our governor, or senators -- our politicians all recognize our impatience, and 
they have learned the new politics of whining. The President flew all the way 
across the country to assure us that everything that can be done, will be done. 
</P>
<P>
 My most pessimistic fear is that the week is ending with no lesson learned. 
Californians feel cheated by the engineers and the architecture that, we 
thought, could save us from tragedy. We are angry at Caltrans. And we do not 
like government forms in triplicate. 
</P>
<P>
 My deepest fear is that we have forgotten the joy that brought us to 
California, and we do not know how to repair the break in our heart.

 * Society continues to miss the message of murder trials like that of the 
highly publicized Menendez case.Until laws are established to protect children 
from violence in the home, we will be faced with our children turning their 
pain against their tormentors. Similar murder cases will perpetually riddle 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, America wept as Baby Jessica was ripped from the only home 
she had ever known. Whose rights were protected then? 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands upon thousands of children's rights remain unprotected. Baby Jessica 
and the Menendez brothers may not be so different. Their rights as children 
were ignored. Let's start protecting our children . . . and our future.

<P>
 * Susan Estrich's Opinion article, "Vigilante Justice" (Jan. 16), was on the 
money. Consider this too: 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens who protest in favor of and condone the actions of Lorena 
Bobbitt, the Menendezes, Damian Williams and the woman who killed her son's 
molester should examine the consequences of these people's violent acts.By 
deifying those vigilantes in any form, people send a dangerous message to those 
victims who need help. It tells them that it's OK to mete out justice in your 
own way, regardless of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true many people are ignorant of, or afraid to use, existing legal 
channels to get help. But even those facing serious adversity are responsible 
for their own actions. Our societal energy should be focused on helping people 
before they explode, not in excusing their actions when they do. Most people 
don't commit crimes when under hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 Our compassion should live not in declaring someone innocent of a vengeful 
act, but in consideration of the cause during sentencing.

 * I find it incomprehensible that jurors possessed of IQs above room 
temperature can believe that Erik would confess the killings to a therapist and 
not at the same time blurt out the alleged child abuse which drove him to 
homicide (Jan. 14). Of course this hardly explains why he also decided to kill 
the eyewitness while he was at it.She happened to be his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The real tragedy is not that the taxpayers have been soaked for yet another 
farce of a trial or even that another killer may someday go free. The real 
tragedy is that our public schools produce "educated" citizens with such 
confused values and deficient abilities to analyze and process conflicting 
information that they would believe the highly predictable and clearly 
concocted alibis of a desperate killer able to afford high-priced legal talent 
and imaginative "expert" witnesses.

KINSEY'S TENURE AT REBUILD L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Robert Scheer's interview with Bernard Kinsey (Commentary, Jan. 12) offers a 
view of RLA's role in the rebuilding process which, while not exactly 
inaccurate, skews facts and figures. In at least two vital respects, the record 
must be balanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings may have been rebuilt, but businesses and jobs haven't been rebuilt. 
That fact, coupled with rebuilt businesses which still are not economically 
viable, accounts for much of the severe economic hardship that grips most of 
the neighborhoods RLA was created to serve. RLA emphasized bricks and mortar as 
symbols of economic development. Business owners on the verge of bankruptcy and 
jobless residents of the riot-torn communities would assert that emphasis is 
misdirected. 
</P>
<P>
 Another troublesome aspect of Kinsey's analysis concerns the RLA loan fund. 
That fund was announced fully six months before RLA was prepared to accept 
applications for funds, a calendar which generated enormous frustration. Worse, 
the fund finances only business expansion. Destroyed businesses seeking to 
rebuild are defined as "start-up" applications and given lower priority than 
businesses that were not destroyed. Moreover, much of the capital in the fund 
was donated and was therefore cost-free, but RLA charges prime interest rates 
plus up to four additional percentage points for direct loans. The result, 
however unintentional, discourages applications, limits the potential for job 
creation, and abandons small businesses which had the misfortune to be entirely 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic emergency faced by the merchants and families, neighborhoods and 
former workers as a result of the unrest 20 months ago continues unabated. 
There is no doubt Kinsey tried to help. We wish him well as he joins our 
efforts outside RLA's structure.

NATURE GIVES NOTICE THAT NONE ARE EXEMPT; WE ARE REMINDED, SHARPLY, OF THE NEED 
FOR COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquakes of the previous week, from Monday morning's 6.6 killer through 
the many aftershocks, jolted all of us in Southern California in more ways than 
one. They underlined, with brutal and terrorizing efficiency, our mutual 
interdependence; they dramatized, as perhaps nothing else could, the 
philosophical, spiritual and practical folly of Balkanization. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often we live in little cubbyhole worlds and don't bother much about 
anyone or anything else. "I have mine and you have yours," we say, "and let 
nature take its course." Well, nature surely did take its course last week and 
said to all of us: "You are in this together and just in case you forgot, you 
are not in charge." That humbling message was part of last week's shock: For 
all our technology and sophistication, we are not in full control of our 
destiny. There are greater forces, and they are both more powerful than us and 
totally immune to reason. 
</P>
<P>
 California should be especially clear on this last point. This state in recent 
years has endured more than its share of disasters -- a withering recession, 
high unemployment, a long drought, frightening urban riots, floods, wildfires . 
. . and now this. But, however terrible to experience, the Northridge 
earthquake should serve to raise our collective consciousness. The temblors 
that damaged yet-uncounted structures in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood, 
Santa Monica, Inglewood and South Los Angeles did not discriminate on the basis 
of race, creed or sex. Pricey neighborhoods and more modest ones were hit 
equally. 
</P>
<P>
 The message was not just that we are all in this together but also that we are 
equally vulnerable. Therefore we need one another; need to work with one 
another and, most of all, must not forget these truths until the next disaster 
reminds us anew of our mutual humanity. The freeways that here and there came 
apart were the pathways of all our lives -- to work, to home, to friends. We 
breathe the same air, drink the same water and stand on the common ground that 
nature sometimes moves underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of that higher consciousness emerged last week as people reached out 
to help each other. It was so heartening to see the hands extended to thousands 
of hungry, homeless and hurting people by neighbors, government workers and 
good corporate citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 It was heartening to see the exhaustive, round-the-clock efforts by utility 
crews to restore basic services such as water, gas and electricity. It was 
moving to witness the caravans of donations from food companies, including 
21,000 bagels, 73,000 dinner rolls and 100,000 tortillas. Shell Oil alone 
chipped in $250,000 worth of food, water and other supplies. One Riverside man 
came up with 4,300 bags of ice. The Anheuser-Busch Foundation offered 46,000 
cases of drinking water, 7,000 loaves of bread and $1 million. Thus, after what 
happened last week, what can be the argument for separate worlds, for a lack of 
common interest? Were the week's events not a wake-up call for more community? 
Can we ever have too much of that?

THE $4-BILLION MISUNDERSTANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A series of natural disasters has sent shock waves through California's 
economy in recent years. Now the state may be facing a severe financial test 
stemming from a U.S. Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the most important business cases of the court's current term, 
Barclay's Bank vs. California Franchise Tax Board, the justices will consider 
the constitutionality of the state's so-called unitary tax rule, which taxes 
foreign corporations based on their worldwide revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 One now has the ominous sense that not only will California lose in the high 
court but that it will lose big. The justices could decide that the state will 
have to give back $4 billion in previously collected taxes to multinational 
corporations. This at a time when the state's economy is in its worst shape 
since the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, California has been in the wrong about unitary taxes. Its practice of 
assessing a foreign company's state taxes as a percentage of its worldwide 
revenues is bitterly opposed by multinational companies, even many of those 
headquartered here in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 California's method differs from that of the vast majority of the states, most 
of which levy taxes on the "arms length" or "water's edge" basis. 
</P>
<P>
 These other states may collect less in taxes, but they don't hamper 
Washington's ability to negotiate international trade and taxation agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might argue that unitary taxation is simpler, but a much more compelling 
argument is that California should not march alone in its taxing methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently the Legislature revised state tax policy to offer multinationals an 
option to file their state returns either way -- unitary or water's edge. Even 
so, petitioners including Barclay's Bank and Colgate-Palmolive Co. are seeking 
monetary compensation for past taxes under the unitary method. That's too bad 
for California. The hope was that Sacramento's recent action would make the 
issue moot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department has recently filed a friend-of-the-court brief, 
erroneously supporting California's arguments in favor of unitary taxation but 
rightly arguing that the state should not have to refund billions in back taxes 
to corporations. That's fulfillment of a campaign promise of President Clinton, 
but it's a muddled position at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington must be free to negotiate international tax arrangements as an 
aspect of foreign policy. And California wisely has stopped insisting on a 
unitary tax alone. There the matter should end. The Supreme Court should not 
put such a huge loan on a state already so burdened by recession and nature's 
wrath.

TRICKY PIT STOP ON INFORMATION HIGHWAY; WHY PUBLIC ACCESS IS SUCH A KEY 
PUBLIC-POLICY QUESTION FOR AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The information revolution is hurling us into unknown economic and social 
challenges. The high-tech wiring of America is changing how we communicate, 
work and shop. Those who can afford to tap into the fast-expanding hodgepodge 
of communications services, E-mail and consumer electronics already enjoy the 
many benefits. Those who cannot are being left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 A widening gap between the technology haves and have-nots is not in the public 
interest. Closing the gap is. The Clinton Administration recognizes the need; 
as a result, it has made access to and affordability of the nation's emerging 
information superhighway a major priority in its National Information 
Infrastructure project. The acronym NII may soon become a familiar one. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand vision is to have all classrooms, libraries, hospitals and clinics 
in the United States connected to the NII by the year 2000. Vice President Al 
Gore outlined the need for "universal service" during his speech on 
telecommunications earlier this month at UCLA. The Administration wants 
affordable access to information services for everyone. With technology 
increasingly defining jobs, lifestyles, entertainment and even education, those 
without access may be deprived of social and economic opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 In principle, then, universal service is desirable, much like rural 
electrification and telephone service, over-the-air broadcast services and the 
interstate highway system. But how is universal service to be financed? 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, that is the tricky question, one the Administration so far has deftly 
sidestepped. It is indeed difficult to craft accessibility rules, especially 
when existing on-line information services have yet to merge into the 
envisioned seamless web of communications networks, computers, databases and 
consumer electronics that will put vast amounts of information at a user's 
fingertips. Complicating the process is the scramble among telephone, cable, 
computer and media companies to get into each other's businesses and markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Should government's role be one of high-tech cop in directing universal 
service? Should it be a federal investor, as in the electrification of rural 
America? Should it guarantee the private sector a rate of return in exchange 
for making access affordable? Or should the private sector provide universal 
service pro bono? These questions are arising as the Clinton Administration 
readies a legislative package on telecommunications. The goal is to encourage 
investment, promote competition and provide universal service within a flexible 
regulatory framework. 
</P>
<P>
 As the vice president aptly put it: "It is easy to see where we need to go. 
It's hard to see how to get there." But get there we must.

SECULARISM IN ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Stephen Games is correct in his assessment that the future identity of 
Israel is at stake (Opinion, Jan. 9). He understands that a fragmented Israeli 
people will be counterproductive when addressing the complexities and 
challenges brought by the potential for peace that is now before them. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he is wrong in suggesting that this is not being articulated. The 
Assn. of Reform Zionists of America has been in the forefront in the struggle 
for pluralism and recognition of non-Orthodox expressions of religious Judaism 
since 1977. Despite overwhelming obstacles, ARZA, with the Israel Movement for 
Progressive Judaism, has established a spiritual and cultural religious 
presence in the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reform and Conservative movements could stem the tide of secularism in 
Israel that Games describes as inevitable. What is needed is a constitution and 
legislation that would guarantee equal funding for their institutions and end 
the inflexible control over life-cycle events and personal status. When 
alternatives to Orthodoxy are permitted to flourish, Israel will fulfill its 
role as a Jewish homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 A pluralistic society will enhance, rather than diminish, the character of 
Israel.

SEGREGATION IN JAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am appalled by the notion that black and Hispanic prisoners should be 
segregated in Los Angeles County jails, notwithstanding the fact that the 
American Civil Liberties Union thinks it's OK ("ACLU Weighs Segregation of 
Pitchess Inmates," Jan. 14). 
</P>
<P>
 Desegregation was a hard-fought battle and segregation is against the 
fundamental public policy of this country. 
</P>
<P>
 If we start segregating black and Hispanic prisoners because they have been 
fighting, instead of disciplining the wrongdoers and addressing the source of 
the problem, then what is next? Next, we will be segregating students in 
schools, public housing and transportation for the same reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 This proposed solution is no answer and is an extremely unimaginative and 
objectionable solution. There will never be, in my judgment, any circumstance 
where government segregation of races, for any reason, can be legitimized or 
acceptable.

RTC AND MINORITIES

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re Ron Harris' column on the meeting between "black business types" and the 
Resolution Trust Corp., Jan. 14: Truth is, dealing with the RTC is tough for 
nearly everybody; I'm quite sure the race of a prospective buyer of an RTC 
property is not a factor in the evaluation of a particular purchase offer.A 
prospective vendor of services to the RTC would, however, receive favored 
consideration ("bonus points") if minority-owned. 
</P>
<P>
 As a real estate agent I have represented African American, Latino, Asian and 
Caucasian buyers in the purchase of bank-owned apartments and commercial 
property. Never has the race of the buyer been any factor in any transaction.

'VIGILANTE JUSTICE,' MENENDEZ TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Susan Estrich may be a professor of law, but in her article she demonstrated 
as much knowledge of the U.S. jury system as she did of political campaigning 
when she served as Michael Dukakis' campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is easy to sympathize with her major premise that perpetrators of an 
indictable act should not be depicted as victims, one must not fall into the 
trap of faulting American due process and the jury system.Lawyers for the 
defense are employed specifically to defend their clients. They must use every 
legal means at their command to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Darrow may not have gotten Leopold and Loeb free; but he will long be 
remembered in the legal profession for his precedent-setting defense and his 
most eloquent summation to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, to Estrich's dismay, in our country defendants are still entitled to 
a trial by a jury of their peers. Understanding citizens must guarantee that 
this is one entitlement that is never taken away.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; REBELLION AGAINST ECONOMIC EXILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE A. COLLIER, George A. Collier is chairman of the department of 
anthropology at Stanford University. He has been studying agrarian politics and 
agrarian change in Chiapas since 1960. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Meeting recently in Russia, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agreed that social 
costs of economic restructuring are worrisome, acknowledging what has been 
brought home to Mexico's President Salinas de Gortari with a vengeance by the 
Zapatista rebels of eastern Chiapas. The governments of both Mexico and Russia 
are confronted by the resentment of "client" groups that are losing the 
protection and paternalistic benefits of the former corporatist state. 
Meanwhile, economic restructuring, although promising future prosperity, 
rewards some at the expense of others. In the Mexican case, the rebels of 
eastern Chiapas count themselves among those "others." 
</P>
<P>
 Press reports describing the Mexican uprising portray the rebels as Indians 
upset over years of poverty and discrimination. The reality has more to do with 
changing government policies, agricultural modernization and cultural isolation 
that disproportionately threaten the Indians of eastern Chiapas, who make up 
the ranks of the Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the 1982 debt crisis, Mexico dismantled market controls, sold 
off state-owned enterprises and reneged on commitments to client groups like 
peasants. In much of Chiapas, Indian leaders used long-standing ties to the 
PRI, Mexico's ruling party, to weather the changes. Rural power holders 
repositioned themselves advantageously as produce merchants in the changing 
rural economy, while the government channeled funding through them for 
followers. Although opposition parties made inroads in central and western 
Chiapas in the 1988 elections, community leaders loyal to the PRI deflected and 
marginalized the opposition with tacit cooperation of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Some peasants profit from economic restructuring by capitalizing their 
agriculture. In central and western Chiapas, wealthier peasants spend earnings 
from other economic activities for fertilizer, herbicides and harvest 
transport. Others, who lack capital or must borrow at usurious rates, cannot 
afford to farm. They rent out their land and work as poorly paid field hands. 
Throughout Mexico, restructuring is widening the gap between well-to-do 
peasants, many of them favorable to the PRI, and poor peasants, often 
disenfranchised, who swell the bottom strata of their communities or eke out 
livelihoods as squatters on the peripheries of nearby cities and towns. 
Privatization of Mexico's agrarian reform land, envisioned in recent revisions 
of the constitution, will widen the gap as wealthy peasants buy out others' 
parcels, much as wealthy Russians are buying up privatized Russian housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But eastern Chiapas's poor peasants have neither urban centers to turn to nor 
established places in the structures of power. The region was settled as late 
as the 1950s, when Indians from Chiapas' over-populated central highlands 
arrived in unregulated migration, swelled by colonists from central and 
northern Mexico in the 1970s. As they converged in rapidly shifting frontier 
settlements in the tropical forest, migrants shucked ethnic origin for generic 
peasant identities, diverse sects of Protestantism and new forms of peasant 
organizing, which appealed to but rarely won support from the Mexican state in 
a reign the government did not control. 
</P>
<P>
 As government dismantled programs favoring peasants, those of eastern Chiapas 
gave up hope for their future within the country's new economic system. 
Peasants kept on the move, satellite images show, battling with other settlers 
for territory, as cornfields rapidly converted tropical forest soils into land 
good only for grazing or coffee growing. In this remote region with few 
roadways or urbanized settlements, peasants had nowhere to turn to escape the 
threat to their life of subsistence agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the immigrants to eastern Chiapas from central and northern Mexico 
were fervently leftist, with political roots going back to the 1968 massacre in 
Mexico City's Tlatelolco Square. By the 1980s, settlers had formed unions as 
alternatives to the peasant organizations of the PRI. As the state removed 
subsidies for fertilizer and dismantled the system of agrarian credit, the 
opposition groups sought non-government credits and market outlets. So while 
central and western Chiapas peasants responded to changing politics from within 
the traditional power structure linked to the PRI, those from the eastern part 
of the state turned to opposition groups to alleviate the painful changes being 
made by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, then, must negotiate with the rebels -- as it has offered to do -- 
because it probably cannot root them out of the rugged, inaccessible lowlands. 
With the attention of the world on it, Mexico will surely offer to alleviate 
the hardships of this zone. But can Mexico or Russia -- or our own society for 
that matter -- meet the needs of the growing ranks of those whose homes, 
livelihood and enfranchisement are threatened by economic restructuring?

sheriff's detective investigated and recommended to the district attorney's 
office that one of the youths (who has allegedly been suspended from the school 
three times since September) be charged. The detective also informed us that 
the youths involved have admitted to the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 I was satisfied with the detective's response. I thought at least my daughter 
could get counseling and try to put the incident behind her. My first instinct 
had been to go after youths, but I realized I would be of no value to my family 
in prison. I decided to let the school handle it, and this is how they 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal of her intermediate school said that he would not expel the two 
students involved. "The most we can do is suspend the youths for five days 
unless we feel that the youths' presence on campus would have a negative impact 
upon the individuals academic performance or would create an intimidating, 
hostile or offensive educational environment," he said, quoting from Rowland 
Unified School District Board Policy. I could not believe what I was hearing. 
"Do you realize what kind of message you are sending to the other students?" I 
asked him. "How can you say that it would not create an intimidating, hostile 
or offensive educational environment? How can you tell me that they could 
commit a crime like this and get a five-day vacation?" 
</P>
<P>
 I went above him to the district assistant superintendent who, after checking 
into the incident, agreed with the principal.  
</P>
<P>
 You hear about incidents like this and figure there must be another side to 
the story. In this case, there was. A few weeks before the attack, a sexually 
explicit and threatening note written by the attacker was confiscated by a 
teacher who gave it to an administrator at the school, who neglected to tell me 
or my wife about it. The note described in graphic detail what the attacker was 
going to do to my daughter.  
</P>
<P>
 It is my opinion that the administrators involved in investigating the attack 
are the same ones who have the most to lose by seeing that the attackers are 
punished. My wife and I feel that the principal and assistant superintendent 
have attempted to minimize and downplay the incident to protect themselves from 
negative exposure caused by their failure to inform us about the note. They are 
more interested in protecting their image than the children they have the 
responsibility to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we distributed fliers to alert other parents. The vice principal responded 
with a note to all parents that said "the youths involved have been suspended 
pending further disciplinary action." On the day the letter was written, a 
friend of my daughter's told us that one of the youths was back on campus, and 
the other one would have been if his mother had not voluntarily removed him. 
Eighteen days after the incident, a demonstration and press conference was held 
in front of the school. A few hours later, the principal called to tell me that 
school officials had decided to recommend expulsion for the main offender.  
</P>
<P>
 When the hearing for expulsion took place, the principal asked my daughter 
three or four questions, none pertaining to the main attack in the alley where 
she screamed and cried to get away from the attacker. When he said there were 
no further questions, I was astonished that he failed to mention the attack. I 
asked to make the record reflect the attack. I was asked to leave the room or 
be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I attended the juvenile criminal hearing, which had to be postponed 
because the boy's file had been lost in the court system somehow. Last month, I 
attended the school board meeting and was somewhat relieved that members 
decided to expel the main offender. But I am still angry, because I honestly 
feel that if I had not taken off work for the past month to attend meetings and 
organize a phone and letter campaign and a demonstration, this youth would not 
have received more than a five-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot believe the anger and hurt parents feel when their child has been 
violated like this, first by the attackers, and then by the system. How can we 
as a society expect to stop these horrendous crimes against our children unless 
those responsible for administering justice send a clear message to everyone 
that we will no longer tolerate it?

COLUMN LEFT: ACCESSIBLE JUSTICE FOR COPS' VICTIMS; LAW-ENFORCEMENT DOES POORLY 
AT DISCIPLINING ITSELF, SO LET'S TRY SMALL CLAIMS COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD KAYE, Ronald Kaye, an attorney with the Greater Watts Justice Center, 
is one of the founders of the Police Abuse Small Claims Clinic, a board member 
of the National Lawyer's Guild and a former staff attorney on the Christopher 
Commission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have had almost three years now of trials and special commissions that put 
the Los Angeles Police Department and the county Sheriff's Department under 
close scrutiny. Reforms of many kinds have been proposed, but the truth is that 
neither police force has taken substantial measures to regain the trust of 
communities of color -- the people who overwhelmingly are the victims of police 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, victims of police abuse in Los Angeles have felt that their 
valid claims against police officer misconduct would not have the clout 
necessary to produce any change in violent police behavior. First, as 
demonstrated in both the Christopher Commission on the LAPD and the Kolts 
Reports on the Sheriff's Department, the internal complaint process -- where 
victims of police abuse file complaints against offending officers -- has not 
resulted in effective disciplinary actions against these officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet neither Christopher nor Kolts recommended civilian review to enhance the 
credibility of the complaint procedure. Although there appeared to be 
significant reform advocated by these two commissions, the reality is that no 
true accountability occurs where discipline is solely an internal police 
matter. To rely exclusively on cops to review other cops' behavior has low 
credibility by definition. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the courts as the only recourse for victims of police abuse. But 
there are few attorneys who specialize in civil-rights actions against the 
police department. Even these attorneys are not likely to take a case without 
the possibility of a substantial monetary judgment. This reality leaves the 
homeowner whose house has been trashed in a mistaken drug raid and the motorist 
unjustifiably stopped and roughed up but not badly injured without a means of 
legal or moral redress. Add to this a general distrust of the legal system in 
communities of color, and victims of police abuse are left voiceless, without 
any avenue to seek justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, contrary to the party line of government officials -- that the residents 
of Los Angeles should now concentrate on "healing" after two years of conflict 
-- the denial of the endemic problem of police abuse and the community's lack 
of power against it can and will lead to renewed frustration and outrage like 
that experienced in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, one court where citizens don't need a legal team or a 
big-dollar complaint to seek justice. It's Small Claims Court, more often 
thought of as a place for landlord-tenant or contract disputes. It could also 
be a forum for making police accountable; the key is in helping citizens make 
their own case and take it to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, a coalition of public-interest groups, including the Los 
Angeles chapter of the National Lawyer's Guild, Police Watch, the Mark 
Rosenberg Community Law Center of South-Central Los Angeles and the ACLU of 
Southern California have created a Police Abuse Small Claims Clinic to 
represent victims of police abuse. The clinic is currently operating out of 
Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles. The clinic is staffed by law 
students, legal workers and supervising attorneys, all working with the client 
to prepare cases for Small Claims Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles communities of color continue to live day to day with personal 
knowledge of incidents where innocent young men are forced to "spread eagle and 
kiss the sidewalk" and unsuspecting families suffer from police searches where 
the modus operandi is "walls down, carpets up." Although such acts of violence 
are generally worth more than the $5,000 jurisdictional maximum allowed in 
Small Claims Court, at least victims will now have a way to make their claims 
heard. Of equal importance, "rogue cops," those who commit multiple acts of 
abuse, would have a record visible for public review. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Abuse Small Claims Clinic is intended to create an atmosphere of 
accountability among the police officers of Los Angeles County, as well as to 
provide a vehicle for the community to seek justice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, it might also prompt the real policy changes -- specifically 
civilian review boards -- that are necessary for improvement of the 
law-enforcement environment in Los Angeles.

COLUMN RIGHT: STROBE TALBOTT'S IDEAS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES; NOW THAT HIS 
THOUGHTS AFFECT MORE THAN MAGAZINE READERS, THE SENATE MUST CLOSELY EXAMINE HIS 
PRIOR WRITINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WEIGEL, George Weigel is president of the Ethics and Public Policy 
Center in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state-designate, was more than a mere 
reporter during his days as chief diplomatic correspondent and editor-at-large 
of Time magazine. He was, rather, an advocate for a distinctive interpretation 
of the Cold War, and particularly of its endgame. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he is playing a large, even dominant, role in formulating U.S. 
foreign policy, Talbott's understanding of the recent past is of more than 
antiquarian interest. For the way Talbott thought about the collapse of 
European communism is clearly shaping the way he is thinking about the future. 
And, as the recent NATO summit demonstrated, the way Talbott is thinking about 
the future is likely to become the way the United States government thinks 
about the future of post-communist Central and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, senators questioning Talbott at his upcoming confirmation hearings might 
well revisit some of his more provocative analyses of the history of the 1980s 
-- not to settle the ongoing argument about who won the Cold War and how, but 
to determine how Talbott's understanding of the revolution of 1989 shapes his 
vision of U.S. policy in the 1990s. Senators so inclined might begin with 
Talbott's essay, "Rethinking The Red Menace," from the Jan. 1, 1990, issue of 
Time -- the issue that proclaimed Mikhail Gorbachev "Man of the Decade." Based 
on that essay, here are the questions it would be interesting to hear Talbott 
address: 
</P>
<P>
 * Do you still believe that "Gorbachev . . . had a near monopoly on the 
promulgation of bold ideas" in the endgame of the Cold War? Did President 
Reagan or Prime Minister Thatcher or Pope John Paul II have any "bold ideas" 
during the 1980s? How about Lech Walesa? Or Tadeusz Mazowiecki? Or Vaclav 
Havel? 
</P>
<P>
 * You placed enormous stress on Gorbachev's role in breaking our "grand 
obsession" with the Cold War. Psychiatry aside, how does your judgment on 
Gorbachev's singular role in the 1980s shape your judgment on Yeltsin's 
distinctive role in the 1990s? We all want Yeltsin to succeed. But given his 
dire economic problems, we wonder why Yeltsin has proposed a Yalta II in which 
the West and Russia would decide the fate of East-Central Europe. Is Yeltsin 
vulnerable to neo-imperialist pressures within his reform coalition? And if so, 
isn't that a more immediate threat than the ravings of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky? 
</P>
<P>
 * Would you explain your claim that "for more than four decades, Western 
policy (was) based on a grotesque exaggeration of what the U.S.S.R. could do if 
it wanted to?" Did Harry Truman, Dean Acheson and Arthur Vandenberg 
"grotesquely exaggerate" the Soviet threat after World War II? Did Dwight 
Eisenhower in the mid-1950s? Did John F. Kennedy in 1961? Doesn't the 
suggestion that they did imply that the Cold War was really the West's fault? 
What does that implication suggest about U.S. policy today? 
</P>
<P>
 * You wrote that "scenarios for a Soviet invasion of Western Europe . . . 
always had a touch a paranoid fantasy about them." Do Walesa's and Havel's 
concerns about a post-communist revival of Russian imperialism exhibit "a touch 
of paranoid fantasy"? How do you read Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. 
Kozyrev's assertion of a historic Russian sphere of influence in east-central 
Europe? Prior to the arrival of the Red Army in 1945, when had Russia ever 
asserted an interest in Prague? 
</P>
<P>
 * You wrote that "the doves in the Great Debate of the past 40 years were 
right all along." What role do you think NATO military modernization played in 
the endgame of the Cold War? How did the Strategic Defense Initiative influence 
Soviet negotiating behavior in the late 1980s? What role does other states' 
military capability play today in shaping Russian understanding of the Russian 
role in East-Central Europe and in the "near abroad" of the former Soviet 
republics? 
</P>
<P>
 * Did human-rights activism behind the Iron Curtain influence the collapse of 
communism? Your own writings focus on what happened "at the highest level." Do 
you believe that democracy and the free market will be consolidated in Russia 
primarily from the top down? What role do democratic and entrepreneurial 
activists at the grass-roots level play in stabilizing post-communist Russia? 
</P>
<P>
 Ideas, as ever, have consequences. Strobe Talbott's ideas could have great 
impact, for good or for ill, on the history of the 1990s. They deserve the 
closest critical scrutiny.

PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; COFFEE AMID THE CHAOS: ONE MAN'S SEARCH FOR NORMALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOBBY WOODS, Bobby Woods is the president of the entertainment consulting 
firm, Heart Times Coffee Cup Equals Lightning. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is about the management of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 I start my day with a cup of coffee, I don't feel ready until I've had it. I 
may have a physical addiction to caffeine -- a drug I believe will be come 
prescription-only in the future, similar to what happened to cocaine in the 
'30s. But more than that, coffee is an anchor in the post-traumatic, 
subconscious search for order through the chaos of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a native of Los Angeles, and I've had my share of earthquakes. Generally, 
they don't bother me that much. A few have sent me running out of the house in 
terror, but over the years I've trained myself not to worry until they hit 3.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Only minutes after that terrible quake Monday morning, I looked out over the 
blackened city still shaking under the stars. I didn't worry about my safety, 
though I was shivering from fright. Suddenly, all I wanted was a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no way I was going back to sleep. And without power there was no way 
to brew coffee at my house. So, since I was starting my day at 4:30 a.m., there 
was only one thing to do. My neighbor, Sheldon, and I piled into the car and 
headed for the 7-11. We went winding down the Hollywood Hills. In my 
convertible, we descended into the ravaged and panicked city -- in pursuit of a 
cup of coffee.  
</P>
<P>
 Driving down the Sunset Strip, we passed many others who, like us, were afraid 
to be at home and sought some relief by listening to the news on their car 
radios. The 7-11 at Sunset and Stanley was open, but they weren't letting 
anyone in. This convenience store chain had been particularly hard hit during 
the riots, and these people were ready for trouble. They had a barricade at the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers lined up outside and told the men at the door what they wanted. Then 
one of the men would disappear into the store, get the items and make change 
out of his pocket. Then one employee yelled, "We're out of batteries and 
water!" A third of the line left. 
</P>
<P>
 I finally got a look inside, and headed back to the car. "It's no good," I 
said, "All the coffee pots are broken. Let's go." 
</P>
<P>
 We drove slowly through a city without traffic lights. Drivers were more 
courteous than usual. But Hollywood was a bust. There was no coffee anywhere. 
We headed for the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun was just coming up as we went over the Cahuenga Pass. News helicopters 
flew overhead. A CNN crew had set up in the middle of Ventura Boulevard. Here 
we were, in the center of an international news scene, as cameras broadcast our 
story to the world -- but without any coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 We started to see real damage. The windows of most storefronts had shattered. 
It seemed as if every house had a fallen chimney or broken wall. "To hell with 
it," Sheldon said, "Let's get back to see if the house is still standing." 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed like a good idea. We turned the car back toward Hollywood and headed 
up Beverly Glen. Broken water mains had turned some streets into angry, muddy 
rivers. Natural gas leaks, threatening to explode, whistled under the car. As 
the aftershocks kept coming, we swerved to avoid rock slides.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, at Mulholland, a miracle. A house was in flames ahead of us but, through 
the smoke, we saw a catering truck. It was parked at the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt as if we were in the eye of a hurricane. The atmosphere became 
incredibly peaceful. We stopped in the middle of the street.  
</P>
<P>
 A small group of people was standing around the truck, buying food from the 
Mexican couple inside. Customers made friends and compared stories -- each with 
its own subtext of panic. We make it through our crises by carrying out our own 
tiny routines. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman, wearing a "Roseanne" jacket, ordered a hamburger for her dog. She 
introduced herself to a man dressed only in his terry-cloth robe. Someone said 
Jack Nicholson had just driven by, looking "pretty freaked-out." 
</P>
<P>
 A man in a perfectly coordinated earthquake outfit was trying to break a $100 
bill. Behind him, in the Range Rover, his wife struggled to keep their three 
children strapped in the baby seats. He asked the cook for bagels and cream 
cheese as if he were standing at the counter at Greenblatt's. "How about a BLT 
instead?" she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 I turned and saw David Hockney, whose paintings of swimming pools have come to 
characterize Los Angeles. He ordered a breakfast burrito off the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone had a Watchman and we all saw the broken freeway for the first time. 
One man put his arm around his wife, comforting her. All of us focused on 
coffee and hot food while the city rumbled below. Though the day's tragedy was 
far from over, in its unstoppable way, order was beginning to return.  
</P>
<P>
 I poured my cup of coffee, and ordered a fried-egg sandwich. Flames and smoke 
floated over the troubled valley below. I added cream, and took a sip. And 
through these seemingly insignificant and eccentric little rituals, the fear 
was starting to come under control.

EAST SIDE, WEST SIDE; THE TUG OF WAR BETWEEN L.A.'S RIVAL REALITIES IS 
POLARIZING THE CITY. BUT SOME ANGELENOS ARE BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Contributing editor Jill Stewart's last piece for this 
magazine was on the Los Angeles mayor's race. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ocean air cools the packed bodies at Santa Monica's Electronic Cafe as a 
bash for the elite of the information highway picks up steam. Crisp computer 
types and mellow virtual realists exchange techno-greetings: "Hi. Military 
simulations?" "Of course, SAG." The cafe, a high-tech playground jammed with 
interactive-media equipment that can link up with Europe or South America, has 
drawn a highly educated, mostly white crowd this night. Lofty issues float off 
lips. The mood is bold. The talk is of changing the very nature of business, of 
crossing social barriers via computers, of making big bucks. The night is very 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 At that hour, across town in East Los Angeles, a football game winds down, the 
eternal grudge match between Roosevelt and Garfield high schools. Husbands who 
graduated Garfield sit on opposite bleachers from wives who graduated 
Roosevelt, and nobody finds that funny. The mood is proud. The stadium, crammed 
with 22,000 Latinos, hardly any blacks or whites, is a roaring sea. Two girls 
climb a railing, giggling when school police scold them. There is a palpable 
sense of community, of old rivals gruffly acknowledging the existence of the 
other. When the game ends, 90 young men shake hands and strut off the field. 
The scene is very Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Angelenos don't know about the big game, especially Westsiders. When 
someone at the cafe says she's leaving to catch the final quarter, having heard 
about the game on TV, people stare as if she's just announced she's off to 
Beirut. Then it happens. The Westside vs. Eastside thing. A man speaks up: "Are 
you sure that's safe to do? Isn't it awfully late?" One guest manages a 
concerned chin up! expression. "Be careful!" It's not late on the Westside, of 
course. But isn't it deeply, darkly late in East L.A? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a critical measure of Los Angeles' dual reality that Santa Monica and 
East Los Angeles are four seconds apart by modem and only minutes by car, yet 
they are often separated by a psychological span of light years. Los Angeles is 
divided in a host of ways -- by race, income, attitude. And one of those 
fundamental splits is geographical. L.A. is in many ways two different cities, 
the Westside and everything else: that vague inland reality that has no handy 
nickname, beginning where the Westside trails off and stretching to the slopes 
of the San Gabriels. Though Angelenos can't seem to agree just where the border 
between West and East lies in a city changing as rapidly as ours, there is 
still a sense, deeply embedded in our psychology, that there is another side of 
town whose freeway exits we do not know and whose lifestyles we do not share. 
Exploring this idea in barrooms and boardrooms across the city, one hears a 
cacophony of voices -- some amusing, some passionate, many revelatory. 
</P>
<P>
 The east and west often hold each other in contempt, with Eastsiders dumping 
on the "white bread" Westside, and Westsiders clucking that the rest of the 
town has gone to hell. And everybody gets into the act, from powerbrokers to 
housekeepers. Influential market researcher and Westsider Richard Maullin 
insists there "is no East-West to Los Angeles," but when asked why Eastsiders 
blubber on so about the Westside, retorts, "It's self-hatred. They are saying, 
'I would like to be like people on the Westside and because I know that I am 
not, I hate you.' " Silver Lake resident Mike Roos, president of the education 
reform group LEARN and a man who usually acts as an unofficial ambassador for 
the two sides of town, likens Westsiders to a bunch of sheep who in the 1980s 
"bought piece-of-s- - - little boxes for $600,000. They could have had palaces 
in Burbank, but they want to receive and express the acknowledgment: I live on 
the Westside." 
</P>
<P>
 Each side relishes its myths about the other. Eastsiders love to howl that 
Westsiders are a bunch of phonies. Malcolm Boyd, the prolific author, Episcopal 
priest and Silver Lake resident, recalls his favorite Westside moment: "I was 
at -- Mortons? -- and I heard someone at another table say, 'Steven Spielberg 
is reading my script today by the pool.' And of course it was total bulls- - -! 
The point is, the gods and goddesses are said to be closer to the earth on the 
Westside, but they're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Earthy Eastside gays, like Boyd, live in the bohemian pockets east of Vermont 
and call the glitzy Westside gays, who live in upscale West Hollywood, 
"WE-HOs," with the emphasis on "HO." County Supervisor Gloria Molina, according 
to one longtime fund raiser, balks at attending meetings in Hancock Park 
because it's just "too far West." And despite Pasadena's location beyond the 
historic Eastside, some Pasadenans see themselves as arbiters of a new Eastside 
consciousness, directly competing with the Westside. Pasadena Mayor Rick Cole 
brags that Pasadena yuppies spend their money on "more meaningful things" than 
Brentwood yuppies.  
</P>
<P>
 The Westside, meanwhile, often regards the Eastside with subdued horror. If 
the Westside is the American Dream, then the Eastside is its nightmare. Some 
wealthy Bel-Air residents grandly point out that they "never go east of 
Doheny," while the less timorous probe as far inland as La Cienega, La Brea, 
even Vermont. One Westside arts leader confides that spending $214 million on 
the Downtown Library renovation "was a complete waste" because Westsiders will 
never use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Westsiders are particularly mystified that Eastsiders manage to stagger past 
the age of 50, given the smog they suck in. "You can't really breathe that 
crap, can you?" asks Stephen Yagman, the flamboyant Venice attorney who handles 
police brutality cases. Yagman remains so cocooned on the beach that, he 
concedes, "I know 200 people pretty well in Venice, and about 20 in the entire 
rest of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 TV weathermen (Westsiders, no doubt) hardly ever mention airborne carcinogens 
like benzene, cadmium and ethylene that strike people in Beverly Hills and 
Westwood just as often as they do in City Terrace and Glendale. Invisible 
carbon monoxide blankets the South Bay more than Burbank, but who hears about 
it? It's all part of the east-west mythology. The Eastside is a place where 
laundry hangs out for all to see, while the Westside is about appearances. If 
one can't see the smog, one can justify spending $350,000 for an aging rambler 
in Rancho Park (comfortably west of La Cienega) without so much as a pool.  
</P>
<P>
 Each side has its point. According to AQMD officials, daily ozone levels on 
the Eastside exceed federal health standards twice as often as on the Westside. 
Eastsiders often litter as if their streets were one giant trash can, dumping 
sofas and hurling hamburger wrappers at a rate that city street sweepers simply 
cannot match. And there are more status victims on the Westside, where one in 
100 people has had plastic surgery and nearly one in 58 who bought a new car in 
1993 found it necessary to pay more than $35,000 for it. 
</P>

 Dennis Macheski, Price Waterhouse real estate research director, has authored 
a study of Los Angeles, the latest of many that confirm, he says, "that Los 
Angeles really is a 'Tale of Two Cities.' " Using Mulholland Drive and the 
Pomona Freeway as a diagonal northern border, the study found that the poorest 
and least educated metro area on the entire West Coast is the region east of 
the Harbor Freeway. Meanwhile, one of the richest and best educated areas of 
the West Coast is west of the Harbor Freeway, where nearly one in five 
households earns more than $75,000 a year. Los Angeles Times marketing data, 
roughly using La Brea Avenue as the division (see chart below) shows that about 
twice as many Westies as Easties have a stockbroker and a gold or platinum 
credit card. At the same time, one in three people living east of La Brea has 
no health insurance, compared to one in nine on the Westside -- a stark 
reminder that for much of the city's working class, the economic barriers in 
Los Angeles are as durable as a steel-toed shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 LOST IN ALL THE SNIPING BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES, GOOD-NATURED AND otherwise, are 
some important facts. The truth is that the Westside is far more diverse than 
many believe. Santa Monica's median income is $37,000, the same as Mid-Wilshire 
and Silver Lake. Palms, Mar Vista, Venice and large sections of Santa Monica 
are all more than 20% Latino. Asian Americans make up more than 10% of the area 
stretching from Mar Vista to Sunset Boulevard along the 405 freeway. By the 
same token, a study of the U.S. Census by Cal State Northridge shows that the 
least diverse region in Los Angeles is not the Westside, but the Eastside's 
homogeneous Latino settlement that sprawls across 50 square miles from El 
Sereno to South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, crime, which some Westsiders imagine is turning the city to 
rubble somewhere beyond the La Brea Tar Pits, is in fact not much more 
prevalent in Eastside communities. With the exception of the Central region, 
which, like most big-city downtowns, suffers exceptionally high crime, the 
broad eastern section of Los Angeles is no more crime-ridden than the Westside. 
For the first 10 months of 1993, unincorporated East Los Angeles and the area 
served by the LAPD's Hollenbeck station (Chinatown, El Sereno, Monterey Hills, 
Boyle Heights) had virtually identical robbery rates to Santa Monica and LAPD's 
West L.A. area (Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, Westwood, Bel-Air, Rancho Park). 
Santa Monica and the LAPD's Pacific area (Westchester, Playa del Rey, Venice, 
Mar Vista, Palms) suffered more rapes -- .5 per 1,000 residents -- than East 
Los Angeles with .25 per 1,000. Auto theft was mixed: worst in Santa Monica and 
the LAPD's Pacific and Hollywood areas and markedly less prevalent in East Los 
Angeles and the Hollenbeck and West L.A. divisions. The homicide rate was high 
for the Rampart area (Westlake, Koreatown, parts of Echo Park), with .4 per 
1,000, but was far lower -- .2 per 1,000 -- for East Los Angeles and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 But tell all that to Westsiders, and frankly, many don't believe it. 
Litter-strewn, graffiti-marked, chain-link-fenced, window-barred sections of 
Boyle Heights, Maywood, Hollywood and Echo Park look just awful, thus they must 
be awful. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the Westside's posing, appearances do matter in Los Angeles more and 
more. Graffiti, largely a Latino youth phenomenon, has cordoned off much of the 
Eastside with visual barriers that turn back traffic and commerce as abruptly 
as a border patrol. Or, as hothead economist Joel Kotkin puts it, "How 'bout 
the death penalty for taggers? Schmucks will say I'm racist to criticize, but 
do you really think Latinos, blacks and Asians like graffiti? It's a sign to 
the aspiring middle class that your neighborhood is s- - -. It's the taggers 
and the whining PCers who support them who provide the reason the middle class 
leaves Los Angeles, and this destroys the very basis of the economy that 
immigrants and others can rise upon. Think of Detroit. There is no neat, clean 
Westside in Detroit. Oh boy, let's copy Detroit, you know what I mean?"  
</P>
<P>
 Truly sophisticated Eastsiders don't argue with the Westside's aversion to 
Eastside funkiness. Pasadena's Mayor Cole, asked the key ingredient to his 
city's financial success as an inland hub even as its immigrant population 
booms, says, "Keeping it very clean." Barrio Planners president Frank 
Villalobos, explaining the secret to his award-winning revitalization projects 
like the Whittier Boulevard redesign in East Los Angeles, says, "maintenance 
contracts keep everything attractive and clean."  
</P>
<P>
 Truly sophisticated Westsiders, on the other hand, don't create absurd borders 
over which they cannot cross. Father Bud Kieser, a Paulist priest and Hollywood 
TV and movie producer, preaches an early-morning Mass to a rich Westwood parish 
and a late-morning Mass to a low-income mid-city parish. He has found that 
crossing the city's borders, especially dealing with the poor, has enriched his 
understanding of his fellow Angelenos and himself. "If you look at the faces in 
my (mid-city) church, you see the struggling, the real problems of jobs, of 
children, of facing retirement or fearing the loud family who've moved in next 
door. But on the Westside, you see the problem is almost too much freedom. They 
have the money to do anything, and they lose themselves; they lose their 
center." 
</P>
<P>
 West and East could both learn a great deal, and enjoy their city much more, 
if they'd make an effort to go "bi-coastal." Pity the poor Eastsider who's 
never dined on lox and eggs at Nate 'n Al's in Beverly Hills (it's only $7) or 
slogged through fern glades to peek at Malibu's well-kept-secret waterfalls. 
Pity the poor Westsider who's never been to St. Vincent de Paul in Lincoln 
Heights, one of the great thrift stores in California. Most Westsiders know 
nothing of buying tomatoes for 29 cents a pound at Downtown's Grand Central 
Market or renting a boat to watch the lotuses bloom on Echo Park Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR ALL THESE DIVISIONS OF LIFE AND LEISURE, IT'S NOT CLEAR WHERE the Eastside 
ends and the Westside begins. The old psychological and physical border to the 
Eastside was the Los Angeles River. In the 1700s and 1800s, the Spanish settled 
many historic ranchos all over Southern California. Beginning in the late 
1800s, Latinos moved in great waves from Mexico to areas east of the river, 
transforming largely Jewish Boyle Heights into one of the city's first barrios. 
Sixth-generation Mexican Americans can still be found there today. But the 
river is no longer the boundary, as Latino immigration tramples the old 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Westside, as defined by Pacific Bell, the Air Quality 
Management District, Los Angeles Times Poll and the Los Angeles Police 
Department, roughly begins at La Cienega Boulevard. But given the cachet of 
such Westside-esque phenomena as Michel Richard's glamorous Citrus restaurant 
and trendy Diamond Foam & Fabric -- both good bets for spotting movie stars -- 
La Brea Avenue seems to be the new demarcation zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Silverton, co-owner, with her husband, Mark Peel, of hip Campanile 
restaurant, chose La Brea six years ago because it wasn't on the Westside, and 
she wanted something "more diverse and eclectic." But now, with New York 
designer Anna Sui (sort of Addams Family retro wear) just up the block, and 
chichi gallery owners breathing down Campanile's neck on Beverly Boulevard, the 
Westside has encircled Silverton and Peel. 
</P>
<P>
 They are philosophical about the transformation. Peel notes, with a hint of 
pride, that nearby stores "are not chains or quick investments like what has 
happened to Melrose but are individual efforts that create a sense of 
permanence and commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 If one draws an imaginary line up La Brea, through the Hollywood Hills, 
curving west at the Ventura Freeway to follow the coastline, one finds that 
Encino, Studio City and Sherman Oaks, so-called "Valley" communities, are, in 
attitude, spirit and proximity, on the Westside. They are far more linked to 
Beverly Hills and Brentwood today than they are to such rumpled cousins as Van 
Nuys or North Hollywood. Some realtors, who Roos and others believe play a 
divisive role in parceling up the city, shriek happily if a home is "south of 
Ventura."  
</P>
<P>
 Historian Kevin Starr says cities can't help but develop "sides." The Upper 
East Side in New York, the South Side of Chicago, undersides everywhere. L.A. 
started to evolve into an east-west city, he maintains, in the early 1900s, 
after the Wilshire brothers envisioned a westward push along the ancient path 
that once linked the Indian village of Yang Na, on the Los Angeles River, to 
the coast. Developer A.W. Ross bought up huge parcels of the Wilshire brothers' 
holdings and realized their dream, finally completing the boulevard's trek to 
the sea in 1934. Los Angeles marched westward. Sheep-grazing land gave rise to 
what is now the Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel in 1926 and Bullock's Wilshire in 
1929. In dusty bean fields, the State of California opened UCLA in 1929. 
"Suddenly," says Starr, "automobiles allowed the beautiful people to zip out to 
their newly built Santa Monica beach cottages. And after World War II, 
Westchester and huge tracts were built, something like 9,000 homes in one year. 
Voila! You had the Westside." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr and other urban thinkers have a more complex view of the divisions 
within the city, describing L.A. as a series of mega-villages scattered over a 
vast terrain whose residents will trade -- and bicker -- among themselves much 
like those in old European city states. Pride and competition are always in 
play in big cities. Writing in his 1941 novel "Mildred Pierce," hard-boiled 
author James M. Cain gave an early nod to this view when Mildred's snobbish 
Pasadena boyfriend told her she'd make a fine wife "if you didn't live in 
Glendale."  
</P>
<P>
 Many Angelenos are learning to sample from the stew. Gai Gherardi, co-owner of 
Melrose Avenue's L.A. Eyeworks, knows a traditional Iranian family who "watched 
2,500 drag queens" in West Hollywood's Halloween Parade and, to her delight, 
loved it. In Echo Park, performance artist Eric Trules sets a tape recorder on 
his windowsill to capture his white, black, Asian and Latino neighbors 
"screaming in the middle of the night, in the most colorful language 
imaginable" -- dialogue he hopes to weave into a book.  
</P>
<P>
 But others, like Michael Nava, a mystery writer and senior attorney with the 
State Court of Appeal, marvel that the city is not "in a constant state of 
civil unrest." Nava grew up in a struggling, working-class family and says he 
feels a powerful kinship "when I see a brown face," yet he chose to live on the 
Westside, because, he says, "life is a lot easier there. I know firsthand 
there's no romance in poverty." He says his dual experience, particularly his 
several years on the Westside, has convinced him that Los Angeles is a city 
deeply hewn by class and race. "Westsiders know their affluence is paid for by 
the suffering of other people, and there is a deep sense of guilt and 
apprehension." Echoing some Latinos, Nava dreams of a Los Angeles dominated by 
Latino culture and Latino leaders. "The future," he says, "is Gloria Molina's." 
</P>
<P>
 But economist Kotkin, a resident of Laurel Canyon, sees a dreary future down 
that path. "If the Westside and the Valley don't maintain themselves, L.A. will 
become the dream of (KCET commentator) Ruben Martinez and L.A. school board 
member Leticia Quezada, who want a huge Mexico City North, a dream I don't 
share." The real issue is not east versus west, "it's whether people stay or 
head to the wine country."  
</P>
<P>
 Angelenos finally seem to grasp that L.A. has become the new Ellis Island and 
that whole sectors of the city may still change. Monterey Park, just east of 
Downtown, was transformed after one Chinese American realtor bought tiny ads in 
mainland China newspapers in the 1970s promoting "the Chinese Beverly Hills." 
In truth, the city's Asians were Japanese Americans, but the dream was sold and 
a town that had defended its white identity in the 1950s by barring Latinos 
from buying homes was utterly remade by capitalist sleight-of-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In Glendale, leaders in the 1980s encouraged developers to raze whole blocks 
of attractive homes to build thousands of luxury apartments. Intended for 
yuppies, the units instead drew tens of thousands of mainly working-class 
renters who changed the ethnic face of what had been an overwhelmingly white 
city. Glendale is now about 20% Latino and 70% white, including a large 
contingent of Armenian immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 Drastic change creates bitterness. African Americans clash with their new 
neighbors as South-Central continues its unstoppable shift from black to 
Latino. Black flight created an outrush of 57,000 black Angelenos from the 
urban core during the 1980s, a migration to L.A. suburbs and distant states 
that continues.  
</P>
<P>
 Maullin has found deep resentment in the most diverse neighborhoods. In one 
Eastside area with equal numbers of white, Latino and Asian residents, he says, 
"If you get them in a room together, basically a focus group, it's all blah, 
blah, how wonderful it is. But when you get them alone, it's the goddamn whites 
this and the goddamn Mexicans that and the goddamn Asians this. There is a 
veneer of civility that keeps us from being Bosnia. What I am seeing is not 
prejudice, however. It is a powerful desire to group with your culture, and we 
should all wake up to that reality." 
</P>
<P>
 PERHAPS MORE THAN OTHER PARTS OF TOWN, THE WESTSIDE WATCHES the cycle of 
change with trepidation. Venice has become a bizarre melange of gang shootings, 
artist hangouts and award-winning custom homes. The once-tony Westwood shopping 
district is in a financial tailspin, abandoned by upscale shoppers after being 
discovered by inner-city teen-agers and overwhelmed by cheap, cutesy stores. 
But while much of the Westside sits precariously upon a ribbon of earth that 
geologists say will liquefy when the Really Big One hits, it doesn't seem in 
danger of disappearing anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Chu, a hotshot litigator at the Irell & Manella law firm in Century 
City, gazes at the lush Central Park-like view of the Los Angeles Country Club 
from his law library and wonders how anyone can fault the Westside. He and 
several other men have met at Palisades High School for pickup basketball every 
Saturday for more than 16 years, forming a community so close that some fly in 
from Sacramento or drive from Palmdale. He says this Westside group is Asian 
American, African American, white and Latino, including "an airline pilot, 
attorneys, business owners, a plumber, a couple of guys in construction, and, 
of course, the guy who keeps a slim jim (a car break-in device) in his beat-up 
car.  
</P>
<P>
 "I call this an urban oasis," Chu says. "I can pick up my wife in Beverlywood, 
and in 10 minutes we can be at one of 150 restaurants. On a sunny day, I'll 
sneak out with other 'bandits' to play golf. We start the conspiracy the day 
before, stash our clubs in our cars and make reservations at a public course, 
for nothing, like $10. For that kind of lifestyle, I don't think there's a much 
better place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 In much the same way, Larkin Arnold, a leading entertainment attorney who 
discovered Luther Vandross, has found in Bel-Air "one of the best places in the 
world, like entering a forest when you drive through its gates." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold describes the two perfect moments in his daily life: soaking up the 
serenity of his acre and a half of privacy (Tom Jones lives next door, but 
Arnold knows that only because he has heard him singing) or wheeling along the 
Malibu coastline in his black two-seater convertible. He and his wife, the 
first African American to serve on the board of directors of the Bel-Air Assn., 
a homeowners club, enjoy the kind of global mobility that takes them from 
Beverly Hills to Paris to the Crenshaw district in a blink, from Wolfgang 
Puck's Chinois on Main restaurant in Santa Monica to down-home Harold & Belle's 
catfish restaurant on Jefferson Boulevard to yuppie/buppie Georgia on Melrose, 
in which they are investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can compare it against New York, D.C., Paris or any other city and still 
say the Westside is the best for weather, air, restaurants, hospitals, schools, 
creative people, the architecture of homes," Arnold says. "I feel blessed God 
has enabled me to enjoy these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a strange way, the Westside's rich and upper-middle classes are among 
the city's most isolated. Walking briskly on her exercise route below Montana 
Avenue, Elisa Lottor says she rarely ventures beyond Sepulveda Boulevard. "You 
can get hurt, you can get robbed, you can get your car stolen," says the 
nutritionist and homeopath, padding along in Avias, eyes surreptitiously 
monitoring a loud group of homeless men drinking nearby. "My friend in Silver 
Lake is always saying, 'Why don't you come over?' and I'd like to, because it 
sounds really interesting. But just to get on the rotten freeway and then have 
to exit and deal with crazy drivers and street criminals, it's not worth it."  
</P>
<P>
 Lottor is a gentle woman, a vegetarian who makes organic-turkey-and-brown-rice 
burgers for her cat. She and her husband bought north of Montana 20 years ago 
for $53,000. But they're on the verge of leaving it all and moving to rural 
hills near Santa Barbara because they believe their world in Santa Monica has 
become a crowded foxhole.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we go to Torrance to the Del Amo mall, my husband sees women with 
big asses and says, 'See that? This is how normal women look.' Nobody looks 
normal in Santa Monica anymore."  
</P>
<P>
 Lottor steps into a crosswalk, and a car cuts her off. "See what I mean? That 
guy's got a Range Rover, so he's entitled. We're surrounded by so many 
materialistic people. You see them dragging their maids around, ordering them 
to do this and do that. I'll be at Zen Bakery, and some obnoxious guy will get 
on his cell phone. And you see parents spoiling children in disgusting ways, 
breaking them in at Starbucks (coffee emporium). You know, 8 years old and the 
parents are asking, 'Would you like to try a latte?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Huber and her husband found a "beautiful little community in a big city" 
when they moved to Santa Monica nearly 30 years ago, and while their town has 
been altered by urban troubles, the Hubers believe in "creating a neighborhood 
no matter what goes on around us." Managers of several apartment complexes, the 
Hubers say that if one neighbor gets sick, "the others all take turns going 
grocery shopping, taking out the garbage, doing the laundry." Huber had a 
stroke last year and, during a power outage, tried to make her way with a cane 
past the complex's pool to help guide tenants into their darkened parking 
spaces. "I was worried about falling into the pool, and suddenly I saw all 
these young men helping people get up the stairs and handling the parking 
problem, and one of them looked over and said, 'You didn't really think we'd 
let you down, did you?' It almost made me cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Maullin says Westsiders who've lived in Los Angeles 10 years or more suffer "a 
mass nostalgia for a place that was lower density, less traffic and away from 
it all. From 1975 to 1990, you saw tremendous commercial development of Century 
City and Wilshire, which didn't have a high-rise before 1970. People are still 
in denial that they live in an urban core." It's hard to imagine being anywhere 
near an urban core at author Amy Ephron's airy Pacific Palisades home. It's so 
quiet that the ear strains to focus on far-off sounds -- an undulating hum, 
perhaps the ocean or a distant freeway. Some yards out here are really private 
parks, tended by gardeners, appointed with huge patios, koi ponds or pools. One 
can't see the wealth inside, but one senses it at curbside. Two garbage cans on 
trash day is modest. Four is living right. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron and her husband, TV producer Sasha Harari, moved from Malibu after the 
fires, their second near-disaster. She remembers grabbing "two Armani suits, 
two pairs of jeans, some T-shirts and the Warhols."  
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Beverly Hills, Ephron seems to have worked past the nostalgia and 
accepted Los Angeles on its current terms. She goes to museums in Pasadena and 
events Downtown. But despite her mobility, she never goes to ATMs at night, 
parks only with a valet and never enters a 7-Eleven store. She has instructed 
her children, ages 9, 7 and 4, what to do if they are ever playing and someone 
brings out a gun (tell them to put it down and immediately go home.) "I do not 
think it is an elitist solution to pay $3 to park," Ephron says. "I lived in 
New York for a while, and I've got my old New York walk back: chin up and don't 
f- - - with me. I love L.A., and I do not want to decry what it has become, so 
I live defensively."  
</P>
<P>
 When she was growing up, "Beverly Hills was a tiny village, provincial with 
almost no chain stores. There was the tobacco shop, the knife man. We had a 
great toy store, Uncle Bernie's, with a lemonade tree that gave fresh lemonade 
free of charge from a rubber tree with spigots." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, people in Ephron's Beverly Hills office building "actually sit in their 
little offices with the doors locked." One can feel her muted sense of loss. 
Ephron shakes her head. The moment passes. "Psychologically," she says, the 
days of old Beverly Hills were "a long, long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 ALBERT EINSTEIN, REINCARNATED and living in Los Angeles, would be an 
Eastsider. Aside from physics, Einstein wrote in "Out of My Later Years" of the 
sin of wealth, saying that the successful man "receives a great deal from his 
fellowmen, usually incomparably more than corresponds to his service to them." 
Which sums up how many Eastsiders feel about the Westside.  
</P>
<P>
 Eric Trules of Echo Park wrote a poem to express his many regrets at having 
spent 10 years "imprisoned" in Santa Monica, emotionally unable to give up his 
$422-a-month rent-controlled apartment. "I saw myself just drying up in my tiny 
apartment, getting old and sad," he says. " Ten years. " 
</P>
<P>
 The performance artist has since discovered that women on the Eastside -- 
unlike women on the Westside, he says -- don't care that he doesn't earn big 
bucks. His love life, "the worst" for 10 years, has suddenly taken off. "When I 
moved inland, the winds shifted," he says dreamily, gazing over his smoggy view 
of the city toward the sea. "I feel like I've gone back to an earlier time 
where things are fertile and breeding and plants are growing and bougainvillea 
is blossoming." 
</P>
<P>
 He cautions that the Eastside, where he is actually paying a higher rent, is 
not for everybody. "We hear gunshots and salsa music, alarms go off, and 
vicious dogs. It's interesting and peaceful and exciting and helicopters all at 
once. I tell people I live in Echo Park, and they say, 'I've heard of moving 
east to west but never the other way.' And I tell them: 'It doesn't make me 
feel as small.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, the 70-year-old Episcopal priest, chats over wine with his companion, 
Mark Thompson, 41, an editor of the Advocate magazine, about why they chose an 
Eastside garden bungalow over the Westside. "Here in Silver Lake, it isn't 
important whether you wrote a book or not," says Boyd, whose new book, "Rich 
with Years," just hit the stands. "Clothes here are very easy. Clothes there 
are not. There, it's very code, and there's a deep awareness of what's hip and 
what's not. Fame is almost a joke here. It's an irony. If you had it, you never 
made a point of it. We have very close friends in West Hollywood who we relate 
to very closely and care very much about. Yet they are seeking something there, 
and I am not sure what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson interrupts: "I think it's called youth, darling." 
</P>
<P>
 Artists are also drawn east, to places like Mt. Washington, Highland Park and 
Atwater Village, because they need cheap space. Internationally acclaimed 
artist Lari Pittman, whose works go for $5,000 to $35,000, and who just sold a 
14-footer to the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, lives on a 
dead-end street next to Dodger Stadium and keeps his studio at the Victor 
Clothing Co. building on lively Broadway in the heart of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had calls from people saying, 'I'm sorry I'm late. I'm on 3rd and 
Broadway in Santa Monica and I can't find you,' " Pittman says. "But anyone who 
really knows the art scene knows there is a whole generation of artists living 
east of La Brea. On the Westside, this studio would cost $10,000 a month. But 
that's not the only reason I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Pittman of Angelenos who avoid inland parts of town: "Maybe it's time for 
people to grow up a little. Look at all of Manhattan. It looks worse than it 
is, but Manhattanites understand that about their city, and they don't become 
paralyzed by it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the psychological hurdle that Westsider Margrit Polak had to overcome 
when she fell in love with Eastsider Harvey Shield. Harvey, a songwriter and 
doo-wop singer with the Mighty Echoes, was uncertain how to persuade Margrit, a 
personal manager and acting coach, to abandon her condo above Rustic Canyon in 
Santa Monica for his flat near Downtown, site of a turn-of-the-century 
tuberculosis hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to weaken Margrit by drowning her in urban angst , on their first 
official date Harvey took her to the Skid Row home of friends in the tattered 
penthouse of the Alexandria Hotel. Margrit, a New Yorker and a bohemian by 
nature, "was impressed." Harvey says Margrit was "amazed that I didn't lock my 
doors." Margrit's first thought upon moving in with Harvey was, "How quick 
could I get a security system installed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Today Harvey and Margrit are contented Eastsiders. They are renovating a 
massive Victorian home in Angelino Heights three miles from Downtown, and they 
are consciously creating a multicultural upbringing for their daughter, Sofia, 
who made them proud with her first three words: "Duke of Earl."  
</P>
<P>
 Margrit gushes to her Westside friends about the Craftsman and Victorian 
manses that go for as little as $200,000. Unlike the Westside, she has found a 
warm neighborhood life. "We all know each other in these three square blocks," 
she says, "and you can't say that about anywhere else in L.A., can you?" 
</P>
<P>
 You can say it about many places in Los Angeles, including East Los Angeles, 
where Latinas rose up to stop a prison some years ago. The Mothers of E.L.A. 
still meet regularly, pursuing a dream to bring a school to the proposed prison 
site to train a new generation to design, build and repair the light rails, 
subways and electric cars of the future.  
</P>
<P>
 Barrio Planners' Villalobos, who lives in East Los Angeles, says that while 
Latinos are winning such battles more often now, flexing their muscle as 
homeowners and residents, they still ask, metaphorically, "Can we afford to 
cross the Los Angeles River?" "My kids go to Malaga Cove in Palos Verdes," says 
Villalobos, "and they're seen as infringing on the white kids' territory. They 
don't look Arab, which is acceptable; they look Mexican. But they are 
adaptable. They know how to go from east to west." 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos, who named his company Barrio Planners as a joke back in the 1970s 
when he and his buddies were the only Latino urban planners at their college, 
says the Eastside needs the Westside, filled as it is with educated and monied 
people who can build shopping centers and finance new corporations. Yet, he 
also understands, the Westside needs the Eastside, bedrock of the middle and 
working classes. "People were crying at my mom's house (in East L.A.) about the 
fires in Malibu. People were crying for Laguna Beach, and these are rich whites 
that these Latino working-class people were crying for. These feelings have to 
be explored more, because these are the feelings that will hold the city 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA SEEMS AN ODD candidate for providing answers to the east-west 
conundrum, yet increasingly, people like Villalobos cite it as the new model. 
City fathers have adopted a toss-out-the-rules philosophy to respond to 
Pasadena's ever-growing and changing population, now more than half Latino, 
black and Asian. The trendy new Holly Village Apartments actually form a tunnel 
through which freight trains run, and the gracious docents at the Gamble House 
are passing their art to trainees of mostly ethnic backgrounds. Dignified 
Vroman's Bookstore threw a splashy book signing for radio star Howard Stern, 
after West Hollywood couldn't be bothered. In a city of just 135,000, about 
1,200 nonprofit groups work to improve life. The once-staid community elected 
the extremely liberal Cole (critics have called him a socialist) as its leader 
even as the city hotly pursues the almighty dollar in classically capitalistic 
fashion. One result has been the revival of Old Pasadena, a smash success. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Pasadena is fraught with the troubles that dog all cities. 
Last Halloween, it suffered one of the worst tragedies in its history, when 
gang members gunned down a group of young trick-or-treaters. Already, in the 
spirit of the new Pasadena, a group of mothers and fathers has formed a 
citywide coalition to get guns off Pasadena's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything is changing. There are still more Pasadenans in the Southwest 
Blue Book social registry than residents of Bel-Air, Malibu and Beverly Hills 
combined. And it did require a public battle to budge the Tournament of Roses 
to diversify its fossilized white male board of directors. But the city's new 
community center is filled with Latino parents taking English classes, and 
Pasadena's future is now looking more like marble swirl than vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we'll make a graceful transition, so that 50 years from now the 
Valley Hunt Club will be rich Chinese, Mexicans and blacks," Mayor Rick Cole 
says. "It has been rich whites for 100 years, but there won't be many whites 
here next century, and that has to be accepted with panache. What I hope most 
is that the cultural and architectural institutions of Pasadena will be 
cherished and will survive among a group of people who look nothing like we do 
now. And that's the rub for all of Los Angeles. It's diversify or die." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as Angelenos try to move beyond the economic and racial barriers that 
bifurcate the area, a lingering disdain and distrust infuse our disputes. Many 
are beginning to acknowledge and challenge the borders. Others are not. But the 
dialogue that is east versus west may one day bring down the boundaries that 
have made Los Angeles a tale of two cities. East Versus West: Nose Bobs or 
Budweiser?

RIGOBERTA MENCHU'S MAYAN VISION; REVERED FOR THE SYMBOLIC POWER OF HER NOBEL 
PRIZE BUT ATTACKED FOR HER CONTINUING LIFE IN EXILE, THE GUATEMALAN LEADER 
FOCUSES ON BRINGING A 'NEW DAWN' TO THE WORLD'S INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 
</P>

By HECTOR TOBAR, Hector Tobar, a former Times staff writer, is working on a 
novel set in the Central American neighborhoods of Downtown L.A. His last 
article for the magazine was a profile of Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria 
Molina.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A society of Indian holy men meets regularly in a Guatemala City apartment to 
study the Mayan calendar, a 2,500-year-old timekeeping system that is at the 
center of their religion. In recent years, their reading of the calendar has 
told them that an ancient prophecy is about to come true: "The time of 
darkness" is coming to an end. The Mayan people, exploited for five centuries, 
second-class citizens in their own land, will soon enter an age of "clarity and 
brightness." A new dawn is approaching. El nuevo amanecer.  
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, inevitably, the priests say, the prophecy is coming true. Ask them for 
proof and they will tell you about the new organizations that fight for Indian 
rights and the increasing number of Mayan men and women graduating from 
Guatemala's universities. They will mention the growing ethnic pride among 
Mayan youth, the girls who are not afraid to wear their traditional garments at 
school despite the taunts of the ladinos, the European-descended minority that 
has ruled Guatemala since 1524. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most dramatic example of the new dawn's arrival, the priests say, can 
be found in the life story of a 35-year-old Quiche Mayan woman, a former house 
servant and farm worker named Rigoberto Menchu. Illiterate until the age of 20, 
she is now Guatemala's most-famous citizen, a woman who regularly meets with 
heads of state and who is recognized as an international leader in the movement 
for indigenous peoples' rights. In 1992, just days after the quincentenary of 
Christopher Columbus' arrival in the Americas, she became the first indigenous 
leader ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rigoberta winning the Nobel Prize is just the first step, the first sign that 
the Mayan people must burst into history once again," says Juan Leon, leader of 
Majawil K'ij ("New Dawn" in the Mam Mayan language), a coalition of Mayan 
cultural and political organizations. "One day, the Mayan people will govern 
Guatemala. I don't know when it will happen, but that is our hope. That is the 
new dawn we speak of." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Mayan priests whose counsel she occasionally seeks, Menchu also 
believes in a Mayan "new dawn." She describes it while sitting for an interview 
in a Guatemala City office. A short woman with a round face that often breaks 
into a grin, she is dressed, as always, in the traditional clothing of 
Guatemalan Indian women -- the huipil (an embroidered blouse) and corte (a 
multicolored skirt made from handwoven cloth). 
</P>
<P>
 "The priests say the new dawn will be like the rain that fertilizes the soil 
before we begin to plant our corn," Menchu says. "It will renew the natural 
cycle of life. The Mayan people will once again flourish. I believe in this 
very strongly. The holy men say we are entering a period of clarity. We are 
rediscovering our Mayan values." 
</P>
<P>
 Since winning the Nobel Prize, Menchu has worked to spread this vision far 
beyond the reach of the Mayans. In October, she convened the second Summit of 
Indigenous Peoples, a conference that assembled leaders of native tribes and 
ethnic groups from five continents. In a speech opening the conference, she 
told the delegates to persevere in their struggle to force the international 
community to recognize their rights: Menchu wants the United Nations to adopt a 
global charter to protect the lands and cultural practices of all indigenous 
peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our struggle is for peace, harmony and mutual respect between peoples and 
cultures," Menchu said, looking out at an audience that included Maoris from 
New Zealand, Inuits from the Arctic Circle, Samis from Scandinavia and Amazon 
Indians from Brazil and Peru. "But we cannot accept a peace that forces 
indigenous peoples to renounce their languages, their cultures, their rights, 
(that forces them) to assimilate into non-indigenous society. We say no to the 
peace that keeps us on our knees, no to the peace that keeps us in chains, no 
to the false peace that denies the values and contributions of our peoples." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the kind of speech -- proud, angry and defiant -- that has made Menchu 
famous. These qualities have also made her one of the most controversial 
figures in Central American politics. Although she is widely praised abroad as 
an eloquent spokeswoman, at home she is often the object of scorn and abuse. 
Most of the Guatemalan media and politicians attack her as a left-wing militant 
and an underground supporter of the Marxist guerrillas who have waged a 30-year 
war against the government. Rather than giving her the Nobel Peace Prize, it 
seems they should have given her the "Nobel War Prize," the editors of the 
influential Guatemala City daily Siglo Veintiuno wrote last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Menchu has been criticized for, among other things, the hard-line stance she 
has taken during the country's continuing political instability. Although she 
is not the center of a cohesive political movement, or the leader of any 
political organization, Menchu has given voice in the international arena to 
the aspirations of a long-silenced sector of Guatemalan society -- not just the 
Mayans, but also poor ladinos and others who call for sweeping social reform 
and a quick end to military domination of the government. She has called for a 
purge of the executive branch and army and has attacked recently installed 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who supports a more gradual reform of the 
government.  
</P>
<P>
 But most of all, Menchu's defiant Mayan pride doesn't sit well with the elite 
of a country where Indians are a de facto lower caste, an army of dark-skinned 
servants and impoverished peasants. Since she received the Nobel Prize, an 
unease has spread through ladino Guatemala. Some ladinos fear that Menchu's 
rise to prominence is an inkling of Guatemala's future, a country turned 
upside-down where Mayans, who make up 60% to 70% of the population, rule over 
whites. Many Guatemalans are asking themselves: What do the Mayans want? 
</P>
<P>
 A new nationalism has emerged among some members of the small minority of 
educated and middle-class Mayans. There is talk of one day re-establishing 
"Mayan law," erasing the borders and unifying the Mayan people scattered across 
Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and southern Mexico. This growing Mayan 
militancy found a violent expression this month when Indians in the southern 
Mexican state of Chiapas launched a guerrilla war, capturing several towns. 
Rebels from the "Zapatista National Liberation Army" said they were acting to 
preserve their language and way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 In Guatemala, the new Mayan pride shows its face even at the public market, 
the place where ladinos and Mayans most often come into contact with one 
another -- Indian peasants bring baskets of produce from the countryside to 
sell to ladino city dwellers. "Ever since Rigoberta won the Nobel Prize, these 
Indians have become unbearable," says a middle-class Guatemala City resident. 
"You go to the market and you try to barter with them and they get angry with 
you. They say, 'I won't go any lower. Take it or leave it.' They have too much 
pride now. You call them indito (little Indian), and they get mad. They weren't 
like that before." 
</P>

 MENCHU ROSE TO INTERNATIONAL PROMINENCE AFTER THE PUBLICATION of her 1983 
autobiography, "I . . . Rigoberta Menchu: An Indian Woman in Guatemala." 
Interviewed by Venezuelan anthropologist Elisabeth Burgos-Debray, Menchu tells 
of her humble origins in a small village in the highlands of El Quiche. 
Desperately poor, members of her family are forced to migrate every year to 
coastal cotton plantations, where they work in slavelike conditions. She 
herself begins picking coffee when she is 8. The book reaches a climax as 
Menchu grows into womanhood and members of her family become founders of the 
Committee for Peasant Unity. The organization grows quickly but encounters 
violent opposition from wealthy landowners and the army. Translated into a 
dozen languages, the book is considered a key text in the study of Third World 
women. It transformed Menchu from a little-known exiled Mayan activist into an 
international figure. It has also become a favorite punching bag for 
conservative critics in the United States. In his book "Illiberal Education," 
Dinesh D'Souza sees Menchu's book as a Marxist-feminist tract epitomizing the 
ultra-radical views held by Burgos-Debray. Others cite it as proof of Menchu's 
support for armed insurrection. They point to a key passage in which Menchu 
learns her village is about to come under attack by the army. (Army officials 
have admitted destroying about 440 highland villages during a scorched-earth 
campaign in the early 1980s). Rather than run away or passively resist the 
invasion, the villagers opt for armed self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew how to throw stones, we knew how to throw salt in someone's face -- 
how to do it effectively," Menchu writes. "We've often used lime. Lime is very 
fine and . . . we practiced taking aim and watching where the enemy is. You can 
blind a policeman by throwing lime in his face." Stephen Schwartz, author of a 
book on Nicaraguan Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's 1990 election, cited such 
passages as proof that Menchu was not deserving of the peace prize. "Menchu, to 
emphasize, does not support peace; she supports leftist violence," Schwartz 
wrote in the American Spectator magazine. "She does not even accept nonviolence 
as a means of protest. . . . Menchu's cause is not that of peace and 
reconciliation, but of murder and subversion." Schwartz and others also charge 
that, even as a Nobel winner, Menchu has worked to support Guatemala's Marxist 
guerrillas in their peace negotiations with the government. (Guatemala's 
guerrilla insurgency is the last remaining one in Central America.) During the 
past year, Menchu has blamed government intransigence for breakdowns in the 
talks.  
</P>
<P>
 William Ratliff, a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution in 
Stanford, says her actions before winning the prize lacked "moral authority." 
He questions, for example, how she can be seen as a symbol for the rights of 
Indian people when she supported the Sandinista government's repression of 
Miskito Indians during the 1980s. "I have no doubt she has ties to the 
guerrillas," he adds. "Throwing lime in policemen's eyes, that's not exactly 
the kind of thing one expects from a peace laureate." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though one of her sisters joined the guerrilla movement, Menchu maintains 
that she has no contact with the Marxist rebels. Still, she does not hide the 
fact that she is uncomfortable with the role of peaceful mediator. When more 
than 2,000 refugees -- nearly all of them Mayan Indians -- returned to 
Guatemala from Mexico last January, Menchu chose to ignore the advice of those 
who told her to avoid the event. The Guatemalan army had opposed the return, 
saying the refugees were active supporters of the guerrilla movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people said that this wasn't my role, to be wasting my time on these 
things," she says. "But I said no. The popular movement gave me life. The 
struggle gave me life. The people gave me life. So I owe them something in 
return, even if I am wasting the Nobel Prize." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 IN A RECENT COMMUNIQUE, THE CLANDESTINE "ROMEO LORENZANA ANTI-Communist 
Movement" called her a "guerrilla" and declared "an open war on this group of 
communist traitors to the fatherland." She does not take such threats lightly. 
Her father, Vicente Menchu, was killed during a 1980 peaceful takeover of the 
Spanish Embassy, when the Guatemalan army stormed and set fire to the compound. 
That same year, her mother was kidnaped, raped and tortured for days before 
being tied to a tree and left to die. Her 16-year-old brother was tortured and 
burned alive in a Mayan village in 1979, as soldiers forced villagers to watch. 
In all, an estimated 120,000 people have been killed since the 1970s in 
Guatemala's political violence. According to Amnesty International and other 
human-rights groups, the military has been responsible for the majority of 
these killings. Only a handful of low-ranking army officers have been 
prosecuted in connection with these deaths. Menchu has lived in a self-imposed 
exile in Mexico since 1981, and when she visits her homeland, she travels in a 
gray, armor-plated Jeep Cherokee with green-tinted, bulletproof glass. The Jeep 
offers a measure of protection against roadside ambushes. "So many people have 
died here," Menchu says from the front of her Jeep during a recent six-day 
visit to Guatemala, "many unknown people, great men and people whom history 
erases. As long as impunity exists (for the killers), those people will stay 
buried and forgotten."  
</P>
<P>
 But the threat of violence has diminished somewhat since de Leon took power, 
and Menchu seems relaxed as her Jeep winds through the potholed streets of 
Guatemala City. She pulls out a compact and applies a few dabs of makeup. Her 
small entourage is headed for a refugee camp on the outskirts of the city, to 
visit 250 Mayans displaced by the army's counterinsurgency campaign. Outside, 
it is a typical day in the country known as "the land of eternal spring" -- 
tropical clouds, verdant hills and volcanoes are fanned across the crystal-blue 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Jeep pulls into the dusty plot of land, the refugees set off 
firecrackers in celebration. She steps out and is almost immediately surrounded 
by children. To honor Menchu, the refugees have decorated their wood-scrap and 
dirt-floor shelters with flowers and colorful paper streamers. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls in their indigenous dresses circle Menchu and begin to dance. For a 
moment, she joins in, playfully teasing the girls, saying they should dance a 
little faster, with more energy, con mas ganas . Old women move forward to 
touch her, approaching her with deep reverence, whispering words to her in 
Quiche, one of 22 Mayan languages. A man places his newborn son in her arms and 
asks her to be the child's godmother, a comadre . Poems are presented in her 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rigoberta, I will tell you how they treat me in school," reads a 10-year-old 
girl. "They call me india because I can't speak Spanish well. They forbid me to 
wear my traje tipico (traditional Mayan clothes). When I play with the other 
children, they don't treat me the same as everyone else. There is 
discrimination against me. But inside of me, there is a hope." Such emotional 
outpourings are not uncommon. When Menchu won the Nobel, 20,000 Guatemalans 
marched in the capital in celebration, many of them poor Mayans who left their 
work as housekeepers and street vendors to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poor and the illiterate in Guatemala have never had a leader they could 
recognize as their own," says Demetrio Cojti, a Cakchiquel Indian who left his 
village to earn a doctorate in Belgium and is now a UNICEF official in 
Guatemala City. "Rigoberta fills that vacuum with her charisma and all the 
things she symbolizes. It's the joy of their lives." Among other things, Menchu 
symbolizes to her fellow Mayans the attainment of respect and success in the 
non-indigenous world. Like many of them, Menchu once spoke only Quiche, but now 
she speaks fluent Spanish. Once, she was illiterate, but now she is a 
distinguished author. Most Mayans can only dream of such achievements: Cojti 
points out that despite recent advances, Mayans still make up only 25% of 
Guatemala's elementary school students, and 1% of college graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 It is understandable, then, that when Menchu takes the microphone at the 
refugee camp to address the crowd, the first thing she tells them is to start a 
school. "We might have financial limitations, we might be poor, but we can hope 
for education," she says, "and we can dream that tomorrow these children will 
have a chance to build their own nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before she is to leave, the refugees gather in a circle while four Mayan 
priests perform a ceremony. They arrange pine needles and flowers in a circle 
and burn incense. Menchu joins the refugees in kneeling to pray to the four 
corners of the earth. The priests call on the spirits of their ancestors to aid 
them in the fight against Xibalba, the Mayan underworld. Unlike the Christian 
hell, Xibalba exists on earth -- army soldiers, police officers and informers 
all work for the underworld, the priests say. "It's like a government," a 
priest explains. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ceremony is complete, Menchu climbs into the armor-plated Jeep that 
protects her against Xibalba and drives away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MENCHU ONCE AGAIN FOUND HER ACTIONS AT THE CENTER OF DEBATE during a failed 
government coup in May and June, when then-President Jorge Serrano dissolved 
Congress and suspended constitutional guarantees, including the right to 
assembly. As luck would have it, Menchu was making a rare visit to Guatemala at 
the time, hosting the first Summit of Indigenous Peoples. More than 200 
delegates had gathered in the town of Chimaltenango, roughly 40 miles west of 
Guatemala City. With martial law suddenly in force and the potential for 
violence rapidly escalating, canceling the summit and sending the delegates 
home seemed the prudent thing to do. But Menchu announced that the summit would 
go on as an act of "civil disobedience" against the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been the most terrible thing in the history of indigenous 
peoples if we had legitimized the coup by dissolving our summit," she explained 
at the time. "I said that anyone who left the summit would never again be 
recognized as a delegate. A lot of people said this was an intransigent thing 
to do, that I was putting people's lives in danger. But these were very hard 
political decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 As the delegates withdrew into closed session, Menchu drove to Guatemala City 
and helped direct a growing movement against the coup. After attending a Mass 
for peace, she led 1,000 people on a march from the 18th-Century cathedral to 
the ornate, lime-green Palacio Nacional, the seat of national government. With 
two dozen stunned soldiers and the international press corps watching, she 
delivered a letter to the president demanding the restoration of civil 
liberties by slipping it under the closed gates when the guards refused to 
accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with growing defiance of his martial law decrees, Serrano resigned and 
fled the country. Then, in one of those strange turn of events that are so 
common in Central American politics, Congress named Ramiro de Leon Carpio, the 
nation's progressive human-rights prosecutor, as the new president. Just days 
earlier, Serrano had ordered de Leon's arrest, and the president-to-be had 
eluded police by climbing to the roof of his house and jumping into a 
neighbor's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon promised to strengthen democracy and enact some badly needed reforms, 
including an end to rampant corruption in Congress. But Menchu demanded more. 
She called for the immediate resignation of the entire Congress, which she 
labeled as corrupt, and the formation of an assembly to draft a new 
constitution. At one point during the crisis, she called for a general strike 
to force Serrano from power -- but few workers heeded the call. 
</P>
<P>
 To her detractors, it seemed that Menchu was trying to start a popular 
insurrection. "We believe Rigoberta's actions showed little concern for the 
reality of the situation," wrote the editors at the daily Siglo Veintiuno. They 
accused her of "political immaturity" and said she viewed the crisis as "an 
opportunity for a revolution that would ruin our political system." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the coup, Menchu never claimed to lead anyone, just to speak for her 
people. And when the coup gave her an opportunity to play a role in Guatemalan 
politics, Menchu did what she had always done -- she used her influential voice 
in the public forums available to her. Without any organized constituency in 
Guatemala, she could act only as an individual, "a moral witness" to the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 The same tactics had worked well for her in the international stage, where, by 
recounting her compelling life story again and again, she helped ostracize a 
series of military regimes. In the process, she also won a Nobel Prize. But 
after a decade in exile, could she still be an effective leader in Guatemala? 
</P>
<P>
 When asked this question, Nineth Montenegro, leader of Guatemala's most 
tenacious human-rights organization, the Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo, buries her head 
in her hands. She is about to say something critical about a natural ally, 
something she'd rather not do. Clearly, Montenegro says, Menchu's work abroad 
has helped the human-rights movement. But remaining in exile -- even when most 
other exiles have already returned -- has stolen much of her thunder in 
Guatemala. "Those of us who have stayed here (in Guatemala) have a certain 
moral authority" in the movement, Montenegro says. "We've stayed here despite 
all the killings. If we had gone into exile, we would have lost that authority. 
That can't be denied." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Menchu's statements during the coup affirmed the desire of many 
Guatemalans for profound change. For years, presidents have come and gone in 
Guatemala without any reform in the secretive structures of power (especially 
in the military) that have given birth to so much terror and repression. 
Without a purge of army officers linked to death squads, for example, de Leon's 
appointment as president might be little more than a new, democratic facade for 
the same murderous regime. 
</P>
<P>
 To a certain degree, Menchu's position has been borne out during the past few 
months. De Leon has proven to be a less-than-effective leader, apparently 
unwilling to challenge the military leadership he routinely criticized while he 
was human-rights prosecutor. He dramatically reversed an earlier position by 
enthusiastically supporting the army's Civilian Self-Defense Patrols, which 
have been accused by international groups, including the Organization of 
American States, of gross human-rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Menchu has grown increasingly critical of the president. 
When de Leon presented a new peace plan in October, Menchu said it was designed 
to force the guerrilla movement away from the negotiating table and insinuated 
that he was being manipulated by the military. She called a news conference in 
Mexico to announce that she was "withdrawing my vote of confidence" for him.  
</P>
<P>
 A week later in Washington, D.C., Menchu renewed her attacks on de Leon. For 
her critics back home, it was just another example of Menchu using her access 
to the media outside Guatemala to prejudice international opinion against the 
country's struggling democracy. "I think the people of Guatemala would be more 
pleased with her if she would help us, with her influence and leadership, to 
build peace," says presidential press secretary Felix Loarca. "When she says, 
for example, that she is withdrawing her vote of confidence for the president, 
I don't think that's the right way. Instead of having these confrontations that 
never lead to anything constructive, we beg her to use her influence to help 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Loarca says neither he nor the president bear Menchu any ill will. "I 
myself asked her once if she would do me the honor of autographing her book for 
me," he says with a smile. Like Loarca, many Guatemalans feel ambivalent toward 
Menchu. Loarca might be distressed by Menchu's political posturing, but she is, 
after all, a Nobel Prize winner. And in a poor country permeated by a 
collective sense of low self-esteem, such triumphs mean a great deal. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 TO DEDICATE HERSELF to the revolution, Menchulong ago renounced marriage and 
motherhood, parting company with a fiance with "much sadness and a heavy 
heart." In private, she can speak harshly of her opponents, using mild swear 
words like cabron , bastard. She is known for her toughness, yet she wept 
openly when it was announced that she had won the Nobel Prize, remembering the 
deaths of her family members. And she is not above a little self-effacing 
humor. When her Jeep develops a flat tire on a bumpy Guatemala City road, she 
jokes about her being fat. "Well, no wonder the tire popped," she says, 
standing on the flattened tire her driver has just removed. "Look, it can't 
even hold my weight." Everyone laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a feeling among some ladino commentators that, as a self-educated 
Mayan woman, Menchu doesn't possess the intellectual capacity to be a power 
player in Guatemalan politics. So tainted is the racial atmosphere in Guatemala 
that people have few qualms about expressing such thoughts publicly. Consider 
the published comments of Carlos Manuel Pellecer, a columnist for the country's 
largest daily, La Prensa Libre. He called Menchu "an ingenuous and poorly 
counseled muchacha. " Muchacha (girl) is what Guatemalans call their servants. 
The Nobel Prize, Pellecer said, "is obviously too grand for her."  
</P>
<P>
 In private, the racial hostility can be expressed more brazenly. Menchu's 
growing notoriety has led to an endless stream of Rigoberta jokes, many of 
which cast her in the role of country bumpkin: A simple peasant thrust into a 
high-class society she does not understand. One joke reminds Guatemalans that 
even in death, she will always be a member of the servant class: "Rigoberta 
died and went to heaven," the story goes. "But she showed up at the pearly 
gates wearing her huipil and her corte. So St. Peter takes one look at her and 
says: 'Hey, Jesus, the tortillas are here!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Menchu has endured such racist jokes and comments all her life. She speaks 
with quiet, restrained anger as she remembers what people said when she first 
spoke on Guatemalan television in 1988, when she returned openly to the country 
for the first time since going into exile. Having been arrested, thrown in 
jail, and then released from custody, she denounced the authorities, breezing 
through her interviews in erudite and eloquent Spanish. Many Guatemalans were 
amazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said, 'Rigoberta Menchu speaks better than a ladino, "' Menchu 
remembers. " 'Her Spanish is perfect. It's incredible that she's so 
intelligent.' As if intelligence belonged to only one sector of the population. 
There were aberrant assertions that I must have been trained to speak by East 
German (Communists) agents because I couldn't have learned all this on my own." 
</P>

<P>
 EVEN AS SHE WAS BEING DISPARAGED at home, her recognition was growing abroad. 
In the weeks before the Nobel committee announced the recipient of the 1992 
Nobel Peace Prize, Indian activists all over the world were busy organizing 
protests to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the 
Americas. It appeared that the committee would acknowledge the quincentenary by 
awarding the prize to an indigenous leader. Still, the ideal candidate was not 
immediately obvious. There was no Nelson Mandela or Martin Luther King Jr. 
whose moral and personal authority granted them unquestioned leadership of the 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Menchu, who had been struggling for more than a decade to pressure the 
international community to recognize the rights of indigenous peoples, "was one 
of a number of people who might have been chosen," says Howard R. Berman, 
professor of international law at the California Western School of Law in San 
Diego. "The movement is very diverse and there's not one central leader." But, 
Berman adds, "Rigoberta was an excellent choice. She's very highly regarded and 
a person of great integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Indigenous activists agree that the prize has granted new visibility and 
legitimacy to their struggle. Since accepting the $1.2-million award, Menchu 
has found herself thrust into a new role as the leading spokeswoman for the 
international movement. With more moral than financial support from the U.N. 
bureaucracy (Menchu complains that the U.N. provided her with a measly 
$47,000), she used her one-year goodwill ambassadorship to convene two 
international summits. At Menchu's invitation, and with part of her Nobel award 
paying some of the costs, more than 100 leaders from five continents attended.  
</P>
<P>
 The delegates agreed to ask the U.N. to declare the period between 1994 and 
2004 the international decade of indigenous peoples, and last December, the 
U.N. General Assembly approved the decade, which will begin this Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Menchu's leadership, the summit delegates also developed a plan to push 
the U.N. to approve the draft declaration on indigenous peoples' rights. The 
declaration must still work its way through a labyrinth of U.N. committees 
before being presented to the General Assembly for final consideration. The 
document declares that indigenous peoples have the right to protect their 
lands, cultural practices and natural resources. Although the declaration would 
not have the force of international law, it could be the first step toward the 
adoption of an international convention on indigenous peoples' rights, similar 
to the Geneva Convention on the protection of prisoners and medical personnel 
in wartime. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was supposed to take the position as goodwill ambassador and pose for 
posters and show up for tea in Vienna and Geneva," says Mililani B. Trask, a 
summit delegate representing the indigenous peoples of Hawaii. "She's gone way 
beyond anything they (the U.N.) ever expected. They wanted her to be a symbol 
but she had the integrity to not do that." 
</P>
<P>

 MAYAN CALENDAR PRIESTS have kept a continuous count of the days over a period 
of 25 centuries. On the day that Quiche priest Nicolas Lucas is interviewed, 
the Mayan calendar reads "12 Ix" (pronounced eesh ). The coming of the "new 
dawn," Lucas says, was foretold by Mayan priests three years before the arrival 
of the first European, conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, who defeated the army of 
Quiche warriors led by Tecun Uman. The priests predicted a long period of 
darkness would follow the conquest. But one day the sun would return. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new dawn is about to rescue our culture," Lucas says. "Our ancestors said 
the moment would arrive in which their children and grandchildren would wake up 
again and see this light. We've been lost for 500 years but it's not possible 
to continue the same way. We have to take action." But asked why the Mayan 
calendar says the new dawn is coming now , Lucas is a little less forthcoming. 
He says he has been studying the calendar for 30 years and "to explain all 
that, I would need a year. Maybe two." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Mayans don't need to have mastered the complexities of their calendar to 
know change is long overdue. Since founding the "New Dawn" coalition in 1991, 
Juan Leon has seen a remarkable growth in Mayan political and cultural 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 But he believes that the day of Mayan dominance is still a long way off. Nor 
is it the goal of his movement. "Some people think what we want to do is to 
throw all the ladinos out of Guatemala and send them back to Spain," Leon says. 
"That's not our intention." The Mayans, he says, only want to live in a country 
where ladinos and Mayans treat each other with respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Menchu expressed similar thoughts in her speech in Oslo when she accepted the 
Nobel Prize: "Combining all the shades of ladinos , Africans and indigenous 
peoples that make up the ethnic mosaic of Guatemala, we should interlace a 
variety of colors, making them shine, weaving as our artisans do." The result, 
Menchu believes, will be a huipil, an intricate, rainbow-colored garment that 
will be Guatemala's gift to humanity.

TOXINS IN THE MOTHER TONGUE; A NOVELIST RESPONDS TO A BOUT OF CENSORSHIP BY 
TAKING BACK MORALITY, AND THE LNAGUAGE, FROM THE NARROW DEFINITIONS OF 
FUNDAMENTALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David James Duncan, David James Duncan, whose last article for this magazine 
concerned fly-fishing in Nevada, is the author of two novels: The River Why and 
The Brothers K. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 1. Censored 
</P>
<P>
 I was invited, a few years back, to speak to 60 or so high school English 
students in a small town neither geographically nor demographically far from 
Sweet Home, Oregon -- from whence the Oregon Citizens Alliance and its now 
nationally famous, selective-Leviticus-quoting anti-homosexual agenda sprang 
into the national headlines. I was buried in work at the time, but I chose to 
visit anyhow, when the English teacher who'd invited me mentioned that her 
students were being forced to read a version of my first novel, "The River 
Why," from which hundreds of words had been purged by a team of parents armed 
with indelible black felt pens. 
</P>
<P>
 My novel had already been assigned, the teacher explained, and her class was 
halfway through it, when the mother of a student happened to pick the book up 
and discover my protagonist's use of language. By no stretch of the imagination 
or Bible could that language be considered "obscene." Using the Hollywood 
rating system, I believe my novel would receive a PG-13 -- and I'm embarrassed 
to add that a G would be more likely than an R. The passages this mother 
nevertheless proceeded to underline, Xerox and distribute to all comers at a 
PTA meeting nearly caused the book to be banned outright. But at this same 
meeting, a couple of brave English teachers stood up and tenaciously defended 
the morality of my novel's overall aims, and a compromise -- which of course 
satisfied neither side -- was reached. The book was called back from the 
students, duly purged by the parents, reassigned and, as some sort of finale 
(and, I think, a small act of teacherly revenge upon the vigilantes), I was 
invited to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing I did upon arriving at the school was paw through an excised 
copy to see just how black my prose had been deemed to be -- and more than a 
few pages, it turned out, looked rather as if Cajuns had cooked them. But what 
interested me far more than the quantity of black marks was the unexpected 
difficulty of the whole censorship endeavor. Hard as these parents had tried to 
Clorox my prose, a myopic focus on "nasty words" at the expense of attention to 
narrative flow had resulted in a remarkably self-defeating arbitrariness. 
They'd taken care, for instance, to spare their big, strapping logging-town 
teen-agers my protagonist's dislike of the Army Corps of Engineers by 
converting the phrase "God damn dams" to "God xxxx dams." Yet when the same 
protagonist, one Gus Orviston, told a story about an inch-and-a-half-long 
scorpion his kid brother lost inside his fly-fishing-crazed family's house, not 
a word was blackened out of Gus' surmise that the lonely creature had 
ultimately "found and fallen in love with one of my father's mayfly imitations 
and died of lover's nuts trying to figure out how to screw the thing." Along 
similar lines, Gus was allowed, in a scene when his lady-love rejected him, to 
describe himself as a "blubbering Sasquatch . . . my beard full of lint, my 
teeth yellow, my fly open and undershorts showing there the same color as my 
teeth, and thick green boogers clogging both my nostrils." Yet when he 
attempted moments later to describe the bottom of a river as "the place where 
the slime and mudsuckers and fish-shit live," student innocence had to be 
protected by the prophylactic "fish-xxxx." 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern grew obvious: While my protagonist had been allowed to piss, puke 
and fornicate, to insult door-to-door evangelists and even to misread and 
reject the Bible with impunity, every time he tried to use an old-fashioned 
four-letter word -- even the innocuous likes of "hell," "damn" or "ass" -- down 
came the indelible markers. Some kind of "suitable-for-mixed-company" 
politeness was, then, what my censors were out to impose. It always seems to 
dumbfound and offend the promulgators of such cleanlinesses when the makers and 
defenders of literature declare even purges like theirs to be not just 
ineffective but dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The students' reactions to being censored in this way were mild compared to 
the teachers' reactions and to my own. Most of them considered it an 
embarrassment -- but less of an embarrassment, probably, than a dozen other 
inescapable facets of high school, small-town and family life. When I read to 
them the single most censored scene -- an expose of the greed and stupidity of 
two drunken fishermen -- with the missing words restored, the students, on a 
show of hands, unanimously preferred their drunks to sound like drunks, not 
Sunday-school teachers. They also agreed unanimously that the purge had been 
utterly ineffective. But most of them, I felt, were no more able than the 
parent-censors themselves to perceive any genuine danger in the laundering of 
their curriculum or literature. 
</P>
<P>
 A parable on the danger: 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a kid and picked raspberries for pocket money, some of the teen-age 
boys in the fields used to defy the heat, boredom and row-bosses (most of whom 
were staid Christian housewives) by regaling us with a series of formulaic, 
ad-libbed yarns they called "The Adventures of One-Eyed Dirk." To a casual 
listener, One-Eyed Dirk's were some of the dullest adventures ever endured. We 
pickers listened with bated breath, though, knowing that it was actually our 
teen raconteurs, not Dirk, who were having the adventure. The trick to a 
One-Eyed Dirk story was to juxtapose strategic verbs and modifiers with names 
of common objects in a way that enabled you, through the magic of metaphor, to 
spout pure analogical pornography within the hearing of everyone, yet to 
proclaim your literal innocence if confronted by an offended adult. An example 
might go: "Stunned by the size of the musk melons she'd offered him, One-Eyed 
Dirk groped through his own meager harvest, found the bent green zucchini, 
sighed at the wormhole in the end, but, with a shy smile, drew it out and 
thrust it slowly toward her . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Silly as this kind of thing may be, it underscores the fact that there is 
virtually nothing a would-be censor can do to guarantee the purity of language, 
because it is not just words that render language impure. Even "dirty" words 
tend to be morally neutral until placed in a context -- and it is the 
individual human imagination, more than individual words, that gives a context 
its moral or immoral twist. One-Eyed Dirk's G-rated zucchinis and wing nuts and 
valve jobs drive home the point that a bored kid out to tell an off-color yarn 
can do it with geometry symbols, nautical flags or two rocks and a stick if he 
wants. The human imagination was designed (by its Designer, if you like) to 
make rapid-fire, free-form, often-preposterous connections between shapes, 
words, colors, ideas, desires, sounds. This is its weakness, but also its 
wondrous strength. The nature of the imagination itself is, at bottom, why 
organized censorship never works. And it is also why every ferociously 
determined censorship effort sooner or later escalates into fascistic political 
agendas, burnings at the stake, dunking-chairs, gulags, pogroms and other 
literal forms of purge. Obviously, the only fail-safe way to eliminate 
impurities from human tongues, minds and cultures is to eliminate human life 
itself. 2. A Liberal Inconsistency 
</P>
<P>
 The censors of my novel achieved a laughable inconsistency by zeroing in on 
"four-letter words" and letting the narrative imagery ride. But there seems to 
me to be a culturally accepted yet comparable inconsistency practiced by some 
of our most respected publications. Scores of nationally important newspapers 
and magazines refuse to print some of the very words purged from my novel by 
small-town parents belonging to the Oregon Citizens Alliance. The national 
publications characterize their own refusal as "editorial policy." The same 
publications characterize the Alliance parents' refusal as "religious 
fanaticism" or "fascism." 
</P>
<P>
 How to work it out?  
</P>
<P>
 We must begin, I think, by admitting that an editorial policy is, in fact, a 
kind of fascism. In the litigious context of today's censorship wars, the 
admirable editorial gentility of, say, a William Shawn is, unfortunately, an 
indefensible inconsistency. I'm reminded of Austrian novelist Heimito von 
Doderer's lines: "Weapons that we have not loaded are forced into our hands. 
And still we fire the shot." Anyone who believes that censorship tends toward 
fascism is logically forced to admit that the urbane Mr. Shawn used to 
unwittingly duplicate the small-town vigilantes' "fascistic tendencies" by 
refusing to print the "s" or "f"- words. And those who can't accept this -- 
those who choose to believe that such a word in Shawn's New Yorker would have 
served no compelling purpose, would have offended many readers and would have 
cost the publication subscription money -- must also admit that there is no 
compelling reason for small-town parents not to wade through their children's 
school libraries eliminating "offensive" words and "non-compelling" books. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not suggesting that all periodicals and newspapers must print such words. 
I am suggesting that the average citizen's desire to improve the quality of 
language or art is born, in rural Oregon as it is in Manhattan, of an 
increasingly desperate concern for the health of the culture; that, given the 
rampant decay of the quality of American life, this concern is not about to 
leave us; that big-city editors, small-town parents, gay artists, unemployed 
loggers, Baptist preachers and working novelists express their desperation in 
different ways; and that we are united -- and should, I think, be humbled -- by 
our own inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Krishna tells the reluctant archer, Arjuna, in the Bhagavad Gita, we 
also have our own individual dharmas to follow. Loggers need trees to remain 
loggers; preachers need full pews and offering plates; and writers need 
unexpurgated bookstores, libraries and lexicons. When Arjuna balked on the eve 
of battle, seeing that the opposing army included beloved old teachers, 
relatives and friends, Krishna told him that our hopes are vain and our labours 
futile till we see ourselves one with the Maker of the million faces. But 
Krishna also advised that, with this Oneness at heart, Arjuna should go forth 
and play his archer's role to the best of his devastating ability. That said, I 
feel that I -- as a novelist engaged in the ongoing fight for every writer's 
and reader's freedom -- must now do my best to destroy, in argument, even a few 
beloved old teachers, relatives and friends. 3. The Morality of Literature 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the advent of the printing press, there have been readers who slip 
from enthusiasm for a favorite text into the belief that the words in that text 
embody truth: do not just symbolize it, but literally embody it. Not till the 
past few decades, though, has an alliance of American "conservative Christians" 
declared that this slip is, in fact, the true Christian religion, that a single 
bookful of words is Truth, and that this Truth should become the sole basis of 
the nation's political, legal and cultural life. The growing clout of this 
faction does not change the theological aberrance of its stance: 
Fundamentalists deify the written word in a way that -- in light of every 
Scripture-based Wisdom Tradition in the world, including Christianity's 
2,000-year-old own -- is not just naive. It is idolatrous. Words in books can 
remind us of truth, and occasionally help awaken us to it. But in themselves 
words are just paint, and writers are just painters -- Old Testament and Gospel 
writers, bhakti and Sufi saints, Tibetan lamas and Zen masters included. There 
are, of course, crucial differences between Scripture and belles-lettres, and 
between inspired and merely inventive prose. But the authors of both write with 
human hands, and in human tongues. Let's not overestimate the power of 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's not underestimate it either. As readers we are asked on Page One to lay 
our hand upon the back of an author's as he or she begins to paint a world. If 
the author's strokes somehow repel or betray our trust, if our concentration is 
lax or if we're biased or closed in some way, then no hand-in-hand magic can 
occur. But when a great word-painter is read with reciprocally great 
concentration and trust, an incredible thing happens. First, the painter's hand 
disappears. Then so does our own. Till there is only the living world of the 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
 This disappearance, the way we lose ourselves in the life of a story, is, I 
believe, the greatest truth in any literature, be it discursive or dramatic, 
sacred or secular. It is at any rate the greatest describable truth, because 
for the duration of the disappearance we possess no I with which to describe 
anything outside the text in which we're lost. Like all great truths, it is 
simultaneously a sacrifice (of the reader's ego) and a resurrection (of the 
world, the characters and the ideas in the text). And like all great truths, it 
is not brought about by any kind of mental computations upon literal meanings 
of sentences or words. All that's required is a willing immersion of 
imagination and mind in the dynamic pulse and flow of written language. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of this great truth, the most valid form of censorship is that 
practiced by authors themselves. It is the duty of all writers to scrupulously 
destroy or revise any or all writing that fails to let them vanish into the 
life of their own language. What authors are morally obligated to censor from 
their work is their own incompetence. Nothing more, nothing less. Simple as it 
sounds, it keeps most of us more than busy. Ezra Pound was quoted as saying, 
"Fundamental accuracy of statement is the one sole morality of literature." If, 
in other words, a story requires that its writer create a mountain and further 
requires that this mountain be imposing, the immoral mountain is not the one 
with the pair of unmarried hikers copulating on a remote slope. It is the 
mountain that fails to be imposing. The "sole morality of literature" demands 
that an author contemplate his peak till frozen clouds begin to swirl round its 
summit; till the bones of lost climbers and mountain goats appear deep in its 
crevasses; till its ice and stone mass haunts and daunts us like a cold moon 
rising not in some safe distance but from the scree at our very feet. 
</P>
<P>
 And the same goes -- with all due apologies to literary inquisitors everywhere 
-- for the imposing penis. This is not to say that all penises are, according 
to Pound's dictum, moral. Indeed, a gratuitously shocking penis, an 
extraneous-to-our-story penis, a hey-look-at- me-for-the-sake-of-nothing- 
but-me penis, however imposing, is literarily immoral (that is, incompetent), 
because by jarring the reader from the narrative or argumentative flow into a 
mood of "What's this stupid penis doing here?" the author has undermined the 
greatest truth of his tale: i.e. our ability to immerse ourselves in it. But 
once the dramatic demands of the story itself have requested of its author an 
imposing penis, it is the one-pointed, apoplectic-veined archetype, the one 
that has us crossing imaginary legs before we know it (or opening them, as the 
literary case may be), that is the moral penis, and it is the church, 
quasi-religious political cult or government agency that seeks to zip a zipper 
over it that is immoral. 
</P>
<P>
 "But how could the deletion of male members, filthy language, perversion, 
sadomasochism, sexual violence and so on ever be wrong? Why, in God's name, 
shouldn't we censor literature, art and human behavior itself in order to 
safeguard the purity of our children and our culture?" These are the 
fundamentalist questions -- the Helms, Falwell and Robertson questions. Those 
who ask them seem to some of us to pride themselves on their amnesia, 
considering how recently the likes of Stalin, Hitler, McCarthy and Khomeini 
have asked the same sort of questions. But it's a widespread amnesia. So here 
are two more answers to the questions -- one civil and American, one literary 
and Christian. First the civil: 
</P>
<P>
 All citizens of this country possesses a constitutional right to detest the 
work of any writer or artist they choose to detest -- and to criticize that 
writer or artist, in public and in private, in the most scathing language they 
are able to devise. I, to cite the handiest possible example, found the few 
pages of Bret Easton Ellis' "American Psycho" that I was able to read to be as 
crassly sensationalistic and literarily incompetent, despite a glib facility 
with sentence-making, as anything I've ever read. But to say that much 
satisfies me. And it's all the fun the Constitution allows: To carry my disgust 
further, to try to summon the outrage, compose the propaganda, induce the 
paranoia and generate the political clout that would let me and my ideological 
clones ban or purge one overpaid hack is simply not the way that people in this 
tenuously free country long ago agreed to do things. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Irish bards, when asked to recite certain stories, would sometimes say 
to their audience: " 'Tis an evil tale for telling. I canna' make it." And 
hearing this, their listeners would request a different tale. I believe Ellis, 
and Americans in general, are dying for a dose of this bardic wisdom. Yet 
sickening stories are an unavoidable byproduct of a sick culture, and a crucial 
diagnostic tool for anyone who seeks a cure. Writers need the freedom to invoke 
body parts, mayhem and twisted visions for many profound reasons, among them 
(jumping metaphors) the same reason that chefs need the freedom to invoke 
curry, garlic, extreme heat and many other things we can't tolerate in straight 
doses, in order to produce a cuisine. There is no mention of jalepeno peppers 
in the Christian Scriptures, and neither the average child nor the average 
televangelist can handle them. That's no reason to legislate them clean out of 
our huevos rancheros . 
</P>
<P>
 Now the literary and Christian argument: In the slender classic, "An 
Experiment in Criticism," the non-literalistic but indefatigably Christian 
professor of literature, C. S. Lewis, wrote that our access to a diverse and 
uncensored literature is spiritually crucial because "We demand windows. (And) 
literature . . . is a series of windows, even of doors. . . . Good reading . . 
. can be described either as an enlargement or as a temporary annihilation of 
the self. But that is an old paradox; 'he that loseth his life shall save it.' 
We therefore delight to enter into other men's beliefs . . . even though we 
think them untrue. And into their passions, though we think them depraved. . . 
. Literary experience heals the wound, without undermining the privilege, of 
individuality. . . . In reading great literature I become a thousand men and 
yet remain myself. . . . Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in 
knowing, I transcend myself; and am never more myself than when I do." 4. Why 
No Argument Against Fundamentalist Censorship Works 
</P>
<P>
 My home state, Oregon, according to its Library Association, was third in the 
nation in 1992 in the number of challenges to the printed word in schools, 
libraries and bookstores. The vast majority of these challenges were made by 
people who consider themselves fundamentalist Christians. I've just provided 
two arguments against such challenges. But I don't for a minute believe that 
either of my arguments -- nor any conceivable argument resembling them in 
category -- will persuade a single committed fundamentalist that censorship is 
an ineffective or negative or potentially deadly cultural strategy. The only 
way to convince a fundamentalist of such a thing would be with a fundamentalist 
argument. And there are none. Fundamentalism and censorship have always gone 
hand in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 My aim here is literary, not theological. But for literary reasons I am 
compelled to point out that a theologically motivated, politically powerful 
cult is out to simplify and "improve" our literature, art, science, sexual 
choices, Constitution and souls. And I see no effective choice, in defending 
all of the above, but to confront the theological basis of the cult itself. 
When I see poets and authors capable of making crowds weep at the beauty of 
their words reduced to explaining to some half-sentient TV news hound that they 
are trying to defend freedom of expression, not the freedom of pedophiles, I 
feel that some huge strategic error is being committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Literary people, being comparatively deep, are often mystified and stymied by 
the relentless shallowness of fundamentalist attacks. But the belligerent 
mind-set and self-insulating dogmas that enable this cult to thrive are neither 
complicated nor invulnerable to criticism. To treat the earth as disposable and 
the Bible as God, turn that God into a political action committee, equate 
effrontery with "evangelism," aggression with "compassion," disingenuous 
televised prattle with "prayer" and call the result "Christianity" is hardly an 
invincible position. Evangelists such as Pat Robertson subsidize their 
organizations by manufacturing a series of carefully designed "moral 
emergencies" that threaten "us," or better yet "our children." Rather than 
defending various scapegoats over the din of fundamentalist alarms and media 
sirens, I'd like to take a brief look at the manufacturers themselves. 5. 
American Fundamentalism 
</P>
<P>
 All of the famous televangelists, all the leaders of the contemporary 
Bible-based political alliances and most of the recent censors of school 
libraries, crusaders against homosexuality and politically active 
fundamentalists in general share a conviction that their political and social 
causes and agendas are approved of, if not inspired, by no less a being than 
God. This enviable conviction is less enviably arrived at by accepting on 
faith, hence as fact, that the Christian Bible pared down into American TV 
English is God's "word" to mankind, that this same Bible is "His" only word to 
mankind, and that the fundamentalist's unprecedentedly literalistic slant on 
this Bible is the one true slant. 
</P>
<P>
 The position is remarkably self-insulating. Possessing little knowledge of and 
no respect for the world's many rich spiritual, literary and cultural 
traditions, these people have no conceptions or models of love and compassion 
but their own and can therefore honestly, even good-heartedly, say that it is 
out of "Christian" compassion and a sort of "tough love" for others that they 
seek to impose on all others their God, Bible and slant. 
</P>
<P>
 The position is also far from unprecedented. Well-known variations on the 
theme include the Inquisitor's tough love for heretics, the conquistador's 
tough love for Incans, Aztecs and Mayans, the Puritan's tough love for witches, 
the white Western settler's tough love for Native Americans, and so on. Every 
Bible-reifying crusader group from the European prototype to my home state's 
Citizens Alliance has seen itself as fighting to make its own or some other 
community more "Christian." The result, among contemporary non-fundamentalists, 
has been a growing revulsion toward anything that chooses to call itself 
"Christian." Yet to this day, I see no more crucial text, in defusing 
fundamentalist crusades, than the four books of the Gospels, and no more 
important question to keep asking all such crusaders than whether there is 
anything truly Christian -- that is, anything compassionate, self-abnegating, 
empathetic and enemy-loving -- about their various crusades. 
</P>
<P>
 This being a literary essay, it's only fair to point out that fundamentalists 
are book lovers, too. They just happen to have invested so much brittle love in 
the first three (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) and final (Revelations) books of 
the one black-covered volume that their ability to enjoy, comprehend or even 
tolerate other volumes has been drastically curtailed. But another question -- 
again both literary and theological -- that needs to be asked is: How brittle 
can one's love become before it ceases to be love at all? 
</P>
<P>
 The ex-Dominican priest and writer Matthew Fox answers this question by 
calling contemporary evangelical fundamentalism "Christofascism." But when I've 
tried to deploy this term, it has felt noxious upon my tongue. What's the 
difference between Fox or me shouting "Christofascist!" at fundamentalists and 
Rush Limbaugh shouting "feminazi!" at feminists? Both coinages are a calculated 
descent into the realm of name-calling. Of course, in the escalating verbal and 
political warfare between fundamentalism and arts and letters, name-calling has 
become so difficult to avoid that even actual names have become a form of 
name-calling. If you want to attack conservative Christianity, for instance, 
you describe the shenanigans of the Jimmys Bakker and Swaggart; and if you want 
to demonstrate the decadence of literature and art, you describe the 
imaginative abominations of Bret Easton Ellis and rectal bullwhips of Robert 
Mapplethorpe. But with "Christofascism" supposedly lurking to the right of us, 
and "feminazism" to the left, I am inclined to place Mahatma Gandhi front and 
center, warning: "Be careful of the means you use to fight the fascist, lest 
you become fascists yourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamentalist right is outspoken in its desire to simplify and control my 
vocabulary, my profession and my spirituality. What I feel compelled to do in 
response is insist upon a distinction. There is a complex 2,000-year-old 
religious and cultural tradition that calls itself Christianity. There is a 
plethora of comparatively new factions of Bible-idolizing literalists who call 
themselves by the same name. But they are not the same. To refer to Origen, 
Oral Roberts, Dante, Billy Graham, St. Francis, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson 
and Lady Julian of Norwich all as "Christians" stretches the meaning clear out 
of the term. The word "humanoid" is as helpful. The gulf between traditional 
Christianity and American fundamentalism is vast. A Francis Schaeffer text used 
to instruct Baptist seminarians all over the United States on the world's 
supposed cults, doctrinal blunders and "other religions" defines and 
illustrates the concept and history of what it calls "mysticism" by analyzing 
the writings of Henry Miller. To teach that mysticism equals Henry Miller is 
not teaching at all. It's an attempt to churn out ideological clones who want 
no "windows," no insight into others, no enlargement or effacement of self -- 
clones content to read and idolatrize their one book, willfully misread all 
others and deliberately use the resulting curtailment of comprehension, 
pleasure and tolerance as a unifying principle. 6. Shame and Reverence 
</P>
<P>
 That fly-fishing protagonist of my censored novel, Gus, voiced some serious 
reservations about the being fundamentalists so possessively refer to as "God." 
But a literary morality problem that Gus (and I) ran into in telling his story 
was that, after a climactic all-night adventure with a river and a huge chinook 
salmon, he had a sudden, transrational (or, in the old Christian lexicon, 
"mystical") experience that left him too overwhelmed to speak with Pound's 
"fundamental accuracy of statement," yet too grateful to speak not at all. The 
paradox this presented my protagonist was, and is, autobiographical. As the 
recipient of several such detonations, I felt bound by gratitude to speak. But 
as a lifelong victim of the pollution of the Christian lexicon, I felt 
compelled to speak in non-Christian terms. Gus' account of his ineffable 
experience did not once invoke the word God . But it did speak of transcendent 
love, and of a being so God-like that in the end he dubbed it "the Ancient 
One." 
</P>
<P>
 Reader reactions to this climax have been neatly divided. Those who have 
experienced analogous detonations have sometimes been so moved by the scene 
that their eyes filled as they thanked me for writing it; and those who have 
experienced no such detonation have as often asked why I ruined a dang good 
fishin' yarn with mystical mumbo jumbo. Odd as it may sound, I agree with both 
reactions. Both are perfectly honest. What more should a writer want from a 
reader? What more, for that matter, can mortals -- be they skeptic or mystic -- 
offer the Absolute? A French novelist/philosopher, Rene Daumal, describes the 
paradox I faced perfectly. He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear to you that I have to force myself to write or to pronounce this 
word: God. It is a noise I make with my mouth or a movement of the fingers that 
hold my pen. To pronounce or to write this word makes me ashamed. What is real 
here is that shame. . . . Must I never speak of the Unknowable because it would 
be a lie? Must I speak of the Unknowable because I know that I proceed from it 
and am bound to bear witness to it? This contradiction is the prime mover of my 
best thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 Another word for this shame, in my opinion, is reverence. And American 
fundamentalists, speaking of the Unknowable, too often lack this quality. Their 
preachers proudly pronounce the word "God," define it, worship their own 
definition, impose it upon all adherents, offer an eternal reward for this 
arrogance, promise eternal torment to all who fail to agree. What an abyss 
between this and the self-giving Christianity of a Francis, an Eckhart, a 
Martin Luther King Jr. What a gulf, too, between this and the contemporary 
Amish -- who practice no evangelism, who tease those who quote the Bible too 
often (calling them "Scripture smart") and who consider it laughable to 
pronounce oneself "saved," since God alone is capable of making such weighty 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a gulf between fundamentalism and American literature. If the latter 
arrives at any general theological conclusion as to what we owe to a divinity, 
it is probably this: Better to be honest to God -- even if that means stating 
one's complete lack of belief in any such being -- than to force one's 
imagination and mind into the mold of a ready-made dogma. In literature, as in 
life, there are ways of disbelieving in God that are more compassionate, and in 
that sense more "Christian," than many forms of orthodox belief. There are 
atheists, for example, who believe as they do because the general state of the 
world and of humanity makes it impossible for them to conceive of a creator who 
is anything but compassionless, remiss or cruel. Rather than consider God 
cruel, they choose disbelief. To my mind this is a backhanded form of 
reverence; a beautiful kind of "shame." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to upset many fundamentalists that literature's answer to the God 
question is virtually the same as the Constitution's. There is also no doubt 
that the openness that our literature and form of government encourage results 
in a theological cacophony and mood of irritable independence that bear no 
resemblance to the unison docility that reigns in the average church. But 
America is a country, and America's a literature that stakes its life on the 
belief that this cacophony and independence are not only legal, but essential 
to our ultimate health. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Abbey remains welcome in our libraries, as he will never be in our 
churches, to say: "God is Love? Not bloody likely!" Goethe remains welcome to 
reply to him: "As a man is, so is his God; therefore God is often an object of 
mockery." And readers remain welcome to draw their own conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother tongue, the language my parents and grandparents used to draw me 
from virtual non-being into the naming of and engagement with life, is English. 
And there are only so many English words with which to describe the eternal 
verities and the journey of the soul. One of the irreplaceable words in this 
language is God . Yet the God of organized fundamentalism, as advertised daily 
through a variety of mass media, is a supramundane Caucasian male as furious 
with humanity's failure to live by a few arbitrarily chosen lines from the Book 
of Leviticus as He is oblivious to His spokespersons' failure to live by the 
militant compassion of the Gospels. 
</P>
<P>
 As surely as I feel love and need for my wife and children, I feel love and 
need for a God. But this feeling has nothing whatever to do with supramundane 
Caucasian males. And I am not troubled by this. If the fundamentalists' God 
were indeed the One and Only, the likes of Gandhi and Mother Teresa, Tolstoy 
and Dostoyevsky, Jung and Merton, Black Elk and Chief Joseph, Thoreau and John 
Muir, Rumi and Hafiz, John of the Cross and Julian of Norwich, Lao-tzu and 
Bodhidharma, Kabir and Mira Bai, Shunryu and D. T. Suzuki, Valmiki and 
Socrates, Dogen and Dante, would all be heretics, atheists and infidels -- 
because the Absolute they all worship is an infinitely different being. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect the situation to be rather different. I suspect the odd 
"evangelical" truth of the matter to be that fundamentalists need 
non-fundamentalists of all stripes -- be they mystics, agnostics, Amish, 
artists, writers, scientists, believers, nonbelievers -- in such a big way that 
it may not be going too far to say they need us for their salvation. As Mark 
Twain pointed out a century ago, the only really prominent Christian community 
that fundamentalists have ever managed to establish in any of the worlds is 
hell.

POP MUSIC CHARTS: SELLING LIKE MAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the R&B vocal-group sweepstakes, Jodeci may turn out to be the most 
enduring act. Its second album, "Diary of a Mad Band," is No. 6 on The Times' 
Southern California pop album chart and No. 5 nationally. "Diary" seems 
destined to radically outsell the second albums of Jodeci's prime 
competition--Boyz II Men and Color Me Badd. Salt-N-Pepa's album is a strong 
Southern California seller all of a sudden, entering the chart at No. 13. 
"Whatta Man," the second hit single from the female rap crew's album, has 
really boosted album sales. The single premiered on the pop chart at No. 9, 
trailed by "Unity" (No. 10)--by another female rapper, Queen Latifah. TOP 10

TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR KELLY TO WIN SUPER BOWL; AFC: BILLS QUARTERBACK TRIES 
TO DOWNPLAY THE MATCHUP AGAINST MONTANA IN TODAY'S CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP IN 
BUFFALO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CIMINI, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Kelly, a car-racing enthusiast, wears a leather jacket with Richard 
Petty's autograph on the left sleeve. Kelly also owns a Petty car, the facade 
of which is mounted on a wall in his sports restaurant in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Petty is the king," the Bills' quarterback said, "but my favorite is 
Dale Earnhardt." 
</P>
<P>
 Why's that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because he takes chances and likes to have fun," Kelly said with a devilish 
grin, knowing he just described himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly is proud of his image, but he realizes he still has some polishing to 
do. Unless he wins a Super Bowl, Kelly will be remembered as a popular, 
fun-loving quarterback who couldn't win the Big One. He's 0 for 3 in the Super 
Bowl, one victory away from a fourth chance to reverse his football legacy. 
Fittingly, the man who stands between Kelly and Super Bowl XXVIII is the 
Richard Petty of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Montana, owner of four Super Bowl rings. The King. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly tried to downplay the matchup in today's American Football Conference 
Championship Game at Rich Stadium -- "This isn't Jim against Joe" -- but he 
acknowledged that a win over Montana's Kansas City Chiefs would be an 
accomplishment to savor years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than anything, it could be a factor, say, six years down the road, when 
I look back and say, 'Yeah, we played against Montana,' " Kelly said. "Yeah, it 
would be great to beat him and go on to win a Super Bowl, but right now, as I 
stand here, it really hasn't entered my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't believe him. Kelly turns 34 next month, and his football clock is 
ticking. His ultimate football goals are to win a Super Bowl and make the Hall 
of Fame. Those close to Kelly believe the Super Bowl failures bother him more 
than he lets on. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a fighter, and I'm sure it (ticks) him off," safety Mark Kelso said, 
"but the fact of the matter is, this team was going nowhere before Jim Kelly 
got here. He was the ignition." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Marv Levy went so far as to say, "Jim Kelly means every bit as much to 
us as Joe Montana means to Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
 To support his contention, Levy noted that Kelly has a 25-16 record against 
the top nine quarterbacks in the league. The top nine, according to Levy: Troy 
Aikman, Randall Cunningham, John Elway, Boomer Esiason, Montana, Warren Moon, 
Dan Marino, Phil Simms and Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
 A flowery statistic, for sure, but it's overshadowed by Kelly's record in the 
Super Bowl. Mention that to Levy, and he bristles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't lose the Super Bowls, the Buffalo Bills lost the Super Bowls," Levy 
said. "I don't know if that's how he looks at it; that's how I look at it. 
Nothing bothers the guy. He's unflappable, so I don't think that wears on him 
at all. He just says, 'Give me another shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 If he plays as well as he did last week, Kelly probably will get shot No. 4. 
Despite brutal weather conditions -- the wind-chill factor was 32-below -- 
Kelly passed for 287 yards and two touchdowns, leading the Bills to a 29-23 win 
over the Los Angeles Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that he's peaked at the right time," Chiefs Coach Marty 
Schottenheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a so-so regular season for Kelly. He threw only 18 touchdowns passes, 
his lowest total since 1988. He attributed the falloff to injuries on the line 
and poor weather conditions at home. NFL insiders believe Kelly's performance 
suffered because of a more conservative offense and the lack of a deep threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "My numbers weren't up there," he said, "but what counts is wins and losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly is motivated purely by his hunger for a championship. These days, he 
wears a look of determination, according to teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wonder how many more chances Jim is going to get (for a championship)," 
center Kent Hull said. "I think that's why he has been so focused this year. 
I've never seen him better."  
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs feel the same way about Montana, setting the stage for a dynamite 
quarterback showdown. A battle of opposites, really. Aside from the fact they 
were raised in the fertile football territory of Western Pennsylvania, Kelly 
and Montana have little in common. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't even know each other that well. Montana isn't a member of the 
Quarterback Club, a marketing wing of NFL Properties whose membership includes 
Kelly, Esiason, Elway and most of the big-name passers in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's separate from all of us," Kelly said of Montana. "Joe has always been 
put off by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 In his own class. Kelly would like a chance to breathe that rarefied air.

AIKMAN, YOUNG HAVE MUCH TO PROVE TODAY; NFC: AGENT FOR BOTH SAYS THERE'S MORE 
PRESSURE ON 49ER QUARTERBACK BECAUSE COWBOYS WON SUPER BOWL LAST SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITO STELLINO, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Troy Aikman recently signed a record $50 million contract, Steve Young 
was bumped into the No. 2 position in the NFL's salary league. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a new feeling for Young. He's used to being No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that anyone will hold any benefits for the San Francisco 49ers 
quarterback, whose contract averages $5.35 million a year. Still, it does 
continue a pattern for Young. He always seems to be the second banana. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Joe Montana was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs before the season 
started, Young lived and played in his huge shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Montana is gone, Young has established himself as the leader of the 
49ers and has taken the club to the National Football Conference title game for 
a second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Young still finds himself chasing another quarterback -- Aikman, whose new 
contract averages $6.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman, who outdueled Young in last year's NFC title game, will try to do it 
again Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 For Aikman, it's a chance to take a big step toward joining the exclusive club 
of quarterbacks who have won back-to-back Super Bowls. Only Bart Starr, Bob 
Griese, Terry Bradshaw and Montana belong to that club. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question if we win this game and go on to the Super Bowl and win, 
it will raise my play in the eyes of the public and put me in a different 
class," Aikman said. "That's not the reason for me to go on to win the Super 
Bowl. It would be nice to win two in a row or three in a row. It would be nice 
to win one every year. That's our goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Young's goal is to get there for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Steinberg, the agent who represents both quarterbacks, said, "When I was 
doing Aikman's negotiations, Steve was statistically superior in virtually all 
respects, except the goal of the entire enterprise is to win the Super Bowl, 
and Troy has done that." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg says there's more pressure on Young because Aikman already has won a 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Cowboys won the Super Bowl last year, Aikman's reaction seemed to be 
more of relief than elation. He said that nobody could say he hadn't won a 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said he doesn't think the pressure will bother Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "He understands the pressure, but at least he's got a chance to do something 
about it," Steinberg said. "He's got a chance to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 It was worse for Young when he was Montana's backup. Even when Young led the 
49ers to a 14-2 record during the 1992 season when Montana was hurt, he was 
viewed by many as an interloper. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was bottled up in the Montana years," Steinberg said. "He had to be 
careful not to trample on the legend." 
</P>
<P>
 Things were so frustrating that Steinberg suggested several times that Young 
should demand a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Young rejected that idea. "He'd say, 'Look, I'm going to get my chance,' " 
Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young kept pointing out that the 49ers were a strong organization with a 
strong supporting cast for a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Young had played for a disorganized team, the Los Angeles Express, in the old 
United States Football League and a losing team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in 
the NFL, and he wanted to stay in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He has the job now and he has learned to live with the expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest point was at the beginning," Young said. "I was always trying to 
jump through hoops. It started with, 'Well, he can't throw the long ball.' Now 
it's, 'He hasn't gone all the way.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided a long time ago to not jump through hoops. I do it because I want 
to go all the way. I've done a lot. And there are some things I would like to 
do for me personally. Then you live well. Then you're happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman has had an easier path to success. At age 27, he's five years younger 
than Young. After being the No. 1 pick in the 1989 college draft, Aikman had 
some rough moments in his first year, when the Cowboys lost all 11 games he 
started, and in his second and third seasons when he was injured at the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything fell into place last year when the Cowboys won the Super Bowl, but 
both the team and Aikman hit a few speed bumps along the way. Aikman underwent 
back surgery in the off-season and missed two games with a pulled hamstring, 
but he's now working on a six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been more of a struggle this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that he's won all four playoff games he's started. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can go into any game and not have something hanging over his head that he 
hasn't achieved that needs to be achieved," Cowboys Coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
"I think it's important that he has that kind of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Aikman and Young have a strong supporting cast. Aikman can hand off to 
Emmitt Smith and throw to Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper. Young can hand off to 
Ricky Watters and throw to Jerry Rice and John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 It could come down to which team has the ball last.

MADDEN SET TO PACK BUS; HIS SEASON WILL END SUNDAY; HE MIGHT BE HEADED TO FOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The old stories. The smoked turkeys on Thanksgiving Day. The jokes. Riding in 
the back of Pat Summerall's pickup truck. The Friday night poker games. Hanging 
out around the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 These were the memory flashes John Madden was having as he prepared for CBS' 
final NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
 After 13 years in the same booth, America's most beloved sportscasting team, 
Madden and Summerall, apparently will move on to the Fox network after the NFC 
championship game today between San Francisco and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, Madden hadn't really thought about it. He was consumed with 
the football. Then, it dawned on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to get that feeling," Madden said just a couple of days before 
the final game. "And it's the first time I've had it. It's not going to be 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
 It's all Fox's fault. Last month, the 7-year-old network outbid CBS for the 
NFC portion of the NFL contract, and CBS was out of the NFL business, for at 
least four years. The NFL's original network, which had done games since 1956, 
was consigned to four years of Sunday golf or basketball or some such. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did this game in Dallas earlier this year," Madden recalled as he began to 
recognize the finality of today's broadcast for the first time. "We were going 
to a Mexican restaurant, and Pat had his pickup truck. We all got in the back, 
and Pat was in front driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I'm sitting in that back where I had some stuff hanging out. And I 
kind of thought at the time, 'This is how it should be. Maybe this is what the 
whole thing is all about, the back of Pat Summerall's pickup truck. It doesn't 
get a whole lot better than that."' 
</P>
<P>
 While Madden's been riding around in Summerall's pickup, Barry Frank of IMG, 
his agent, was trying to stir up a bidding war involving Fox, ABC and NBC. It 
culminated Thursday when the two announcers agreed to accept offers from Fox. 
Madden reportedly agreed to a $30-million, four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors had Madden going just about everywhere but Nickelodeon. Madden had 
said he was waiting until the season's over to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't got into that. For some reason, it's hard to believe, I know, but 
this is the most fun part of the season for me, and I'm not going to get into 
what I'm going to do after," Madden said. "I want to enjoy what I'm doing right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 When the season is over, he'll now make his move quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, the two Q's -- quickly and quietly," Madden said. "I don't know -- 
because I've never done this before . . . And it is the unknown out there for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS gave Madden his first broadcast home in 1979 right after he left as coach 
of the Oakland Raiders. His first year, Madden worked with a different 
play-by-play partner almost every weekend. He even got to work once with 
Summerall because Tom Brookshire had to go to his daughter's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "My second year, 1980, I worked with Gary Bender the entire season. My third 
year, 1981, was my first with Pat, and we've been together ever since," Madden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The memories I have of being with Pat? Hell, he's just the greatest guy," 
Madden said. "It's like I told somebody the other day. Pat wears well. The 
Friday night poker games, the stories Pat always tells about his grandaddy, 
sitting in that pickup truck, riding the bus. I know I'm rambling. And Pat 
bringing those smoked turkeys on Thanksgiving. All those things. Those are just 
Pat Summerall. That's kind of what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Madden is sure what the future is all about, at least for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 He also knows, "I'll be covering football. I know that's what I'm going to be 
doing. It's the people you miss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 People like producer Bob Stenner and director Sandy Grossman, who have been 
doing NFL games on CBS together for 35 years, and all the technicians and 
cameramen and researchers and assistant directors and producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through a lot of things together and a lot of practices and a lot 
of poker games and football games and booths and different situations," Madden 
said of Summerall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be hard to picture myself not standing next to Pat Summerall."

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; L.A. OPEN TO HONOR MCSPADEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He doesn't hit the ball quite as far and his putting is a bit shaky, but 
Harold (Jug) McSpaden, according to Chi Chi Rodriguez, is a golf phenomenon at 
85. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before the big money in professional golf, Byron Nelson and 
McSpaden were called the "Gold Dust Twins." 
</P>
<P>
 Between them, they won most of the tournaments on the PGA Tour. The "gold" was 
sometimes as much as $1,500 for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nissan Los Angeles Open, at Riviera Country Club Feb. 8-11, is honoring 
McSpaden, who won it half a century ago, in 1944 when the tournament was played 
at Wilshire Country Club. McSpaden remembers playing Riviera in 1929, when it 
was only two years old. 
</P>
<P>
 He is still a solid golfer, as he proved with an 80 in a practice round the 
other day at Riviera. Twice last year he shot rounds of 74, 10 shots under his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chi Chi said it was the most amazing feat in golf," McSpaden said. "He bows 
every time he sees me and says it's guys like us oldtimers who made it possible 
for these people to earn all this money. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1934 I won all four tournaments in California. I won here in L.A., at 
Pasadena and Sacramento and won the San Francisco match-play tournament. I won 
less than $6,000 for the bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last spring at the Legends of Golf, they held an unusual event. All the old 
golfers, like Tommy Bolt, Jerry Barber and myself, were in a 36-hole contest. 
The feat was to shoot your age or under for both rounds. If you failed on the 
first you were gone. I shot 78-80 and won $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, bread costs a lot more than a nickel these days." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1944 McSpaden was No. 2 on the money list, behind Nelson, and earned 
$23,855.30 in War Bonds. After winning 17 tournaments, McSpaden, then 38, 
retired in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just plain got tired of it," he said. "We drove to all the tournaments and 
played golf five or six days a week, depending on how far we had to drive 
between tournaments. I knew how long it took and the best roads to take to just 
about every city in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "That last year in the L.A. Open (1947) at Riviera, Sam Snead made a birdie 
three on the 18th to beat us. I quit after the Masters that year. I 
three-putted 11, 13 and 15, and when I three-putted 18, I lost to Jimmy Demaret 
by two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe my best year was 1938. I played more than 100 rounds that year and 
sportswriter Grantland Rice figured that I averaged 69.37 strokes a round. I 
remember during the war Bob Hope and Bing Crosby staged a tournament to raise 
money for the war. I shot 64-65 -- 129 to win it. Bob Crosby and I won the 
pro-am and it made Bing so mad he wouldn't give the trophy to his brother." 
</P>
<P>
 When McSpaden left the tour, he joined Palm Beach Clothing Co., which sent him 
to Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I finally started to make money," McSpaden said. "The stock just 
kept going up. . . . I was tired of the traveling to play golf, but in my 
clothing job I was on the road almost as much." 
</P>
<P>
 He was headquartered at a home on the Victory Hills Golf Course in Kansas 
City, Kan., which he built in 1929. At 2 a.m. one morning in 1978, McSpaden 
awoke to find the house on fire from a smoldering cigarette. He woke up his 
wife Betsy and she thought he was joking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was no joke," McSpaden said. "It was terrible. The flames were all around 
us and we tried crawling. A glass door blew out and we were right in the fire. 
We made it out, but I was temporarily blinded. I had cataracts on both eyes. I 
had to have surgery and in those days they didn't have laser. It took a doctor 
with steel nerves and it was scary, but I finally regained my eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house was mostly redwood and the fire just wouldn't stay put out. When it 
finally burned itself out, the only thing left was the fireplace. We rented a 
trailer and lived on the property until the house was rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Golf became an avocation after he left the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was retired 40 years until I was persuaded to start playing in some senior 
events," McSpaden said. "I kept playing socially, but never worked at it. So, I 
started playing in the Legends and the Senior Open." 
</P>
<P>
 The USGA decreed that players in the Senior Open must walk 18 holes all four 
days of the tournament in 1989. Some elected not to play. But McSpaden, then 
80, could still walk a brisk 18 holes and he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he says he doesn't play often now, he apologized for shooting the 80 
at Riviera. He was breaking in a new set of clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was in his prime, McSpaden was a long hitter, but not as long as Jimmy 
Thompson. Thompson, the John Daly of that day, often hit the ball 325-350 
yards, McSpaden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays, they are making clubs that won't slice or hook," he said. "So the 
present-day golfers can't do the things with a golf ball we could." 
</P>
<P>
 McSpaden shot a 59 long before Al Geiberger did at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only problem was that it came in the round before the San Antonio Open," 
McSpaden said. "When it counted, I shot a 74, but I followed that with a 63. I 
had a distinguished group sign the card for the 59. Playing with me were 
Nelson, Paul Runyan and Walter Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit my drives about 50 yards shorter than I did then, and sometimes I don't 
putt so well, but with these new clubs, I guess I'll keep playing a bit 
longer." Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Al Geiberger recently bought a second home in Palm Springs, then learned there 
won't be a senior tournament there this season. The Vintage at the Vintage 
Country Club was one of the first successful senior events, but it became 
unwieldy for the club to handle last year and it was moved to Indian Wells 
Resort. It couldn't find a sponsor this year, but is expected to return to the 
area in 1995. . . . Raymond Floyd told Golf Digest he hopes his sons Raymond 
Jr., 19, and Robert, 17, don't pursue professional golf careers because they 
won't have their own identity because of the fame of their dad. But Dave 
Stockton is reveling in Dave Jr.'s qualifying for the PGA Tour. In his first 
event, the Hawaiian Open, Dave Stockton Jr. finished five under par and picked 
up $2,819. . . . Stockton Sr. has already informed officials he will play in 
the GTE West at Ojai March 3-6.

LATEST DEFEAT IS JUST TOO MUCH FOR BAKER; IRVINE: AFTER SAN JOSE STATE WINS, 
89-76, ANTEATER COACH HAS MORE THAN A FEW WORDS FOR HIS TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the fait accompli , the last straw, the end of a home stand from hell, 
and it was more than Rod Baker could bear. A few minutes after San Jose State 
beat UC Irvine, 89-76, Saturday night, the normally composed and soft-spoken 
Anteater coach entered his team's locker room bellowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four minutes later, he finally emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, which came home after a victory at Utah State on a high, hit new lows 
in home losses to Pacific and San Jose. The Anteaters (5-9 and 2-4 in 
conference) are headed in the opposite direction of San Jose (8-7, 4-3), which 
picked up its third consecutive victory and equaled its most in a season under 
Coach Stan Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters, who won only six games under Baker last year, could have tied 
that mark this week. Thursday night, they came up two points short against the 
Tigers. Saturday night, despite an inspired effort by center DeForrest Boyer, 
they fell on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a team meeting, and we talked about tendencies and roles," Baker said. 
"(After the tirade), it was conversational after that. We aired some things 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say I was not real pleased tonight. They pounded us on boards and 
we simply got outplayed. That's not a good feeling. We got outplayed by a very 
good team, that's not a (mediocre) team, but at this point in conference, no 
one can afford to be outplayed by anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose guard Terry Cannon scored 10 of his game-high 26 points in the final 
3 1/2 minutes as the Spartans held off a late charge by Irvine and quieted the 
crowd of 2,789 at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they brought it to six (76-70), we started to execute with the clock and 
with high-percentage shots," Cannon said. "We benefited by using the clock and 
getting baskets." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans, as with so many of Irvine's opponents this season, also 
benefited from the Anteaters' poor perimeter defense. Nevada Las Vegas shot 56% 
from three-point range, and Rebel outside shooters accounted for 42 points on 
treys. Reno's Preston Johnson and Jerry Hogan combined to make nine of 15 
three-pointers. And Saturday night, San Jose shot 58% on three-pointers, 
including five of seven in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense can't be very good when we allow a team to shoot 52% and 58% on 
three-pointers," Baker said. "Our defense wasn't as good as theirs, and we're 
not going to beat anybody when we make just nine field goals in a half." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine was nine of 29 from the floor after the intermission, but they still 
managed to trim a 13-point deficit to six (73-67) when Boyer, who was eight for 
13 from the field and finished with 23 points and nine rebounds, made one of 
two free throws with 3:38 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cannon went coast-to-coast for a flying layup, was fouled and made the 
free throw, and that put the Spartans ahead, 76-67. He made three more free 
throws and then stole a pass and scored on another drive and layup to seal the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one means a lot," Cannon said. "We're 4-3 in conference, and for the 
first time, we're in a position to be in the upper half in the standings, and 
that's a very significant step for our school." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Irvine, well, Baker says he has to go back to the drawing board, a move 
he had to make in the middle of last season, a season during which the 
Anteaters managed just six victories. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Irvine's woes has been the anemic shooting of guard Chris Brown. Brown, 
who became academically eligible on Dec. 10, had been a shot in the arm, but 
lately, he has been shooting blanks. Brown, who made only three of 10 shots 
against Pacific, was one for 11 against the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been sick, but that's not an excuse," Baker said.

PREP WRESTLING ROUNDUP; CAPISTRANO VALLEY WINS THIS ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a sneak preview that San Clemente hopes will have a different ending 
when the main attraction screens later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-ranked Capistrano Valley edged 10th-ranked San Clemente, 130-127, in 
the San Clemente wrestling tournament Saturday night, giving both teams 
something to chew on as Thursday's South Coast League showdown nears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be great," San Clemente Coach Mark Calentino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cougar Coach Joe Zeller agreed. "Three points, that was the difference 
(Saturday)," he said. "Thursday's going to be close." 
</P>
<P>
 So close that John Witting (30-2), a 7-1 victor over Ocean View's Jeff Barney 
at 152 pounds and the Tritons' only tournament finalist, said the heavyweight 
class could decide the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may be what it comes down to," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But if the Tritons don't prepare better for the Cougars than they did for 
Saturday's tournament, it probably won't matter.  
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't wrestle good all week," Witting said. "For Capo, we have to wrestle 
hard all week." 
</P>
<P>
 Three Capistrano Valley wrestlers advanced to the finals, but all came up 
short. At 135, Michael Peters of El Cajon Valley pinned Mark Stephenson at 
3:59, and Alec Laidlaw fell behind Torrance's Gerald Fazis early and lost, 3-2, 
at 170, and Cougar Terry Tuzzolino scored on a takedown of Mark Albert of Los 
Alamitos, to tie it, 7-7, late in the third, but Albert scored six quick points 
with five seconds left for the 13-7 decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the championships it's tough to come back if you fall behind early," 
Zeller said. "They just don't make many mistakes once you get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Third-ranked Santa Ana finished third with 118 points and placed three in the 
finals. All were flawless. Roger Santiago was a 4-1 winner at 112, Miguel 
Valencia was a 15-13 victor at 125, and Ron Hernandez defeated Ray Torres of 
Dana Hills, 13-6, at 130. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana defeated Capistrano Valley twice in earlier tournaments this season, 
but the Saints were missing players -- because of injuries and temporary 
suspensions by Coach Scott Glabb -- Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 "We did a fine job with who we had," said Glabb, adding that his team should 
be at full strength for the section playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 In the El Toro eight-way tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Von der Ahe named most valuable wrestler -- Santa Margarita's Andy Von der Ahe 
was named most valuable wrestler in the lower weight divisions after pinning 
all four opponents at 135 pounds. Anaheim placed third in the tournament, which 
was won by Bell Gardens.

PREP BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; BREA-OLINDA OVERCOMES MATER DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Hauser, Mater Dei girls' basketball coach, said beforehand that her team 
was a little excited, a little anxious and maybe even a little scared. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not show it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-ranked Mater Dei hung onto top-ranked Brea-Olinda like a bad flu before 
finally falling, 65-49, in front of an overflow crowd at Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 With 7 minutes 6 seconds left, it was a five-point game, 47-42. 
</P>
<P>
 But like the Ladycats (19-0) have done so often before, they excelled late. 
Lee Moulin hit a three-pointer, Nicole Erickson went coast-to-coast after 
grabbing a defensive rebound, and then came 11 consecutive free throws -- 
Moulin was five for five, Erickson six for six. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about the only place on the floor from which Brea was shooting well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're not shooting well," Moulin said, "we usually get our points from 
somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea -- which had four starters shooting 46.8% or better -- shot only 32% from 
the field against the Monarchs. Erickson had a game-high 20 points, Moulin had 
15 and Kiyoko Miller had 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (15-3) got 15 from Melody Peterson including three first-quarter 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs tied the game at 18 with Allison Luckey's basket with 7:13 left 
in the second quarter, but a 10-0 run gave Brea the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 In other nonleague girls' games: 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley 44, Costa Mesa 42 -- Susan Scott scored 17 points and 
Jennifer Garrett added 12 for visiting Capistrano Valley. Costa Mesa is 11-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia 74, Aliso Niguel 20 -- Estancia (15-3) built a 16-point halftime 
lead, then held Aliso Niguel to three points in the second half and none in the 
fourth quarter. Karla Dominguez led four Eagles in double figures with 18 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia 57, La Habra 31 -- LaQuinta Alexander scored a game-high 14 points 
and had 10 rebounds for Valencia (9-7). La Habra is 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty Christian 63, Redlands Calvary Chapel 23 -- Sophomore Jessica Clark 
scored a career-high 25 points and had 21 rebounds for Liberty Christian 
(10-7). 
</P>
<P>
 In Olympic League girls' basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos Valley Christian 67, Whittier Christian 30 -- Kelly Hibma scored 16 
for Cerritos Valley Christian (17-2, 7-0). Alana Kempton scored 18 points for 
Whittier Christian (9-7, 4-3). 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange League girls' basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia 47, Western 38 -- Magnolia's Whitney Torregano topped all scorers 
with 16 points, but she left the game in the fourth quarter with a knee injury. 
Isabel Rojas led Western (2-3 in league) with 12. Magnolia is 13-6 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 In Olympic League boy's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Ontario Christian 58, Capistrano Valley Christian 56 (OT) -- Brandon Floerke 
hit a three-pointer with five seconds remaining in regulation to force overtime 
for Capistrano Valley Christian (3-15, 1-5), but Jason Lagastee sealed the 
victory for Ontario Christian (7-9, 4-2) with two free throws with nine seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague boys' games: 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel Redlands 68, Liberty Christian 65 -- Liberty Christian (7-10, 
2-1) led by four in the final quarter but was then outscored, 9-2. MARTIN

QUARTER HORSES; REFRIGERATOR WINS HIS SECOND TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Refrigerator, who in December became only the second horse to win consecutive 
runnings of the Champion of Champions, was chosen as 1993 World Champion 
Running Quarter Horse in voting announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerator, who won all five of his starts in 1993, was also voted the 
champion aged horse and champion aged gelding, titles he also won in 1992. He 
is the first horse to win two World Champion titles since Dash For Cash, who 
won the 1976 and 1977 Champion of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Jim Helzer of Arlington, Tex., Refrigerator was trained in California 
by trainer of the year Blane Schvaneveldt of Cypress. At Los Alamitos, 
Refrigerator won the Los Alamitos Championship in September, the Breeders 
Championship Classic in November and the Champion of Champions in December. His 
victory in the 440-yard Champion of Champions increased Refrigerator's career 
earnings to $1,948,257, the highest in quarter horse racing history. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Quarter Horse Assn.'s 58-member Racing Committee and seven 
members of the media voted on the year-end champions. Of the 10 champions in 
1993, eight raced at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 A Classic Dash, who won the Dash For Cash and All American futurities, was 
voted champion 2-year-old colt and overall 2-year-old champion. Jumping Tac 
Flash, the only horse to beat A Classic Dash, was voted champion 2-year-old 
filly. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Down Dash was voted champion 3-year-old filly and was a surprise winner 
of the overall 3-year-old championship. Royal Down Dash made four starts at Los 
Alamitos last summer and was never better than third. 
</P>
<P>
 Champion aged mare Sound Dash won the Horsemen's Quarter Horse Racing Assn. 
Championship at Los Alamitos in October. Champion aged stallion Six To Five won 
three stakes in New Mexico last summer and was later third to Refrigerator in 
the Breeders Championship Classic. Griswold, who won three 870-yard stakes at 
Los Alamitos, was voted champion distance horse for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Allred, a 50% owner of Los Alamitos, was voted owner and breeder of the 
year. G.R. Carter was voted the leading rider.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE VICTIMS SWARM HOME REPAIR STORES; 
REBUILDING: HIGH ON THE LIST OF ITEMS NEEDED ARE WATER HEATERS, PLYWOOD AND 
PLASTIC SHEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF PRUGH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I hate California with all my guts!" declared Susanne Dickerson, pushing a 
shopping cart filled with rolls of plastic sheeting out of a Home Depot store 
in Canoga Park. "I've had it!" 
</P>
<P>
 And the plastic sheeting was going to help her escape. 
</P>
<P>
 If she and her husband were going to move, they would first have to sell their 
earthquake-battered house in Woodland Hills. And to sell it, they would have to 
fix it. 
</P>
<P>
 So here was Dickerson, 47, among the hordes Saturday swarming to Home Depots, 
HomeBase Warehouses, hardware shops, building supply stores and lumberyards -- 
all the fix-it-yourself places. 
</P>
<P>
 The plastic was a hot item on this first weekend day since the quake, what 
with rain a possibility. Also high on shopping lists were water heaters costing 
$111 to $379, the small flexible pipes that attach to them at $6, 4-by-8-foot 
sheets of plywood, plumbing tape, roofing supplies, 2-by-4s, shovels, brooms 
and trash barrels. 
</P>
<P>
 David Silvers, 73, of Tarzana was fixing it himself so he could stay, not 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love California -- absolutely love it," he said, carting away a 50-gallon 
water heater. "I've loved it from the minute I first saw it when I spent my 
first Army furlough here." 
</P>
<P>
 He smiled. "It was December of 1942," said the native New Yorker. "It was 85 
degrees, and people were swimming ." 
</P>
<P>
 A contemporary, Mort Hirsch of Northridge, bought another of the hundreds of 
water heaters that now arrive daily by the truckload. The retailers are barely 
able to keep up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where else can you go?" he asked. "Move back to Indiana? And let my house 
float down the river?" 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's quests for rebuilding -- both structures and quake-damaged psyches 
-- capped an especially tortuous week for the Home Depot store's assistant 
manager, Matt Salerno, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three days before the earthquake, Salerno had been transferred to Canoga 
Park, moving from Orlando, Fla., with his wife, Betty, and their two small 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Florida looks beautiful right now," said Salerno, who commutes from Simi 
Valley. "This quake scared the . . . out of me. My 3-year-old keeps saying: 'I 
don't like those shakers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, this Home Depot on Roscoe Boulevard resembled Grand Central 
Station almost from the moment the doors opened at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a groundswell of first-time do-it-yourselfers, management offered 
classes in subjects such as installing water heaters, basic electrical repair, 
repairing stucco block walls, basic plumbing and pipe repair, repairing 
interior walls -- and preparing for an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 By 9 a.m., the parking lot overflowed and shoppers jammed the aisles inside -- 
with helpful clerks in orange aprons serving as traffic cops -- amid a constant 
cacophony of paging over loudspeakers: 
</P>
<P>
 "Will somebody in building materials please call 305?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I need a truck driver! Call 204!" 
</P>
<P>
 At a coin telephone, a customer needing dimensions tells someone on the other 
end: "Measure it from the center of the door handle to the edge of the door. It 
should be about 3 1/4 inches." 
</P>
<P>
 Some in management at the Home Depot store and at a HomeBase a few blocks away 
said they have heard reports of price-gouging by some competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a run on ($6) flex pipes for water heaters," said Richard 
Jerkovich, manager of the HomeBase outlet. "And there were scalpers outside 
yesterday, selling them for $20 apiece."' 
</P>
<P>
 Water heaters, too, sold quickly, Jerkovich said. The 55 available at 5 p.m. 
Friday rapidly diminished: "By 6 o'clock, we had only four left." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile at Home Depot, the day's first class -- in how to install a water 
heater -- attracted just one pupil. Tracy Stine, 41, of Woodland Hills sat in 
portable bleachers as Darrin Rolls showed her how to anchor a heater firmly to 
a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to learn," said Stine, an escrow officer, "because I can't find 
any contractors." 
</P>
<P>
 Ethel Crown, 60, a HomeBase shopper from Reseda, brought a friend to help her 
install the water heater she purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Into each life a little rain must fall," she said philosophically, her friend 
wheeling the heater onto a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Michigan, we lived in fear of tornadoes," she said. "There's no place that 
is paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, climbing into the truck, she waved and smiled and shouted: "If God loves 
California, tell him not to rock the baby!"

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; BACK IN BUSINESS, BETTER THAN EVER; SAVAGED BY 
1987 QUAKE, WHITTIER'S UPTOWN IS REBUILT ON SOLID FOUNDATION OF HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the battered cities of the San Fernando Valley survey the rubble left by 
Monday's earthquake, they may find inspiration and hope by looking to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago a 5.9 earthquake similarly battered the city of Whittier, 
destroying or severely damaging more than 100 businesses in the central 
business district. At the time it seemed to many people that the heart of the 
city, known as Uptown, would never rise again. Over the preceding years, it had 
begun sliding into lethargy and disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the Uptown district is booming with new businesses, new opportunities, 
new attitudes. People who live and work there now mark time "B.E." and "A.E." 
-- Before Earthquake and After Earthquake. And though it may seem improbable to 
people who are just now realizing how fundamentally their lives have been 
changed by Monday's earthquake, most people in Whittier's downtown business 
district seem to agree that A.E. is better. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no one who has survived a massive earthquake would argue that such 
temblors are good things, or that rebuilding is easy. But Whittier residents 
such as Lane Langford know that sometimes progress can arise from tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I know what they (people in the earthquake areas) are feeling right 
now," said Langford, whose bookstore on Greenleaf Avenue was badly damaged by 
the 1987 earthquake. "I remember I was angry, angry that something like that 
could threaten my life and my livelihood. But I was determined to pull out of 
it. I think those people have the right spirit, the right attitude, to do the 
same thing. They can come back. It's not an easy task, but it can be done. I 
know. It can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier was founded in 1887 by members of the Society of Friends (commonly 
known as Quakers) and named after poet John Greenleaf Whittier, a Quaker. From 
the beginning the downtown section of town along Greenleaf Avenue -- called 
Uptown because it was up a hill from the railroad station -- was the commercial 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the years and months leading up to the abrupt change from Whittier B.E. 
to Whittier A.E., the Uptown business district in this city of 77,000 -- the 
community where Richard Nixon went to college and later opened his first law 
firm -- was going through a decline common to many small town centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Uptown shoppers were heading out to the new malls, following the major 
stores -- Woolworth, J.C. Penney, Montgomery Ward -- that had long since left 
Uptown. Commercial lease rates were dropping, and buildings were being bought 
by absentee landlords who often appeared to hate spending a dime on 
maintenance. More vacant storefronts were appearing. The city's once-grand 
movie palace, the Wardman Theater, had become a porno house. 
</P>
<P>
 Uptown was not yet a slum. There were still stores and offices where people 
were making their livings, and Greenleaf Avenue was still lined with ficus 
trees. But the area was tired, old-fashioned, set in its ways. At night it was 
like a ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 5 p.m. this place rolled up the sidewalks -- tight," said Casey Hazelton, 
executive director of the Whittier Uptown Assn. "You could have shot a 
cannonball down Greenleaf Avenue and not hit a soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at 7:42 a.m. on Oct. 1, 1987, the magnitude 5.9 temblor hit -- the most 
powerful in the Los Angeles area since the Sylmar earthquake 16 years earlier. 
Three days later, a 5.4 aftershock hit the area. The quake claimed eight lives 
in Southern California, more than 200 people were injured and damage was set at 
about $358 million. No one died in Whittier, but about 60 people were treated 
for injuries at a hospital. About 5,000 homes and businesses suffered 
substantial damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit was the 52-block Uptown area. When the smoke and dust cleared, 34 
buildings housing 78 businesses had been destroyed or had to be demolished; 23 
buildings housing 61 businesses suffered severe damage.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was at home about three miles away when it hit," recalled Dale Huckfeldt, 
71, whose family had owned Huckfeldt's Furniture Store on Greenleaf Avenue for 
half a century. "I remember thinking: 'Oh, this isn't so bad.' So I stayed 
around and helped my wife pick up the house a little bit and then I figured I'd 
drive down to check on the store. The closer I got the more I said, 'Uh oh.' 
When I got to my store my stomach was rolling, my heart was sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave McCoy, who was completing his purchase of Sargent's sporting goods store 
on Greenleaf that very day, said of the Uptown area: "It looked like a bomb had 
gone off." 
</P>
<P>
 As the fear and shock wore off, the biggest question on everyone's mind was: 
"Should we stay?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was not an easy decision. Uptown was a wreck. And there was more than a 
little cynical snickering when the Whittier Chamber of Commerce draped a banner 
near the ruins that said: "Whittier: It'll Be Better Than Ever!" 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, right, people said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as bookstore owner Langford put it: "The earthquake separated the wheat 
from the chaff." 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake about 50 Uptown businesses closed or relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know what we were going to do," Huckfeldt said. "I was 67, about at 
the age when a lot of people retire. But finally my wife told me: 'You're never 
gonna be happy to just sit and watch the boob tube. Let's do it.' So we did." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people said: 'Well, this is what we've been dealt, so let's go make 
it better,' " McCoy recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage was so severe that Whittier police kept the area cordoned off for 30 
days, to guard against more collapses and to allow for demolition of 
structurally damaged buildings. To keep businesses open while the rubble was 
cleared, the Uptown Assn. set up trailers in city parking lots to house their 
shops. Grants and low-cost loans poured in from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and 
the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 One important Uptown recovery program was as simple and mundane as sheets of 
plywood. To screen off ugly lots left vacant when buildings were demolished, 
brightly colored plywood walls were put up. The walls may sound insignificant, 
but Whittier residents agree that they had an important psychological effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody in Whittier will even pretend that the rebuilding process was all 
sweetness and light. In damaged residential areas many homeowners, faced with 
extensive home repairs, sold out to developers who put up apartment buildings 
over howls of protest from neighbors. And in Uptown, the cost of structural 
repairs or rebuilding hit some business owners hard. Huckfeldt had to take out 
a loan on his Whittier home to augment a 4% low-interest government 
reconstruction loan. He will be 99 years old when his store is once again paid 
off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, city officials, Uptown Assn. and Chamber of Commerce members and 
citizens tried to work out a 30-year plan for Uptown's future. There were 
seemingly endless meetings, endless proposals, endless arguments over 
stultifying and tedious details. 
</P>
<P>
 But out of it all a plan emerged to restore Uptown's former small-town charm, 
to upgrade building fronts, to attract night life to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had to be patient because it took a long, long time," Langford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, it got done. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like the signs said," said Hank Cunningham, Whittier's assistant 
city manager, who oversaw the city government role in the Uptown rebuilding 
process. "Today it's better than ever. Six years ago, who ever would have 
guessed it was possible?" 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers tell part of the story. Of the 23 Uptown commercial buildings that 
were badly damaged, 22 have been repaired; buildings now sit on 19 of the 34 
lots. Retail sales exceed pre-earthquake levels. 
</P>
<P>
 New businesses, attracted by the success of old businesses, have moved in. 
There are farmers markets, sidewalk cafes, "beat-style" coffee shops, half a 
dozen art galleries and trendy restaurants. The theater that once was devoted 
to grainy porno movies is now a three-screen, first-run theater done up in Art 
Deco style. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoot a cannonball down Greenleaf Avenue at 5 p.m., or 9 p.m., and there would 
be heavy casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 The small-town charm is back, too; Hollywood says so. When producers of the TV 
show "The Wonder Years" needed a location for a small, all-American downtown 
for the show's final episode, they came to Uptown Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really has come along, hasn't it?" said Peggy Tullius as she served tea 
and espresso at Past Tyme, her newly opened combination tearoom, gift shop and 
coffee bar in a Greenleaf Avenue building that had been gutted by the 
earthquake. "I always knew it would come back, but I never knew it would come 
back this charmingly." 
</P>
<P>
 "If a community wants it bad enough they can do it," said the Uptown Assn.'s 
Hazelton. "Through a disaster you're going to find the best in people. The 
strength comes out, the desire to see their community survive. It might have 
been easier to pull up stakes, but they chose to stick it out. Now when I look 
at it, it seems like just short of a miracle."

 The big voice of Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg boomed through the small 
auditorium during Saturday's meeting of the city's Emergency Operations Board, 
which is coordinating earthquake disaster operations. Insistent, impatient, she 
demanded answers to questions asked by her Hollywood constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the department heads on the board seemed seemed unhappy with Goldberg 
and her constituents. Why didn't they follow procedures, these new homeless 
living in parking lot encampments? Couldn't they have called the proper city 
agency instead of Goldberg? The meeting became tense until Mayor Richard 
Riordan got everyone laughing. "If I lived in Hollywood, I'd call Jackie 
first," he said, obviously convinced that the councilwoman knows how to get 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Another scene from the same meeting: A transportation official reported that 
the program to ease traffic jams will be announced next week when plans are 
completed. No, said Riordan, we can't wait. The people need information before 
they go to work Monday. "I think we should do it tomorrow," he snapped. He said 
Sunday would be ideal because U.S. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena 
would be in town and could preside at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 This is how Riordan played it at the meeting. In handling Goldberg's barrage 
of questions, he smoothed rough edges and gently steered the L.A. team away 
from the feuds and turf wars that have damaged other disaster relief efforts. 
In pushing up the transportation plan, he was performing what he considers his 
main role in the current crisis, "to get people off their asses." 
</P>
<P>
 Running meetings, cheering up the homeless, talking to President Clinton, 
working with Gov. Pete Wilson, snapping out orders, persuading enemies to sit 
down together, Riordan has given Los Angeles far more energetic and aggressive 
leadership than we had during the bleak and confusing days of the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency board is a good illustration of the change in leadership since 
the days when the riot-torn city was led by two burned-out, feuding men, Mayor 
Tom Bradley and Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. The board is composed of the heads 
of key departments, such as Water and Power, Public Works, Fire and Police. In 
theory the panel is supposed to make sure the city departments are working 
efficiently -- and together. But in the past it has functioned as a low-level 
debating club. Veteran City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky remembers attending 
meetings during the riots when a deputy police chief, rather than Gates, 
presided and Mayor Bradley was represented by a deputy. "There was chaos and 
disarray," he said. "There was no leadership in that room." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the day of the earthquake, however, Police Chief Willie L. Williams has 
presided over every meeting and Riordan has been at his side. "These two people 
have made the difference," Yaroslavsky said. "We all know the tension between 
Bradley and Gates, the difficulty they had sitting next to each other. Williams 
and Riordan get along fine. Williams is an extreme professional. He doesn't 
tolerate a lot of side comment or humor, he moves the meeting along. The 
mayor's not grandstanding. There is mutual respect between the mayor and the 
department heads. It's the bureaucrats who can make you or break you and I 
think the mayor has inspired confidence in them and earned their respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan took charge of the emergency team at the beginning. After he was 
awakened by the quake, he put on pants and a sweat shirt and drove Downtown 
from his Brentwood home in his Ford Explorer, stopping at the Wilshire Division 
police station. 
</P>
<P>
 The first member of his staff on duty was Geoffrey L. Garfield, assistant 
deputy mayor for public safety, who lives in a Bunker Hill apartment not far 
from City Hall. Garfield headed to the Emergency Operations Center in the City 
Hall East basement. Communications Director David Novak soon joined them. Novak 
called Riordan, told him how to get to the hard-to-find emergency center and 
went to work with Garfield on an emergency proclamation for the mayor to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan arrived at 5:30 a.m., talked to Williams, who was heading in from his 
San Fernando Valley home, and took charge of the emergency center. One of his 
first moves upon arriving was to order 250 breakfasts from his Downtown 
restaurant, the Pantry, to be brought to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:35 a.m., President Clinton called, and said he was sending out Pena, 
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros and James Lee Witt, head 
of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the days that followed, I watched a Riordan, who was far different than the 
nervous candidate I had covered during the mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigning is not his game. What he's good at is running things, solving 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw an example of that Friday. I encountered him, press secretary Annette 
Castro and FEMA boss Witt leaving The Times, where they had met with the 
paper's editors. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan looked like a man in charge, not at all like he did during the 
campaign for mayor. Then, and through much of his six months on the job, he 
seemed overly cautious and ill at ease. His verbal gaffes mounted. During the 
fires, for example, he was criticized, even ridiculed, for sounding provincial 
when he said he was happy the flames missed L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, he walked briskly across 1st Street toward City Hall, his coat 
open. You need a key to get into the 1st Street entrance and neither Castro nor 
the mayor had one. While we waited for someone leaving the building to open the 
door, I asked Riordan how he was doing. "I can't believe I'm not getting 
tired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside his office, there was a crisis. A 4 p.m. meeting between Los Angeles 
Unified School District officials and teachers union chiefs had blown up. Old 
enmities had interfered with what should have been an urgent session on getting 
the schools operating again. Riordan hit the phone, arranging for the federal 
government to help the district inspect damaged school sites and for the 
teachers and administrators to try harder to work together on the reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also spent considerable time meeting with state and federal officials. 
On Thursday, after a meeting at Caltrans, he impulsively walked down the street 
to Wilson's office and talked to him about delays in getting traffic moving. 
Riordan emerged from the meeting with the job of being the unofficial 
coordinator of local transportation planning. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, he worked on strengthening his relationship with Pena. 
Riordan's close friend, Nancy Daly, had the mayor and Pena over for dinner. 
"Just the three of us," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even his most severe critic on the City Council, Mark Ridley-Thomas, was 
supportive. "I think the mayor is finding out what government is really about, 
what it really has to do," he said. Ridley-Thomas said, "I think he is really 
trying" to be a mayor who represents all parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The next few months will be tough. The disastrous consequences of the 
earthquake will no doubt shape the rest of his term. But Riordan emerged from 
the first week of his test with a stronger grip on City Hall -- and on the city 
-- than before.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; EMERGENCIES ROUTINE FOR VOLUNTEER MEDICAL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 39-member emergency medical team from New Mexico had barely set up shop -- 
four tents outside a quake-damaged medical building in Canoga Park -- when the 
patients started showing up at noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a hour, the waiting room was full: with pregnant women, sick babies, 
stressed-out grandparents and a National Guardsman with an asthma attack so 
acute he had to be taken away in an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of it was fairly routine medical stuff for the team of five doctors, 12 
nurses, 12 paramedics and other emergency medical specialists, hardened 
veterans of disaster scenes from the Virgin Islands to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can handle anything from headaches to heart attacks," said John Gaffney, 
an administrator at the University of New Mexico and one of the team's leaders. 
"We expect just about anything. That is what disaster medicine is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 No one gets a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew, organized by the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and 
dispatched by federal health authorities, is part of the national disaster 
medical system. Their disaster work began in 1989, when they were dispatched to 
the Virgin Islands in the wake of Hurricane Hugo, and included visits in 1992 
to Miami to assist victims of Hurricane Andrew, and Hawaii after Hurricane 
Iniki. 
</P>
<P>
 The MASH-like unit of civilian volunteers arrived at March Air Force Base on 
Friday night. They were bused to the site in Canoga Park, at Gault Street and 
Remmet Avenue, and set up the tents. 
</P>
<P>
 The team carries its own water purifier, which can operate on solar power if 
utilities are out, and stockpiles of food and other supplies. One team member 
is a licensed pharmacist and travels with a portable pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to be able to go anywhere and set up without having to 
increase the drain on the local resources any more than we have to. Every 
member of the team is prepared to live in whatever austere environment they 
send us to," Gaffney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each member of the team had a bedroll in case they have to sleep in one of the 
tents, which had been set up in a parking lot next to the county's Canoga Park 
Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the first patients they saw Saturday had been living in parks or 
shelters since Monday and were receiving their first medical attention since 
the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials had spread word that the clinic was open by passing 
out flyers, in English and Spanish, in parks and shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 One young family arrived with four of the five people badly in need of medical 
attention. The mother, whose name was not released, was pregnant and feeling 
contractions every 20 minutes. Her husband appeared to have broken his hand. He 
told the medics he had fallen Monday morning when he and his family were 
scrambling for safety. His hand was badly swollen and his fingers were bent at 
odd angles. Two of their toddlers were running high temperatures, had sore 
throats and stuffy noses. They had been living in a nearby park since the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Another early patient, Rosa Lopez, a grandmother, was frightened badly during 
the earthquake, and had to be driven to the field clinic by a friend. Her face 
drawn by tension, her eyes still darting about nervously as if she expected 
another earthquake, Lopez said she hoped to get something for "high blood 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 A little while later, a woman showed up with a baby with a bad case of 
chickenpox. After a quick examination, the nurses determined that the 
chickenpox was in its late stages and not much of a threat to be contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the spread of chickenpox is one of the biggest fears of county health 
authorities. Although most adults and children have had it, it is especially 
dangerous to pregnant women because it can travel through the mother to the 
fetus, or be especially virulent if it attacks a newborn infant. The nurses 
kept the baby with chickenpox away from the three pregnant women who had shown 
up during the first hour. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went: a host of ailments, but nothing extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff McBrayer, a paramedic from Albuquerque, said: "Usually after the first 
few days the major casualties have been dealt with, and then it's all the 
routine stuff. People have lost their medications, they can't get access to 
things. Sick kids, especially. That's what we see the most." 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials said the New Mexico team meets a big need. With hospitals 
stretched to the maximum, particularly those in the west San Fernando Valley, 
emergency workers hoped that patients with less than acute medical needs would 
visit the clinic first. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great," Los Angeles City Fire Capt. Lawrence Mayer said after a tour. 
"People who leave here and (are sent) to a hospital would have gone anyway. If 
they come here first and get treated, (many) won't need to go to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 County health authorities appeared to be breathing a sigh of relief over 
reports that -- so far, at least -- there had not been any outbreaks of 
contagious disease among the thousands of homeless earthquake victims who have 
moved into tents and emergency shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 With the county in the throes of a tuberculosis epidemic and the worst flu 
outbreak in years, concerns had been raised about the spread of disease. 
Chickenpox is especially worrisome for county health officials because cold, 
damp winters are when it is at its worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that it's inevitable that if children go into these crowded 
situations this time of year, some of them are going to have chickenpox," said 
Dr. Shirley Fannin, a county disease control administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin said that she did not consider the spread of tuberculosis a serious 
threat because most TB cases are concentrated in the central part of Los 
Angeles County and most of the quake victims are in the northwest Valley. 
Still, county health workers were trying to keep track of each tuberculosis 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Health workers said two families with small babies suffering from chickenpox 
had been turned away from a large tent city for quake victims set up at Canoga 
Park High School. Both families then found friends to stay with, according to 
Red Cross workers.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; NO SINGLE IMAGE OR STORY CAN PORTRAY THE 
DEVASTATION; SNAPSHOTS: SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF DISASTER -- AND PEOPLE'S RESPONSE 
TO IT -- VARY FROM TRAGEDY TO HUMOR. 
</P>

<P>
 These are the sights and sounds of disaster: 
</P>
<P>
 A father begging rescue workers in Sherman Oaks to please not leave his son's 
body under the rubble of his hillside house overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3-year-old girl sitting in a rusty wagon in her pajamas, surveying the 
still-smoking ruin of her family's mobile home in Sylmar. "I don't have a bed 
anymore, mom," she said over the dull roar of an open gas main flaming up like 
a Roman candle just yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Samaritans rescuing neighbors trapped in apartment buildings that had 
folded in on themselves like popup books. "I'm not going down," said a woman, 
terrified of heights, as she surveyed the precarious escape from her balcony, 
down a flimsy ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes you are!" barked a man she had never seen before. And she did. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very human to try to distill cataclysmic events into a single, searing, 
defining image. But this earthquake was so fickle in its choice of victims and 
so erratic in its effects that no image could possibly capture all the tragedy 
and death, generosity and goodness, and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each event tells its own story, on its own terms. All you can do is let the 
images parade through the mind, one after another, reciting their tales like 
characters in some medieval play. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing you thought of as you drove around the San Fernando Valley 
last week was that when the world is over they will probably board it up with 
plywood and drape the whole thing in police tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Plywood was the great equalizer. It covered the shattered tinted windows of 
upscale athletic clubs in Chatsworth as well as little carnicerias in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was so much tape strewn across intersections that the Valley looked 
like a Christo exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting it from everyone we can," Los Angeles Police Officer Chris 
Mandala said outside the Northridge Fashion Center, where a parking lot and 
part of the Bullocks store had collapsed. So far, unlike bottled water in some 
areas, supplies were holding up. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall was completely closed off by tape. Peering into the Bullocks store, 
where the sign now reads "Bullo," reminds one of the old Visible Man models. 
The veins and nerves and lymph nodes of the building were exposed. Racks of 
women's clothes were perched perilously over an open canyon of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the mall, the marquees of many of the stores were still lighted. There 
was the loud hum of electricity in the air, futilely pumping life into the 
place, like a heart that continues to beat even after the head has been 
severed. 
</P>
<P>
 At Gary's Tux Shop, one of the well-dressed mannequins lay on its back while 
the others stood alertly and oblivious, resembling party-goers determined to 
ignore the bad manners of a guest passed out on the couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Another common sight was toppled brick walls, lying in little heaps as if a 
child playing with his Legos had suddenly lost patience and knocked them over. 
Secrets were exposed to the passing world: an untrimmed bush or dirty pool 
behind a $400,000 house. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many people seemed to need to give the quake a personality. A man in a bar on 
Ventura Boulevard said it was like having someone come in and rearrange your 
furniture. "I want it over here," the man said, gesturing. "No, I think it 
would be better over on this side of the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Another man said it was odd the way the quake unearthed portions of his past 
life. After the shaking stopped, he found the stub of a 1986 opening day 
Dodgers ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did I save this?" he asked himself absently. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveying the damage, you are left with the feeling that the quake had done 
far more than was visible. Also shaken was our faith in the complexity and 
well-ordered nature of modern cities. Environmental impact reports, City 
Council meetings, seismic studies -- all the fine bureaucratic machinery could 
not tame the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
 You can drive for blocks past neatly laid out neighborhoods under spreading 
ash trees, and the lulling sense of the familiar and safe begins to creep in. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you come upon a block of apartment buildings in Sherman Oaks that look 
like some large animal had raked their facades. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Owens, the manager of the Woodman Apartments, leaned against her car and 
tried to warn people against going inside the building, the front of which was 
cracked in scores of places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saying it's not a good idea," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get our stuff," a man with blond hair persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, similar scenes were being acted out at the Jeri Manor, 
where the lobby appeared to have collapsed, and at the Oakwood Apartments, 
where a long line of residents were being ushered into the building one at a 
time to retrieve whatever they could carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Many events that would have topped the news on any other day went unremarked 
on in this disaster. Roundly ignored, three wood-frame houses and a four-unit 
apartment building in the 200 block of Hager Street in San Fernando went up in 
smoke. Eleven members and several generations of the Garcia family were left 
homeless. Things would have been worse but for the efforts of a volunteer fire 
crew led by Joseph Ortiz, who wore his fire hat at a cocky angle and tried to 
protect his broken arm by hiding his hand inside his long-sleeved shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming upon the rare open store, you are tempted to wander in, even if it's 
just a tae kwon do studio where a woman is screaming in the dark on the phone. 
Shops are, in some ways, the most comforting places we have, because they are 
where we go to conduct the business of life. So we wander in, buying nothing, 
just to feel the sense of purpose that comes with shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as the hours passed, there were the slowly returning sounds and smells 
of normalcy. The smell of baked goods as a Coco's restaurant prepared to 
reopen. And the surest sound of recovery, when the radio news began to sound 
repetitive and your fingers twitched to turn the station for the first time in 
24 hours. Field reporters begin doing stories about the outdoor barbecues in 
the parks, where thousands gathered to wait out the aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you having?" one reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ribs and carne asada ," replied a man with a Spanish accent. 
</P>
<P>
 " Carne asada ?" the reporter repeated, making sure he got this critical 
information down right. 
</P>
<P>
 The camps began to take on the look of permanency. Portable toilets were 
brought in and stacks of firewood appeared near the makeshift home sites. This 
disaster would not be over soon. At a park on Winnetka Avenue, young men in 
sleeveless T-shirts chose up teams for a soccer game, using a Laker cap and an 
old jacket to mark off the goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Gonzalez, 33, the manager of the heavily damaged Keswick Apartments, had 
brought most of her tenants with her to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything left," she said. She and some of the other women washed 
up after lunch Tuesday while a group of children wandered around. Everybody was 
pitching in, but that wasn't enough for Barbara Cowart, 47, sprawled on a 
blanket under the afternoon sun. She had moved to Los Angeles three months ago 
from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between the shaking and the desert, I'll take the desert," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was thinking of going back, but she was already adapting to the West Coast 
lifestyle. "If I stay here I'm going to buy plastic plates and cups. If they 
fall out, at least they bounce," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the Valley at night was to rediscover dark. On Monday night, much of it 
was Mojave Desert dark, hall closet dark, River Styx dark. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday night, many street lights and traffic lights were on and Ventura 
Boulevard began to return to life. The Insomnia Cafe in Sherman Oaks was open 
for business, serving double cappuccinos at $2.50 each out on the sidewalk, 
while a generator hummed in the background. They had already served 14 National 
Guard troops and several firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the oasis in the middle of the desert," said Scott Gatewood, who was 
serving up the drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Hyun, a photographer on the television show "SeaQuest," wandered in with 
a flashlight strapped to his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city should keep the electricity off all the time," he said. "The 
city became a village." 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Walker, a guitarist in an outfit called Girl Jesus, which she described 
as a Middle Eastern/industrial/gothic/thrash band, struck up her guitar on the 
sidewalk and did a pained version of "Knockin' on Heaven's Door."  
</P>
<P>
 Showing that lust hardly ever takes a holiday, just about the only other 
businesses braving the night were those catering to sexual tastes. At Le Sex 
Shoppe in Studio City, Gerardo Cuevas, 21, sat watching television alone. 
"Usually by this time I have five videos sold," he said. It was about 10 p.m. 
"I haven't sold one." 
</P>
<P>
 As the 11 p.m. curfew approached, upscale quake refugees straggled into 
Residuals, a bar in Studio City that attracts film industry people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take Phil down there," said Mark Robertson, a man in a billed cap who tended 
bar, "he just couldn't take any more tremors. He was feeling tremors that 
weren't there." 
</P>
<P>
 So Phil was throwing darts, focusing as intently on the small cork board as on 
a law school exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Residuals was running out of supplies, but nobody was ready to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good seeing you," said a man, walking in. "In fact, it's good seeing 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew came and went, but nobody left. Robertson kept serving drinks, Phil 
kept throwing darts. From time to time, Robertson announced it was last call. 
Nobody paid him the slightest attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're making it hard on me," he sighed. "I can understand them not wanting 
to go home tonight."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; OFFICIALS IN VENTURA COUNTY IGNORE THEIR OWN 
PROBLEMS TO AID OTHERS; DISASTER: THE 6.6. JOLT WAS THE START OF A SELFLESS AND 
HECTIC WEEK. A FILLMORE COUNCILMAN RELUCTANTLY GIVES THE ORDER TO RAZE BADLY 
DAMAGED HOMES, INCLUDING HIS OWN.

<P>
 Darkness. Then, abruptly, a jolt. A crash. Rumbling, screaming, shattering, 
tumbling. Panic. And again, darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone before dawn Monday in a hilltop parking lot in Simi Valley, nighttime 
security guard Mike Tam watched the shuddering earth heave through the San 
Fernando Valley and on toward Ventura County. One by one, lights flared and 
went dim as transformers blew. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hell of a show," Tam said. "I could have used my surfboard up there 
on that ridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Across Ventura County in Fillmore, Roger Campbell was not so sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell is a city councilman. A deputy fire chief. And Fillmore's only 
emergency medical technician. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the trembling stopped, he sprang into action. Jumping into his 
firefighter's boots, stashed as always by his bedside, Campbell stumbled 
through the house, grabbing shoes for his family and clearing a path through 
the rubble. He ripped the front door off its hinges and hurried his wife and 
two teen-age children outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the dark, Campbell had an inkling that the quake had shoved his 
90-year-old house off its foundation. But when he dashed off to the fire 
station at 4:40 a.m., he shelved all thoughts of his personal tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was the start of a selfless -- and hectic -- week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've mainly been working on solving other people's problems," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 So have Julie Merich and Nan Thompson, emergency room nurses at Simi Valley 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 They were nearing the end of their graveyard shift Monday, helping physician 
Pam Biren deal with two patients who had just come for aid when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceiling tiles smashed to the floor. The big sliding glass door exploded. 
Medicine and supplies tumbled off shelves. Sugary-smelling slicks of liquid 
Tylenol and Motrin oozed across the floor -- yellow and red pools snaking 
around the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as it started, we looked at each other and said, 'Earthquake. Big 
earthquake.' Then we ran to the doorway," Merich said.  
</P>
<P>
 As the shaking subsided, Biren ran to check on the patients. Then, fearful 
that the whole building would collapse, the three emergency room staffers 
shuttled their two patients -- a man with a sore back and an asthmatic woman -- 
out the door. Merich guided them to the parking lot and sat them down in the 
chill, still darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone and in clusters, huddled under blankets or shuffling in slippers, the 
wounded, the scared and the dazed began to arrive within 10 minutes of the 
fearsome jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Most were bleeding from cuts, suffered as they tripped through rubble-filled 
hallways or lay stunned under fallen objects. A few had more serious injuries 
-- fractures, chest pains, panic attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 As her watch inched toward 5 a.m., Thompson held a flashlight in the hospital 
parking lot while Biren stitched up a gash on a young man's face. 
</P>
<P>
 With that first, nerve-racking operation, they launched a primitive, open-air 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of off-duty doctors and nurses, some from neighboring cities, came by 
in sweats and sneakers to offer their services. They quickly set up an assembly 
line to suture wounds in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the hospital's emergency generator had kicked in immediately after 
the quake, no one wanted to go back into the building. Not with ceiling tiles 
on the floor and aftershocks on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like we took care of at least 50 or 60 people by flashlight," Merich 
said. "I had them lined up on the curb. I was running around like a chicken 
with my head cut off." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell in Fillmore and Merich in Simi Valley were among the first to respond 
to the earthquake that rocked Southern California with horrific force at 4:31 
a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was centered in Northridge, the magnitude 6.6 quake sent 
devastating tremors throughout Ventura County, shattering lives in Fillmore and 
Simi Valley and wrecking buildings in Moorpark and Thousand Oaks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The force of the quake bounced Larry Perillo -- a 6-foot, 2-inch, 280-pound 
quality control worker -- clear out of his bed in Simi Valley. He flipped in 
the air, landed face-down and hit his head on a table, leaving him bruised and 
disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away in northeastern Thousand Oaks, Anne Weidenweber was jolted 
awake and tried to warn her husband that the heavy mirror behind their bed 
could come flying down on top of them. But he could not hear her shriek -- just 
then, the mantle and chimney came plunging down, bricks cascading in a 
thunderous crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And in a Vons supermarket in Simi Valley, Robert Moss found himself pinned in 
an aisle when the quake toppled a huge Coca-Cola display he was stocking. It 
took him 90 minutes to extricate himself and slither around the debris to 
freedom, using the light on his pager to guide him down the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the noise and destruction, Mary Beth Wolford, superintendent of the 
Simi Valley Unified School District, slumbered -- tucked into a comfortable bed 
in a guest room at a friend's house in Sun City West, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 But her oblivion ended with a scare almost as frightening as the quake. 
Wolford awoke to a television news account of the disaster, featuring an 
interview with a Simi Valley resident. Trembling, he described the fear. The 
chaos. The wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The personal side of me was saying, 'I'm glad I wasn't there at 4:31 a.m.,' 
but the professional side was saying, 'What a lousy day to be gone,' " Wolford 
said. "The more I heard, the worse I felt." 
</P>
<P>
 Frantic to return and investigate the damage to her schools, Wolford scrambled 
to get a ticket -- any ticket -- to Southern California. When she finally got 
aboard a flight to Burbank, she found it filled with other nail-biting 
travelers desperately anxious about whether their homes, businesses and 
relatives had survived the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolford arrived in Simi Valley about 3:30 p.m., took one look at the broken 
glass littering her living room, and headed straight out on a tour of the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them looked bad. And three -- Township Elementary School, Valley View 
Junior High and Simi Valley High -- looked downright dangerous. Wolford's 
succinct assessment: "It was a total mess." 
</P>
<P>
 As Tuesday dawned in Fillmore, Campbell still had no clue about the 
earthquake's total punch. He had heard vague rumors about crumbled freeways, 
collapsed apartment buildings, crushed bodies. He knew the epicenter was 
somewhere in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, he didn't know much. And he didn't much care. 
</P>
<P>
 Every last ounce of Campbell's energy was focused on his city, its three 
square miles of territory and its 13,000 anxious residents. 
</P>
<P>
 And he had more than enough to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Fillmore's downtown district was destroyed. Bricks were scattered, 
helter-skelter, across cracked streets. Homes had crumpled like paper. Hundreds 
of people had jammed into a makeshift shelter at the San Cayetano Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Like scores of other firefighters and city officials, Campbell was working 
frantically. On barely two hours of sleep, he was coordinating the response to 
Fillmore's trauma. His crew was supervising building inspections, organizing 
the shelter, preparing an ordinance declaring a local state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 No time to listen to the radio. No place to plug in a television set. No idea 
where to buy a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to know what was going on in my own town, and I didn't pay attention 
to anything else," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also didn't pay attention to his own family's plight, focusing instead on 
those worse off. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, around noon, he managed to wrangle a few minutes break from his post 
at the command center. He rushed to his home -- just three blocks away -- and 
saw, for the first time, the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The lime green, two-story house that he had lived in for more than 20 years 
was tilted several degrees to the west. Cockeyed and slumping, it looked as 
though it were about to collapse. But despite the clear danger, dozens of 
Campbell's friends were traipsing through the off-kilter door, carrying his 
furniture to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the county, other quake victims spent Tuesday performing 
similarly grim tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 They cleaned their homes or tried to salvage cherished possessions. They stood 
in 30-minute grocery store lines for water, flashlights and canned food -- in 
at least one case, ignoring a sign that warned "Shop at Your Own Risk." They 
consoled distraught friends and called worried relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, council members showed their congressman, Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), their quake-ravaged library, picking their way 
around fragments from the metal ceiling that had blasted loose during the 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like Beirut," City Manager Grant Brimhall said. "Or worse." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, Wolford strode through the city with building inspectors and 
held conference after conference to decide which schools could reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in her home just blocks from the Simi Valley Hospital, nurse Merich tried 
to relax after the most hectic 15-hour shift of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many, Merich could not find peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they tried to nap Tuesday, many Ventura County residents found 
themselves twitchy and tense. Even when they were lying in bed, their muscles 
stayed taut, their hands reached out toward flashlights and hard-soled shoes, 
their minds ran through an endless catalogue of objects broken and friends left 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to go to sleep because I was so afraid the Big One would come," 
13-year-old Sarah Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others shared her fear -- and wondered how to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mexico, we all have the idea that we should run outside as fast as 
possible, but here, they tell us to stay inside and get in the doorway," Jose 
Lopez, 31, said. "But there's not enough room in the doorway for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday evening, those who survived the quake with homes and possessions 
intact felt ready to get their lives back to normal. Some even felt relaxed 
enough to make a few earthquake jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Thousand Oaks council meeting marked by three small aftershocks, council 
members expressed gratitude that their city had suffered less than nearby Simi 
Valley. Councilman Alex Fiore chuckled: "This time, I guess it just wasn't our 
fault." 
</P>
<P>
 The sign in Fillmore on Wednesday seemed pitifully inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The entire downtown district was cordoned off, sheriff's deputies were 
patrolling homes and shops to prevent looting, and volunteer firemen were 
trying to move the emergency shelter to a bigger location. 
</P>
<P>
 But the orange sign posted on a traffic cone near Santa Clara Street offered 
scanty news: "Traffic Subject to Delays Due to Special Event." 
</P>
<P>
 For a change, Campbell was free to help his family instead of aiding others. 
He scarcely knew where to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no earthquake insurance," he said. "I am financially devastated. I 
don't know what to do. Except work on cars. I know I can make money working on 
cars. I'll just have to keep working and hope the people who owe me money will 
pay me money." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his resolve, he did not get much done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put on my coveralls like I'm going to work, but I haven't touched a thing," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others who watched life savings crumble in the earth's violent spasm, 
Campbell got a small measure of support Wednesday, when President Clinton 
declared Ventura County a disaster area, eligible for federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also received some bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech scientists reported that aftershock activity was unusually vigorous -- 
and migrating toward Ventura County. Two strong Wednesday afternoon temblors 
were centered barely six miles northeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolford did not need a geology degree to figure that out. 
</P>
<P>
 When the floor started pitching shortly after 1 p.m. Wednesday, Wolford dove 
under a table in the district office, where she had been answering press calls 
about school damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right away, I said: 'That's a 5.1,"' she said. "My colleague said: 'No, no, 
no, that's a 3.2, I'll bet you a dollar.' As it turned out, I was right on 
target. When we heard on the radio that it was a 5.1, everyone in the room 
offered to give me a dollar. And we had a bit of laughter, which we desperately 
needed to break the tension." 
</P>
<P>
 The chuckle might have made everyone feel better for an instant. But within 
minutes the district office was deluged with phone calls from frightened 
students, teachers and custodians. 
</P>
<P>
 No one wanted to go back to school, not even to the schools that had been 
declared safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour, Wolford had dashed off a press release canceling school in the 
Simi Valley Unified District for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew immediately that we'd have further damage from those aftershocks," 
Wolford said. "I thought: 'There goes the plan for tomorrow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was Thursday. Three days had passed. But the aftershocks kept coming, 
smaller but still potent in some pockets of eastern Ventura County. And the 
talk kept coming as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For some it was idle chatter. 
</P>
<P>
 How many pictures fell off your wall? How scared was your cat? How long did it 
take you to vacuum up the glass? 
</P>
<P>
 For those most affected, the talk was serious, and wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
 Where will I live if it rains this weekend? How can I get loans to repair my 
house? Why won't the building inspector let me enter my shop? 
</P>
<P>
 Federal emergency aid offices opened at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church 
in Fillmore and at the Sycamore Drive Community Center in Simi Valley to answer 
those nuts-and-bolts questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of quake victims lined up at the FEMA centers, some waiting for hours 
in the bright sunshine. But most got no tangible help Thursday -- just a sheaf 
of papers and an appointment for an individual counseling session later in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know what FEMA is," Campbell said, discouraged and disconsolate 
as the magnitude of his personal tragedy began to sink in. "I don't even know 
what they can do for us. All they did was give us pieces of paper and tell us 
to come back tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers of the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- well versed in 
helping Californians after last fall's disastrous wildfires -- promised to work 
on pragmatic problems soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The philosophical questions, however, were harder to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have lost everything, so they're asking why," said Father 
Norm Supancheck of St. Francis of Assisi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell some of them I don't know -- only God knows. Some, I reassure that we 
can go forward from here. For others, though, that's not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, like every day since the earthquake, more than 200 people 
attended church services at St. Francis of Assisi -- a dramatic jump from the 
normal attendance of about three dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Many were children, who seemed to find peace in the sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful to see how the children who haven't slept for days come to 
church and fall asleep leaning against their parents because they feel safe 
there," Supancheck said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the newly homeless, suddenly jobless and simply shaken sought financial 
aid or emotional support, administrators across the county continued the gritty 
work of assessing damages on Day 4 of Quake Week. 
</P>
<P>
 Building inspectors plodded from door to door, pasting red, yellow or green 
tags to indicate the state of each structure they investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, many had good news -- at least in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, officials checking out the library concluded that they had 
overestimated the damage. A new computer system, installed the day before the 
earthquake, was working again -- although it had been sprayed with water when a 
sprinkler burst during the temblor. Despite the collapsed ceiling, City Manager 
Brimhall pronounced the library structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although damage estimates topped $5 million in the Simi Valley Unified School 
District, the structural weakness was not as bad as it had appeared. After 
another exhausting day of touring schools, conferring with inspectors and 
answering calls, Wolford reported Thursday that the schools once considered 
ruined could be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the damage we were fearful was structural turned out to be merely 
cosmetic," she said. "We'll be able to repair them and the buildings will be in 
good shape. They may not look nice, but they'll be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county in Fillmore, the devastation was every bit as bad as it had 
first appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting as usual Thursday night, the Fillmore City Council decided to take 
control of the demolition bulldozer. Any building deemed a public hazard could 
be razed with 48 hours notice, the council members decided. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the toughest vote of Campbell's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the ordinance we passed was a death sentence for my house," he 
said. "I voted for it. But it was hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The house he had lived in nearly all his married life, the house he had raised 
his two children in, the house he had renovated room by room, would be swept 
away by a city bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
 Logically, Campbell knew he had to tear down the home. Leaning and shaky, it 
clearly jeopardized his elderly neighbor's house. Repairing his house would 
cost $60,000 to $75,000. For that price, he said, he might as well build a new 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 The thought was daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 He had managed to find a temporary apartment for his family -- one bedroom for 
the four of them, "not nearly enough room, but it's a roof over our heads." 
Dozens of tasks still lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 He had to look for a new home. He had to get price quotes from contractors. He 
had to keep up with his City Council and Fire Department chores. He had to earn 
money, lots of money, in his auto repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal life is a shambles," Campbell said. "I'm trying to do a bunch of 
things at once. I have to, because I'm in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The portable toilets stank. The lines were long. The paperwork was endless. 
And the check was nowhere near the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many of the earthquake victims waiting for federal assistance Friday 
remained good-natured, patient, and even optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were frustrated -- wanting immediate answers when they could get only 
future appointments. But others were glad to be taking some action, glad to be 
talking to people who could help. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling up and down the line in Simi Valley, distributing fliers and 
flashing his smile, disaster relief worker Michael Kavanaugh tried to keep 
everyone cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are hurting, we're there," said Kavanaugh, a retired police officer 
from Roanoke, Va. "That's the whole point, isn't it? We're here to help and 
we'll be here for as long as we need to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 John Ayers, for one, was glad to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley computer programmer had just experienced a rather traumatic 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been rooting through the Elks Lodge, seeking a wheelchair for his 
injured son, when a series of aftershocks rolled through eastern Ventura County 
about 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubble rained down around him as he dashed for the door. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, he was checking out his chimney when another jolt hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The earth swayed slightly as he clutched the roof in terror. 
</P>
<P>
 Two near-escapes in one day convinced Ayers to stay outside and on the ground 
-- and the FEMA line outside Simi Valley's Sycamore Drive Community Center was 
as good a place as any. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many, he was not sure what he might need from the government. But he 
thought he might as well queue up, just in case. Perhaps, he said, he would ask 
for a low-interest loan to fix his cracked foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, though, Ayers could not think that far ahead. After four tense 
nights of fitful sleep, he had one main wish: "Let's just have a little peace," 
he said wearily. 
</P>
<P>
 But, even on the fifth day, peace seemed far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolford was harried and harassed at the district office in Simi Valley, 
fielding calls from school principals, custodians and worried parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell was harried and harassed at his auto repair shop in Fillmore, trying 
to take care of business and find new lodging for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 And John Dosen was harried and harassed at an industrial building in Newbury 
Park, welcoming a small army of State Farm Insurance claims adjusters from 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 800 out-of-town employees joined the 250 stationed in State Farm's 
regional office in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they could fan out to handle the claims -- which were expected to reach 
nearly 100,000 -- they shuttled through an "induction center" in Newbury Park, 
picking up maps, flashlights, hard hats, gloves, and instructions on how to 
assess earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a casual observer, this may look a little chaotic, but really, it's 
organized," Dosen said, as claims adjusters in red "Special Disaster Team" 
T-shirts swarmed through the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced in dealing with natural disasters -- many spoke calmly of having 
"worked Andrew," as in the hurricane -- the claims adjusters nonetheless 
admitted some fear of aftershocks. Yet they all tried to ignore the shakes, 
girding themselves for six weeks of nonstop work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make the adrenaline rush last that long," said Karen O'Neill , who 
left her husband and 4-month-old daughter in icy Ohio when she flew west to 
process earthquake claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 21 degrees below zero when I left," O'Neill said, marveling. "Here, I 
don't even need a jacket." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jennifer Jimenez, Saturday meant: 
</P>
<P>
 Another morning of waking up in the Royal High School gym, surrounded by 
crying babies, barking dogs and snoring men. 
</P>
<P>
 Another trip to the smelly portable toilets. Another communal shower in the 
women's trailer. Another pass through the cafeteria line for sticky buns, fruit 
and cereal. Another makeshift day. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 23-year-old mother was not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 She had slept in her house at the east end of Simi Valley the first night 
after the quake -- or rather, she had stood vigil over her infant's crib, 
fearful that at any moment the creaky old building would cave in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I came here," Jimenez said, gesturing to the Red Cross shelter. "And I 
had my first good sleep. I know this building can hold an 8.9 earthquake. I 
wish I was at home. But I feel safe here." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her fellow shelter-dwellers seemed to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the inconveniences, they expressed boundless admiration for the Red 
Cross volunteers, and deep gratitude for the temporary housing. Hundreds of 
people have slept at Red Cross shelters in Simi Valley and Fillmore each night 
since the quake, and hundreds more have accepted emergency food and water. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people couldn't be better," said Frances Littlefield, 82, who spent 
Saturday morning reading the paper and joking with the volunteers. "They're all 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 As Littlefield sat in her wheelchair, cozy in a white terry cloth bathrobe, 
8-year-old Jessica Valadez played with her pet rats in the shelter's lobby. 
Meanwhile, Danielle Maston, 12, tried to shush her puppy, which had started 
barking furiously in its tiny carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Their public schools superintendent, Wolford, had just formulated a plan that 
would put them back in the classroom within days -- a plan that made neither 
girl happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by games, pets and potential playmates, Jessica and Danielle said 
they considered life in the Royal High gym even better than summer camp. And 
they wanted the vacation to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually don't like my house much," Jessica said. "It's too boring there. 
Here, they give us lots of activities and it's much more fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The good cheer and hard work of those who had come to Ventura County to help 
the needy also impressed Campbell. After spending three hours with FEMA 
officials, Campbell said he felt optimistic for the first time since he had 
paused to contemplate his plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know financially I've taken a terrible hit, and I lost 21 years of history 
in my home, but I know that FEMA can help me. Not with gifts, but with loans, 
loans that I can pay back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While fellow firefighters escorted merchants into their wrecked downtown 
stores, Campbell stayed in his auto repair shop, tuning up cars so his 
customers could get back to work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a real despair, a really bad depression," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I haven't cried for almost 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For some, prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week of terrifying tremors, confounding commutes and boggling 
bureaucracy, Ventura County residents plan to take solace Sunday in meditation, 
recreation or vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Dennis Mongrain expects hundreds to attend his morning service at St. 
Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley, looking for answers to that eternal enigma: 
Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Why the floods? Why the fires? Why the quakes? Why me? 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to answer such cosmic questions, Mongrain decided instead to remind his 
congregation of the earthquake's primary lesson: homes and cars, even fat bank 
accounts, can crumble in an instant, felled by nature's awesome force. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus on building spiritual and personal relationships, not on accumulating 
material possessions, Mongrain will urge. After all, he plans to tell them, 
"You can't take your surfboard to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 While some will seek peace in churches, other quake victims will look to 
escape their sorrows and fears by plopping down in front of a television set 
for a day of NFL playoff action. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers, the Kansas City 
Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills sounded like an ideal Sunday to Joe Martini, who 
has spent several nights in Simi Valley's Red Cross shelter, bunking down on an 
army cot and showering in a trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they'll have the playoffs on TV here," he said. "That really will be 
fun -- something to take our minds off what's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the best diversion will not distract Campbell and thousands of other 
county residents -- still stunned and disbelieving.

DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE; STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS BECOME THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER PEOPLE 
IN TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Decked out in stone-washed denims, Hawaiian shirt and low-top Nikes, Leo 
Parker looks more like some goateed party boy on a three-day Vegas blowout than 
an expert counsel to countless Los Angeles property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Parker can quickly tell you, looks can be deceiving -- in people and in 
buildings rocked by a major earthquake. As he cruises up the long driveway of a 
Chatsworth mansion last week, its hand-wringing owners awaiting his attention, 
Parker is a steely-eyed consultant who can give the "good word" on worrisome 
temblor damage -- or sound a residential death knell. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a house doctor, one of hundreds of local structural engineers who have 
been making home and condo calls 18 hours a day ever since Monday's quake and 
the aftershocks rocked buildings and owners clean off their once rock-solid 
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 As the city building inspectors clear out, thousands of property owners are 
looking for on-the-spot expertise from independent structural engineers such as 
Parker, who have gained a newly found professional status akin to that of brain 
surgeon or cardiologist: Their opinions are considered with the full weight of 
a medical diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake hit, Parker has been tailed by anxious owners seeking his 
colorful, straightforward explanations on everything from bedroom cracks to 
fallen fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 As Irwin and Sherry Learhoff looked on in rapt concern, the 36-year-old Parker 
explained why most of the damage occurred to the upper floors of their 
11,500-square-foot Chatsworth home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the mayhem is upstairs because the house shook off the quake like it 
would a shiver that accelerated up its spine," he said. "It built up force as 
it went along. It crested at the top, like a skyscraper rocking in a stiff 
breeze." 
</P>
<P>
 The cracks, he explained, told the real story of the quake's damage. Some 
internal fissures running up and down, or across a living room wall, simply 
followed the form of the reinforcing plywood sheets beneath them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most disturbing cracks, Parker said, were the diagonal ones -- 
signifying that one half of the support had twisted one way and the rest the 
opposite, such as when a chiropractor releases tension from a joint. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple nodded knowingly. Then Learhoff shook his head: "Geez." 
</P>
<P>
 They were lucky to reach Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demand has been so great my head is still spinning," Parker said. "We 
have three structural engineers in our firm, far too few to handle the hundreds 
of requests we've had. We finally had to stop taking new business." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, there are 3,000 certified structural engineers, a flock of strange 
scientific birds who outdistance most colleagues nationwide in one critical 
aspect: analyzing earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "California probably has the best-trained structural engineers in the world 
outside Japan," said Robert Boyens, a Lawndale engineer and spokesman for the 
Structural Engineer's Assn. of Southern California. "While other states have 
wind and water forces, we also have the distinction of having the ground 
convulse. Our job is to make sure buildings can withstand not only vertical 
loads but unpredictable seismic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, we have played an invisible role in the building process, working 
with builders and architects. But all that has changed after the quakes. Now 
we're very, very visible. Suddenly, people know who we are." 
</P>
<P>
 The Learhoffs know. 
</P>
<P>
 For a $250 fee, Parker visited their house in the north San Fernando Valley to 
hear their story: They were away when the quake hit, avoiding the light 
fixtures that came crashing down atop their bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the couple walked about like funeral-goers, pointing at a 
crumbled second-story fireplace and kicking at the shards of brick, fallen 
helter-skelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aftershocks are killing us," Learhoff said. "Every one of them keeps 
chinking the armor. It drives you crazy. But I'm no professional engineer who 
can read this stuff. We need help to figure out if our home is still livable." 
</P>
<P>
 With the couple in tow, Parker circled the house, picking through rubble like 
an archeologist at a suburban excavation site, his flashlight beam pinpointing 
cracks as he jotted notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker had good news: Sure, the damage looks unsightly but none is structural. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Learhoff still was not sure she wanted to come home yet. The place just 
didn't feel right anymore. "You have to ask: 'What's really safe when you have 
a 12-month-old?' " she asked. "My first impulse is to fix up the place and sell 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning in Sherman Oaks, the house doctor was greeted by a dozen 
condominium owners. In the quake's aftermath, many have moved in with 
relatives. Like unruly schoolchildren, each pushed to get a front position in a 
semicircle around Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are our lives going now? To the state of confusion forever?" asked 
Diana Harrison, an eight-year resident of the La Ventana condominiums. "My 
place looks like a bomb hit, like I live in Beirut. My possessions are mostly 
gone. But that's OK, I've had them 70 years. But I still need a place to live. 
I need a place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 The questions ranged from the deep to the practical: When would their fears go 
away? When could they hang their pictures again? When might they get a good 
night's sleep without popping pills? 
</P>
<P>
 Walking slowly, saying little to the crowd in tow, Parker examined the 
foundation and moved through a few selected rooms. Behind him, the group 
murmured as he gave the structure a clean bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
 "From here, your building looks just fine," he told one owner. "If you don't 
live in the corner units where most of the stress occurred, I'd say you can 
move back in." 
</P>
<P>
 The beaming woman turned to a friend and said: "That's absolutely wonderful. 
C'mon, let's go to Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone gets such good news. Some homeowners have been told they must 
stay away until further tests are done. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when it gets tough," Parker said. "People hire you to give them good 
news. When they don't get it, they want to shoot the messenger. They get angry. 
But I tell them: 'Hey, I didn't cause this earthquake.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Structural engineers have also disagreed with city inspectors on a building's 
safety status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one 13-story place where the owner wanted his apartments filled as soon 
as possible," Boyens said. "The city had given him the go-ahead, but I still 
had some problems. But I'm just an adviser. I told him what I thought. I don't 
know what he did."

SURVIVORS OF COLLAPSED APARTMENTS DENOUNCE LANDLORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Survivors of the collapsed Northridge apartments that killed 16 people met 
with a city building official Saturday -- and denounced the owner of their 
building, saying that he has added insult to injury by preventing the salvage 
of their remaining possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a chaotic and emotional meeting at a local church, survivors of the 
Northridge Meadows collapse -- the deadliest single incident of Monday's 6.6 
temblor -- demanded to know when their former landlord would arrange the 
outside inspection of the wreckage needed before they can search for their 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the survivors said they are living in local shelters without money, 
identification, a car or even a change of clothes, and expressed outrage that 
even five days after the quake they are not allowed to sift for belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't let us in within the next two days, I'm telling you, we're 
going to bust in there," said Erik Pearson, 27, who lived on the third floor. 
"We've been going out of our minds." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to be logical about this, but I'm losing my patience," said 
Josephine Winans, who was rescued from Apartment 128 by other residents after 
the roof collapsed. "I have nothing, and I at least need to take a picture of 
my apartment to show that I was under the rubble for insurance purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Cary Erdman, who lived in Apartment 112, was upset that several people managed 
to gain access and retrieve possessions, while he and others who had obeyed the 
law were still without their things. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just hasn't been fair, and no one really understands what is going on," he 
said. "There is a lot of confusion about when people are going to be let in." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for owner Shashikant Jogani, one of Los Angeles' biggest 
residential landlords, said an engineer is expected to examine the building 
sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to wait," said Bill Banker, a Jogani spokesman. "Who could live with 
that on their conscience if more people died?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some survivors were near panic, begging to be allowed inside and 
fearful that the building would be razed before they could go on salvage 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will be allowed to enter the condemned building until it is inspected 
by outside engineers, according to officials from the city's Department of 
Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Johnson, a building official, said the city has condemned the apartment, 
prohibiting entry, until the owner decides what to do with the structure.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the responsibility of the owner, at that point, to determine . . . 
whether he thinks the building is stable enough for people to go in, or whether 
he thinks the structure needs to be raised," Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Using a crane, Building and Safety workers retrieved some survivors' cars from 
the top floor of the apartment complex's parking garage Saturday, but most 
residents were less than satisfied with that development. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other survivors, Pearson was furious at his landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 "Firefighters told me that that building was not retrofitted, and that it was 
built after the '71 quake," Pearson said. "Look at the disaster and great loss 
of life in this building compared to the other buildings around here. There's a 
reason. I think there are a lot of smoke screens going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren O'Brien of the city's Department of Building and Safety said he had 
spoken with Jogani personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a complete misunderstanding of the problem and how to relieve it," 
O'Brien said, adding that Jogani seemed traumatized by what had happened to his 
building, and did not realize it had to be inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 Jogani could not be reached for comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, he was one of the defendants in a class-action lawsuit filed in 
Los Angeles Superior Court by the NAACP and two civil rights law firms accusing 
several San Fernando Valley apartment owners with discriminating against 
African Americans.

 After a wearying start to the new year, with little time to grieve over the 
death of his mother, President Clinton is taking a weekend break and retreating 
to the solitude of Camp David, Md., with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's looking forward to this weekend as a time to rest, spend time with his 
family, probably watch a few movies, read, work on his State of the Union 
speech, bowl a few lines, walk around outside if the weather warms up," Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Friday.

SILENCE, SIGNS ARE KEYS TO MURDER TRIAL; COURTS: MOST OF THE MAIN FIGURES IN AN 
UNUSUAL CASE ARE DEAF. THE JUDGE ALSO IS HEARING-IMPAIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The prosecutor calls it "a very straightforward murder case," and in many ways 
the Val Lamar Smith case is depressingly similar to scores of other killings 
that happen in Los Angeles every year: Young men, allegedly members of rival 
gangs, meet up with each other and somebody winds up dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But what sets the Smith murder case apart is that most of the key figures are 
deaf. Smith, the defendant, is deaf, as was the man he is accused of killing, 
James E. Powell Jr. Several of the key witnesses also are deaf. Even the trial 
judge is hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 At the trial, which is expected to start as soon as the Van Nuys courthouse is 
open again for business, the legal system will not only have to bridge the gap 
between the hearing world and the silent. It also must bridge the gap between 
two different forms of sign language -- one the formal American Sign Language, 
the other a less stylized form of sign language that has its roots in the 
segregated American South and lives on today in poor, predominantly African 
American neighborhoods where access to special schools and training for the 
deaf is often limited. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The informal sign language often uses broad gestures and pantomime-style 
movements to convey meaning.  
</P>
<P>
 Sign interpreters for deaf jurors or other deaf trial participants are an 
almost daily sight in Los Angeles courtrooms. But because Smith and some of the 
witnesses use the informal sign language, which few court-approved sign 
interpreters know, another interpreter who is deaf will translate a deaf 
witness's answers from informal sign into American Sign, and another 
interpreter will translate the American Sign into spoken words for the jury and 
other hearing trial participants. When the witness is asked a question, the 
process will be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not unheard of in Los Angeles courts, the two-stage sign language 
interpreting format will be a new experience for most participants in the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be interesting," said Superior Court Judge Michael Farrell. 
"I'm curious as to how it's going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell said he is hearing-impaired, with less than 50% capacity in both ears 
in the conversational range -- the result, he believes, of Army service in the 
tank corps. He does not understand sign language. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels said it is her first trial involving a deaf 
defendant and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different, and it may be a little more difficult," Samuels said. "It may 
be a little harder to judge the demeanor of a witness. . . . Uncertainty, 
anger, indignation, all the emotions -- sometimes you don't get that with sign 
language. I don't know how that's going to play to a jury. But I don't think it 
will pose any big problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's attorney, Tony Bryan, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell and Samuels said they were somewhat concerned that the double sign 
interpretation process might slow down the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had cases (with signing deaf participants) where the people are slow, 
and my gosh, it can just take forever," Farrell said. He also is concerned 
about the accuracy of the signing, particularly the translation of the informal 
sign language. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I have to look at is, are (the defendant and deaf witnesses) 
completely understanding what's being said," Farrell said. "And how will I 
know?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph Padilla, who supervises interpreter services for the Los Angles 
County courts, said he does not believe there will be any problems with the 
sign interpreting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is done in split seconds," Padilla said. "You'd be amazed at how fast 
they are. It's fascinating to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla said that Karen Bowman, a court interpreter who can use both American 
Sign and the informal sign language, will act as one of the interpreters at the 
Smith trial. Bowman, who is deaf, is widely recognized as an expert in both 
sign language forms and is one of only a few sign interpreters who is 
court-qualified in the informal sign language, Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles courts employ 10 American Sign interpreters, Padilla said, adding 
that next to Spanish, American Sign is the most frequently translated language 
in the court system. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming trial has its origins in events of January, 1992, when Smith, now 
23, and two male friends, who also are deaf, drove from South-Central Los 
Angeles to an apartment complex in Van Nuys to visit friends. While there, the 
men encountered Powell, 27, a deaf Long Beach resident who had been staying in 
the apartment of Yvonne Lane, who also is deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, an argument -- conducted in sign language -- broke out 
among the men, allegedly over rival gang affiliations. Smith allegedly drew a 
revolver and shot Powell, killing him. Smith was arrested and held without 
bail. One of the men with him later pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, who originally told police she had been taking a nap when the shooting 
took place and had not been aware of it -- because of her hearing impairment, 
the police at first believed her -- now is expected to testify in informal sign 
language that she saw Smith shoot Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith faces a possible life sentence if convicted.

STUDY OF L.A. FINANCES FINDS MILLIONS IN NEW INCOME; REVENUES: RIORDAN TEAM 
WILL RECOMMEND AGGRESSIVE AND CREATIVE MANAGEMENT OF CITY ASSETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the devastating earthquake hit the city, final touches were being put on a 
seminal, four-month Riordan Administration study of Los Angeles city finances 
that concludes that aggressive, creative management of city assets and revenues 
could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new income over the next 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The closely guarded report, which will be carefully scrutinized by skeptical 
city lawmakers and employee unions when it is released in the next few weeks, 
is expected to provide one of the first significant gauges of Mayor Richard 
Riordan's capacity to bring his business skills and connections to bear on the 
city's daunting budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see this (report) as a chance to really lay out where they want to go in 
terms of overhauling the fiscal operation of city government," said a City Hall 
source who is familiar with the work of the nine-member mayoral task force 
writing the report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's office and investment banker Michael Tennenbaum, the task force 
chairman, have declined to discuss the panel's findings before the release of 
the study. The quake has complicated projections of financial costs and 
revenues, and a fine point still is being put on some numbers and 
recommendations, sources cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the panel has tallied up about $300 million to $400 million it 
maintains are potential savings and revenue increases that could be achieved 
over the next several years, knowledgeable sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is taking a new look at some familiar targets, such as how to 
increase collections on city parking tickets and bad checks and identifying 
excess landholdings that can be sold. It has also developed some fresh ideas on 
how to generate money, examining how the city could increase interest income 
through better cash management, reduce employee pension fund costs and draw 
more income from the city's airports, harbor and Department of Water and Power, 
sources familiar with the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the options considered range from leasing all or part of Los Angeles 
International Airport operations to private bidders to stepped up efforts to 
recover bills owed to the city for paramedic ambulance services, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Griego, a deputy mayor in the Tom Bradley Administration and a task 
force member, said the panel believes about $100 million could be available in 
relatively short order. Recovering $300 million to $400 million in additional 
annual revenue over the next five years would require longer-range changes in 
city operations, as well as investments in such things as better computer 
programs and equipment to manage city tax collections and cash flow, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the panel has identified considerable needs for investment 
in run-down city facilities and equipment, and remains unclear just how much of 
the potential increased funds might be available to help Riordan deal with 
budget deficits and expand a costly buildup of the police street patrols. For 
example, Griego said, about $80 million a year more needs to be invested in 
maintaining and repairing city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding a cautionary note, Riordan adviser William Ouchi, the UCLA management 
expert who is overseeing the financial review, said the study has helped show 
that "the magnitude of the fiscal challenge is going to be larger than many 
people think." He added that it will be more difficult than some people 
anticipated to meet the fiscal challenge without raising taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 Strong doubts already are being voiced outside the mayor's circle about the 
practicality of the panel's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, finance committee chairman and a major player in 
city fiscal matters, said the Tennenbaum group is "extremely talented and 
extremely smart." But they also appear "overly optimistic (and) perhaps 
somewhat unrealistic," as well as unschooled in the legal and political 
complexities of City Hall's highly unionized Civil Service environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't find $400 million," said Yaroslavsky, who has been briefed on some 
of the task force proposals. "If it were so easy, we would have done it. We're 
not here sitting on our hands." 
</P>
<P>
 A sizable share of the expected shorter-term revenue would hinge on the 
politically sensitive notion of changing the way the city values and 
contributes to its three major pension funds, Griego said. It appears that the 
safety of employees' benefits can be assured and changes still be made that 
could save tens of millions of dollars in annual city contributions, Griego 
said. The largest potential saving, perhaps in the $40 million to $50 million 
range, is in the huge DWP pension account. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, early Riordan Administration efforts to re-examine the DWP pension 
practices have touched off a storm of protest from employee unions. Other 
knowledgeable sources said the final task force report may de-emphasize 
financial gains possible from pension fund changes because of the political 
furor already brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Griego and other sources said, savings could be realized by 
overhauling and streamlining the manner in which the city leases office space, 
pursues bad check writers and tracks down city business tax scofflaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration and council have already begun to move in some of these 
areas. This week, a long-studied proposal was approved to hire two outside 
firms to assist the city clerk and city attorney in collecting millions in 
past-due license fees and bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But even some of the task force's less-lucrative notions, such as more 
aggressively pursuing past-due bills for services such as paramedic ambulance 
rides, may prove difficult. "It's not easy to get," said one veteran city 
budget analyst. "Many of these are poor people. . . . Some of these things have 
got built-in problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the task force effort represents a comprehensive attempt to organize 
and attach fresh dollar estimates to a host of revenue-generating ideas. It is 
expected to mark a jumping-off point for Riordan as he tries to rally public 
support for his campaign to stabilize city finances, dramatically boost 
spending on police and keep a pledge to avoid new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Task force members -- who include the real estate developer Eli Broad, First 
Interstate Bank Chairman Ed Carson, Arthur Andersen Co. managing partner Dick 
Poladian and Gilbert Ray, a partner at the O'Melveny & Myers law firm -- are 
being asked to help Riordan stump for the recommendations after the report is 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Old hands at City Hall caution that past wall-to-wall financial reviews have 
produced plenty of paper, but not always results. Ten years ago, a study by a 
group of high-powered business leaders for former Mayor Tom Bradley, who was 
wrestling with a $160-million budget shortfall, identified more than $100 
million in potential cuts and new revenue. Among them was cutting funds for 
nonessential services, imposing a rubbish collection fee and investing in more 
tax collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Daniel Shapiro, who headed the review, recalled this week that 
the report was coolly received and few recommendations were implemented, partly 
because many of the proposals ran afoul of vocal constituencies. Instead, the 
mayor and council opted for simple across-the- board budget trims and a 
temporary tax on city business, which, Shapiro noted, is "still there 10 years 
later." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Riordan's task force, some of whom were also Bradley allies, say 
the key difference today is a mayor who is firmly committed to change and cost 
efficiency. "I think (Riordan) understands. He has a fiscal vision," said one 
task force member who asked not to be identified. "We're trying to come up with 
something that is realistic and could be doable politically." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, another panel member, added: "I don't think it's going to be blue sky."

SIGHTSEERS FLOCK TO NEW VALLEY 'ATTRACTIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge Fashion Center, heavily damaged in last week's earthquake, 
became the most popular photo opportunity in Southern California on Saturday, 
judging from the hordes of camera-toting sightseers who flocked there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get some of this on film," said Jeremiah Jennings of Acton, 
peering into the eyepiece of a video camera pointed at the wreckage of the 
mall's parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings was one of thousands of people visiting the mass destruction over the 
weekend. Motorists cruised the damage route adjacent to the mall along Nordhoff 
Avenue, taking advantage of every pause in the backed-up traffic to jump out of 
their cars and take snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
 Another popular tourist destination was the site of the Northridge Meadows 
apartments, where 16 people died. As if the residents in the surrounding area, 
cleaning up after the quake, were invisible, people strolled down the streets 
toting video and still cameras. They took pictures of cracked walls, broken 
windows and shaky stucco facades. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who came by apparently felt guilty about intruding on the misery of 
others and offered to pitch in and help quake refugees haul and load furniture 
onto the moving trucks that lined the street, said Mindi Renner, whose 
grandmother lived in one of the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some visitors, however, claimed a valid reason for coming by. Jennings said he 
came to help his daughter, who lives nearby, dig out from the temblor. His 
pictures of the collapsed mall structures were a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents Susan and Paul Opel came to find out if Northridge 
suffered as badly as news reports described. They felt their city, which also 
was hit hard, has been ignored in the crush of coverage focused on the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel much better now," said Paul Opel, as he gazed at the growing mountain 
of twisted steel and concrete being formed from the demolition of Bullock's and 
the adjacent parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary Los Angeles police officers directed traffic, trying to keep cars from 
slowing or stopping along streets clogged with moving vans and residents trying 
to clear out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just doing a great, big circle around the mall trying to keep traffic 
flowing," said Officer Sean Meade, as he and partner Dave Tulk pushed motorists 
along, like cowboys moving a cattle herd. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Espin of Westchester and Kathryn Boorer of Mar Vista admitted that they 
came out to the Valley to view the effects of the quake for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wondered if people would hate us if we showed up," Espin said, fiddling 
with a camera that hung from his neck. "We don't feel that comfortable about 
doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 But for some of the evacuees in the 19000 block of Nordhoff Avenue, gawkers 
were hardly the problem, according to Sid Whittert, who lost his home of 22 
years and a lifetime of mementos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't pay attention to it, we're just concerned with ourselves," said 
Whittert, carrying stereo equipment to his car from his battered condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out alive, and that's all we want," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Weiss, who was helping her elderly parents move from their devastated 
condominium to her home in Newbury Park, noted that the looky-loo phenomenon 
was hardly unique to earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look what happens whenever there is a fender-bender on the freeway," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody stops."

JAMES FLANIGAN: LOOK TO 480 BC IF YOU THINK L.A.'S FUTURE IS OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it only wishful thinking to hope that the earthquake will mark a turning 
point for the troubled Southern California economy? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. History can be reassuring. San Francisco, destroyed by the 1906 
earthquake and fire, was built anew by 1909 despite an outbreak of bubonic 
plague in 1907. It had determination in those days and proclaimed that by 
holding the Portola Festival in 1906 to symbolize the recovery of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overcoming obstacles produces improvisation and vitality in economic life," 
says Jane Jacobs, author of "Cities and the Wealth of Nations" and other noted 
works on urban societies. 
</P>
<P>
 But history also can be demanding; cities are renewed by human energy. San 
Francisco has not recovered with the same vigor from the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake. It has shown a hesitation to take bold action, a slowness to try 
new methods. "It can't decide whether it wants to be Carmel or Calcutta," quips 
historian Kevin Starr, a former San Francisco resident who now teaches at USC 
and lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 For Los Angeles' recovery, determination and imagination will be more 
important than money. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be there. City officials believe that ultimately more than $5 
billion in federal aid will flow to reconstruction of highways and buildings 
and other forms of disaster relief. In Washington, White House plans are for a 
$2-billion economic recovery package immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake, there will be losses. The cost of lives lost and the effect 
of homes destroyed is incalculable, of course. The measurable economic costs 
are forbidding: Gov. Pete Wilson estimates the quake's total costs at $30 
billion. Industry estimates so far say that only $2 billion of damaged property 
was insured. So business people will be faced with tough decisions about 
investment and rebuilding in a troubled economy; one has to make a profit to 
repay even low-interest government loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, don't forget all the federal, state and private money that rebuilds 
damaged highways and structures only brings the economy back to the line of 
scrimmage. And other costs continue, such as the economic penalty for having 
sections of the Santa Monica, Golden State and other freeways unusable for more 
than a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, rebuilding will create thousands of construction jobs, revitalizing a 
major industry that has been in recession for four years. Also the economy 
could get an immediate boost from consumers buying home repair supplies and 
making purchases postponed during the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real payoffs -- and the factors that could determine Los Angeles' 
future -- will come in new thinking, in the ingenuity and dedication city 
officials and business people show in turning obstacles into opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 150 school buildings closed indefinitely, possibilities open up for the 
school district to think of new ways to instruct children, to try new methods," 
says Francine Rabinovitz, of Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler, a Los Angeles 
public policy consulting firm that has worked with New York's school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are opportunities to change the way the city has operated for decades," 
says William Ouchi, a UCLA economist who works in the administration of Mayor 
Richard Riordan. Specifically, says Ouchi, City Hall officials are thinking of 
unused rail tracks that parallel the Santa Monica Freeway. "With federal help, 
we could clean up those rails and put transit on them," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Serious thought and planning has begun for many transit and commuting 
innovations to be tried over the coming year, Ouchi reports. Use of 
telecommuting and flexible hours will continue after the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Shared jitney cabs, an enlargement of the city's wide-ranging, entrepreneurial 
airport shuttle services, is an idea receiving a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spread of the Los Angeles area militates against fixed transit routes, 
but shuttles which can deliver passengers to their door or street could be 
valuable," says Paul Curcio, head of the Urban Innovations Group at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater insurance would be needed for the shuttle entrepreneurs, but the city 
could help with that. However, there is one hesitation: "Regulations would have 
to be changed before shuttles could serve as mass public transit vehicles," 
Curcio says. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the kind of test Los Angeles will have to pass if it is to prosper: 
Will it adapt regulations to meet new circumstances, to build and work anew, or 
will it be timid and hidebound? It's a critical question. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities do not fail from disasters. After the great fire of 1666, London 
rebuilt with the inspiration of architect Christopher Wren, who built St. 
Paul's Cathedral and many other structures. Chicago had 6,000 temporary 
shelters thrown up within a week of its great fire in October 1871, and went on 
to build much more strongly than before. 
</P>
<P>
 But cities do fail from within. Ancient Rome died in the century AD 300 to 
400, not from defeat in war, but from stagnation as taxes supported a growing 
mercenary soldiery and civil service, and people moved away to a simpler life 
on farms. The Visigoths sacked Rome in AD 410.  
</P>
<P>
 "We do have a danger of business people moving out. The earthquake could be 
one more straw on top of over-regulation and bureaucracy," says a local 
business leader. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the quake's immediate aftermath, defeat was not the trend. With few 
exceptions, government agencies and private utilities worked efficiently.  
</P>
<P>
 The region's economy was rising before the earthquake, and business people 
broadly are prepared to invest anew -- especially if reconstruction is carried 
on with vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist Jane Jacobs, who is now 77 and lives in Toronto, agrees. She would 
be surprised if Los Angeles, which she calls one of the great world cities, 
faded. Cities fail, she says, "when they keep on doing the same thing. Don't 
try to restore things as they were; that lacks imagination and leads to 
stagnation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles and Southern California have always come up with innovations for 
their own needs that are then sent out to others, notes Jacobs. "You're a 
semi-desert yet you became a great port; you made products for the movies, and 
for builders and aircraft. You have skills that didn't drop from the sky," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Put another way, it's no accident that Southern California leads the nation 
and the world in environmental science and technology. "Solving problems is 
very good for economies," says Jacobs. "Never fear, if you come up with useful 
solutions, they'll be useful for others, too."  
</P>
<P>
 Determination and imagination, not wishful thinking, built this metropolis -- 
and can rebuild it again. History is reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Persians sacked Athens in 480 BC," says Kevin Starr, "and after that the 
Athenians built the Acropolis, the Parthenon and the port city of Piraeus." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has work to do.

JAPANESE COMPANIES DOMINATE THE MARKET FOR LCD SCREENS. BUT U.S. ELECTRONICS 
FIRMS BELATEDLY ARE GEARING UP FOR; FLAT OUT COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some call it Flat Panel Flats. 
</P>
<P>
 This region, carved out of woodlands south of Portland, is the focal point of 
an infant electronic display industry whose healthy growth may be critical to 
the future success of the entire U.S. electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest manufacturer of flat panel displays -- Planar Systems 
Inc., which builds displays for medical equipment -- is based here. Not far 
away, Tektronix is working on technology that one day may be used to produce 
large televisions thin enough to hang on walls. Motif Inc., a local start-up, 
is constructing what soon will be the nation's largest factory producing 
screens for laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
 But as significant as these companies are by American standards, they are 
Lilliputian on a worldwide scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Planar's sales last year came to just $46 million. By contrast, Sharp Corp., 
the industry's world leader, is a $13.6-billion company with more than $1 
billion in flat panel display sales alone. 
</P>
<P>
 And together, Japanese companies hold an iron grip on 95% of the world market 
for flat panel displays -- a dominance they are committed to maintaining, no 
matter what their late-starting American competitors undertake. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is the U.S. display industry's strategic importance, far out of 
proportion to its size, that has turned it into a test bed for American 
industrial policy. 
</P>
<P>
 From computers and telecommunication to autos, broad sectors of U.S. high 
technology will depend increasingly on these thin glass screens to give their 
products portability and pizazz. How well the federal government promotes panel 
manufacturing may not only determine those sectors' success, but also shape 
future debates over Washington's appropriate role in the development of other 
emerging industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are competing in a world economy," says Malcolm Thompson, who heads 
display efforts at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. "This is either going to 
be jobs for Americans or jobs for someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the United States government 
publicly opposed industrial policy -- the idea of selectively backing important 
industries as Japan did after World War II in its drive to catch up with the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Clinton Administration is openly promoting a stronger government role 
as unavoidable in a competitive global economy in which virtually every 
advanced power promotes frontier industries at the expense of American industry 
-- whether Europe's support of aircraft manufacturing or Japan's promotion of 
semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few weeks, officials at the Department of Defense will put the 
finishing touches on an inter-agency plan that, drawing a page from the Japan's 
own targeting policies, will determine how best to nurture a competitive 
American flat panel display industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the proposals under consideration are innovative financial incentives 
designed to spur the large corporate investments necessary to make this country 
an international player. American companies, once wary of government 
intervention in the market, now are enthusiastically backing a bigger 
government role. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as AT&T, IBM and Xerox chose not to invest in liquid crystal 
display (LCD) technology a decade ago, concluding it was too expensive and the 
manufacturing process too complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, they have woken up to discover that displays are critical to a broad 
range of the products they plan for the future. Yet, they are completely 
dependent on Japanese suppliers -- most of which are also their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent shortages of color displays and the high prices that companies have had 
to pay for them have underscored American firms' vulnerability. Companies like 
Apple and Compaq have found themselves with little alternative but to 
subcontract key products to Japanese manufacturers to assure supplies of the 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a feeling that the computer and electronics industries could go down 
in flames if they are vulnerable to (supply) delays and (discriminatory) 
pricing," says Jeffrey Hart, a political science professor at Indiana 
University who has studied the industry. Japanese companies' advanced knowledge 
of how the latest generation screens will be produced, Hart argues, would give 
them a competitive advantage in a wide range of new products. 
</P>
<P>
 Big U.S. companies are taking their first, cautious steps into the white-hot 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Xerox has put together a consortium, including AT&T, that is asking for 
government support to build a commercial-size, color-display production plant. 
IBM hopes to join the consortium and persuade it to use technology developed by 
Display Technologies Inc., an IBM joint venture with Toshiba. AT&T and Xerox 
also reportedly are moving ahead with pilot plants of their own to build color 
displays. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to promote a domestic display industry are "good for the country, for 
the economy and for the job market," says Jim Dornbusch, manager of business 
operations at AT&T's high resolution technology division. "It's an industry 
that will produce an enormous amount of revenue and jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Japanese think tank Nomura Research, the flat panel display 
business is expected to be worth about $15 billion by the end of the decade -- 
triple its size today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The business is worth most to companies that can use the screens to produce 
high-value electronics products. For example, Sharp Corp., once a laggard in 
the camcorder business, became an industry leader overnight when it began 
selling a camcorder that features a large color LCD as the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception of the quality of a machine is dependent on what the display 
looks like," says Steven Depp, IBM's director of subsystems technology. Demand 
for IBM's new ThinkPad laptop computer, for example, has been driven by the 
rich colors of its LCD screen. IBM's joint-venture plant in Japan gave IBM an 
important head start in designing the product and securing supplies of the 
screens, Depp says. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing catch up actually may put America at an advantage. "For the first 
time, the Japanese have pioneered first-generation manufacturing," says Peter 
Mills, head of the U.S. Display Consortium, an industry group that is trying to 
develop more advanced display manufacturing equipment with government aid. "And 
like any first generation, it doesn't work very well." 
</P>
<P>
 In pursuit of the holy grail of the display business -- color screens with 
video capability -- Japanese companies have spent upward of $1 billion 
perfecting a complex technology called active matrix liquid crystal display. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology requires cramming hundreds of thousands of tiny transistors 
onto a single plate of glass slightly smaller than a sheet of paper. Each 
transistor switches liquid crystal shutters on and off, allowing light to pass 
through color filters and appear as points of colored light. 
</P>
<P>
 With a few defective transistors, the entire screen is useless. And the back 
lots of Japanese color display factories are piled high with the glass of 
rejected displays. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the high reject rates and the high cost of materials -- color 
filters cost $120 per screen -- color screens for laptops sell for as much as 
$1,400. But while high manufacturing costs once appeared as a window of 
opportunity for American companies, the window is closing fast. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a government study by Lawrence E. Tannas, an Orange, Calif.-based 
consultant, highlighted Japan's problems manufacturing color displays. But 
Tannas has a new study that concludes Japan's toughest problems have been 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese companies, he says, are about to make a quantum leap in productivity, 
using a new generation of manufacturing equipment that is three to five times 
more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost the chance of becoming an international player in this round," 
Tannas says, adding that only a major shift in technology will give America 
another chance to break into the market. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Japanese firms have made a show of renewed confidence in the 
business by announcing plans to spend $2.3 billion to quadruple production of 
color displays with the new equipment over the next three to four years.  
</P>
<P>
 Stanford Resources, a San Jose-based consulting firm with wide expertise in 
displays, predicts that Japan will start making money on color displays this 
year, a full year ahead of earlier forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan has had such a tremendous head start, it is going to be difficult to 
catch up," says Joseph Castellano, president of Stanford Resources. "Any new 
technology will take five years to develop." 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody is talking about giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first Display Manufacturing Technology Conference held in San Francisco 
earlier this month, 400 people showed up to talk about technology trends in 
what participants called an "upbeat" atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 One key source of the optimism: The Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects 
Agency boosted its budget for display research to $125 million this year, up 
sharply from $25 million just two years ago. And many believe more money is on 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the money will be spent efficiently. Taunton, Mass.-based Kopin Corp. 
has been working for more than a decade on technology it promised would cut the 
cost of making active matrix LCDs. The company's founders made small fortunes 
last year when they went public, with no product and little more in earnings 
than the company's two-year, $9.3-million ARPA contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the government makes some mistakes in its effort to promote the 
industry, the amounts of money involved pale, in any event, in comparison to 
past defense spending that failed to pan out in usable technology. Most 
industry analysts say ARPA has done an effective job coordinating the resources 
of universities, national laboratories, start-ups and large corporations to 
promote promising technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 With dozens of new display technologies vying against each other, there are 
still hopes that one will emerge that will enable America to make an end run 
around its Japanese competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an industry in its absolute infancy," says Xerox's Thompson. "It's a 
long ways before we will find who are the winners and who are the losers." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, ARPA awarded Xerox $21.4 million for work on a technology that 
produces the world's crispest color images -- but involves a costly, expensive 
manufacturing process. Silicon Video, a small Cupertino firm, is using ARPA 
money to work on field emission displays, which combine thousands of 
microscopic television tubes to create bright color images. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the right processing approaches, it could be very low cost, low power, 
(with) beautiful color and full video," says Bob Duboc, vice president of 
operations. But he acknowledges that the technology is at least two years from 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 More promising, near term, is Motif's approach, which uses so-called passive 
matrix screens -- now commonly used for monochrome displays -- and adds 
sophisticated chips that enable the displays to handle color and video. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Lewinsohn, one of two chief executives at Motif, says his factory will 
be producing 300,000 panels a year within 12 to 18 months. The plant will cost 
less than $70 million -- one-eighth the cost of an active matrix factory. 
Analysts agree that the technology is promising for certain segments of the 
market -- including mid-range laptops -- where customers may be willing to 
sacrifice the bright colors and contrast available on active matrix screens in 
exchange for lower prices.

 One problem with the government's decision to sponsor numerous alternative 
technologies is the difficulty the industry will face agreeing on standards 
that will allow low-cost manufacturing. Japanese industrial policy, by 
contrast, has encouraged industry to focus early on the technology with the 
best potential. The result has been a quicker move to mass production. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government's biggest help to U.S. industry may be the $20 million 
it is investing to cover two-thirds of the annual budget of the U.S. Display 
Consortium. The group's goal is to create an infrastructure of suppliers of 
advanced display manufacturing equipment and materials so that the emerging 
American industry is not dependent on Japanese suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 But an equally important function for the consortium will be pushing for an 
industry consensus on the key technologies that ought to be pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was established only last summer. But learning from the experiences 
of its sister organization in the semiconductor industry, Sematech, it has 
moved quickly to focus its research efforts on a dozen key manufacturing 
technologies with the biggest potential for cutting production costs. 
</P>
<P>
 With closer coordination, officials hope they can avoid the divisiveness 
created in 1991 when a group of display makers filed dumping charges that 
resulted in a 63% tariff on display imports. That drove production of laptop 
computers offshore without doing much to help American producers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's still a chicken-and-egg dilemma: There is no point in supporting 
equipment manufacturers if companies aren't building factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, ARPA gave $50 million to Optical Imaging Systems Inc. of 
Troy, Mich., to help build a small factory that will produce active matrix 
color displays for jet fighters. The company will work with American equipment 
makers working under contract to the U.S. Display Consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of these investments will result in any significant production -- 
unless major corporations with money to invest get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Although AT&T and Xerox insist they are serious about the business, they have 
yet to offer details of their plans. And while government subsidies may make it 
less risky for the companies to build pilot plants, it is far from clear the 
companies will follow through with money for additional plants. David Mentley 
of Stanford Resources estimates that if American companies want a 20% share of 
the $12-billion-plus market in the year 2000, they will have to invest nearly 
$2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies may be particularly wary of making large investments because huge 
new Japanese plants are coming on line over the next two years, Mentley says. 
The resulting overcapacity could set the stage for the kind of predatory 
pricing that once devastated U.S semiconductor makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Important questions remain. Just how much will the Clinton Administration 
propose spending on incentives for U.S. production? How will the incentives be 
structured to avoid the appearance of pork barrel? 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale that probably will be offered for expanded government investment 
is that a commercial industry exposed to market forces will be more likely to 
supply low-cost displays for both military and civilian use. Such an industry, 
promoters say, would be more efficient than dependence on a small corps of 
high-cost military contractors. 
</P>

 Scott Holmberg, who helped build one of the first prototypes for a color 
active matrix LCD way back in 1982, is skeptical that U.S. companies can be 
convinced to make the substantial investments necessary. Although he had a 
pilot production plant for color displays in 1989, his key backer -- Honeywell 
-- pulled the plug. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were ahead of the Japanese but we couldn't get the financing to put up 
manufacturing facilities in the U.S.," says Holmberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Holmberg is chief executive of Image Quest, a Fremont, Calif., company 
that is developing production technology to build color displays for a company 
with deeper pockets -- Korean conglomerate Hyundai. 
</P>
<P>
 When the technology is perfected, it will be transferred to Korea, where 
Hyundai is committed to pouring in the huge investments necessary to produce 
world-class facilities by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be in it for five years just to break even," Holmberg says. "U.S. 
investors aren't willing to sit tight for that long." Japan Dominates the 
Flat-Panel Market... 
</P>
<P>
 With a long head start on U.S. and Korean competitors, seven Japanese 
manufacturers-led by Sharp-hold 95% of the world market for liquid crystal 
displays. Figures are for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp: 26.8% 
</P>
<P>
 Seiko Epson: 12 
</P>
<P>
 Optrex: 8.2

 After years of losses on every screen sold, flat-panel display manufacturers 
are expected to begin making money this year on liquid crystal displays, with 
margins projected to fluctuate but remain positive throughout the decade.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; ALONG RESEDA BLVD., A RETAIL NIGHTMARE; 
EARTHQUAKE: "I CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO BE OPEN," SAYS ONE SHOPKEEPER, ECHOING THE 
PLIGHT OF OTHER MERCHANTS. 
</P>

 Dainty pink and red valentines and wrapping paper were back in the racks by 
late last week at the Kids at Heart gift shop in Northridge. But for owner 
Laura D'Angelo, the shattered windows, cracked walls, broken merchandise and 
fallen ceiling tiles served as physical reminders that her life might never be 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 After greeting a visitor with a faint smile, D'Angelo burst into tears. Her 
Granada Hills home was a shambles, she explained, and the survival of the small 
business she had spent seven years building was now in doubt. Replacing the 
windows alone would cost more than $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not Mervyn's," D'Angelo said. "Mervyn's will survive. But I can't afford 
not to be open. I just want our lives to return to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 For merchants along the devastated block of Reseda Boulevard where 16 people 
lost their lives in the collapse of the Northridge Meadows apartment building, 
"normal" vanished with last Monday's powerful earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Already battered by the recession, these small businesses often exist day to 
day, counting on their doors opening each morning and bringing in the few 
hundred or thousand dollars needed to meet expenses and provide a small profit. 
</P>
<P>
 On this block -- lined with apartment buildings, restaurants and strip malls, 
where hair and nail salons are scattered among the dry cleaners, memorabilia 
shops and other small businesses -- most of the merchants carry no earthquake 
insurance. The premiums and deductibles are too high. Though their buildings 
are owned by others, as tenants they are responsible for many of the repairs 
themselves. What's worse, for every day they remain closed, money is lost that 
could be used to pay for repairing the damages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The six days following the earthquake have been spent carrying away carpets of 
glass, boarding up blown-out windows, throwing out demolished merchandise and 
beginning the laborious and painful process of figuring out exactly how much 
was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 As the electricity finally came back on late in the week, many merchants 
expressed frustration that they could not reach their insurers by phone. And 
even when they did, they received only vague answers about what would be 
covered. Many tried calling the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to 
inquire about low-interest loans, but the lines were busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, too, were angered by what they perceived as a lack of compassion on the 
part of their landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Dellibovi said she asked the owner of the strip mall that houses her nail 
salon for an extension on more than $2,000 in rent that's due in two weeks. The 
answer, she said, was no -- and she was informed that the cost of fixing the 
badly damaged roof would come out of her pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall's owner, Matthews Investment Co., and its management company, Mat 
West Management, in Van Nuys, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind each door in the strip malls that line the block, merchants faced their 
uncertain future with a mixture of fear and weary resignation.  
</P>
<P>
 Dellibovi started her salon eight years ago with her mother Mary -- thus the 
name Kimary's Nail Boutique. She is proud of the salon's upscale image and 
reputation for quality, pleased that all the manicurists have built up their 
clientele through word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, bottles of nail polish lay strewn on the floor, and heavy 
shelves had toppled onto chairs where customers used to sit while their nails 
dried. All the $500 nail drills, $250 sterilizers and $125 gallons of acrylic 
were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dellibovi estimated it would cost her $10,000 to $15,000 to reopen; she still 
owes $6,000 on an earlier loan. The salon's manicurists are independent 
contractors, but without federal disaster assistance, she said, "I think a lot 
of the girls are going to be secretaries." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they do open their doors again, many business owners wonder if 
customers will return. 
</P>
<P>
 At My Hero, a submarine sandwich shop, owners Howard and Elise Kuebler watched 
through their windows -- the only ones in their mini-mall that weren't 
shattered by the quake -- as apartment dwellers loaded their belongings into 
moving vans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people we serve won't be around," Elise said. 
</P>
<P>
 After 30 years at the location, the Kueblers said they were not sure if they'd 
be able to stay themselves, since the building had not yet been inspected. 
Every day of lost business was another $1,000 gone. Already, they had thrown 
out thousands of dollars worth of spoiled meat. A lemonade and punch machine 
was beyond repair, as was the ice machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ara Boyajian, owner of Royal Cleaners at the Northridge Garden Center across 
and down the street, said a large percentage of his customers lived in the 
apartment buildings nearby, many of which are now condemned. Students from Cal 
State Northridge also have provided a steady clientele for area shops, but the 
hard-hit campus remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all these buildings condemned, it's going to be a ghost town around here 
for a long time," said Daniela Moreno, daughter of Giulianos Italian deli owner 
Dan Moreno. "A long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The front wall at Giulianos appeared in danger of collapse, so Moreno served 
free snacks and discounted drinks on the sidewalk outside while her father 
waited in a FEMA line at the Winnetka Recreation Center. After a three-hour 
wait, Dan Moreno got an appointment for Jan. 30, at which time he plans to ask 
for a $250,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost $50,000, wholesale, in merchandise alone -- including deli items, wine 
and imported Italian packaged goods, Dan Moreno said. The oven cannot be used. 
Each day the store stays closed means the loss of what usually amounts to 
$2,000 in sales. Even if the Morenos can stay in the building, it could be six 
weeks before the deli reopens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has been rough enough the last couple of years because of the 
recession," Moreno said. "A lot of my customers are advising me to go into 
bankruptcy. I don't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he acknowledged, "I've got some decisions to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Half a block away, Ben Hur, owner of Zeppelin Cleaners, gazed sadly at the 
piles of damaged clothes and broken dry cleaning equipment in his store. The 
thousands of dollars in machinery lost was bad enough, he said. But his biggest 
worry was that his customers would abandon him if he stayed closed too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I look at this and say, 'What shall I do? What shall I do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the Baskin-Robbins ice cream shop across the street from Northridge 
Meadows, gawkers who came to take pictures and shoot videos of the collapsed 
apartment building kept stopping by, begging for ice cream and sodas. But with 
no refrigeration, not an ice cream cone was to be found. Franchise owner Joel 
Greene said he had thrown out "thousands and thousands of dollars" worth of 
inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 A few businesses were managing some transactions, despite the inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 At D&G Escrow in Northridge Garden Center, no new loans or refinancings had 
been canceled because of the quake, said escrow officer Debbie Moreno, who is 
not related to the deli owners. The biggest immediate problem was the lack of 
bathroom facilities -- the toilet had flown off its bolts and crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But there were other worries as well. Moreno said that lenders had begun 
demanding reinspections on properties, a process that promised to delay 
closings of escrows.  
</P>
<P>
 For strip-mall owners, a major worry is that already depressed real estate 
values will fall even further because of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the chief concern of Burnam Family Properties, which owns the 
Northridge Garden Center, is trying to work with tenants to get them back in 
business as soon as possible, said property manager Linda Ellingson. That is in 
the owner's best interest, too, since the tenants all have clauses in their 
leases allowing them to forgo rent payments while they're out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 As aftershocks continued to roll through the area, some business owners turned 
to a type of gallows humor to stay calm. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kids at Heart, D'Angelo said she plans to proceed with a rubber stamp 
promotion on Saturday, even if she has to hold it on the sidewalk or in the 
parking lot outside her shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The stamps, in various animal shapes, all survived the quake. D'Angelo said 
she will sell them for half the regular price: "We'll call them 'earthquake 
boo-boos.' "  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The block of Reseda Boulevard between Plummer and Superior streets was the 
site of the Northridge earthquake's gravest tragedy, the deaths of 16 people in 
the collapse of the Northridge Meadows apartments.  
</P>
<P>
 The merchants on whom residents of the area rely -- the shopkeepers in the 
strip malls along both sides of Reseda -- suffered as well. The temblor brought 
most business to a halt; many shop owners are unsure if they will be able to 
recover.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the months ahead, The Times occasionally will revisit the block to tell 
these business people's stories.

VIEW FROM WASHINGTON / ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT: IT TAKES A STRONG STOMACH TO GET 
THE MOST OUT OF YOUR 401(K) PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT writes about banking, health care 
and other national issues from The Times' Washington bureau. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of you are cheating yourselves out of a decent retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 If your company has a salary set-aside plan for pensions, popularly called a 
401(k), you are probably picking investments that won't do a good job in 
building financial security. 
</P>
<P>
 The best bet for the long haul is the stock market, where mutual funds beat 
bonds, Treasury bills and bank certificates of deposit. But most of you don't 
have the stomach for the ups and downs of the market, the soaring and crashing 
of the Dow Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington policy-makers are trying to figure out ways to encourage American 
workers to overcome these fears and take a more aggressive approach to picking 
among 401(k) investment options. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Labor Department directed employers to offer at least three 
choices in these retirement plans and to give participants the chance to switch 
among them at least four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Only now, though, are government officials recognizing that workers are adrift 
in a sea of confusion and hesitancy. People are so fearful of losing money -- 
of suffering a temporary loss as the market fluctuates -- that they won't take 
risks that can pay off big and secure their retirement in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to do everything we can to help inform and educate people about 
investing," said Olena Berg, director of the Labor Department's Pension and 
Welfare Benefits Administration. She is talking about pamphlets, videos and 
public service announcements to get out the message. 
</P>
<P>
 Education means telling workers that they can end up with paltry retirement 
assets if they pick nothing more aggressive than Treasury bills or guaranteed 
investment contracts, financial instruments sold by insurance companies to 
pension plans. GICs today offer a relatively paltry 4.5% or 5% in exchange for 
tying your money up for three years. Treasury bills are returning slightly more 
than 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market may be a lot more volatile, but corporate shares can be 
expected to produce an annual return of 10% over the long haul. And that makes 
stock mutual funds the best bet for most people's retirement planning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The difference of a few percentage points may not look like a big deal. But as 
Sylvester Schieber of the Wyatt Co. benefits consulting firm points out, a 
dollar invested over 20 years at a 4% annual return produces $2.19, while the 
same dollar invested at 7% gives you $3.87. 
</P>
<P>
 Help from Washington to alert workers to the risks and rewards of their 
investments is long overdue. Do-it-yourself pensions such as 401(k) plans have 
virtually exploded to $1 trillion in assets last year, up from $343 billion a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional pension plans -- so-called defined benefit plans -- had $1.2 
trillion in assets last year, up from $700 billion 10 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 These plans reward longevity. The company promises a fixed monthly pension 
based on years of service. It contributes the cash and hires professional 
managers to direct the flow of funds into stocks, bonds, real estate and other 
assets. If the investments don't work out, the company comes up with extra 
money to pay the promised benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Pensions such as 401(k)s -- called defined contribution plans -- shift the 
risk and the worry to the worker. Workers contribute a percentage of their 
paycheck, with the company typically matching only a portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is guaranteed about these pension plans. The size of the monthly 
retirement check depends on the success of the investments selected by each 
worker. And sadly, most workers aren't carrying that burden very well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With workers letting their money wallow in low-risk investments, defined 
contribution plans commonly have rates of return two or three percentage points 
behind the old-style defined benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people never want to gamble with their own money," said Robert Guarnera, 
president of Pension Actuaries Inc. of Armonk, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to take too conservative an option," he said. "And there is no 
employer incentive to educate the worker." 
</P>
<P>
 Too many companies abdicate, giving workers an explanation of investment 
choices with all the clarity and readability of an advanced calculus textbook. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've created a monster with this do-it-yourself retirement," said Karen 
Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center in Washington. She wants 
business, workers and Congress to take a hard look at retirement policies that 
shift so much risk to workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the national debate could take years. Meanwhile, workers who have a 401(k) 
and want a decent retirement had better spend more time learning about their 
choices and thinking hard about the stock market -- even if it sometimes 
resembles a roller coaster.

MIKE PENNER: FOR FEDOROV, MVP IS WAY TO SPELL NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE PENNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ll the best, and some of the worst, from the first half of this 
new-and-expanded hockey season, in less time than it takes to explain the 
neutral-zone trap . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USA Today Still Misspells His Name, But He No Longer Cares: Detroit center 
Sergei Fedorov -- not Federov -- as Friday's USA Today headline had it -- has a 
chance to become the first European to win the NHL's most valuable player 
award. So far, it's been a stupendous season for the fourth-year pro from 
Pskov, Russia -- 32 goals, 77 points and a pay raise from $295,000 to $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 'He Would've Been Our Fourth Defenseman,' Barry Melrose Said, But That Was 
Back In July: From Oct. 6 on, Marty McSorley's alleged value to the Kings has 
soared like a rocket, with his departure being blamed for everything that ails 
the team, from lack of toughness, to erratic defense, to bad food on the team 
charter. With Pittsburgh, McSorley had three goals and 12 assists in his first 
36 games, yet he's the only thing separating the Kings from a 45-0-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Springsteen's Singing Songs About Philadelphia Now: They have the 
third-best record in the league. They have more victories than the Pittsburgh 
Penguins, the Montreal Canadiens and the Calgary Flames. They rank third in the 
league in fewest goals allowed. They are the New Jersey Devils. Now name three 
of their players. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll Believe It When We See It: The New York Rangers begin the second half 
with 63 points, tied with Toronto for most in the league, prompting "This is 
the year" speculation for, oh, the 54th time since the Rangers last won the 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Not What The Penguins Were Hoping For: Mario Lemieux leads the league in one 
department. Games Missed, 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Michael Jordan Would Help: The Chicago Blackhawks have scored fewer 
goals than the Mighty Ducks, averaging 2.98 per game. 
</P>
<P>
 How About Tugnutt For That Russian Guy, What's His Name, You Know, USA Today 
Wrote About Him?: What's a team with Fedorov, Steve Yzerman, Paul Coffey, Ray 
Sheppard, Dino Ciccarelli, Nicklas Lidstrom and Keith Primeau doing in second 
place in the Central Division, six points out at the All-Star break? It's 
called goaltending, and Detroit has yet to find anything close to it, even 
though Coach Scotty Bowman keeps trotting candidates out there -- Tim 
Cheveldae, Chris Osgood, Vincent Riendeau, Peter Ing. As Red Wing GM Bryan 
Murray poses trade possibilities by the hour, Detroit writers have taken to 
summarizing the situation this way: "Osgood and no good." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Again, Dale Hunter Can Out-Tackle Anyone On The Redskins: On a lark, 
Washington Redskins kicker Chip Lohmiller was invited to participate in the 
Washington Capitals' team skills competition -- and Lohmiller won the hardest 
slap shot contest. It should be noted that NHL slap shot champion Al Iafrate 
was injured at the time, but that didn't stop the other Capitals from slinking 
off the ice in embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 'Raspberry Bure' Would Also Help: The Mighty Ducks' Jekyll/Hyde first half -- 
12 victories on the road, only six at home -- has prompted much in-depth 
analysis (Is it the weather? The ice? The Decoys?), plus the occasional joke. 
Q: What do Prince and the Mighty Ducks have in common? A: Both can only play in 
purple. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, They've Been Leaving, One By One, For Years Now: Gretzky's gone, 
Messier's gone, Coffey's gone, Kurri's gone, Anderson's gone, Fuhr's gone, 
Tikkanen's gone, Simpson's gone, Lowe's gone, but the Edmonton Oilers are 
staying put, owner Peter Pocklington recently announced. The city of Edmonton 
can scarcely contain itself. 
</P>
<P>
 They Can't Wait For Expansion Into San Diego, Portland and Seattle: The San 
Jose Sharks are 5-0 against the Mighty Ducks, 10-21-10 against the rest of the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan Can't Hit Major League Pitching, But What About Gretzky?: On Dec. 28 
against Vancouver, Gretzky scored the goal of the year, and maybe the decade, 
when he swatted at a puck wobbling in mid-air, at least three feet off the 
ground, and drilled a line drive over the right shoulder of a stunned Kirk 
McLean, the Canuck goaltender that night. Videotape of the play was sent to all 
the networks, as well as Vero Beach, where Darryl Strawberry will soon be 
studying it. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing Is Everything I: With no pro football to televise in 1994, CBS suddenly 
has much air time available for hockey. Unfortunately for the NHL, the league 
signed a five-year working agreement with ESPN in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing Is Everything II: Under last season's playoff format, where the top 
four teams in each division advanced, the Mighty Ducks could qualify simply by 
finishing ahead of Edmonton and San Jose. Under the new format, where the top 
eight teams in the conference qualify, the Ducks must now beat out Edmonton, 
San Jose, Winnipeg and the Kings.

 At Least Dixon Ward Has Been A Better Replacement Than Jay Leno: Like Johnny, 
Jimmy Carson retired in Los Angeles. Unlike Johnny, Jimmy Carson is 25 years 
old, with 2 1/2 years remaining on a $3-million contract, so the Kings had to 
do something with him. Finally, in late December, Mr. Invisible was traded to 
Vancouver, Carson's fifth team since 1988.

MARYLAND STADIUM BOARD, RAMS DISCUSS ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Shaw, Ram executive vice president, met for the first time with 
representatives of the Maryland Stadium Authority this past week to discuss 
possibly moving the team to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parties wished to keep the meeting, conducted Thursday in New York, a 
secret. But sources said the stadium authority asked Shaw to provide a "letter 
of interest" to satisfy local politicians that the Rams were seriously 
considering Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no comment," Shaw said Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources in Baltimore said Shaw met with Herbert J. Belgrad, stadium authority 
chairman, and two other parties involved in Baltimore's pursuit to land a team. 
Belgrad led the city's drive to acquire an NFL expansion team and spearheaded 
the construction of Camden Yards for the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The meeting was preliminary, and underline the word preliminary," the source 
said. He also said it was unlikely the Rams would provide any letter of 
interest anytime soon because it might limit their options. 
</P>
<P>
 In Maryland, however, Gov. William Donald Schaefer and the legislature have 
said they want indications of an NFL team's willingness to relocate in 
Baltimore by Feb. 14. If none steps forward: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Schaefer reportedly will support the Washington Redskins' proposed move to 
Laurel, Md. Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke is pushing hard to build a stadium in 
Laurel, 15 miles south of Baltimore, in time to begin play in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The legislature, which has approved the sale of bonds to build a $165 
million stadium for a prospective NFL tenant, has threatened to take away those 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But a team source said Shaw isn't overly concerned about the deadline, and "it 
might be months" before any action is taken regarding a move. The Rams will not 
formally invoke the escape clause in their Anaheim Stadium lease until early 
May and are not expected to make a final decision regarding a move until early 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryland Stadium Authority is expected to sign a deal to bring a Canadian 
Football League franchise to Baltimore's Memorial Stadium in the next few 
weeks. But, sources said, the CFL's arrival would have no impact on efforts to 
lure the NFL.

JIM MURRAY: GEN. PFUND NEEDS A FEW GOOD MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In May of 1940, the French general, Maxime Weygand, had just replaced Gen. 
Maurice Gamelin as the high commander and flew over the battlefields of 
retreating, routed Allied forces below and announced to the world, "They have 
handed me a disaster!" 
</P>
<P>
 I have often wondered if Randy Pfund didn't feel the same way when they handed 
him the leadership of the Los Angeles Lakers in the fall of 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 He was taking over the command of an elite group with a proud history. The 
L.A. Lakers, like the Allied armies, had a proud history of victory and 
conquest. Great men had appeared in their uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 In sport, you spoke of the Yankees, Notre Dame, Calumet, the Boston Celtics -- 
and the L.A. Lakers. They had the greatest players of the ages and their shirts 
were hanging in the rafters -- Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
 Pfund had hardly rolled up his sleeves or dusted off a blackboard before he 
got hit with the first bad news -- Magic Johnson, hounded out of the league by 
his disease, which causes AIDS, and players opposed to contact with him, 
changed his mind about coming back and hung up his sneakers again.  
</P>
<P>
 Coach Pfund looked out on the floor and saw, not the marquee players of the 
past, but guys named Smith or Jones, a Cooper who wasn't Michael and a team 
whose principal consistency was turnovers.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, they set out to help him. So, they got him -- are you ready for this? -- 
Benoit Benjamin! It was like throwing a drowning man a brick. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't so much a team as a tryout camp. It had no floor leadership. Magic 
took that with him. Sometimes the players played as if they hadn't been 
introduced to each other. Sometimes they played as if they didn't like each 
other. There was no direction, no inspiration.  
</P>
<P>
 James Worthy was no Magic, but that's no knock. Hardly anybody is. Magic could 
go up in the stands and find four ushers and turn them into a team. He might 
even have gotten Benjamin interested.  
</P>
<P>
 But this was no Magic act. This was no "Showtime." This was home movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers were orphaned. The coaches left. Pat Riley, Mike Dunleavy. So did 
players. Byron Scott, A.C. Green. Magic. The ship was sinking and the radio was 
broke.  
</P>
<P>
 And this mess was Randy Pfund's. Put the rabbit back in the hat. Get three 
doves out of a handkerchief. Do a Houdini, they told him.  
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is, with what he had to work with, there'd be a danger this magic 
act would actually saw the woman in half. This act didn't need mirrors, it 
needed miracles.  
</P>
<P>
 In other towns, you know the team is going bad when the press gets on it, the 
talk shows get nasty and the ticket sales fall off. In L.A., you know when 
Hollywood deserts you. Hollywood does not want anything to do with a flop. It 
might be catching.  
</P>
<P>
 So, they stayed away in droves. No Dyan Cannon shaking her blond locks at 
courtside. No agents crowding the owner's box. Jack Nicholson has taken up 
golf, that's how bad things are. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what they gave to Randy, and it's no Pfun. He is the most visible 
object for fan and media criticism. No one blames the players. Nobody knows who 
they are.  
</P>
<P>
 The other night, the Lakers got their 12th victory of the season (but, shucks! 
it's only late January!) as, calling on Lord knows what reserves of energy and 
memory, Worthy threw in 22, using some sturdy picks by Vlade Divac.  
</P>
<P>
 They beat a Phoenix team that was minus Charles Barkley, Kevin Johnson and, by 
the end of the game, Coach Paul Westphal (ejection) and Danny Ainge (ankle), 
107-102. But the Lakers, who had lost four in a row, take their victories 
wherever they find them these days.  
</P>
<P>
 "Do you ever wish you could look out there and see Magic, and Abdul-Jabbar and 
Cooper running those plays?" Pfund was asked after the game. He laughed. "Only 
about once a week," he said, smiling.  
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he added, "I try to emphasize to the young guys what a great 
tradition they're stepping into when they put on those gold jerseys. I want 
them to realize they're successors to a history so rich in basketball lore. But 
at the same time, I don't want them to be intimidated by it. Even the Yankees 
had to go on after Ruth and Gehrig and DiMaggio and Mantle.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have some good young players the public doesn't know about. Sedale Threatt 
had a monster night tonight (19 points, five assists, two steals). Worthy was 
'Big Game James' (22 points, five assists). George Lynch is going to be an 
outstanding player (17 points, seven rebunds, six assists, four steals).  
</P>
<P>
 "What does this team need? A pillar. Someone we count on, someone we go to. If 
you don't have a pillar, you don't have cohesion. You have confusion. I don't 
say you have to have a Larry Bird or a Magic, but you need a reasonable 
facsimile. A Charles Barkley. It gives your team identification, it focuses 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Is he saying it's a one-man game? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, even a (Michael) Jordan needs a strong supporting cast. But you have that 
in place, and then you find the man that brings it all together.  
</P>
<P>
 "You'll find," he added, "that today's players are slower to become 
superstars." 
</P>
<P>
 But didn't Magic Johnson do exactly that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Earvin was one who could do anything," Pfund says. "But some of these players 
we have, the George Lynches, the Nick Van Exels, are the stars of tomorrow. But 
it's going to take time. That's what you have to believe and work for. And 
teach.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, it's frustrating. A Vlade can be great one night -- and the next 
night you wonder where he went. You work on overcoming that. You don't dwell on 
the negatives. That's not the Laker way, either. " 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Gen. Pfund doesn't believe he has been handed a disaster. He 
believes he has been handed an opportunity.

NFL PLAYOFFS; NFC'S BEST CAN PUT UP OR SHUT UP; PRO FOOTBALL: CONFIDENT COWBOYS 
EXPECT THE USUAL STRONG GAME FROM SMITH IN REMATCH AGAINST 49ERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson has guaranteed a Cowboy victory. A week ago, San 
Francisco Coach George Seifert wasn't sure his 49ers could handle Hoopla High 
in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 With contrasting coaching styles, powerhouse offenses and most of the NFL's 
best-known stars, does it really matter who is playing in that other game 
today? 
</P>
<P>
 "You said that right -- that other game," Johnson said. "The NFC has won, I 
guess, nine Super Bowls in a row. So it's an indication that the winner of this 
game may be the best team in professional football again." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers and Cowboys, who will play the first NFC championship game in Texas 
Stadium since Jan. 1, 1978, tangled for the title a year ago in Candlestick 
Park. The Cowboys won, 30-20, before moving on to crush Buffalo, 52-17, in the 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 In a regular-season rematch with the 49ers earlier this season in Dallas, the 
Cowboys won again, 26-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing the best team in football in their home," said Seifert, who 
added that his team was in disarray before beating the Giants, 44-3, last week. 
"The level of competition now is about as tough as we've faced since I've been 
the head coach here. In fact, it's probably the toughest that I've faced since 
I've been the head coach." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, who have won 32 of their last 40 games, have proved recently that 
they are the best team in football -- as long as running back Emmitt Smith is 
in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith will start for the Cowboys today, but he remains bothered by a shoulder 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy laid his good hands upon my shoulder and my shoulder decided to be 
well," Smith said. "So it feels very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Without Smith, who sat out the first two games this season because of a 
contract dispute, the Cowboys couldn't win. They lost to the Redskins, 35-16, 
and then fell to the Bills, 13-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith signed, and the Cowboys went on a seven-game winning streak. He suffered 
a thigh injury on his first carry against Atlanta, left the game and the 
Cowboys lost, 27-14. Bothered by the same injury a week later, Smith played 
against Miami, but the Cowboys were stopped, 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on two sound legs, Smith went on to win the NFL rushing title, and the 
Cowboys closed out the regular season with four consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very clear what Emmitt Smith means to this team," Cowboy 
quarterback Troy Aikman said. "We're a completely different team with his 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
 In last season's championship victory, Smith scored two touchdowns, ran 24 
times for 114 yards and caught seven passes for 59 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emmitt Smith will be fine," Seifert said. "Even if he isn't 100%, what he 
brings to them emotionally will be significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith carried only twice for 10 yards in the second half last week against 
Green Bay after the shoulder injury he suffered against the Giants a week 
earlier flared up. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always an opportunity to stick that needle in that shoulder if I need 
it," said Smith, who has rejected anti-inflammatory injections all week. "I 
think a shot is still a possibility. I will do whatever it takes to be on the 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Cowboys rely on Smith, the 49ers have Ricky Watters. The Cowboys 
also have Michael Irvin and Jay Novacek. The 49ers counter with Jerry Rice and 
Brent Jones. The Cowboys have Aikman and the 49ers have Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole gang is going to be there," Cowboy guard Nate Newton said. "What a 
great game to watch. We're going to light it up, they are going to light it up, 
and it's going to be quite a show." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers had the No. 1 scoring offense in the league this season. Young, who 
continues to fight comparisons with Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana, 
finished second to Smith in voting for most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Steve Young has won a Super Bowl, has he?" Johnson asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "With what Troy has accomplished, there's no lingering doubt in his mind of 
what he's capable of. Troy is confident he can do everything there is to 
accomplish as a quarterback. He doesn't have any doubts hanging over his head." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman doesn't make many mistakes -- only six of his 392 passes were 
intercepted this season. Young tries to make things happen -- he threw a 
league-high 29 touchdown passes, but had 16 passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Young completed 68% of his passes; Aikman 69.1%. Young will scramble, and 
Aikman will throw the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offense is awesome," Young said. "We think we can move the ball at any 
time against anybody if we avoid turnovers. We just have to make sure we don't 
stop ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean we can't win if we turn the ball over. But in the two games 
we've played against Dallas, that seemed to be the key." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers lost the ball four times in last year's title game, while the 
Cowboys did not have a turnover. This season, the 49ers had two turnovers, the 
Cowboys had one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys have speed on defense, while the 49ers have concerns. The Dallas 
defense gave up one touchdown or fewer in 12 of its 16 regular-season games. 
The 49er defense gave up three or more touchdowns in a game six times this 
season, and only Miami, Atlanta and Washington surrendered more passing 
touchdowns than San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defenses shouldn't even show up the way everybody has been talking about 
the offenses," Cowboy linebacker Ken Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said 49er safety Tim McDonald: "We played some good games defensively, then 
came back and didn't play as well. Suddenly, we were the worst defensive team 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have to play the Cowboys and they're the defending Super Bowl 
champions. They have all the edge in the world. They're the team to beat. The 
pressure is on them." 
</P>
<P>
 What pressure? The Cowboys are going to win. Jimmy Johnson said so.

THE JURY ON JOE; THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS BELIEVED THEY NEEDED JOE MONTANA TO 
REACH THE SUPER BOWL. THE SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS THOUGHT STEVE YOUNG WAS THE 
QUARTERBACK FOR THEM. WITH THE CHIEFS AND 49ERS A VICTORY AWAY FROM WHAT WOULD 
BE A CLASSIC SUPER BOWL SHOWDOWN, THE DEBATE STILL RAGES ABOUT WHO GOT THE 
BETTER DEAL. TODAY'S CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP TESTS WILL BE STRICTLY . . . PASS 
OR FAIL; GREAT DEBATE NEVER ENDS FOR DIVIDED FANS OF 49ERS; PRO FOOTBALL: WHILE

 It's drive time, three days before game time, 6:26 p.m. on Thursday. 
Interstate 280 northbound toward Cupertino is jammed with motorists, the radio 
airways with callers, none of whom give a Dick Button flying camel about figure 
skating. 
</P>
<P>
 You wonder if the Silicon Valley wonks would know Tonya Harding from Warren G. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry on a car phone clearly wishes to apply a cellular headlock on San 
Francisco Chronicle columnist Lowell Cohn, a guest on Ralph Barbieri's sports 
talk radio show on KNBR. Cohn's article that day had re-examined -- for, oh, 
maybe the billionth time -- the difficulties of being 49er quarterback Steve 
Young in Joe Montana's town. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn wrote that Young appeared nervous at a Wednesday press briefing before 
Sunday's NFC championship game against the Dallas Cowboys, noting the 
quarterback had "dry mouth, the forced smile of someone who was not at ease 
with himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry is sick of this "pseudo-psychological probing," and warns Cohn he is 
only putting more pressure on the quarterback who had dared replace Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he feels pressure from the article, he's got a real problem," Cohn shoots 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 John from Hayward phones in at 6:30 to say only a fool would compare Montana 
and Young: "When Joe comes on the field, you don't want to change the channel." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been like this for months in the Bay Area, which is in the throes of a 
major anxiety attack over the prospects of a San Francisco-Kansas City Super 
Bowl that would pit its beloved 49ers against its beloved expatriate 
quarterback, Montana, who led the team to four Super Bowls before departing 
with such sweet sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the way of this matchup -- which would no doubt unleash an 
emotional civil war in Bay Area -- is Sunday. San Francisco must dispose of the 
defending Super Bowl champion Cowboys, and Kansas City must defeat Buffalo in 
the AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like a death wish," said Bud Geracie, sports columnist for the 
San Jose Mercury News. "But everybody wants it." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody. Fans, players, milkmen, nuns. No matter the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that it might further split 49er loyalties into Young camps and 
Montana camps and reopen old wounds. No matter that it might force fans to 
choose between a team and a god. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that a Montana victory over Young might cause irreparable damage to 
Young's 
</P>
<P>
 psyche and send the 49ers spiraling downward. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral dilemma: Could a die-hard 49er fan root against them in a game 
against Montana, the quarterback who gave San Francisco the best years of his 
life? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are three groups," Geracie explains. "There are Joe's people, the 
Branch Montanians, as they're called. There are Steve's people and a group that 
is torn between Joe and Steve. Of the groups, I think Steve's got the smallest 
following." 
</P>
<P>
 Young is in an almost impossible position. Since taking over for Montana in 
1991, he has won three consecutive NFL passing titles and a 
most-valuable-player award. But until he wins a Super Bowl, he cannot escape 
the shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans here are ruthless, they really are," Mike Garcia, 30, a longtime 
49er fan, said as he sipped on a beer at the Sports City Cafe in Cupertino. 
"Steve's at a very critical point in his career. Joe's in a no-lose situation." 
</P>
<P>
 That the rickety Montana, 37 and holding, is turning broadcasters to mush with 
his heroics does not help Young's cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire Bay Area wants to see this matchup," San Francisco Examiner 
columnist Art Spander says. "If Joe gets in and Steve doesn't, it'll be just 
awful for Steve." 
</P>
<P>
 In case the dream matchup doesn't actually come off, many think it's necessary 
to jump on this story in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kansas City, Montana said he "couldn't care less" about meeting Young in 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 49er training facility in Santa Clara, players were interrogated about 
the possibility. Receiver Jerry Rice, an unabashed Montana supporter, said he 
was tired of making the comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 In back-handed fashion, he noted Young is "going to get better in years to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice also told reporters he would certainly do his best to beat Montana's 
Chiefs should the teams meet in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like if we get together in the Super Bowl I'm going to say, 'Joe, 
I've been so many years with you, I'm going to drop this pass for you,' " Rice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is safe to assume, though, that several 49ers have been following Montana 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Wright, a San Francisco assistant who played on all four 49er Super Bowl 
teams, said it would be strange facing his former teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be hard for me," Wright said. "The whole season in Kansas City, the 
guys have been pulling for him. We'll always be friends, but no matter how good 
of friends we are, when you put on that foreign uniform, it's all business." 
</P>
<P>
 Though there's no quantifying the emotions, it appears most 49er fans feel as 
Wright does. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Gomez, 34, a San Jose resident and die-hard 49er fan, stood outside the 
team's complex Thursday, hoping to collect a few autographs. An employee of 
Santa Clara County, Gomez estimates he makes the trip about seven times a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 He was standing behind the same thick brush last April the day Montana decided 
to accept an offer from the Chiefs, ending a chaotic 48-hour saga in the Bay 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana, who had missed most of two seasons because of injuries, had returned 
to a hero's welcome to play the second half in the team's final regular-season 
game in 1992, rekindling all the old memories. 
</P>
<P>
 He was back in uniform for the playoffs as an understudy to Young, though it 
seemed clear Montana would not accept the role for long. 
</P>
<P>
 After the season, 49er Coach George Seifert ended the speculation when he 
named Young the team's starter for 1993. Montana was allowed to seek his own 
trade. After he settled on Kansas City, 49er management changed its mind and 
announced that Montana would be the "designated starter" if he remained. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez and dozens of others swarmed the complex that April day, hoping for an 
explanation, or a glimpse of Joe, who was inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stood out here the day he left," Gomez said. "It was sad. There was one 
guy out here crying. It was like losing one of his kids. He had this truck, and 
it was all decorated with 49er mementos." 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked which team he would root for in a San Francisco-Kansas City 
Super bowl, Gomez did not hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm rooting for San Francisco," he said. "Joe? He's gone now. He's not here. 
You've got to focus on the team you're standing behind. I'm not talking bad 
about him, but he's gone. And the day he left, he never said goodby. We stood 
out here behind the brush. He should have addressed the people. He didn't 
address anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The great Montana-Young debate spills into the Bay Area bars at night. You can 
find lively discussion most evenings at the Sports City Cafe, a favorite 49er 
hangout. Five investors in the restaurant are former 49ers -- Wright, Ronnie 
Lott, Keena Turner, Roger Craig and Carlton Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 Current and former players often frequent the cafe. Montana used to dine and 
drink there. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Williams, the restaurant's general manager, moved to the Bay Area in 
1979 -- from Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a lifelong Chief fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe being there now really helps me," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is strong Montana sentiment at the Sports City Cafe, it remains 
a 49er establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the prospective Super Bowl matchup, Williams predicted: "I'd say most 
people will pull for the 49ers, but I don't think they'd be heartbroken if the 
Chiefs won." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cafe's regulars agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my team," Ed Ford, a San Jose bankruptcy appraiser, said as he sipped 
on a glass of red wine. "This is why I live here. Joe Montana's not on my team. 
He's a wonderful guy, but this is my team." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garcia said it was best that Montana left. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was still here, you would have had all that turmoil," Garcia said. 
"Neither team would have been in this position had the trade not been made." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Kusal, an employee of the Air Force, said he could never root against 
Montana, no matter the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Kusal said he hoped Montana will lead a last-minute drive to beat the 49ers in 
the Super Bowl to show the organization it made a mistake by allowing Montana 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "You believe when he's in there, you'll win," Kusal said. "Half of winning is 
believing you'll win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young can win a game, 44-3, and Montana can win a game 27-24. That's the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no telling how San Francisco will cope if the great game actually 
comes off. 
</P>
<P>
 Geracie, the Mercury News columnist, guesses there won't be enough ink for the 
presses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be maddening," he said. "You could conceivably go to the Super Bowl 
(in Atlanta) and not do anything but write about those two the whole week, 
maybe without leaving your room."

 Joe Montana. Steve Young. Torn between two quarterbacks, you pluck the daisy 
petals of your mind. You play Joe. You play Joe not. You play Joe. You play Joe 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 QB or not QB, that is the question. 
</P>
<P>
 This has happened before. Sean Connery and Roger Moore. Richard Nixon and 
Gerald Ford. Shelley Long and Kirstie Alley. You have an original and you have 
a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Pipp and Lou Gehrig. Michael Crawford and Davis Gaines. George Patton 
and Omar Bradley. By necessity, you must exchange one for the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Best and Ringo Starr. Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. Dick York and 
Dick Sargent. Sometimes things change for the better; sometimes not. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing can be murder. Ingrid Bergman had to choose between Paul Henreid and 
Humphrey Bogart. Lady Guinevere had to choose between King Arthur and Sir 
Lancelot. One had done so much for her. One could do so much for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Devotion. Emotion. Devotion. Emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Hoffa expected his job back. Frank Fitzsimmons had other ideas. Fitz 
enjoyed running the Teamsters. And they weren't exactly suffering without 
Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyalty. Logic. Loyalty. Logic. 
</P>
<P>
 Coca-Cola gets the heave-ho. "New" Coke is introduced. Research supports the 
revised formula. Customers prefer the classic. 
</P>
<P>
 In with the old. Out with the new. 
</P>
<P>
 San Franciscans longed to have Montana back. 49ers felt that Young was, well, 
Young Montanastein. They considered him the "New" Montana. But customers 
preferred the classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments raged. We owe Joe. Yes, but we need Steve. Joe, don't go. Steve 
can't leave. Joe was MVP. Steve is MVP. Joe got us where we are today. No, Joe 
got us where we were yesterday. Steve is better for us today. Yes, but Joe is 
Joe. Joe is our hero. Steve is our future. Don't forget the past. Don't stop 
thinking about tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough call. 
</P>
<P>
 But OK, here are 49 reasons why the 49ers should have no regrets, no matter 
how it must hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Sometimes you have to sacrifice a Mike Scioscia to try a Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 2. At the last minute, they did offer Joe his job back. He left anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Montana's body is in so many pieces, kids could play with it like Lego. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Steve Young is so good, he passes to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Young's young. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Without him, the 49ers might have beaten the Rams by only three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 7. The only thing Young would have done differently with Dwight Clark would 
have been throwing to the left corner of that end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Yes, Joe did have a whole town in Montana named after him. But Steve had a 
whole college named after his great-great-granddaddy Brigham. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Ronnie Lott got the 49ers to all those Super Bowls, too. But they replaced 
him , didn't they? 
</P>
<P>
 10. Missouri needed Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Montana's receivers aren't the only ones who know how to spike footballs 
on banners of Buddy Ryan's face. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Joe missed five games in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 13. Joe missed 15 games in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 14. Joe missed 16 games in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 15. Steve threw 29 touchdown passes this season. Joe threw 13. 
</P>
<P>
 16. Steve passed for 4,023 yards. Joe for 2,144. 
</P>
<P>
 17. It wasn't Young's fault that Dallas came up with Troy Aikman and Emmitt 
Smith just as he was taking Montana's place. 
</P>
<P>
 18-48. Steve had to play with Tampa Bay. The poor man's been through hell. 
Give him a break. 
</P>
<P>
 49. With quarterbacks, there are no guarantees. There are only options.

THE JURY ON JOE; THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS BELIEVED THEY NEEDED JOE MONTANA TO

QUARTERBACK FOR THEM. WITH THE CHIEFS AND 49ERS A VICTORY AWAY FROM WHAT WOULD

<P>
 Weird, primal screams began to bounce last Sunday afternoon across the 
back-yard fences of the wooded San Francisco suburb where I live. The faithful 
were communicating and the message was clear. Joe Montana was doing it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time Montana completed a big pass against the Houston Oilers, the 
neighbors would break from their television, throw open the back door and whoop 
with joy. I heard them because I was standing at my back door, too. Whooping. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, many people consider such behavior crazy. Many people, and especially 
those who write for the sports pages -- and thus consider themselves 
sufficiently clear-eyed, cut-throat and savvy to serve as general managers of 
any team, any sport -- can't understand why many San Francisco fans persist in 
rooting for Montana. How, they ask, can anyone fail to see the wisdom in 
letting old Joe migrate to Kansas City? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, let me try to explain. You see, these fans know -- as Montana knows, as 
some of his former teammates hint they know, as the owner must know and as even 
Steve Young knows or, at least, suspects -- that the 49ers blundered, and 
blundered badly, by letting Montana slip away.  
</P>
<P>
 They didn't make their team any better on the field. They didn't make their 
fans any happier in the stands. They didn't secure their future. All they did 
was take the best quarterback ever to play, a popular fellow who managed to be 
at once both charismatic and self-effacing, and show him the door.  
</P>
<P>
 Makes sense to me.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps some history is in order. When I started rooting for the 49ers as a 
kid, the team's only marquee player was a kickoff returner named Abe Woodson. 
Now think about that. Only on a truly bad team does the poor guy who runs back 
kicks after opponents score emerge as a star. And the old 49ers were bad. We 
fans called ourselves the 49er faithful, and season after season we endured a 
succession of George Mira and Steve Spurrier and Steve DeBerg. Yes, there was 
John Brodie, but he was never quite able to move past Dallas.  
</P>
<P>
 Then came Joe. Early in that 1982 NFC championship game against Dallas, the 
contest that later produced "the Catch," Montana slipped a touchdown pass low 
and hard to a kneeling Dwight Clark.  
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback thrust his arms into the sky, and then trotted on spindly legs 
toward Too Tall Jones, all 6 feet 9 of him. The Dallas defender had been 
babbling all week about how the almighty Cowboys did not respect the upstart 
49ers. Montana looked Jones in the eye and said, "Respect that. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I love that story. It goes to the heart of understanding the deep, residual 
loyalty to Montana, a relationship that almost transcends football -- a bond 
that in and of itself should have been enough to persuade the 49ers to keep 
Montana in San Francisco.  
</P>
<P>
 Montana emerged amid a dark season in this city. Jonestown. Mayoral 
assassination. AIDS. A shrinking municipal importance, especially in 
relationship to rival Los Angeles. With Montana, the 49ers cut against the 
downward grain.  
</P>
<P>
 There were times when, for many San Franciscans, it seemed the only thing they 
could count on was Montana delivering in the clutch. Cable cars might break 
down, ports might close, but Montana always could find someone in the back of 
the end zone. Respect that. At least.  
</P>
<P>
 The hard-hearts who run teams or write about them will snicker at such 
sentimentality. Fans, schmans. Joe was old. Joe was scarred. Joe had to go. And 
forget about the unwritten NFL rule that starters don't lose their jobs because 
of injury. With Joe, who was sound again by midseason last year but confined to 
the bench -- forced to watch, along with the rest of us, as Young and the rest 
fell to Dallas -- with Joe, they rewrote the rule.  
</P>
<P>
 Just why the 49ers were so bent on moving Montana is a mystery. My hunch is 
that it had more to do with ego than economics or competitive edges. My hunch 
is that from the top down, there was a clandestine desire to show that the job 
could be done without Montana.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, if so, we are still waiting for the proof. They always want to talk 
numbers, the supporters of Young. Efficiency ratings. Touchdown totals. 
Yardage. Without question Montana's former back-up has posted some gawdy stats. 
So did DeBerg, the first quarterback in the Bill Walsh system. So did Jeff 
Kemp, who replaced Montana after a back injury. The 49er system produces 
passing yardage faster than McDonald's makes hamburgers.  
</P>
<P>
 The system, though, won't take you all the way. DeBerg had a bad habit of 
killing drives on the 10-yard line. Montana took over and found the end zone. 
He also found the Super Bowl. Steve Young has not. In comparing the 
quarterbacks, here's a number that trumps all others: Montana 4, Young 0.  
</P>
<P>
 But age, they clamor, age. Listen. Everyone understands Montana's best days 
are behind him. His legs show it more than anything. So what? He is still 
winning, isn't he? More to the point, he is still entertaining.  
</P>
<P>
 In a way, Montana's physical decline has made him even more fascinating to 
watch. Stripped of his quickness and once perfect athletic form, he now must 
rely on those less tangible strengths that set him apart from all the other 
chuckers and scramblers all along: His instincts for the game. His competitive 
fire. There is a purity now to his performances.  
</P>
<P>
 Trust me, ticket sales here would not have dropped if Montana had remained. 
And, judging by what Montana has done with the Chiefs -- sans Jerry Rice, Ricky 
Watters, John Taylor and the rest -- neither would the number of victories.  
</P>
<P>
 And here is the extra point: Young himself is no spring chicken, and at the 
rate he absorbs head blows, in a couple of years he'll be a punch-drunk, 
ex-scrambler -- and headed for the backside of 30. And so the clamor will begin 
to move No. 8 out to pasture.  
</P>
<P>
 No, the 49ers didn't buy much time keeping Young at the expense of Montana. 
They didn't buy much of anything. What did they get for Montana? A fourth-round 
draft pick? Brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, though, if they had traded Young last year instead of cutting loose 
Montana. Young was the league MVP -- or so the sportswriters voted. He could 
have brought the 49ers a lot -- for example, the rights to a hot rookie 
quarterback like Rick Mirer, and maybe even a few good defenders. Like Ronnie 
Lott. (Another story.) 
</P>
<P>
 In this scenario, Montana's replacement could have learned for a couple years 
under the master himself. There could have been a graceful transition. Fans and 
Montana and the city could have grown comfortable together with the prospect of 
fall without No. 16. Anything wrong with that? Even Young, freed of Montana's 
shadow, might have been better off.  
</P>
<P>
 But now I am sounding like a general manager wanna-be myself. Let me say it 
simply: More than anything else, the 49ers owed it to their fans to keep 
Montana.  
</P>
<P>
 Fans don't count for much in the NFL, and neither, for that matter, do 
players. The relationship between Montana and the 49er followers transcended 
the typically contrived and shallow loyalty of pro sports. It was a special, 
rare bond between a player and the people like myself who enjoyed watching him 
play. Call us cultists, call us idiots. The bond remains unbroken.  
</P>
<P>
 And should that San Francisco-Kansas City dream matchup occur in the Super 
Bowl, my loyalties will be clear.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm going to root for the 49ers.  
</P>
<P>
 And also, for the Chief.

BOWLING; DUKE STRIKES EARLY, BEATS SMITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNYDER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Norm Duke was never out of the pocket and methodically defeated amateur for 
the AC/Delco Professional Bowlers Assn. title Saturday at Cal Bowl in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke, one of the smallest pro bowlers at 5 feet 5, won his fifth championship 
in 11 years on the tour, 247-223. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke, from Oklahoma City, had Smith on the ropes early. He opened with four 
strikes while the 20-year-old from Moorpark struggled to get started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous at the beginning," said Smith, the 1993 National 
Amateur champion. "I changed to the out-and-in shot that Norm was using in the 
fourth frame." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith then struck five times, but it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke, seeded second in the playoffs, disposed of Ft. Lauderdale's Steve 
Wilson, 276-213, to reach the finals, where he won $44,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his elimination, Wilson whipped Justin Hromek, 204-169, and Ken 
Muscato, 210-187. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke praised Smith as a "future star in pro bowling. To me, he's no amateur. 
In the eyes of the pros, he's already a professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is a member of Team USA. He said he will be in Colorado Springs, Colo., 
next week for Olympic training, and he will bowl in the U.S. Open in April at 
Troy, Mich.

<P>
 Shaw reportedly met secretly with Herbert J. Belgrad, chairman of the Maryland 
Stadium Authority, and two other interested parties involved in Baltimore's 
quest for a team.

BACKUP ROLE SUITS KELM FINE; FOOTBALL: AFTER SURPRISE RELEASE FROM RAMS, 
LINEBACKER IS GLAD TO BE PLAYING IN THE LEAGUE, MUCH LESS FOR THE 49ERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 By mid-September, Larry Kelm had checked in his shoulder pads and was checking 
out library books. 
</P>
<P>
 Books on resume writing, interviewing and making contacts in the cut-throat 
job market. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut by the Rams at the end of training camp, Kelm was ready to put his career 
as a middle linebacker on hold -- at least for the rest of this season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time to put that civil engineering degree to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was looking grim two weeks into the season," he said. "I wasn't getting 
interest from any team in the league. Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still had intentions of coming into camp somewhere next year. I wasn't 
going to sit down and not pursue anything in the off-season. But in the 
meantime, I figured I had better go looking for a job." 
</P>
<P>
 He found one . . . in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed by the 49ers after the third week of the season, Kelm discovered he 
didn't need those library books -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 He's no longer a starter, which he was with the Rams the past four seasons. 
But Kelm doesn't mind being a backup linebacker and special teams specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Not when he's playing for the 49ers, who meet the Dallas Cowboys today in the 
NFC championship game. And not when he's one game from the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelm has reached the playoffs for the first time since the Rams made the 1990 
NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," he said. "The way things had gone with the Rams the past few 
years just shows you how hard it is to get to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something you shouldn't take lightly. I remember back to 1988 and '89, 
it was like, 'Hey, we go to the playoffs all the time.' I learned that it's not 
that way. " 
</P>
<P>
 Kelm had missed the Rams' first nine games in 1989 with an injured left foot, 
but started the final 10, including the playoffs. He had 11 tackles at New 
England in the regular-season finale and had 10 in the conference championship 
game against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 The next season, he tore a posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in the 
final exhibition game and started the regular season on injured reserve. He 
underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair the small tear, and started the final 
10 games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That spell of injuries really hurt me," Kelm said. "Those were two years 
where I was supposed to be the guy. It's been a struggle ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 He started 15 games in 1991 and his 105 tackles were the most by any Ram in 
five seasons. But the Rams lost their final 10 games of the season, and 
finished 3-13. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Kelm had only 70 tackles in 14 starts, and the Rams went 6-10 in 
Chuck Knox's first year back as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 After the season, a run-stopping linebacker was at the top of Knox's 
free-agent shopping list. 
</P>
<P>
 And he found one in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams signed free agent Shane Conlan to a multimillion dollar deal, leaving 
Kelm wondering about his future when training camp started in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting cut caught me off-guard," he said. "They (coaches, front office) 
never let on that I had much to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was OK when camp started up. The coaches kept telling me, 'We 
signed Shane but we still want you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After a couple weeks of soul searching and job hunting around the league, Kelm 
figured he was finished for the season. Maybe it was time to enter the 
eight-to-five working world. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 49ers, who were searching for some depth at linebacker because of 
Keith DeLong's foot injury. Jeff Fisher, the former Ram defensive coordinator 
and now the 49er secondary coach, put in a good word for Kelm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fisher had a lot to do with it," Kelm said. "He had a lot of nice things to 
say about me, and that helped get me up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelm flew to San Francisco, where he was picked up at the airport by 49er 
linebacker Brett Faryniarz, a friend and former teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 Faryniarz drove Kelm to the team's Santa Clara practice facility to sign his 
contract. Afterward, Faryniarz was going to move Kelm into his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they arrived at the 49ers' practice facility, Faryniarz was told that 
he was being waived to make room for Kelm. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is life in the NFL -- as Kelm learned two weeks later when the 49ers 
waived him. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong had recovered from his foot injury, and the 49ers wanted to move a 
player up from the practice squad to protect him from being signed by another 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the most expendable guy," Kelm said. 
</P>
<P>
 But DeLong reinjured his foot and was placed on injured reserve. The 49ers 
re-signed Kelm on Oct. 19, and he has been with the team since. 
</P>
<P>
 He started one game -- Tampa Bay -- but has otherwise been used in blowouts 
and on special teams coverage, where he will get most of his work in today's 
game.  
</P>
<P>
 The game is a homecoming of sorts for Kelm, who grew up in Corpus Christi, 
Tex., and played at Texas A&M. His parents are still in Corpus Christi and his 
wife Lynann's family is in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of people bugging me for tickets," Kelm said. "It's been a 
crazy week." 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly started that way early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 49ers' 44-3 victory over the New York Giants, Kelm and his wife 
returned to Southern California Sunday to spend his days off. They had barely 
settled into their Trabuco Canyon home early Monday morning when . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything started shaking," Kelm said. "Wouldn't you know it, the earthquake 
hit. It knocked me right out of bed."

NHL / ALL-STAR GAME NOTES; YOUNGSTER PLAYS LIKE A VETERAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid all the all-stars, there was only one rookie, Ottawa's Alexei Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a 20-year-old Russian who is still learning English, and he is still a 
stranger in this crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a good young player on a bad team and was selected to play in the NHL 
All-Star game only after the Senators' lone all-star, Bob Kudelski, was traded 
to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yashin, the replacement, managed to belong, scoring two goals against the 
NHL's best, including the game-winner in the Eastern Conference's 9-8 victory 
Saturday at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very fortunate," Yashin said through an interpreter. "My teammates were 
very generous and very friendly. I was glad I could help with two goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Yashin, a center, was taken second overall in the 1992 draft but did not join 
the Senators until this season. His teammate, Alexandre Daigle, the No. 1 pick 
overall last June, was the preseason choice for league rookie of the year, but 
Yashin has overshadowed him. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 3 1/2 and 216 pounds, he will overshadow a lot of people. Yashin has 
20 goals, tying him with Philadelphia' Mikael Renberg for the rookie lead, and 
leads the Senators with 50 points, most in the NHL by any rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's certainly a talent," said Eastern Conference teammate Mike Richter, who 
was voted MVP after Yashin's second goal gave the East the victory. "I haven't 
seen him play a lot, but geez, I watched him in practice, and when you watch 
somebody practice you see firsthand how a guy can play. This kid's tall and 
strong and has a great shot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' Dave Taylor, making his fourth and probably last All-Star game 
appearance, recorded his first point with an assist on a goal by San Jose's 
Sandis Ozolinsh in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, 38, was added to the Western Conference roster by Commissioner Gary 
Bettman as a designated veteran player. He played on a line with Vancouver's 
Pavel Bure and Detroit's Sergei Fedorov. 
</P>
<P>
 "It knocks a few years off your age, playing with those guys," Taylor said. 
"It was a treat to play with them. The whole thing was a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a game in which there were no penalties, Philadelphia's Eric Lindros 
managed to emerge with a cut under his right eye that required stitches. 
Lindros, who was making his first All-Star game appearance, said he wasn't sure 
how the cut happened. . . . Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr did not play after 
pulling a groin muscle Friday. . . . Pierre Turgeon of the New York Islanders 
had a game-high four assists. . . . Former King Paul Coffey, now with Detroit 
and playing in his 12th All-Star game, scored his first All-Star goal.

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: MOVIE GAFFE 975: 'I'LL DO 
ANYTHING' GETS LOST IN TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I'll Do Anything," the James L. Brooks musical-turned-romantic-comedy that 
opens Feb. 4, is set in Hollywood, so it's not surprising that the picture 
abounds in movie references. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the first few minutes of the film, for example, Matt Hobbs, a character 
actor portrayed by Nick Nolte, assures his wife, Beth (Tracey Ullman), that 
he's going to beat out Raul Julia for a part in "Kiss of the Spiderwoman." 
Audiences, of course, are likely to recall that Julia got the role. 
</P>
<P>
 The year, we are told, is 1987, six years before the main action in "I'll Do 
Anything" begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Mention of the well-known movie helps establish for the audience that Hobbs is 
an actor of considerable stature. The only trouble is, "Kiss of the 
Spiderwoman" came out in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat sheepish after being informed of the gaffe, Brooks, who wrote and 
directed "Anything," said flashing the date on the screen was a last-minute 
decision. Given that Jeannie, the Hobbses' daughter, is 6 months old when we 
first see her in 1987 and 6 years old when she is portrayed by Whittni Wright, 
the reference to a movie made before she was born would have been a mistake in 
any case, Brooks acknowledged. But, he contended, "naming the year is a 
different deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved 'Kiss of the Spiderwoman' because it was such a famous acting 
picture, with two great parts and two actors (William Hurt, in addition to 
Julia) who had a great time working together," Brooks said. "There's things 
I've read about the making of that movie that I've used in rehearsals since." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, Hurt and Julia switched roles while rehearsing their 
movie. "I had Whittni and Nick switch roles in rehearsals -- which really 
helped (their performance)." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, "Anything" is a tribute to character actors who dedicate themselves 
to their craft. Julia's "Spiderwoman" role as Valentin, a political activist 
locked into a South American prison with a gay window dresser who is obsessed 
with tacky Hollywood movies, "just always was the part that you really want, 
for all the right reasons," Brooks said. "So I guess I was swayed more by that 
than the date (that the film was released). 
</P>
<P>
 "And," he added, "the names were fun." When Ullman's character castigates her 
husband for putting his not-so-lucrative career ahead of his parental 
responsibilities, the name of "Spiderwoman's" director rolls sneeringly from 
her tongue. "I've got a baby girl in there sleeping in a used crib who couldn't 
care less what a director named Hector Babenco thinks," she shouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaffes like the one in "Anything" recur with regularity in the movies. The 
1981 "Pennies From Heaven," for example, is set in 1934, yet the characters go 
to see a movie, "Follow the Fleet" starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and 
eventually join the action. That movie wasn't released until 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 During the "Be Our Guest" number in the animated 1991 Disney version of 
"Beauty and the Beast," the singing dinnerware form the shape of the Eiffel 
Tower. But the story is set well before the tower was constructed in 1889. 
</P>
<P>
 In Warner Bros.' current release "The Pelican Brief," newlywed Julia Roberts 
plays law student Darby Shaw, a single woman whose lover has just been killed. 
But in one scene we get a glimpse of Mrs. Lyle Lovett's wedding band. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaffes, in fact, are such a tradition in Hollywood, that one recent movie, 
"Last Action Hero," spoofed the practice with dozens of intentional mistakes, 
according to Premiere magazine. Looking through the window from Jack Slater's 
(Arnold Schwarzenegger) apartment, to mention just one instance, rain is 
falling. In the same scene, from the outside, the weather is sunny and dry.

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: OSCAR HUBBUB; AND NOW, FOR 
A NOT-SO-SUBTLE VOTING REMINDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fine Line Features would like to remind academy members that Madeleine Stowe 
from "Short Cuts" was the National Society of Film Critics' choice for best 
supporting actress of 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 The independent distributor took out a recent ad extolling Stowe's award in 
the Hollywood trade papers. But hers is just one of 22 ensemble performances in 
the three-hour-plus Robert Altman-directed film that the company believes is 
Oscar-caliber. 
</P>
<P>
 The film interweaves several Raymond Carver short stories and boasts featured 
speaking parts for Stowe, Lily Tomlin, Lyle Lovett, Tim Robbins, Matthew 
Modine, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tom Waits, Bruce Davison, Jack Lemmon, Julianne 
Moore. . . and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, Fine Line has found itself in the rather costly position of having to 
mount an Oscar campaign for the entire cast, in addition to promotional ads for 
Altman and his technical crew (editing, cinematography, music).  
</P>
<P>
 To avoid having to shoulder the expense of promoting each actor individually, 
the New York-based company will list all actresses in one trade ad, actors in 
another, and the entire cast in a third one. The ads will run this week as the 
Oscar nomination deadline approaches.  
</P>
<P>
 The usual practice is to promote one or two actors per movie, whether that be 
a critics' favorite, such as supporting actor Ralph Fiennes for "Schindler's 
List," or longshots who don't stand a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short Cuts," however, appears to be in a category all its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can we do?" asks Ira Deutchman, president of Fine Line. "We didn't have 
any choice but to support all of them. To choose among them would be 
impossible; the performances are uniformly amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Deutchman jokes that one solution would be for the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences, whose members vote the Oscars each year, to adopt a new 
award category: Best Ensemble Acting in a Motion Picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that Fine Line might not promote him, Davison, previously nominated 
for best supporting actor in "Longtime Companion," said his agent at William 
Morris paid for an ad on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 And Moore is said to have independently hired the manager of best supporting 
actress winner Marisa Tomei ("My Cousin Vinny") to handle her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, in the critics' polls, "Short Cuts," while considered by most 
reviewers one of the top five movies of the year, has yet to win any major U.S. 
awards, though in several categories has been a runner-up and was the best 
picture winner in the Venice Film Festival. It received one Golden Globe 
nomination, for best screenplay.*

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: LITERARY FILE; 
'SHADOWLANDS' REKINDLES INTEREST IN C. S. LEWIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI E. PIKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If "Shadowlands" becomes a box-office success, "Jurassic Park" won't be the 
only dinosaur-centered film to make its mark among recent movies. "Shadowlands" 
is about the brief, late-in-life marriage of American divorcee Joy Davidman 
Gresham and English writer C. S. (Clive Staples) Lewis. Lewis dubbed himself a 
"dinosaur" and an "Old Western Man" in reference to his traditional, Christian 
and literary perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, this Englishman who died at age 64 the same day as John F. 
Kennedy may seem a rather snoozy subject for a film. Many people only know 
Lewis as a children's writer: His seven-volume fantasy series "The Chronicles 
of Narnia" is a perennial favorite. Actually, the stocky, chain-smoking, 
Belfast-born Anglican defies easy categorization. 
</P>
<P>
 Schooled in his teens by a private tutor who predicted no great success for 
his pupil, Lewis went on to become a Renaissance and Medieval literature 
professor at both Oxford and Cambridge. Despite his demanding academic 
schedule, Lewis carved out time to write more than 50 books, pamphlets and 
essays. These include poetry, literary criticism ("The Oxford History of 
English Literature in the 16th Century," "An Experiment in Criticism"), the 
autobiography "Surprised by Joy," a science-fiction trilogy, a novel about the 
Cupid and Psyche myth called "Till We Have Faces" and theological works such as 
"Mere Christianity," "The Problem of Pain" and "The Screwtape Letters." All of 
these, plus others, are still in print and sell by the thousands in various 
translations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' marriage to Gresham in 1956 came after years of confirmed bachelorhood. 
At first largely a "green-card" arrangement to help Gresham and her two sons 
(only one is portrayed in the film) stay in England while she slowly died of 
cancer, the four-year union ultimately thawed Lewis' emotions and launched him 
into the greatest romance of his life. Still, the relative quickness, secrecy 
and taint of previous divorce attached to the wedding in England's conservative 
'50s society added to Lewis' somewhat quixotic reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to his prodigious book output, the writer has become something of a 
hero to a wide swath of people who admire his blend of brains, faith, poetic 
spirit and storytelling finesse. As early as 1947, he was popular enough to 
rate a Time magazine cover story describing him as "one of a growing band of 
heretics among modern intellectuals: an intellectual who believes in God." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is not without detractors. In his own lifetime, a number of his 
university colleagues found his unabashed advocacy of Christianity so 
distasteful that they voted Cecil Day-Lewis (Daniel Day-Lewis' father) into a 
coveted poetry professorship at Oxford over Lewis largely out of spite. Still, 
Lewis, or Jack as he was nicknamed, never lacked for talented and supportive 
friends such as J.R.R. Tolkien, Owen Barfield and Charles Williams to 
appreciate his wit, generosity (he donated most of his book proceeds to 
charity), sensitivity to beauty and roving imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 The last decade has seen something of a Lewis renaissance. "Shadowlands" has 
attracted interest in various incarnations as a British television drama and a 
Tony Award-winning play before it became a film. John Cleese recorded a biting 
audiocassette rendition of "The Screwtape Letters," and the BBC has turned out 
television versions of a few of the Narnia books. Several Lewis biographies and 
an edition of his diary were recently published. There are thriving C. S. Lewis 
societies replete with monthly journals and meetings in Los Angeles and New 
York. And the Redlands-based C. S. Lewis Foundation for Higher Education 
presents triannual conferences in England about the man and his works. 
</P>
<P>
 Even 30 years after his death, Lewis fans believe that his words wear well. 
Below, a smattering of Lewisania: 
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 All that is not eternal is eternally out of date. -- "The Four Loves" 
Flippancy . . . is a thousand miles away from joy; it deadens, instead of 
sharpening, the intellect; and it excites no affection between those who 
practice it. -- "The Screwtape Letters" Ambition! We must be careful what we 
mean by it. If it means the desire to get ahead of other people -- which is 
what I think it does mean -- then it is bad. If it means simply wanting to do a 
thing well, then it is good. It isn't wrong for an actor to want to act his 
part as well as it can possibly be acted, but the wish to have his name in 
bigger type than the other actors is a bad one. -- "God in the Dock" It is a 
serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember 
that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a 
creature which, if you say it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship, or 
else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a 
nightmare. All day long we are, in some degree, helping each other to one or 
another of these destinations. -- "The Weight of Glory" Courage is not simply 
one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which 
means, at the point of highest reality. A chastity or honesty or mercy which 
yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions. 
Pilate was merciful till it became risky. -- "The Screwtape Letters" In reading 
great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself. Like the night 
sky in a Greek poem, I see with a thousand eyes, but it is still I who see. 
Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend 
myself; and am never more myself than when I do.

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: 'TROUBLE' MAKER; JULIA 
ROBERTS FIGHTS TO GET HER NAME IN THE PAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julia Roberts may have spent much of her adult life fleeing from the intense 
scrutiny of the media but, nowadays, she is quite literally up to her aquiline 
neck in the frenetic and often cluttered trappings of the newspaper world. 
</P>
<P>
 In Touchstone's summer release "I Love Trouble," Roberts plays an aspiring 
reporter competing against a star newspaper columnist (played by Nick Nolte) 
for the ultimate front page story. Striving to create the proper journalistic 
atmosphere, producer Nancy Meyers and director Charles Shyer, a 
husband-and-wife team who also co-wrote the screenplay, have gone to great 
lengths to re-create an accurate yet decidedly opulent series of rival 
newspaper sets for the film, which wraps in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the sets to symbolize the great newspaper traditions in movies as 
well as in life," explains Meyers. "Newspapers in old movies were such major 
sets. They were exciting places . . . the sort of place that you wanted to work 
when you grew up. It was terribly glamorous." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than use existing sets, or the long-vacant Los Angeles Herald Examiner 
building that has often been used in films about newspapers, the couple opted 
to build two lavish newsrooms and offices for the comedy. "The sets were 
important in helping to establish Nick and Julia's characters," Meyers adds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, Nolte works for Chicago's leading newspaper, the Chicago 
Chronicle. Roberts' character works for the underdog paper, the Chicago Globe. 
Reading from the script on the "I Love Trouble" set, Meyers narrates: "The 
Chronicle is a block-long and is a been-there-forever, don't-mess-with-it kind 
of building. The Chronicle is the No. 1 newspaper in the Midwest and has the 
newsroom to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 To execute their grandiose vision, the couple hired Academy Award-winning 
production designer Dean Tavoularis. "The biggest challenge was in taking an 
enormous amount of space and turning it into something interesting visually," 
Tavoularis says. "We needed to capture the power of the Chronicle, and contrast 
it with the Globe, which has seen better days." 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve the sleek and sophisticated look for the interior of the Chronicle, 
Tavoularis, overseeing a production staff of 80, created a 36,000-square-foot 
newsroom with adjoining editor and staff offices, installing 200 desks, 120 
working on-line computers and 15 tons of prop paperwork (research files, 
newspaper articles, photographs) to place on the desks. The sheer size of the 
Chronicle set allowed the director much more latitude when shooting than the 
smaller Globe set. "The Chronicle is a much larger space so we were able to use 
a lot of steady cam and do things with the shots," Shyer explains. "Julia's 
paper was more cramped and limited in space. It was a throwback to the old 
newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' work environment is decidedly more downscale, in keeping with her 
underdog role as a cub reporter for the struggling paper. "We wanted her paper 
to look like the newsroom in 'His Girl Friday,' " Meyers says. The interior 
Globe set covers 9,100 square feet. The computers were from the '70s, to help 
achieve an antiquated look. "The two stars are only seen in their own 
respective newspapers," Shyer adds. "They never enter the other's domain." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Chronicle, replicas of journalism awards, including the H. L. Mencken 
Award and the Robert F. Kennedy Award, were purchased to go in the offices of 
both Nolte and his editor.  
</P>
<P>
 Not far from Roberts' desk at the fictional Globe is a small poster that 
screams its own tabloid headline: "IT'S ALL MY FAULT -- I'M FROM THE MEDIA!" 
Perhaps the press-shy actress lent the design team a helping hand.

 You've been generous to others in recent months. Now, pamper yourself, for a

 Some of the best of the late Eugene Ormandy's many recordings with the 
Philadelphia Orchestra were of not-quite core repertory, which the casual 
listener might have overlooked when they first appeared in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly valuable are interpretations recently reissued in Sony's Bargain 
Classics series: Berlioz's "Harold in Italy," with the luscious solo viola of 
Joseph de Pasquale (53255), and a pairing of Paul Hindemith's most popular 
scores, the "Mathis der Maler" Symphony and "Symphonic Metamorphoses of Themes 
by Weber" (53258). 
</P>
<P>
 "Harold" offers the Philadelphia sound at its most voluptuous. Not only the 
fabled strings, but the fat-toned brass and larger-than-life (as it's usually 
lived) solo woodwinds, all subsumed under the conductor's big-hearted 
conception of the score. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more taut and fiery recorded versions of Berlioz's tricky 
symphony-concerto, but none quite so shapely or consistently well-executed as 
this. Worthwhile Berlioz fillers, too, in this generously packed CD: the 
familiar orchestral excerpts from "La Damnation de Faust" and "Les Troyens" 
led, respectively, by Charles Munch and Daniel Barenboim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hindemith program likewise takes advantage of the "Philadelphia sound," 
which is to say that richness of tone is always a goal. But this "Mathis" also 
conveys a degree of tension generally considered alien to the Ormandy method 
and temperament, while the present "Metamorphoses" succeeds in projecting the 
lumpy Hindemithian wit. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonus here is William Walton's attractive, rarely heard Variations on a 
Theme of Hindemith, the theme drawn from the latter's 1940 Cello Concerto, with 
reminiscences of "Mathis" as well. It's played with a striking combination of 
elegance and muscularity by the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell. 
</P>
<P>
 There hasn't been much of note in the way of bargain Baroque from the budget 
labels, but hope for a brighter future is provided in a newly recorded program 
from Hungary that includes four of the sonatas published in 1730 as Handel's 
Opus 1 (Naxos 550700). 
</P>
<P>
 The soloist is an alto-recorder whiz named Laszlo Czidra, with an imaginative 
continuo team comprising Zsuzsa Pertis (whose instrument is listed as a 
clavichord, but sounds at times like a two-manual harpsichord), bassoonist 
Zsolt Harsanyi and cellist Pal Kelemen. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances have vigor, grace and clarity. And Czidra's attitude toward 
ornamentation is refreshingly respectful of the composer. He lets us hear the 
simple purity of what Handel notated before adding, in the repeats, his own 
lively variants. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On LaserLight -- which might be called a hyper-budget label, its product 
selling for under five dollars per disc -- there are some classy reissues from 
the early 1970s of works by J.S. Bach performed by the modern-instrument 
Deutsche Bach Solisten, some of whose members were to become major participants 
in the authenticity movement, under the enlightened direction of Helmut 
Winschermann. 
</P>
<P>
 The standout of the lot pairs two solo cantatas, the flashily jubilant 
"Jauchzet Gott," BWV 51, and the calmly introspective (its gory title 
notwithstanding) "Mein Herze schwimmt in Blut," BWV 199, in performances by a 
very young Edita Gruberova. 
</P>
<P>
 Gruberova's aggressive vocalism in no way reflects a "period" sound. Her 
soprano has a bright, cutting edge and in sustained phrases a pronounced 
vibrato. She uses that voice with terrific rhythmic thrust, in combination with 
a ferociously confident command of Bach's coloratura fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 As if her shining presence weren't sufficient to justify the paltry asking 
price for the disc, the 74-minute program (LaserLight 14 135) is fleshed out by 
handsome performances from Winschermann and his band of two Bach 
reconstructions: the Concerto in D for flute, oboe and violin, after the 
Concerto for three harpsichords, BWV 1064, and an alternative version of the 
Fourth "Brandenburg" Concerto, retaining the recorder duo but with harpsichord 
solo in place of the violin.

 CONTEMPORARY ROMANTICS: Works by Mary Jeanne van Appledorn, Max Lifchitz, Ron 
Mazurek, Elizabeth Pizer, Howard Quilling and Harold Schiffman. Max Lifchitz, 
piano. North/ South Recordings 1001. The eight selections here, coupled with 
"American Debuts" (N/S R 1002), introduce the listening public to contemporary 
American piano music. Most of these have programmatic connotations, though the 
compositional styles vary from Schiffman's gentle, tonal set of Nine Pieces to 
Mazurek's complex interaction between piano and taped, electrically produced 
sounds in "The Voice Within." Results differ as well: Pizer's quiet miniatures 
are as short in interest as they are in length and Appledorn's "Liszt Fantasy" 
impresses more for the technical work than for dramatic impact. Still, the 
propulsive rhythms of Quilling's Sonata No. 2, as well as its hypnotic slow 
movement, and the eerie effect of "The Voice Within" bear attention. Lifchitz 
shoulders the entire range of demands with convincing aplomb, including those 
of his own, angry, Vietnam-era protest, "Elegia." * 
</P>
<P>
 PETER SCHICKELE: "Sneaky Pete and the Wolf" (Prokofiev's "Peter and the 
Wolf"); Saint-Saens' "Carnival of the Animals." Atlanta Symphony, conducted by 
Yoel Levi; Ralph Markham and Kenneth Broadway, duo-pianists. Telarc CD-80350. 
Schickele has rewritten and narrates the texts to these popular children's 
pieces. Peter's story is transformed into a Western tale of Sneaky Pete; his 
lady love, Laura Canard; his old, drunken side kick, Ben Blunderbuss, and 
dangerous Hugo the Wolf ("El Lobo"), who is out to get Pete for having sold him 
some bogus real estate in Florida. It is not likely to replace the original, 
but it does provide plenty of chuckles. Leonard Slatkin asked Schickele to 
update Ogden Nash's well-known poems for a 1991 New Year's Eve performance by 
the New York Philharmonic of Saint-Saens' programmatic work. The result was a 
complete new set of verses, in turn gentle and silly, spiced with occasional 
barbs. Broadway & Markham rise to the challenge with precise, impressive 
technical and coloristic flair, neatly complemented by their attentive cohorts.

 ROSA PONSELLE: The Columbia Recordings. Rosa Ponselle, soprano; various 
orchestras and soloists. Pearl GEMM CDS 9964. This two-disc set of 41 numbers 
contains all but one of the records Ponselle made for Columbia during a 
six-year period after her Met debut in 1918.The voice was large and essentially 
dark, the same sound from top to bottom, with no register breaks. The technique 
was formidable. Listen to the trill in "Casta diva," "Ernani involami" or "Qual 
fiamma." She could produce granitic alto tones for "Suicidio" and also light 
coloratura for the "Vespri" Bolero and the "Trovatore" duet with Luna (Riccardo 
Stracciari). In these early years she had no fears for her top, and an 
effortless C was there for "O patria mia." There is some now-mostly-extinct 
light encore material here including duets such as "Comin' Through the Rye" 
with her sister, Carmela, and it is doubtful "Little Alabama Coon" would ever 
make much of a comeback, even if Ponselle, herself, returned.

 SONGS OF DVORAK, JANACEK AND MARTINU. Gabriela Benackova, soprano; Rudolf 
Firkusny, piano. BMG 09026-60823-2. With the exception of the inevitable "Songs 
My Mother Taught Me" from Dvorak's Gypsy Songs, the Czech and Moravian material 
is fresh and unhackneyed. Since Janacek and Martinu were both friends and 
mentors of the pianist, there can be little doubt we are hearing the music 
stylistically the way we ought. It is a shame, however, that Benackova, who 
possesses one of the most beautiful voices around, doesn't appear to care much 
for consonants. Even with the texts before us, it is difficult to get a word. 
Still, the voluptuous pleasures of the repertory and the technical mastery of 
the performers make the recording special. WALTER PRICE

RECORD RACK: THE DOMINO EFFECT IN LONG BEACH RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DOMINO "Domino" Outburst/RAL/Chaos *** Not much more than a year ago, Long 
Beach was, as a rap capital, somewhere between Chula Vista and Anchorage, a 
town better known nationally for its adventurous opera company than for its 
nurturing of hard-core beats. Now, of course, since Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy 
Dogg sold umptillion albums with rhymes about the roughnecks of the East Long 
Beach streets and Warren G & Mista Grimm having pounded the radio with their 
own Long Beach rhymes, the city has come to occupy the place in the gangsta-rap 
mythos that Oakland occupied last year and Compton the year before that. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest hip-hop sensation from Long Beach is Domino, who used to rap with 
Snoop in junior high school and whose first single, "Getto Jam," was one of the 
great rap singles of last year, a booming-bass party song that may be one of 
the most laid-back examples of the relaxed, low-tech hip-hop sound known as 
"G-Funk." The rest of the album may be as good. 
</P>
<P>
 Domino's rapping voice is slightly sing-songy, slightly nasal, a flexible 
instrument that insinuates itself into the grooves like a riffing alto sax; the 
hooks in the songs come from the implied melodic cadences in the rhymes. The 
production here -- mostly by the L.A. hip-hop veteran Battlecat -- is smooth 
and sure, almost organic in its hard-line, ultra-repetitive use of 
easy-listening soul. New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two 
stars (fair), three stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 ALICE IN CHAINS "Jar of Flies" 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia ** Perhaps Alice in Chains exorcised a few too many demons on its 
dark and cathartic "Dirt" album in '92, because the new "Jar of Flies" EP lacks 
the visceral intensity and memorable songs that marked the Seattle hard-rock 
quartet's four previous releases. 
</P>
<P>
 While the band has certainly earned the right to explore other aspects of its 
musical personality -- and it does, even dabbling in jazz-swing and 
incorporating strings on this partly acoustic, partly electric effort -- the 
result is ultimately more atmosphere than substance.The overall feel of the 
seven-song collection is heady, warm and ethereal, but with few exceptions the 
songs are too linear and static to be compelling. "I Stay Away" features some 
of Alice's trademark, dark 'n' heavy crunch and Layne Staley's passionate if 
strangely mannered vocals, and the poignant ballad "Don't Follow," featuring a 
plaintive harmonica and Jerry Cantrell's distinctive, dirge-like guitar wail, 
is beautiful and even Beatleesque in its gentle melody. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's about it for bright spots among 30 otherwise monotonous, meandering 
minutes. New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), 
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 ZZ TOP "Antenna" RCA *** A fretful Billy Gibbons emerges on ZZ's latest, but 
there is more on his mind than the pressures of having signed a megabucks deal 
with a new label. While there is no radical departure from the electro-plated, 
machine-enhanced techno-boogie that gave ZZ Top its commercial legs in the 
'80s, the Gibbons-led band has its antenna out for new stylistic and thematic 
signals that serve it well. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, a few business-as-usual, cartoonish, round-up-the-video-vixens 
sexual-entendre exercises are included, with the booty-motivating "Cherry Red" 
a particularly good example of this patented ZZ form. But a darker shadow hangs 
over much of the rest, in songs that pack a tense sizzle as they express unease 
over drug addiction ("Pincushion"), the AIDS specter (the slow-blues grinder 
"Cover Your Rig") and various forms of personal malaise. 
</P>
<P>
 The pop-blues ballad "Breakaway" is one of the band's best, a soulful piece 
that could have been written by Lowell George or covered by Bonnie Raitt. 
Gibbons sparingly but effectively introduces some new, occasionally dissonant 
hues into his futuristic blues-guitar work -- one song, "Deal Goin' Down," even 
has shades of U2 and Jesus Jones. After its stale, aptly-named 1991 album 
"Recycler," "Antenna" is a welcome refresher for ZZ Top. New albums are rated 
on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good) and four 
stars (excellent).

<P>
 ** 1/2 Save your money. 
</P>
<P>
 If you already have the original versions of these three albums, skip these 
remix packages. Even with two new tracks per collection they're not worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums featuring cosmetic remixes are usually a waste anyway. They're almost 
never an improvement on the original. Unless there are radical changes, like 
using parts of the melody as a jumping-off point for a stretched-out dance mix, 
what's the point? 
</P>
<P>
 The audience for remix collections is hard-core fans who know the originals so 
well that a new piano line here and a toned-down horn part there is 
significant. But even fanatics won't find much in this trio of remixes to get 
excited about. All the new material sounds like outtakes from the original 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Shai's remix package is decidedly inferior to the music on the vocal group's 
debut album. And tampering with the tracks of Mary J. Blige's "What's the 411" 
didn't make that excellent album any better. 
</P>
<P>
 Remixing Brown's weak "Bobby" album is like slapping a new coat of paint on a 
rickety shack. Beefing up the bass on the remixes of those lame tracks just 
means that you now have loud lame tracks. New albums are rated on a scale of 
one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good) and four stars 
(excellent).

POP EYE: YOU CAN BET THAT ALL'S PHAIR IN THE BIDDING WAR FOR LIZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The major-label battle for Liz Phair is on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago-based singer-songwriter, whose 1993 debut album "Exile in 
Guyville" made her one of the most acclaimed new artists of recent years, isn't 
a free agent yet. She's still under contract with New York independent Matador 
for one more album.  
</P>
<P>
 But already the big companies are climbing all over each other to offer her a 
deal. Geffen, Atlantic, RCA, Warner Bros., Virgin, Epic and A&M have made 
particularly aggressive overtures to the young artist, and virtually every 
record company had representatives on hand when Phair played shows in Los 
Angeles and New York last month. 
</P>
<P>
 And the early betting is on . . . none of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 The big companies may be wasting their efforts, industry officials close to 
the situation say. When all is said and done, Phair is likely to stay with 
Matador -- which would make Atlantic at least a partial winner, since it 
distributes the company's releases. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really likes Matador and likes working with them -- they really 
understand each other," says Bob Lawton of the Twin Towers booking agency in 
New York, who has been fielding a lot of calls from Phair's industry suitors in 
the absence of an official manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music is only a part of the things she wants to do," he says of Phair, who 
was unavailable for comment. "She wants to be a visual artist and to direct 
(videos and films). And if you know enough about what you want or what you 
don't want, you don't need a big manager or record company to get you there. 
She's going to get there anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Matador co-owner Gerard Cosloy is confident his star artist will stay with 
him.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of negotiating a new deal with her," he says. "After 
she's finished her recording commitment with us she's free to do whatever she 
wants. And it's to her advantage to talk to everybody. But my feeling is we 
have more to offer than anyone else. Everybody assumes they can do better (than 
a small company), but they rarely can."

<P>
 How does he feel about all the major-label executives following her around? 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as they pay to get in to the shows, I don't really care," says 
Cosloy, who hopes to release Phair's second album, currently being recorded in 
Chicago, in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you took away the sales of the record to people in the record industry 
who got interested in her," he adds, "she wouldn't have sold as many records. 
We're happy to take money from anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Even RCA's director of A&R Bruce Flohr, one of the executives who would love 
to sign Phair, finds it hard to argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been hounding not only her but her lawyer," he says. "We agree with all 
the critics that she has a real vision. But I don't think that it will come 
down to a bidding war, but down to where Liz sees as the best place for her 
vision. It wouldn't surprise me if she decided to stay with Matador."

 KNACK ATTACK: First "Wayne's World" brings back Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody." 
Then "Benny & Joon" breathes life into the Proclaimers' "I'm Gonna Be (500 
Miles)." And then "Wayne's World 2" puts the Village People's "Y.M.C.A." back 
on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 What next? A movie reviving "My Sharona"? 
</P>
<P>
 Yikes! That's exactly what the makers of the new film "Reality Bites" and the 
folks at RCA Records have in mind. The Knack's ode to a teen-age groupie -- a 
No. 1 hit for six weeks when it was released in 1979 -- is prominently featured 
both in a key scene in the new Ben Stiller-directed film starring Winona Ryder, 
Ethan Hawke and Stiller, and also in the preview trailers for the movie.  
</P>
<P>
 The soundtrack album also includes new tracks from World Party, the Posies and 
Me Phi Me and previously released songs by U2, Lenny Kravitz, Crowded House and 
Juliana Hatfield, but both RCA and Universal Pictures, which is releasing the 
movie, are giving "My Sharona" a big push. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked to a lot of radio programmers and they're excited about the song 
coming back," says Hugh Surratt, RCA senior vice president of artist 
development. "The song isn't in anybody's oldies rotation and they haven't 
played it in years, so they think that with the boost from the movie there 
could be a very fresh audience for it out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Surratt says that a new video is being edited from old footage of the 
L.A.-based band and clips from the picture, in which the main characters rock 
out to the song at a 7-Eleven, and that there's already been some interest from 
TV talk shows about having the Knack -- whose attempted comeback a couple of 
years ago flopped -- performing live. 
</P>
<P>
 Now let's see, where did we put that old "Nuke the Knack" T-shirt?

 DIGITAL DISHING: Everyone's always looking for the pulse of the music 
industry, but it may have turned up in an unlikely place: a computer bulletin 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pop Eye reader alerted us to the America OnLine service's "Music Industry 
Dirt" -- an ongoing computer conversation full of gossip and gripes of record 
industry personnel. Judging by a recent conversation about the EMI Record Group 
(ERG), it's a no-holds-barred forum, with subscribers taking full advantage of 
the anonymity it offers.  
</P>
<P>
 In the conversation, a participant called "Midi900" suggested that EMI stands 
for "Every Mistake Imaginable," while ERG is "Every Record Gone." Meanwhile, 
the others involved ("SkippyUSA," "Big Soul" and "KMART 222") slammed the 
company's fondness for inconsequential, quick-hit artists such as Vanilla Ice 
and Barney the Dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 People at other companies shouldn't laugh. These folks don't seem like the 
type to play favorites or give anyone a break. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 AND ONE MORE THING: We're not sure which is scarier about veteran 
performer-producer Al Kooper's new instrumental album, "Rekooperation": the 
liner notes by Stephen King or the series of cover photos taking Kooper from 
geeky teen to graying, middle-aged gent. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, here's a sample of King's stab at rock criticism: 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much soul of any kind in the video graveyard of pop music these 
days, I'm sorry to say. Even the rhythm and blues too often feels 
machine-tooled and soulless, music that's gone politically correct and turned 
its switchblade over to Officer Friendly. . . . Pop music left its heart in San 
Francisco right around the time Garth Brooks recorded "Friends in Low Places," 
and its soul in a place where only your proctologist can get a good look at 
it."

 ALTERNATIVE ROUTES: Severe road damage during Monday's earthquake produced a 
surge in demand for Thomas Bros. guides, a spokesman for the Irvine company 
says. In addition to commuters searching for alternative routes, bulk orders 
have come in from ambulance companies. . . . The company may put out a 
supplement to help drivers through the quake-affected areas.Says a spokesman: 
"We're trying to take our time, yet react as quickly as possible, to make sure 
things are correct."

 LIVING THE HELL: Leon Leyson of Fullerton agrees with critics who praise the 
historical accuracy of Steven Spielberg's Holocaust movie, "Schindler's List." 
He should know. . . . Leyson was among the 1,100 Jewish factory workers whose 
lives were saved by German industrialist Oskar Schindler (E1). Leyson was 14 
when the war ended, and among the youngest on the list. But he credits his 
mother as his real hero in those difficult days: "She was a magician. She could

them: A $1-million payoff this summer for whoever gets a hole in one in a final 
competition at Meadowlark Golf Course. Your $5 entry goes toward the city's 
fireworks plans. . . .The city should come out ahead, even if someone wins the 
million: The fireworks board pays just $3,500 for insurance against the chance 
of such a long shot happening.

'KOJAK' STAR TELLY SAVALAS DIES AT 70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Telly Savalas, the gruff, hairless actor who became a television favorite as 
the lollipop-loving New York detective in the 1970s series "Kojak," died 
Saturday of prostate cancer. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Savalas died in his suite at the Sheraton-Universal Hotel in Universal City, 
said Mike Mamakos, a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved him dearly. He was a wonderful man," Mamakos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Savalas had undergone treatment for prostate cancer at Huntington Memorial 
Hospital in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who loves ya, baby?" which Kojack muttered to fellow cops and assorted 
hoodlums, grew into the detective's signature and a national catch phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 The series grew out of an acclaimed TV movie, "The Marcus-Nelson Murders," 
based on the real-life brutal murders of two young career women in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kojak" broke into the top-10 rated shows in its first season, 1972-73. 
Savalas won the Emmy as best actor in a dramatic series the following season. 
The series lasted until 1978, setting the standard for gritty, realistic cop 
shows such as "Hill Street Blues" and "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Savalas, who intentionally shaved his head, became indelibly identified as Lt. 
Theo Kojak, and he remained grateful for the recognition. "I made 60 movies 
before 'Kojak' with some of the biggest names in the business, and people would 
still say, 'There goes what's-his-name.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He was born Aristotle (Telly is the diminutive) Savalas in Garden City, N.Y. 
He became expert at clouding his age as well as his early life, often telling 
fanciful tales. He claimed that his entrepreneur father "was a millionaire five 
times and a pauper six." 
</P>
<P>
 Young Telly grew up with four brothers and one sister in a large, volatile 
Greek family in which "it wasn't so much strong discipline as strong love that 
kept us in line." The boy was in and out of Catholic schools, depending on his 
father's fortunes. He remained vague about his three-year service in World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war he earned a bachelor's degree in psychology and went through a 
series of jobs: writing for the U.S. State Department Information Service, 
directing news broadcasts at ABC, directing at a Stamford, Conn., playhouse, 
teaching adult education in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, just as he was despairing for his future, an agent called, seeking 
someone who could speak a European accent in a live TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second show I did on TV, I was the lead," he told an interviewer in 1973. 
"I made $900 and I was having fun saying some other guy's words. This is a 
dangerous profession for the ego." 
</P>
<P>
 His television career continued, mainly in hoodlum roles. Burt Lancaster 
provided Savalas' first important film role in 1961, as a police detective in 
"The Young Savages," about Harlem crime. The following year he appeared in 
Lancaster's "Birdman of Alcatraz" as a sadistic convict. The role won him an 
Academy Award nomination as supporting actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Savalas became one of Hollywood's busiest character actors, usually in 
hard-bitten roles. The films include: "Johnny Cool," "The New Interns," "The 
Greatest Story Ever Told," "Genghis Khan," "Battle of the Bulge," "The Slender 
Thread," "Beau Geste," "The Dirty Dozen," "The Scalphunters," "Mackenzie's 
Gold" and "Kelly's Heroes."

LORENA BOBBITT FOUND INNOCENT; JURY CITES TEMPORARY INSANITY; LAW: JUDGE PLACES 
HER IN CUSTODY TO UNDERGO PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION AFTER SHE SEVERED MATE'S 
PENIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE GEARAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt was acquitted by reason of temporary insanity Friday by jurors 
who agreed an "irresistible impulse" provoked by abuse compelled her to cut off 
her husband's penis. She was committed to a mental hospital for observation. 
</P>
<P>
 A supporter shrieked as the beginning of the verdict was read, while Mrs. 
Bobbitt stoically stood next to her attorneys. The decision ended a two-week 
trial that riveted television viewers who followed every salacious detail of 
the Bobbitts' sex lives as it unfolded in testimony on CNN and Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 While the verdict was being read, Mrs. Bobbitt turned to one of her lawyers 
and asked: "Is that good?" 
</P>
<P>
 "This case was not about a penis," said Lisa Kemler, one of her lawyers. 
"Everyone was so consumed with that. But that's not what this case is really 
about. It was really about a life." 
</P>
<P>
 One of her closest friends read a message from Mrs. Bobbitt directed at abused 
women. "She encourages you to reach out, talk to someone today," Janna Bisutti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Mrs. Bobbitt also hopes to pursue the dream she had when she came to 
the United States in 1986 -- a good education, marriage and family. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bobbitt, who was acquitted of marital sexual assault for allegedly raping 
her shortly before she mutilated him, checked out of his Manassas hotel 
Thursday and was not at the Prince William County courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not into dancing on graves," said Paul Erickson, Bobbitt's media 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Herman A. Whisenant Jr. placed Mrs. Bobbitt in custody to undergo 
psychiatric evaluation to determine whether she poses a danger to herself or 
others, as required by Virginia law. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney James Lowe objected to the immediate custody order and asked 
the judge for a hearing on the issue. But Whisenant said the law gave him no 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Blair Howard called the verdict "a great step forward for 
Lorena in the healing process." 
</P>
<P>
 The psychological observations will determine whether she needs treatment and 
the extent of that treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she will be found not dangerous to herself and others," Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Bobbitt was taken to Central State Hospital in Petersburg, where she will 
be examined by state doctors and at least one outside expert. They must report 
back to the judge within 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the start I knew my daughter was innocent. What happened was a moment of 
madness," Mrs. Bobbitt's father, Carlos Gallo, said from Venezuela. The 
Ecuador-born Lorena was raised in Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Paul B. Ebert told reporters after the verdict that he has "a 
certain amount of sympathy for Mrs. Bobbitt, but that doesn't justify what she 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, if she needs help, she will get it," Ebert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebert said he could not have pursued the case without calling John Bobbitt, 
26, as a witness, and he doubted that his hesitant, sometimes contradictory 
testimony during the trial hurt his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't manufacture testimony. John Bobbitt is what he is, and he testified," 
Ebert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Mrs. Bobbitt smiled and talked with well-wishers as the 
panel of seven women and five men deliberated. Jurors had sent out questions to 
the judge about psychiatric reports on Mrs. Bobbitt and the judge's 
instructions on how to weigh evidence about her state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury announced its verdict after 7 1/2 hours of deliberations over two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Bobbitt, 24, was charged with malicious wounding, which carries a maximum 
sentence of 20 years in prison. The jury also considered unlawful wounding, a 
lesser felony charge that carries no more than five years in prison. She also 
could have been deported. Jurors could have acquitted her outright had they 
concluded she acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Mrs. Bobbitt argued that her four-year marriage to Bobbitt was a 
"reign of terror" in which Bobbitt sometimes beat her and sexually assaulted 
her. The couple separated twice but were living together at the time Bobbitt 
was cut. They're now seeking a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Bobbitt said she was raped early June 23 when her husband came home from 
a night of drinking with a buddy. She went into the kitchen for a glass of 
water, saw a knife by the dim light of the refrigerator and took it into the 
bedroom, where she cut off Bobbitt's penis. 
</P>
<P>
 In recounting those events, Mrs. Bobbitt testified about what went through her 
mind as she saw the knife: 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the first time he raped me. I remember the put-downs and insults 
he told me. . . . There were so many pictures in my head. I remember how he did 
anal sex with me and hurt me. I remember everything, everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyers said years of physical and sexual abuse triggered an "irresistible 
impulse" in Mrs. Bobbitt. They said she also was motivated by self-defense 
because she said Bobbitt had threatened to track her down and rape her if she 
left him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although at her husband's trial Mrs. Bobbitt was able to describe the 
mutilation, she testified in her own trial she couldn't remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors tried to depict Mrs. Bobbitt as a vengeful wife who attacked her 
husband out of anger and maintained she could not claim self-defense because 
Bobbitt was asleep when he was mutilated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt's penis was reattached surgically the same day it was severed. Doctors 
say it may take two years to find out if he will fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial in this historic Civil War town 35 miles from Washington, D.C., 
brought out dozens of reporters and television crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Court TV carried the proceedings gavel-to-gavel. Its coverage ranked 13th in 
last week's cable Nielsen ratings, attracting viewers in 1.76 million homes. 
Cable News Network also showed much of the testimony live. The Bobbitt Case

NEW BECKWITH TRIAL TO TRACK RACIST HISTORY; MISSISSIPPI: WHITE SUPREMACIST IS 
ACCUSED OF KILLING CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER MEDGAR EVERS MORE THAN 30 YEARS AGO. TWO 
EARLIER TRIALS ENDED IN HUNG JURIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIST, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Medgar Evers was cut down more than 30 years ago, his assassin was aiming 
at more than the fiery NAACP leader -- he meant to kill black dreams of racial 
justice in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 He succeeded in his first aim; he was less successful in his second. And once 
again Mississippi is seeking to come to grips with both, putting white 
supremacist Byron De La Beckwith on trial for Evers' murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the fact that the state has taken the initiative makes a great 
statement about the progress Mississippi has made as a society," said Charles 
Sallis, a Millsaps College professor whose 1974 history book once was banned 
from Mississippi's schools for dealing too honestly with the state's racist 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallis added, however: "A lot still has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, which began last week and is expected to last several weeks, will 
be the third for Beckwith, a onetime fertilizer salesman whose fingerprint 
authorities say was on the sight of the hunting rifle that killed Evers on June 
12, 1963. Two all-white juries in 1964 failed to reach verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith, now 73, has maintained that he was in his hometown of Greenwood when 
Evers was shot in the back in the driveway of his Jackson home. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's 93 miles away. It would have had to have been a mighty powerful rifle 
for me to have done it," said Beckwith, who contends the rifle was stolen from 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection will take place in Panola County, a predominantly white county 
in northern Mississippi, where attorneys hope publicity about the case has not 
tainted potential jurors. Once a jury is picked, the case will be moved back to 
Jackson for testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 That testimony will take place in the same courtroom as the previous two 
trials held in 1964 -- a year marked by the murders of three civil rights 
workers in Neshoba County. It was the "Freedom Summer," when hundreds of 
volunteers from the North and South set up programs designed to promote black 
voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Evers, the state NAACP field secretary, had championed voting rights and 
helped organize economic boycotts of businesses that discriminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's imperative, not just important, that we go on with this trial," said his 
widow, Myrlie Evers. "Justice has not been done in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Evers, who campaigned for years to have the case reopened, said a 
conviction would be important not only for Mississippi and the nation but "for 
me and my family. That night is like a movie that is on replay every day. I 
have not forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Evers had allowed her three children to remain awake to greet their 
father that night. They recognized the sound of his car pulling into the 
driveway about 12:30 a.m., and then heard the single shot. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury re-indicted Beckwith in December, 1990, after The Clarion-Ledger 
newspaper in Jackson reported that secret files from the now-defunct state 
Sovereignty Commission showed the old segregation watchdog agency had been 
asked to investigate jurors for Beckwith's second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they found no evidence of jury tampering, but steady pressure 
from Mrs. Evers and black leaders kept the investigation alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was taken to the grand jury after prosecutors said they located 
witnesses with new information. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those witnesses was the Rev. Robert L. T. Smith of Jackson, who died in 
October. Smith said in 1990 that he saw Beckwith at a meeting at a black 
Baptist church in Jackson the night Evers was slain -- a meeting that Evers 
also attended. That claim contradicts two alibi witnesses who testified at 
Beckwith's previous trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents show prosecutors have subpoenaed at least 19 witnesses, 
including nine people who testified in the 1964 trials. Among the new witnesses 
are Peggy Morgan, who lawyers claim Beckwith told in 1966 that he had killed 
Evers, and Delmar Dennis, a former Ku Klux Klansman who also claims Beckwith 
bragged about the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith still preaches white supremacy and directs those interested in his 
past to read his biography, "Glory in Conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Charlie Sallis and Myrlie Evers view the trial as symbolic for 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mississippi has a chance to finally put this behind them," Mrs. Evers said. 
"They can say to the country and to the world that Mississippi has changed or 
they can say it's the same old boys' network that has been its past." 
</P>
<P>
 Sallis said that although it would be difficult for prosecutors to reconstruct 
what happened three decades ago, "what we do know for a fact was that there was 
bias and prejudice working in the state at that time. It was a closed society."

FINLAND FORESTERS CAVE IN, CARE FOR TREES; ENVIRONMENT: WOODLAND MANAGERS MOVE 
AWAY FROM CLEAR-CUTTING PRACTICES WHEN THEY ARE THREATENED WITH LOSS OF 
MARKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stung by environmental criticism and possible loss of markets, managers of 
Finland's vast forests say they are treating their trees better after decades 
of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The eyes of Europe are on us," said Juhani Pyykkonen, trudging through the 
snow in a forest he supervises 350 miles north of Helsinki. "When we walk in 
our forests, we no longer walk alone." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the practice of clear-cutting -- felling all trees in an area, 
removing bushes, plowing the land and planting new trees. Wildlife habitats are 
destroyed; the new forests, with fewer tree varieties, are vulnerable to 
disease and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, environmentalists say, the white-backed woodpecker could become 
extinct by 2000. In addition, 700 animal and plant species are disappearing 
because of Finnish forestry methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Finnish paper makers, the world's second-largest exporters after Canada, 
protested when leading German printing houses declared recently they might halt 
imports from producers who clear-cut forests. The statement followed a campaign 
by the environmental group Greenpeace among major buyers of Finnish paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot compare our forests with the massive clear-cuttings in the Amazon, 
Siberia or North America," said Vice President Pauli Hanninen of United Paper 
Mills, Finland's main producer. "We don't destroy our forests. We're confident 
our felling practices will stand up to scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Forests provide 40% of Finnish exports. In 1993, forest products earned an 
estimated $8 billion, up 17% from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of newspapers and magazines around the world use Finnish paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Pine, spruce and birch trees cover more than two-thirds of Finland, but heavy 
logging since the 1950s has destroyed more than 90% of natural forests in what 
had been called Europe's last wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 "One cannot call it a wilderness anymore," said Erkki Lahde of the Finnish 
Forest Research Institute. "Less than 2% of primeval forest remains." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, about half the 45 million cubic yards of timber Finland's paper 
mills used were from clear-cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
 But foresters say clear-cuttings, once commonly larger than 2,500 acres, now 
average 3.7 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Foresters select individual trees for felling and allow more natural growth by 
leaving grown trees in felling areas to provide new seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciduous trees and shrubs, once thinned out in planted conifer forests, are 
allowed to grow freely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't cut down and poison saplings anymore. We let them grow as they 
enrich the soil and give us a better forest," forester Pyykkonen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, economic considerations were paramount. Now we take the environment 
into account at every level." 
</P>
<P>
 Finland's forests are in no danger of disappearing, industry spokesmen say. 
Annual fellings amount to 67 million cubic yards, while total tree growth is 
104 million cubic yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists say the industry's reliance on this simple quantitative 
measurement is what got the trees into trouble. Felling methods were tightly 
controlled by a national forestry board. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite improvements, Finnish foresters have much to do if they intend to 
conform to the new international convention on biodiversity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention, signed by 170 nations at the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil, 
calls on nations to develop ways of preserving the diversity of life and 
ensuring sustainable use of living resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we conformed to the convention, it would mean stopping all 
clear-cuttings," Lahde said. "We are shifting in the right direction, but it 
may be a question of too little, too late."

NO PLACE LIKE THIS HOME FOR 28 CHILDREN, 13 HAITIAN; CHARITY: MANY WERE RESCUED 
FROM POVERTY AND CIVIL STRIFE. 'IF WE DIDN'T, THEY'D DIE,' ANNIE RAVISH SAID.

<P>
 The Gabriel Home is like any other house full of kids: toys and clothes 
everywhere, a "Barney" video on TV, little ones underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Ed and Annie Ravish care for 28 children, many disabled and nearly 
half rescued from Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters range in age from 18 months to 16 years. The latest additions 
are two 4-year-olds. Juliette is blind and Esnel weighed just 10 pounds and 
couldn't lift his head when he arrived in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't do it, they'd die," Annie Ravish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors in the Caribbean island nation must certify the children have medical 
needs that can't be met there. Local doctors treat them free. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, with 10 of their own children, live in a nine-bedroom house. Five 
horses, four cats, three dogs, a pair of iguanas, a bird and a goat round out 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
 A tour finds two little girls in blue dresses toddling about. Six cribs line 
the walls of the front room, where two youngsters are receiving physical 
therapy. Outside, another four or so build a fort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps us busy," said Ed Ravish, 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Ties with Haiti began when they learned two years ago that an orphanage could 
no longer care for Nadege, a blind girl the Ravishes had been sponsoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I said, 'I'm going to get her,' " Annie Ravish said. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived in Haiti just before the coup that deposed President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, and was trapped for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know whether she was alive or dead for the first week," Ed Ravish 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Ravish, 43, hid in an orphanage. Trained as a midwife, she delivered 
five babies, picked up a few words of Creole and made some friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never afraid of the Haitian people," she said. "I was terrified of the 
military." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she saw soldiers shoot down a mother and child crossing the street 
after curfew and narrowly missed being shot herself while sneaking to a 
telephone one night. She kept the spent bullet, which hit a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1991, she and the girl returned. Soon after, the couple decided to 
start Gabriel Home. They have the help of more than 30 volunteers, including 
two physical therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just no other home like this," Annie Ravish said. "It's a home-home."

UNORTHODOX MEDICAL CARE GOES TO THE DOGS, AND CATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chiropractor Shirley McQuillan seldom hears complaints from the athletes she 
treats, but the few who don't take kindly to her skeletal adjustments are known 
to bite and kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had my share of bumps and bruises," said McQuillan. "I have my top 10 
list of horses that will try to kill me." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, McQuillan's clients are horses. No, they are not covered by Blue Cross. 
But, clearly, alternative health care is not just for humans anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiropractics, massage, herbal remedies, vitamin treatments and homeopathy are 
becoming more and more popular with veterinarians who see room for 
non-traditional methods in the treatment of animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Acupuncture is at the forefront, recognized by the American Veterinary Medical 
Assn. as a viable way of treating pain in animals. The International Society of 
Veterinary Acupuncture has more than 500 members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not considered unusual anymore, especially around here," said Dr. Ann-si 
Li, a San Francisco Bay Area veterinarian who for the last decade has combined 
traditional Western veterinary medicine with acupuncture, vitamin and herbal 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Her clients have included an epileptic dog, a cat with a thyroid problem and a 
cancer-ridden rat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Acupuncture is working with energetics, energy. It's something you can't see 
but it's valid," Li said. "Whenever you put a needle into the body, you get a 
physical response. With a dog that is very tired, you might put needles in 
specific areas to bring up energy in parts of the body. Once I take the needle 
out, the owner will say, 'He already looks better.' His eyes brighten up and 
the level of energy improves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not the same dog that walked in the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Li cites successes: a turtle who had stopped eating until she administered two 
needles and he "trundled over to the dish. It was really cute." She also 
treated a Pekinese-terrier mix named Moppet who had ailments of the kidney, 
liver and pancreas, as well as a mouth ulcer. After six acupuncture treatments 
and a series of herbal and vitamin treatments, Moppet recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like she came back from the dead," said Moppet's owner, Allison 
Iosif. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Bruce Little, assistant executive vice president of the American 
Veterinary Medical Assn., is skeptical. His group has recognized acupuncture 
only as a way to help alleviate pain, and has taken no position on any other 
type of alternative medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only acupuncture is recognized as a valid modality. There hasn't been any 
research done to show that (other practices) do any good, no documented 
evidence of efficacy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Michael Lemon disagrees. In the Seattle suburb of Renton, Lemon mixes 
traditional veterinary medicine with acupuncture, nutrition and homeopathy, a 
200-year-old alternative treatment that administers small doses of natural 
drugs which in a healthy patient would produce symptoms like those of the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemon notes that AVMA once scoffed at all uses of acupuncture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of time as far as acceptance. In time, I think the various 
aspects of homeopathy will be accepted at one level or another because more and 
more veterinarians are accepting it," Lemon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarians who practice alternative medicine don't advocate it for all 
types of animal injuries or illness. With broken bones or internal injuries, 
Western medicine may provide the most effective treatment, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But McQuillan said regular chiropractic adjustments and maintenance work can 
prolong a horse's athletic life by years and can help reverse certain kinds of 
lameness and irritability. 
</P>
<P>
 McQuillan, of Georgetown, Ky., counts among her clients Kentucky Derby winners 
-- "Sunday Silence hated me" -- champion jumpers and top rodeo horses. 
</P>
<P>
 She grew up on a horse ranch in northern Wisconsin run by her father, Myron 
McCone, a "human" chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, McCone tried skeletal adjustments, similar to those he made on 
humans, on one of his horses. After noticing dramatic results, he taught 
himself to alter chiropractic techniques to fit the skeletal structure of a 
horse. He eventually taught the techniques to his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no license or certification program for horse chiropractors, 
McQuillan became a riding instructor and augmented her father's training with 
seminars and reading on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical session may start with 6-foot-2 McQuillan pressing her way up a 
horse's spine, looking for trouble spots. One type of adjustment involves 
pushing on the horse's rump while she wraps the tail around her hand and jerks 
the horse away from her. She may finish up with a couple of gentle twists to 
the horse's head to align the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you adjust a horse there's a big release of endorphins. A lot of horses 
remember that and they like me a lot. One would turn around and back up to the 
stall door, waiting for me to adjust him. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I had another one who would half rear and bare her teeth. Some horses 
think I'm wonderful and others just hate me." 
</P>
<P>
 McQuillan is not a veterinarian but often works with them. She makes barn 
calls nationwide to as many as 300 horses a month, earning $65 a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Little remains a doubter. He said anyone who professes to be an equine 
chiropractor but lacks a veterinary degree is breaking the law in most states. 
</P>
<P>
 McQuillan said many people in the horse world shared Little's skepticism when 
she started 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought I was certifiable. Now it's pretty accepted and I work for vets 
all over the country. Once people feel the change it makes in their horses, 
they want the horse to feel that way all the time," she said.

'MADDING CROWD' INVITED TO HARDY HOME; LITERATURE: DORSET'S INTERNATIONALLY 
FAMOUS AUTHOR IS FINALLY BEING RECOGNIZED AT HOME. SOON, HE MAY HAVE A SPECIAL 
PLACE IN THE LOCAL MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They're opening his home to the public and plan to rebuild the church 
musicians' gallery he loved. Soon, he may even have a special place in the 
local museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Always eloquent, sometimes irascible, often inspired -- Thomas Hardy is 
gaining at home some of the glory that Dorset's leading literary son enjoys 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a classic case of a prophet not being recognized in his own country," 
said Dr. James Gibson, chairman of the Hardy Society. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of local neglect and the Hardy family's desire for privacy have 
contributed to the writer's poor profile at home, despite his massive 
international reputation, Gibson believes. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to Shakespeare, William Wordsworth or the Brontes, whose houses are 
popular shrines, Hardy's homes are relatively inaccessible. There is little 
evidence of him at Dorchester's museum, where staff battle to adequately store 
valuable Hardy manuscripts on a small budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Longstanding locals like to show they are not overly impressed by his fame," 
said Richard de Peyer, curator of the Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, most local towns and villages are prepared to cash in on Hardy, 
making the most of even the most tenuous connection. There are streets and 
coffee shops named "Casterbridge" -- his name for Dorchester. Hardy postcards 
and reprints of his works abound. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want Hardy T-shirts and we don't want Hardy soap," said Gibson. "But 
we must make more of our Hardy heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hardy died in 1928, his ashes were interred with other giants of 
literature in Poet's Corner at London's Westminster Abbey. But his family 
insisted that his heart be buried in a country churchyard at Stinsford, near 
Dorchester, where his parents met and where he was baptized. 
</P>
<P>
 There it lies, with his two wives and other relatives, and with "William Dewy, 
Tranter Reuben, Farmer Ledlow late at plough," as he says in his poem "Friends 
Beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy's heart was always in the gentle green valleys where he spent most of 
his life and which form the appealing rustic backdrop to many of his haunting 
poems and to the best-selling novels which chart the decline of England's rural 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his characters mirror the qualities and peculiarities of local people. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hardy always has been unpopular at home, Gibson said, "possibly because of 
envy and the fact that he was regarded as mean because he did not throw his 
money around." His tendency on occasion to be difficult or domineering also 
made enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 An international clamor has persuaded the National Trust to open Max Gate, the 
red brick neo-Gothic house on the edge of Dorchester that Hardy designed. He 
lived there from 1885 until his death, writing "Tess of the D'Urbervilles," 
"Jude the Obscure" and other works. 
</P>
<P>
 On three afternoons a week this summer, Hardy enthusiasts will be able to walk 
through the drawing room, conservatory and gardens where Hardy entertained such 
luminaries as Virginia Woolf, Robert Louis Stevenson, H. G. Wells and the 
Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII. Some Hardy memorabilia may be on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
 Rented as a private home, Max Gate previously only has been accessible to 
scholars and literary societies, by special arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had thousands of people coming," said William Jesty, who moved out of Max 
Gate in November after 22 years. "In the last three years we were receiving 
large coach parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said his society, which has 200 Americans among its 1,500 members, has 
had "letters from all over the world" asking to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Trust had resisted for fear of damage and because of a 
stipulation by Hardy's sister, Kate, who left the house to the trust in 1940, 
mandating that it be kept as a private residence. 
</P>
<P>
 David Bett, the trust's Wessex regional director, said officials hope that the 
new arrangements "will protect both the fabric and spirit of the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Although none of Hardy's belongings remain at Max Gate, the rooms, including 
several oddly proportioned bedrooms and a set of pinched servants' quarters, 
remain as he designed them -- proof that he chose wisely when he turned his pen 
from architecture to writing. 
</P>
<P>
 The garden, where Hardy planted 2,000 trees, features in a number of his 
poems. There he buried his beloved pets, including his favorite dog, Wessex. 
"Faithful and True," runs Hardy's carved epitaph on the pet's grave. 
</P>
<P>
 Just visible through the trees is St. Michael's Church at Stinsford, where 
generations of Hardys worshiped and are buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to restore the gallery at the back of the church, where a band once 
accompanied the singing, is likely to rekindle interest in Hardy's works. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the Greenwood Tree," his second published novel, included an 
affectionate portrait of the rustic musicians who once reigned in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 The book also introduced Wessex, an ancient geographical term for part of 
Dorset that Hardy revived. 
</P>
<P>
 In this and subsequent Wessex novels, including "The Mayor of Casterbridge," 
"Tess of the D'Urbervilles" and "Far From the Madding Crowd," Hardy explored 
the decline and fall of the rural culture of England in the 19th Century -- his 
"grand subject," according to David Wright, editor of a recent Penguin edition 
of "Under the Greenwood Tree." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dorset County Museum is appealing for funds for a permanent display of its 
collection of Hardy artifacts, estimated to be worth $74 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is poorly displayed and much of it is not properly stored," said 
de Peyer, who hopes to build a $370,000 literary gallery featuring Hardy and 
other Dorset writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Valuable original manuscripts lie in unsealed containers on bookshelves in a 
reconstruction of Hardy's study. Hot water pipes run close to the shelves and 
vital works "inevitably are deteriorating," de Peyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum has about 1,500 letters to Hardy, 800 volumes from his library and 
complete original manuscripts of "The Mayor of Casterbridge," "Under the 
Greenwood Tree," "The Woodlanders" and part of "Far From the Madding Crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 There are Hardy paintings and drawings, personal belongings including 
furniture and a large collection of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reconstructed study is the only memorial to him -- testimony, Gibson 
said, to an earlier curator's dislike for Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson hopes to persuade the National Trust to make more of the tiny thatched 
cottage in Higher Bockhampton where Hardy was born and spent his early years -- 
and where he wrote "Under the Greenwood Tree" and "Far From the Madding Crowd." 
He came from a poor family; his father started as a self-employed mason and his 
mother had been a servant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more examples of his work to be on display, to evoke an atmosphere," 
Gibson said. He would also like to see the cottage opened more regularly -- 
currently visitors must phone ahead for a viewing during certain limited hours. 
Despite this, about 18,000 people toured the tiny rooms last year.

<P>
 A Malaysian bus driver was fired after he refused to cut his nearly 6-inch 
fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia's road department told Jaafar Nordin the fingernails not only look 
bad but could hinder his driving. When Nordin refused to cut them, the 
department revoked his driver's licence. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Nordin cut his hair and nails was five years ago when he 
accepted a friend's challenge to let them grow until he gets married at the end 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest nail, on his left hand middle finger, is 5.9 inches, the New 
Straits Times reported Friday.

RESTORATION WOULD BE MUSIC TO HIS EARS; HARDY: ST. MICHAEL'S CHURCH WILL BE 
SITE OF A 'QUIRE' GALLERY AS A TRIBUTE TO OLD DORSET CUSTOM FEATURED IN 
AUTHOR'S WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Thomas Hardy's forebears, worship was enlivened by a merry troupe of 
musicians and singers who performed Psalms and other sacred pieces set to local 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the writer reached manhood, high church killjoys had abolished 
these traditional Dorset "quires" and replaced them with organs and somber 
hymns. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, the musicians' galleries were pulled down. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, thanks to a $104,000 bequest from Richard Little Purdy, a Hardy scholar 
at Yale University, St. Michael's Church, where the Hardys worshiped, will be 
able to rebuild its gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again the rafters of this small, squat edifice of gray stone will ring to 
the sound of violins, cellos, oboes and bassoons -- and the lively caroling of 
singers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to rebuild the gallery as close as possible to the original," said 
William Jesty, a member of St. Michael's parochial council. "There are groups 
which are reviving 19th-Century church music and we hope they will play special 
occasions and concerts." Original scores are preserved in the Dorset County 
Museum in Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
 The bequest also will allow the church to restore a 1930s organ given by 
Hardy's sister, Kate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy learned of the quires from his grandfather, father and uncle -- who all 
played at one time or another in the oak musicians' gallery at St. Michael's in 
Stinsford. A plaque notes that they performed "the office of string players." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Under the Greenwood Tree," his second published novel, Hardy pays tribute 
to a vanished tradition with an affectionate portrait of the "Mellstock quire," 
a rambunctious troupe of cider-drinking musicians, who entertain worshipers 
until reform-minded vicar Mr. Maybold decrees that they must go. 
</P>
<P>
 "One is inclined to regret the displacement of these ecclesiastical bandsmen 
by an isolated organist," Hardy wrote in a preface to the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "The change has tended to stultify the professed aims of the clergy, its 
direct result being to curtail and extinguish the interest of parishioners in 
church doings." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Michael's quire was abolished in the 1840s by the church's vicar, the Rev. 
Arthur Shirley, a keen supporter of the Oxford Movement and the revival of 
medieval ritual, who felt the convivial band "distracted from the preaching," 
said Jesty. Shirley opted instead for a clockwork barrel organ. 
</P>
<P>
 Stinsford's rotted oak gallery finally came down during restoration work in 
1911. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdy, a quiet, shy man from a wealthy Boston family, regularly visited 
Britain in the 1930s and got to know Hardy's second wife, Florence, who lived 
on at Max Gate after her husband's death in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1978 and 1988, Purdy published seven volumes of Hardy's letters with 
Hardy biographer Michael Millgate. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdy left a bequest for the upkeep and preservation of St. Michael's Church, 
where Hardy's heart is buried with his two wives, "in affectionate remembrance" 
of Florence Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Hardy gave Purdy a lot of minor manuscript material, including scrapbooks 
and source material. He left most of his impressive Hardy collection to Yale, 
but some items went to the Dorset County Museum in Dorchester.

GREAT LAKES DREDGING DUE AS GUNK MOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been more than 30 years since the government dredged the Ashtabula 
River in northeast Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have been trying for years to get a navigable path cleared through 
the river for recreational boats. Trouble is, the Ashtabula is full of heavy 
metals and cancer-causing chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Properly dredging the river will be expensive, and once it's dredged there's 
another problem: what to do with all the contaminated muck. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Great Lakes, there is too much contamination and a dwindling 
inventory of places to store it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious matter for the region," said Steve Thorp, program manager 
for the Great Lakes Commission in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has built 26 places around the lakes to hold dredged-out mud 
too polluted to dump back in the water. Six of them are full; four more will 
fill up in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimates 
that by 2006, there will be no more room in 24 of the 26 facilities. The five 
Ohio facilities, for example, expect to be full by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Five million cubic yards of silt are dredged out of Great Lakes shipping 
channels each year. About half of that is too dirty to return to the water, 
said Allegra Cangelosi, director of the Great Lakes Washington Program. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs the federal government more than $33 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all dredged material used to be routinely dumped back into the lakes. 
Then Congress decided that contaminated soil should be dumped elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1974, the Army Corps of Engineers has been opening disposal sites to 
store soils contaminated by chemicals and heavy metals. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress had assumed the flow of pollution would eventually stop, so it 
planned for 10 years of sediment storage and set aside the problem of what to 
do with the muck. 
</P>
<P>
 But new pollutants kept going into the lakes, and dredging never got rid of 
all the old accumulation. Now that original 10-year plan has become permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to contaminated muck in the future depends in part on what 
Congress does when it renews the Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. John Glenn and Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. Eric Fingerhut, all Ohio 
Democrats, have introduced a package of Great Lakes proposals that give a high 
priority to dealing with toxic gunk on the lake bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
 They want full-scale testing of new sediment cleanup technology, plans for 
dealing with confined disposal facilities after they close, more Environmental 
Protection Agency authority over dredging, a new trust fund to use Clean Water 
Act penalty money to pay for cleanup projects, and help for Great Lakes 
communities to reduce the pollutants in wet-weather runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorp said the commission hopes Congress also will come up with a uniform 
policy for paying to expand the disposal facilities. "Some places have to foot 
the bill entirely on their own," while the federal government foots the bill 
elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the commission has lobbied unsuccessfully to move the entire 
responsibility to the federal government; however, now it is hoping for a 
single, uniform formula regionwide -- perhaps a 75%-25% split, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, chemicals continue to pollute the lakes, and industry, 
environmentalists and politicians are tussling over an effort to rewrite the 
rules that say how much can be released there legally.

 The Health Ministry is moving to lift a ban on residual antibiotics and 
antibacterials in beef and pork, in response to demands from the United States 
and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, antibiotics in meats were banned in 1975 and antibacterial residues 
were prohibited in 1979. The bans effectively curtailed meat imports from the 
United States and Europe, which use the banned products in livestock.

HUNT FOR SAFE STAIRCASES GIVES CAREER A LIFT; ARCHITECT: JOHN TEMPLER CALLS 
STAIRS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Novelist Gustave Flaubert once said: "Architects, all idiots; they always 
forget to put in the stairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes that's a good thing, said one of the defamed, John Templer. 
</P>
<P>
 The architect calls stairs one of the world's most dangerous products. He has 
spent 23 years climbing them, from the Spanish Steps in Rome to New York's 
Lincoln Center, to prove his point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stair safety should matter as much as brakes on a car," said Templer, who 
designed the staircase in his Atlanta home with safety features. "But people 
don't think of stairs as dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 They should. Every year, 1 million Americans seek medical treatment for falls 
on staircases. About 50,000 are hospitalized and 4,000 die. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States isn't unique. In Japan, more people die on stairs than in 
fires, Templer said. But stair safety has largely been ignored, Templer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects still build steps for the size of shoe people wore in 1850. Templer 
said stairs are slippery, too steep, often badly built and have inadequate 
railings. 
</P>
<P>
 Templer, a Georgia Tech architect who has traced the history of steps in a 
two-volume book called "The Staircase," is on a quest for the perfect stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 His interest began as a student at Columbia University, when someone asked him 
why people were always falling down the steps outside Lincoln Center. Templer 
discovered there was no research on stair safety. Nobody even counted falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Curious, he visited Lincoln Center with his family and his sister-in-law 
tripped on the steps. Templer called his mentor to propose the topic as a 
thesis and learned that the man had just broken his leg falling down a 
stairwell of a subway station. 
</P>
<P>
 A career was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "All stairs are dangerous; it's a matter of degree," Templer said. "There are 
ways to mitigate the danger, if we could get that message to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Stairs evolved from ladders and first were used for defense. Narrow winding 
staircases, for instance, hampered intruders. Europeans wrought stairs into 
works of art, building grand palace staircases that gradually steepened, 
forcing visitors into a slow, stately pace as they approached royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Most stairs have 9-inch treads and 8 1/2-inch risers, a size determined around 
1850, Templer said. But people today have bigger feet that hang over the edges 
of stairs, throwing them off balance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stairs also are too high, Templer concluded after experiments in which he 
forced volunteers to trip on collapsible stairs. They were harnessed so they 
didn't tumble all the way to the floor, but Templer used videos to simulate how 
they would have landed. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants building codes revised for stairs with 11-inch treads and 7-inch 
risers. His proposal prompted a lobbying blitz from the National Assn. of Home 
Builders, which contends that larger stairs would add at least 150 square feet 
and $1,500 in costs to a typical house. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Meyer of the builders' association dismissed Templer's work, saying 
people fall when stairs are improperly lighted, have loose carpeting or have 
objects placed in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 That's true, too, Templer said. But he said his experiments, funded by the 
National Science Foundation, prove stair shape is a large problem. And, he 
added, the steps in many staircases aren't even the same size -- a sure way to 
trip people up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get out a measuring tape and measure the darn thing," he advises home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, other architects are beginning to agree. Canadian researchers using 
trick stairs showed most banisters are too low to stop falls. Public buildings 
with wide, shallow steps often have them painted to catch people's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 In his home, Templer's gracefully curving staircase forces people to walk 
slowly. The 11-by-7 steps alternate light and dark brown so each is visible. 
The banister is covered with foam and leather for a good grip. The non-skid 
carpeting covers thick padding to cushion any fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have enough knowledge now to be able to make reasonably safe stairs," he 
said. "It's like building a 1900 automobile today, without the seat belts and 
the air bags, even though you know better. There's no excuse."

<P>
 Republican leaders Friday called President Clinton soft on crime and outlined 
their own get-tough approach -- including immediate construction of military 
stockades to house violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a three-day party strategy session in advance of Nov. 8 elections, 
Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican Whip, said new emergency 
stockades on surplus military bases would help "shatter the culture of violence 
and overwhelm the relatively small number of truly destructive people in our 
midst." 
</P>
<P>
 "We should build as many stockades as necessary and as quickly as though this 
were wartime and people were dying -- because they are," Gingrich told a 
breakfast meeting of party officials.

UNIVERSITY FACULTIES BEING TAUGHT TO TEACH; HIGHER EDUCATION: STUDENTS SEE 
SPECIAL TRAINING CENTERS AS REASSURING NEWS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION 
THEY ARE RECEIVING WHILE TUITION CONTINUES TO SPIRAL.

 It's a cold and gloomy Friday morning near the end of the semester, but the 
students in one Smith College mathematics class sit spellbound. 
</P>
<P>
 They're deep into a calculus equation meant to figure out the speed with which 
a vat of grape juice ferments into wine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here the problems are complex, they're messy, but they're interesting," said 
teacher Jim Callahan, part of a group devising new ways to teach calculus. "It 
draws the students in." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and four other colleges in western Massachusetts have begun a 
three-year, $300,000 campaign that tackles something higher education is often 
accused of overlooking: teaching teachers to teach. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are the University of Massachusetts, Mt. Holyoke, Amherst and 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirsten Tambo, a Smith sophomore, said the effort makes a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took calculus in high school and it was just a bunch of numbers on the 
board. This is more like real life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent report by the Wingspread Group on Higher Education said colleges and 
universities put teaching second to research. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too much of education at every level seems to be organized for the 
convenience of educators and the institutions' interests, procedures and 
prestige, and too little focused on the needs of students," the commission 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest in a series of similar pronouncements, and more universities 
are taking note. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teaching is a difficult art," said Edward Foote, University of Miami's 
president. "Some people are born to it. Some have to learn it." 
</P>
<P>
 His university is one of several that have opened centers in which teachers 
can volunteer to be videotaped and critiqued. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar centers are run by Stanford University, the University of Georgia, 
Southwest Texas State, the University of Washington, the University of 
Massachusetts and Carleton College in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Students see the centers as reassuring news about the quality of education 
they receive while tuition spirals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a teacher has difficulty communicating, you're wasting your money and 
your time," said Tchiyuka Cornelius, president of the U.S. Student Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Some faculty say they're taking too much of the blame. They say research 
enhances, and does not impede, their teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a notion that people are good researchers and therefore not 
interested in undergraduate teaching," said Robert Hallock, chairman of physics 
and astronomy at the University of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, the vitality they gain from doing research at the frontier keeps 
them enthusiastic, and when they get into the classroom they communicate that 
enthusiasm to undergraduates." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst Benjamin, general secretary of the 42,000-member American Assn. of 
University Professors, said the problem isn't with the quality of teaching, but 
with other obstacles to learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major problems have to do with issues like the students being part-time, 
the faculty being part-time, the substitution of two-year for four-year 
education and large class sizes," Benjamin said. "I don't see training faculty 
to teach as any panacea." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the debate about getting faculty to teach better is really about 
getting faculty to teach more. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Wulff, assistant director of the Center for Instructional Development 
and Research at the University of Washington and president of a national 
faculty teacher training network, said the problem is "finding a workable 
balance between the teaching and research."

 After owning and loving her dog, Tascha, for 12 years, Dawn Schneider had to 
decide whether to try to save her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Tascha, a black English cocker spaniel, wasn't expected to live for long 
unless she underwent a radical mastectomy. Schneider said yes to the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a decision Schneider repeated two more times last year after 
veterinarians found growths on the dog's other breasts and then its kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 The operations did extend Tascha's life. They also relieved Schneider and her 
family, but left her wallet about $1,800 lighter. She dreads another pet health 
care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I view her as part of my family. I can't not do something. I couldn't live 
with the guilt if I didn't do everything I could," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As medical technology grows, pet owners face an array of sophisticated -- and 
expensive -- procedures: dialysis for dogs, cat chemotherapy and even pet 
pacemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost always, the procedures are performed without insurance. While ailing 
Old Yellers were taken behind the barn and shot, today's pet owners face 
tougher choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only an issue of how much you love your pet, but how much you can 
afford," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 No hard numbers for medical procedures exist; however, the number of 
veterinarians in the United States grew by 49% during the 1980s to 65,767, 
according to the American Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Pet owners can choose among such specialists as dermatologists, oncologists 
and cardiologists to perform high-tech services. 
</P>
<P>
 Dialysis is performed on dogs who damage their kidneys lapping up anti-freeze, 
hip replacements are made for old and fragile-boned purebreds and CAT scans are 
performed on cancerous cats. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 U.S. dog and cat owners, for instance, annually choose to fit 
their pets with pacemakers, and even more choose open-heart surgery, according 
to Dr. Larry Tilly, a veterinarian cardiologist in Santa Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Ailing animals can have their lives extended up to one or two years with 
pacemakers costing as little as $500, compared to the $10,000 to $15,000 their 
owners must pay for their own, Tilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the pacemakers in pets are models previously used by humans. Tilly, in 
fact, supplies his fellow vets with used pacemakers he gets from other medical 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other pet care procedures are a bargain when compared to the same 
procedures performed on humans, largely because pet insurance isn't widely 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 People with brain tumors might be charged $35,000 for treatment, but the same 
procedures could be done on a cat for $1,000, said Steven Withrow, a 
veterinarian in charge of clinical oncology at Colorado State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Withrow's clinic attracts desperate pet owners from across the United States 
and other countries, but he said he must be able to offer relatively 
inexpensive treatments because of the lack of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market just won't bear the same prices that human physicians get away 
with," Withrow said. "Part of the job in veterinary medicine is we have to be 
in the position to offer the Cadillac of care, but we also offer the used 
Volkswagen." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, veterinarians also offer the ultimate cost-cutting product their 
colleagues who work on humans can't: euthanasia. The old ace-in-the-hole of 
veterinary care will always be around, but experts say even that choice has 
become more complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Rollin, a professor of philosophy and physiology at Colorado State who 
studies attitudes toward animals, said people have become much more emotionally 
attached to their pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got started (more than 15 years ago), the idea that there was grief 
for a pet was ludicrous. You'd get responses like, 'It's a dog, get another 
dog,' " Rollin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, emotionally charged situations like Michelle Cobey's of Seattle are the 
norm. Cobey recalls how it took her days to decide to end the life of Mac, a 
scruffy black stray cat she took into her home. After a few years, Mac's 
kidneys began failing. Eventually, Cobey decided not to pay for dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "My choice was to spend $500 or $600 dollars to do some things that might help 
him, but might not," Cobey said. "It was very, very difficult. I kept wanting 
somebody to tell me what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Every veterinarian has war stories about anguished families engaging in a grim 
calculus that evaluates the pet's quality of life, the owners' emotions and the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ronald Scharf, who practices outside Schenectady, said the problem is 
especially acute for poorer families, who might sometimes literally have to 
choose between shoes for the children or drugs for the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "People of limited financial opportunities might be more of the mind to put 
the animal down," Scharf said. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlighting their differences with doctors, many veterinarians consider 
euthanasia "a gift" that can put an animal out of its misery. A doctor who does 
that for one of his human patients can be charged with murder.

LET IT SNOW, LET IT SNOW, PUZZLED SCIENTISTS SAY; WEATHER: RESEARCHERS ARE 
MYSTIFIED AT EARLY MELTING TRENDS. IT'S TOO EARLY TO BLAME GLOBAL WARMING, THEY 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After slogging through it, being stuck in it and even dying from it, you'd 
think that human beings by now would know everything there is to know about 
snow. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
 Solid, liquid and gas at varying times, snow is a complex substance whose 
behavior -- on land and in the air -- still eludes scientists. Wet snow is an 
entirely different material from dry snow, and within the wet and dry 
categories are numerous different types. 
</P>
<P>
 When snow hits the ground, it is no longer the same substance that has been 
falling through the atmosphere. And fallen snow, a good insulator of the soil 
it blankets, undergoes constant change. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to snow on the ground -- how it bonds, breaks apart, melts and 
refreezes -- matters for everything from avalanche prediction to the design of 
better-performing tires for military tanks and private cars, safer skis for 
airplanes, faster skis for people, more effective but environmentally correct 
de-icing chemicals for highways and "grooming" techniques for smoother, 
longer-lasting snow roads and snowmobile trails. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War has melted some snow-cover research, says Russell 
Alger, director of the Institute for Snow Research in Michigan's Upper 
Peninsula. Except for Bosnia-Herzegovina in winter, the big push now militarily 
is for improved vehicle mobility -- not in snow, but in desert sand. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 95% of Earth's seasonally snow-covered land lies in the Northern 
Hemisphere, which holds most of the planet's landmass. 
</P>
<P>
 From December through March, the white stuff blankets 16 million to 20 million 
square miles of the hemisphere, the majority of the land north of 40 degrees 
latitude. By midsummer it all disappears, except for glacial snow and ice 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1972, satellite images, which have provided the first consistent record 
of snow coverage, have shown that the year-to-year horizontal expanse of winter 
snow has not varied significantly across the Northern Hemisphere as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the snow has melted earlier in the spring in the past six years -- in 
March and April, rather than April and May," said geographer David A. Robinson, 
of Rutgers University in New Jersey, who has analyzed the satellite data. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest change in recent snow cover is not so much its lack in winter as 
its early end, its reduction in spring," agreed Kenneth F. Dewey, professor of 
climatology at the University of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the early spring snow loss? Scientists aren't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a strong correlation between temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere 
and the extent of snow cover," Robinson said. "Does recent warmth in spring 
cause the early end of snow cover, or does the early snow loss have a 
subsequent impact on temperature? Once you have the loss, it kind of 
snowballs." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers are "trying to unravel this chicken-and-egg question," Robinson 
said. "It is too early -- the record is too short -- to attribute this to 
global warming." 
</P>
<P>
 While snow coverage has not changed much globally, snow depth may have 
decreased. There is no similar satellite record, because the current technology 
cannot yet distinguish different snow depths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monitoring snow cover may give an index to future climate change," Robinson 
said. "Snow has to be an important piece of the climatological puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
 Earth loses a good portion of its heat from the reflection of sunlight off 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow on the ground, especially fresh snow (the whitest), reflects back about 
90% of the sun's rays, said Samuel C. Colbeck, a senior research scientist at 
the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in Hanover, N.H. 
"The more snow cover, the more solar radiation is reflected back." 
</P>
<P>
 To fit another piece into the weather puzzle, Dewey is analyzing satellite 
data of Southern Hemisphere snow cover for the first time to determine whether 
it is in phase with the Northern Hemisphere's. About 800,000 square miles of 
the Southern Hemisphere, mostly in South America, are snow-covered seasonally.

JEAN-LOUIS BARRAULT; FRENCH CLASSIC ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jean-Louis Barrault, considered by many to be France's greatest classic actor, 
died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor-director, whose versatility and dramatic gifts delighted 
international audiences for more than 50 years, was 83 when he died at his home 
in western Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuters news agency said he died of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of both classic and contemporary drama, Barrault was equally at ease 
with Shakespeare's "Hamlet," Ionesco's "Rhinoceros" or a bold stage adaptation 
of Rabelais' Renaissance masterpiece, "Gargantua and Pantagruel." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after his death, tributes began pouring in from actors and public 
figures; French television stations changed their programs to run his films. 
</P>
<P>
 Culture Minister Jacques Toubon said Barrault "held high the flag of theater 
and the flag of France in his triumphant tours abroad" and he praised the 
actor's "unique mixture of subtlety and power, of intelligence and energy." 
</P>
<P>
 As an actor, he proved an expert mime and an accomplished vocal melodramatist. 
That diversity extended to what some felt was the ridiculous when he staged 
what he called a "dramatic game," a 1970 rock musical version of the barnyard 
characters that make up the oeuvre of Rabelais. He named the extravaganza for 
the 16th-Century French satirist whose name has become synonymous with coarse 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics in New York and Los Angeles were exuberant; audiences who spoke no 
French were perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his other audacious moves was the staging of "The Screens" by Jean 
Genet, a confessed thief who spent years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrault also starred in numerous films, including his best known part as 
Baptiste in Marcel Carne's 1945 classic, 'The Children of Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 He also had featured roles in "The Longest Day" in 1961 and "La Nuit de 
Varennes" in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Le Vesinet outside Paris, Barrault decided on a theatrical career when 
he was only 6. He studied at drama school and began as a mime. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrault and actress Madeleine Renaud were married in 1940, and they formed 
one of France's most enduring and prominent stage couples, likened to the 
American-British husband-and-wife team of Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1947 they founded the popular Theatre de Marigny on the Champs Elysees, 
which for 10 years played to audiences of artists and intellectuals, 
celebrities and socialites and working-class men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brilliant decade at Marigny, the Renaud-Barrault troupe moved into the 
state-subsidized Odeon theater where they staged the works of such contemporary 
playwrights as Henri de Montherlant, Jean Anouilh, Jean Giraudoux, Eugene 
Ionesco and Samuel Beckett. 
</P>
<P>
 After an evening of French readings at UCLA in 1969, a Los Angeles Times drama 
critic likened Barrault and Renaud on stage to a melding of metals: 
</P>
<P>
 "He clenches a fist at life; she extends a hand. He would change the world; 
she would make you comfortable in it. He is brass, she is silver." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrault brought to his personal affairs a passionate force for human rights 
and tolerance. During the student-worker rebellion in May, 1968, Barrault sided 
with rioting students, whom he let into the Odeon. 
</P>
<P>
 He was fired as director of France's International Theatre des Nations 
Festival after the riots but agreed to return at government invitation three 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
 As a director, Barrault experimented with theater in the round, staging 
Rabelais in an old dance hall converted to house wrestling matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1981, he and Renaud had run the Theatre du Rond Point on the Champs 
Elysees, where they put on the best plays written by contemporary writers. 
</P>
<P>
 As he aged, his productions grew more temperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now," he told The Times in one of his last U.S. tours, "we are 
performing works that are lighter and aimed at enjoyment as a reaction against 
the daily cataclysms that existence proposes. It is in pleasure taken that 
mankind finds its harmony." 
</P>
<P>
 Renaud is believed to be his only survivor.

JARAMOGI ODINGA; KENYA'S FIRST VICE PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 Jaramogi Odinga, 76, who helped bring multi-party politics back to Kenya. 
Odinga, the country's first vice president, was among the opposition leaders to 
President Daniel Moi who successfully pressed for additional political parties 
and formed two of them.In 1992, in the country's first multi-party election in 
26 years, Odinga finished third in balloting that reelected Moi. He was named 
minister for home affairs in 1962 and became the country's first vice president 
in 1964. He resigned from the government in 1966 and formed a socialist party 
that was later outlawed. In later years Odinga was seen as a crusader for 
democracy and human rights, but his flirtation with communism in the 1960s 
derailed his political career for more than a decade. On Thursday in Kisimu,

ARTHUR ALTMAN; WROTE 400 SONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arthur Altman, who wrote the lyrics to "I Will Follow Him," which was revived 
by Whoopi Goldberg in the film "Sister Act," and the music to "All or Nothing 
At All," Frank Sinatra's first hit record, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the American Society of Composers Authors & Publishers said 
over the weekend that Altman, who wrote more than 400 songs, died in Lake 
Worth, Fla., of a heart ailment on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, who joined ASCAP in 1934, wrote the lyrics for "I Will Follow Him" in 
the early 1960s. It became the No. 1 song in the country in 1963 after it was 
recorded by Brenda Lee. He also wrote another Lee hit, "All Alone Am I." 
</P>
<P>
 Sinatra recorded "All or Nothing at All" shortly after joining the Tommy 
Dorsey band. More than 250 versions of the song have since been recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 A classical musician by training, Altman began his professional career as a 
violinist with the CBS Radio Orchestra.

bomb on Hiroshima. He owned a number of bookstores over the years but much of 
his business was carried out at Gino's, a restaurant in New York City where he 
worked and ate over nearly five decades. In New York City on Wednesday.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO NEIGHBORLINESS?; * CITIZENS BAND RADIO ENTHUSIAST WHO 
SAVED LIVES SHOULD BE LAUDED, NOT FINED $50 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent story of the citizens band radio enthusiast who ran afoul of his 
Laguna Hills homeowners association was chock full of lessons in 
neighborliness. We hear a lot about the need for people to get along, and 
separately, about the excessive zeal of neighborhood associations. This unusual 
tale had all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Wright, a 20-year-old Explorer Scout, was targeted by his homeowners 
association in Laguna Hills after he used his citizens band radio to guide a 
Coast Guard helicopter and Orange County sheriff's patrol boat to rescue a boat 
stranded off Dana Point. Instead of giving Wright a badge, they went after him 
for using his CB at all. The 124-member Moulton Parkway Assn. No. 1 fined 
Wright $50. Neighbors complained that Wright's communications interrupted their 
cordless telephones and television reception. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed like the ultimate tale of Orange County homeowners associations run 
amok. They are fabled for their varied restrictions on everything from housing 
color choices, to whether vegetables can be grown within view (gasp!) of the 
street. But here was a youngster who had saved lives and was getting docked for 
being a good Samaritan. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness to the association, such interference at most times obviously 
could be annoying and generally unneighborly. But what timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there was more to the story. The Orange County Human Relations 
Commission confirmed that it had stepped in to conduct an informal mediation 
last year between Wright's family and a neighbor who had complained about the 
young man. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, this was a story that should have had a happy, feel-good ending. 
Instead, it left people feeling uneasy, and not just in the neighborhood. The 
lessons seem obvious enough. Don't quibble about the rules when lives are at 
stake. And neighbors ought to be able to iron out their differences and learn 
how to get along.

LESSONS LEARNED IN NEIGHBORS' TRAGEDY; * VOLUNTEERS WHO WENT TO L.A. DESERVE 
PRAISE; ANAHEIM'S BID FOR AID WAS A BAD JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the sublime to the ridiculous -- Orange County was mostly unaffected by 
the Northridge Earthquake last week. We had many heroes and one conspicuous 
goat. 
</P>
<P>
 County emergency personnel performed wonderfully in coming to the assistance 
of our neighbors to the north stricken by the Northridge earthquake. Officials 
went beyond mere assessment of local effects to contribute mightily to the 
assistance efforts in the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles. Fortunately, the 
county suffered remarkably little damage and no major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 But with all the real suffering elsewhere, what an outrageous proposal the 
city of Anaheim made in an effort to get federal and state assistance in fixing 
the collapsed scoreboard at Anaheim Stadium. The city sought repair money even 
as the city manager was pointing to a "structural flaw" in the collapsed Sony 
Jumbotron. Anaheim should be content to count its blessings that the scoreboard 
didn't come tumbling down during a stadium event, causing injury and death, and 
exposing the city to uncalculated liability. 
</P>
<P>
 So on to much finer moments. The county sent fire engines, firefighters, 56 
members of the Orange County Urban Search and Rescue squad and its Heavy Rescue 
Team, the unit that had pulled a man from the collapsed Nimitz Freeway after 
the 1989 Loma Prieta quake in the Bay Area. Additionally, doctors and nurses 
went, and so did Marine helicopters to ferry infants. The National Guard 
activated its emergency center in Los Alamitos, and county building inspectors 
and public works crews were available to assess damage. 
</P>
<P>
 These courageous and dedicated people made Orange County a good neighbor. But 
even as the county personnel reached out, there was evidence from the quake of 
work to be done at home to prepare for the worst in the future. The review 
reminded local officials of a 1989 study showing many county fire stations 
considered "very unlikely" to survive a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors wisely called for a new review of earthquake risks to 
the stations. But the way out of the dilemma will not be made any easier simply 
by more study. And the county has made some effort to shore up and secure 
problem doors on fire stations already. The larger point is that its budget 
crisis is not going to go away. The county got only a good scare this time; 
deciding how to allocate money to the Fire Department will test the ability of 
local officials to make good judgments about priorities.

ANTI-GANG PROGRAM A GOOD TEAM EFFORT; * COOPERATION BETWEEN AGENCIES HELPS TO 
CUT RED TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana police are moving quickly to get a new anti-gang program up and 
running. Based on a successful program in Westminster, the Santa Ana version 
has a new wrinkle that could serve the city well: It includes agents from the 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster program began two years ago, teaming a deputy district 
attorney, an investigator from the district attorney's office, Probation 
Department officers and police for a coordinated crackdown on the most violent 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting everyone together makes it easier to cut red tape and avoid layers of 
bureaucracy. It's quicker to get search warrants; a prosecutor can advise how 
to make a case more likely to stand up in court; a probation officer can spot a 
gang member known to be violating conditions of probation. Westminster Police 
Chief James Cook said violent felonies dropped 59% in the two years after the 
program started. 
</P>
<P>
 That's an impressive record, one that deserved emulation. Orange County Dist. 
Atty. Michael R. Capizzi had the good idea of urging county officials to expand 
the program, and the Board of Supervisors wisely agreed. Santa Ana will get two 
of the team programs, with Anaheim, Garden Grove, Orange and Costa Mesa also on 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Santa Ana decided two months ago to seek help from ATF as well. 
Santa Ana Police Capt. Dan McCoy, coordinating what will be called the Street 
Terrorist Offender Project, or STOP, said in some cases there are tough federal 
laws for gun crimes and in applicable cases, ATF agents can steer accused 
criminals to federal prosecutors. That's another valuable weapon for the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATF is part of the Treasury Department, whose secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, 
said this month that Orange County had developed into one of the nation's 10 
most crime-ridden localities. There is some question over the statistics used 
in Bentsen's ranking but there is no doubt that Santa Ana registered a record 
80 homicides last year, with a record 47 of them gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides providing agents to help the Santa Ana anti-gang unit, the Treasury 
Department has ordered ATF agents to redouble their efforts to learn the source 
of guns used by criminals in Orange County. Coming up with that kind of 
information is a tall order, but if the agents can fulfill it, they will 
provide valuable assistance that can help cut off the source of criminals' 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem for ATF investigators is that far too many guns are available. The 
California Department of Justice estimated that handgun sales in Orange County 
totaled more than 50,000 last year, double the figure in 1986, when 
record-keeping began. ATF agents said when they track a gun, they check first 
to see if it was stolen. In some cases, homeowners do not realize guns were 
taken in residential burglaries until police tell them. So much for home 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the federal help, Santa Ana police have their work cut out for them, 
since the county's most populous city has the largest number of gangs. The 
investigators are right to single out the toughest, most dangerous gangsters 
for pursuit and prosecution. A study of Westminster's program last year found 
that nearly half of those prosecuted were charged with crimes involving guns. 
And contrary to some perceptions, most victims of gang crime were not members 
of rival gangs, but innocent civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 As those involved in fighting gangs have noted, it took years for the gang 
problem to grow to the fearsome proportions it attained, and it will take years 
to reduce gangs' power. STOP should be a good start.

STUDENT ALLIANCE'S RIGHT TO MEET MOVES OTHERS TO SPEAK FREELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Louis P. Sheldon's well-honed skill of vacillating between the laws of 
Caesar and the laws of the Lord is giving unto me a headache. At the onset of 
this debate, I knew it would only be a matter of time before His Bellicosity 
squared off against the untold threat of these teen-age students. 
</P>
<P>
 The hollow diatribe of this sore loser illuminates the flimsiness of his stand 
against an issue addressed in a democratic forum and OKd by the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting California Penal Code, and somehow mystically entering into the 
thought processes of Congress on the creation of the Equal Access Act, Sheldon 
demonstrates his ability at bridging the important gap between religion and 
state . . . as the need arises. 
</P>
<P>
 What does a support organization for a group of American citizens who have 
historically been despised and threatened have to do with sex? Nothing. The 
ongoing religious oppression backed by Mr. Sheldon and his followers is 
responsible for the exodus away from the major churches over the past two 
decades, as well as the increased incidence of hate crimes in recent years.  
</P>
<P>
 When a religious leader fails to see the simple goodness of providing safe 
harbor for his fellow journeyers in this life, then it is time for this person 
to re-evaluate his objectives and to ascertain just which God he is responsible 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 My prescription for the chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition is 40 
days and nights of meditation in the desert . . . and I don't mean Palm 
Springs. 
</P>

 * Looking at The Times' front-page picture of Fountain Valley High School 
Student Alliance member Christina Grant (Jan. 12) and reading the supporting 
article "O.C. School's Gay-Support Group Wins OK," I was reminded of the saying 
"actions speak louder than words." The group states their goal is to promote 
acceptance and understanding of all people and yet the picture shows Ms. Grant 
in a shirt that depicts a cross in a circle with a slash mark across it and the 
word religion above. 
</P>
<P>
 Proudly wearing the anti-Christian shirt strongly suggests her lack of respect 
for Christians and causes concern for the effectiveness of the group's 
proclaimed goal of tolerance for all people. 
</P>
<P>
 BONNIE O'NEIL

</P>
<P>
 * Regarding your coverage of the Fountain Valley Student Alliance, the support 
group for gay and lesbian students (Jan.12): I am proud to be an activist for 
gay/lesbian and AIDS issues in Orange County. Yet I purposely refrained from 
attending the recent school board meetings regarding this student group. 
</P>
<P>
 I object to the presence of uninvited guests, such as members of the 
Traditional Values Coalition or National Gay and Lesbian Task Force at the 
school board deliberations. The Fountain Valley Student Alliance is a group 
that has taken the initiative to make its own decisions. Certainly, the 
students have the right to invite whomever they choose to support them. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when national organizations appear to offer their "support," part of 
the educational process is jeopardized, and the lives of the individual 
students involved become pawns in the political game between powerful adult 
interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger is that the elected officials involved will make decisions based on 
the political interests of the adult groups, not on the basis of what the 
students want. 
</P>
<P>
 So I say to outsiders on both sides, whether from the TVC, the NGLTF or 
wherever, until someone asks for assistance, let these kids learn on their own. 
Part of the educational process in a pluralistic society should be learning how 
to come to terms with differences of opinion. Certainly, adults should be 
available as resources when requested. 
</P>
<P>
 These youth, on both sides, are our future. Let them find their own way for 
conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe their solution will be better than the bitterness that characterizes the 
current debate over the rights of gays and lesbians and the rights of 
association all Americans enjoy. 
</P>

<P>
 * In a recent letter to the editor (Jan. 16), Louis P. Sheldon asserted that 
Fountain Valley High, a public school, should not allow a gay support group to 
meet because it advocates sexual intercourse between minors, which is illegal 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 While this sounds logical on the surface, it does deserve further examination. 
Sheldon is mistaken to believe that this support group is actively encouraging 
sex. In fact, these students want, and are getting, nothing more than a caring, 
supportive environment made up of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Sheldon is the one who continually positions this as a sexual issue.

REMEMBERING THE MAN BEHIND MLK DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin? Can you tell me where he's gone? 
He freed lotta people, but the good, they die young Abraham, Martin and John  
</P>
<P>
 I was reminded of this song, by Dion, on the day that my family marked as a 
holiday acknowledging the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. Recently, I 
respectfully spoke with my students about the contributions of this great 
American. As is usually the case when I share something that is particularly 
pertinent or meaningful to my students, several stopped by to thank me for 
sharing and reminding them about the struggles that people often go through to 
bring about change. It's about remembering! 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine my disappointment when reading the article "Many Cities, Firms Ignore 
King Holiday," (Jan. 17). Nice to know that trash was being picked up -- wasn't 
Dr. King in Memphis to help garbage collectors? It was nice to see that the 
city of Mission Viejo, which now celebrates MLK Day, recognized that they were 
"making a statement, whether we (wanted) to or not, by not declaring it a 
holiday," according to council member Robert D. Breton. The cities of Garden 
Grove and Costa Mesa seem to be more concerned with their role as stewards of 
tax money rather than their role as leaders in civics and citizenship. (A 
Mission Viejo man) summed it up when he stated that Martin Luther King Jr.'s 
birthday is "still seen or perceived as a second-class or 'black' holiday, and 
that city and business leaders are missing his message." 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to recognize this day as a holiday just makes it ordinary. Certainly, 
Dr. King's message and life were anything but ordinary and deserve better 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 We celebrated Martin Luther King Day by going to the movies, where we were 
treated to the extraordinary story of Oskar Schindler, as told in "Schindler's 
List." This powerful drama described the horrors of the Jews during World War 
II and the heroic efforts of one man to save hundreds of Jews.  
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of the movie, Schindler is given a ring by the people he has 
saved. On it, inscribed in Hebrew, it says, "Whoever saves a life, saves the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 The depth of humanity displayed by Oskar Schindler and the love that Martin 
Luther King provided knitted the day together perfectly. The day was certainly 
one for remembering . For me in the classroom, or for anyone else, it's about 
remembering -- and remembering happens best when you make a special holiday to 
remember the contributions of one now departed. 
</P>

 * I was astonished to see that Yorba Linda does not observe Martin Luther King 
Day, a national holiday, but instead honors the birthday of Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 King was one of the giants of our time; Nixon is a pipsqueak who rose to power 
by slandering good people.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a good thing we all know there is no racism in Orange County. Otherwise, 
we might think color (would) be an explanation for the city's action.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON THE QUAKE; ORANGE COUNTY SHOULD HEED THE 
HARD LESSONS OF DEVASTATION; RESIDENTS MUST NOT IGNORE THE TRAGEDY TO THE 
NORTH. THE IMPACT WILL BE FELT THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND ADD TO THE WOES THAT 
FOLLOWED THE 1992 RIOTS AND NOVEMBER BRUSH FIRES.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Monday, Orange County residents woke up wondering if the nightmare they 
had long-feared had come true. 
</P>
<P>
 An earthquake shook our homes and, once again, rattled our sense of security 
about living in this region. But fears soon subsided as people learned the 
epicenter was elsewhere and the county was spared serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that we cannot afford to feel in the aftermath of this terrible 
tragedy is complacency. The San Fernando Valley and Orange County have much in 
common. Though the epicenter was in Northridge, there will be a local impact 
that we need to prepare for, and lessons to be learned for our future. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake is a serious blow to our weak regional economy. Recently, signs of 
increased housing and retail sales provided a glimmer of hope that residents 
would start spending and employers would start hiring again. Now, the recovery 
is on hold as cautious residents and businesses assess the damage and rethink 
the future.  
</P>
<P>
 The disabled freeways will disrupt our close economic ties with Los Angeles 
County. The many Orange County businesses with customers and suppliers in Los 
Angeles will find travel more difficult and costly now. And Orange County will 
also feel the impact of Los Angeles residents staying away from our theaters, 
malls, amusement parks and sports events. Restricted travel in the region will 
hurt everyone.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, the earthquake is yet another factor to give tourists thinking of 
vacationing here pause. 
</P>
<P>
 First there were the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Then there were the devastating 
brush fires last fall. Now the scenes of collapsed buildings and freeways will 
haunt us. The fact that the quake was in the Valley, and not in Orange County, 
is of little distinction to out-of-town visitors. We will now have to work even 
harder to attract tourists this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, adding to the list of crime, job layoffs, air pollution and traffic 
congestion, the earthquake presents another reason for residents and business 
to question their future here. The horror people felt Monday morning could 
hasten their moves to nearby states. And national attention to Southern 
California's earthquake problem will make it more difficult for the state to 
recruit new businesses and workers.  
</P>
<P>
 What can we do in the short run? Make sure that state and federal officials do 
all they can to get the roads fixed and Los Angeles moving again. Become 
involved in joint ventures to repair the image and solve the economic problems 
of the region. Do what we can to restore tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the long-term lessons Orange County must learn from the 
earthquake, and some things we can do to help mitigate the effects of a future 
earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * We need to make sure that our multitude of city and county governments and 
agencies knows how to coordinate before and after an emergency. The Valley was 
largely spared the problem of fragmented governmental response because most of 
it is under the jurisdiction of the City of Los Angeles. But in Orange County, 
as the bickering surrounding the El Toro Marine Base closing shows, the various 
entities might work against each other in a crisis. Let's get the political 
understandings in place beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 * We also need to avoid raised freeways and overpasses in future freeway 
planning, and make the reinforcement of existing freeways a high priority. 
Orange County could not afford to have the Santa Ana, San Diego or Costa Mesa 
freeways out of commission for a year.  
</P>
<P>
 * Other transportation modes must be developed in case our freeways fail. The 
BART System was critical to the economic survival of San Francisco after the 
Loma Prieta quake destroyed parts of the Bay Bridge. Similarly, Metrolink 
should help Los Angeles commuters cope. Orange County needs a backup system so 
that our economy won't stop if the freeways can't be used.  
</P>
<P>
 * Future developments should provide a good match between housing and jobs. 
Working close to home is a key to living in an environment where freeway travel 
may not always be possible. New housing near current work sites, and more 
workplaces near current housing, should be encouraged to ease our freeway 
dependence.  
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, we should make sure that our regional agencies don't allow "suburbs 
of suburbs" like the Antelope Valley, Santa Clarita and Moreno Valley to 
develop in the future. Residents have been trading long commutes for 
inexpensive housing at the urban fringe. But all of this depends on a freeway 
system that works. When routes are severed, as they have been north of Los 
Angeles, residents could find themselves with plunging housing values and no 
way to get to work.  
</P>
<P>
 While the Northridge earthquake was a tragedy, it could have been much worse. 
The quake struck in the early morning hours when few people were on the 
freeways or in the parking garages, shopping malls and office buildings that 
collapsed. But we need to face the fact that our great structures of steel and 
concrete are no match for Mother Nature. While there is nothing we can do to 
prevent earthquakes, we can do a better job of preparing for them in the 
future.

BUDGET SHORTFALL AND CONTINUING FISCAL PROBLEMS PLAGUING IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Foresight would have alienated some of Irvine's $4.5-million budget 
shortfall ("90's Fiscal Policy Calls for City Cuts," Jan. 14). Just last year 
the City Council executed rather poor judgment by removing a reasonable 
business head tax in their effort to appear business friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 They have ignored the downtrend in the real estate market. Now with dwindling 
development fees leaving a giant void in the coffers at City Hall, one has to 
wonder if this is a harbinger of things to come, a time when the city is built 
out and there are no more developer fees on which to rely. A time when the 
developers have taken their profit and moved on to greener pastures and the 
city, which has relied on the fees to bring a heavy cash infusion, now must 
continue to support the infrastructure all the development has brought. 
</P>
<P>
 What will happen when the residents no longer receive the services they were 
drawn to when they bought into the dream and purchased their homes in Irvine? 
Will Irvine fall into disrepair and approach bankruptcy as other cities have or 
will the residents find themselves digging deep into their pockets to pay 
increasingly higher taxes to support these services? 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt about it, the developer fees can be likened to a pyramid game; it's 
great when the door opens at the beginning, but watch out when the door closes. 
</P>
<P>
 MERYL SCHWARTZ 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * As a longtime Irvine business owner and homeowner, it's clear to me why 
Irvine is facing such a precarious fiscal crisis. The city, like all 
municipalities, needs to be less dispirited. It must engage in more substantive 
pro-business measures. 
</P>
<P>
 In December my full-service photo center successfully raised nearly $4,000 for 
the Irvine Animal Shelter through its assistance with "Santa Paws." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the wonderful people at the animal shelter, the city offered no 
accommodation or support to encourage further contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 That's all right because the pets we helped save and their owners sure were 
appreciative, as were we for proving that the private sector can help and make 
a difference. I hope our year-round contributions serve as a catalyst for other 
small businesses to also get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 There is more. With just three shopping days until Christmas we received a 
notice of violation for a banner that has been displayed for nearly 18 months 
(each evening we carefully took it down). 
</P>
<P>
 Nice timing. The sign was our single best marketing tool and we lost sales 
during our busiest season; the city also lost valuable sales tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with no banner displayed, we are told that $118 is the fee we must pay 
for the privilege of hanging an approved banner -- with only very specific text 
-- in front of the store, and then for no longer than 30 days per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Have you, like me, noticed banners flying in most shopping centers, real 
estate signs on street corners and huge billboards proclaiming sites for 
property developments? Something doesn't seem equitable. The sign ordinance is 
being changed, but it's too late and not business-friendly enough. We will need 
to work together to shape a more responsive city for its residents and 
businesses. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * There is no bigger hypocrite in Irvine than Mark P. Petracca. He 
relentlessly vilifies non-liberals, while praising liberals for putting on 
clean underwear. His recent letter in the Times ("Paradise Has Been Lost in 
Irvine," Jan 16) attacks the current city administration for balancing the 
exorbitant budget created by ex-mayor, Larry Agran. As our liberal mayor, Larry 
built City Mahal, a breathtaking limestone and granite monument to squandered 
public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is that Mark never criticized Larry's profound waste merely because 
Larry is Mark's liberal soul mate. How consummately dishonest.

PUBLIC SAFETY MUST BE TOP PRIORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I don't share in the elation surrounding the recent federal grant aiding 
Garden Grove's hiring of six new police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Why have we reached the point that our Police Department has to go to the 
federal government to motivate our city to protect its citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, most of us are ignorant enough to argue that federal money is free 
money. Relax! We're paying for that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not suggesting that we don't need six new officers. We need 15 or 20. As 
one who lives in one of the three areas being targeted by the new officers, I'm 
sorry; I don't feel safer. I won't be any more willing to allow my family to 
walk to the grocery store or the park. 
</P>
<P>
 To enact change, public safety must be the city's No. 1 priority. Watch next 
year's budget battle; the Police Department will again slide down the priority 
list. Particularly now that the City Council can argue that we just added six 
new officers. 
</P>
<P>
 If we don't change our priorities now, five years down the road, when the 
federal money runs out, we'll be without our six new officers, again. 
</P>
<P>
 (Police) Chief (Stanley L.) Knee has a vision of a better Garden Grove, but 
the police will never truly be able to accomplish the goals of "community 
policing" until the city changes its priority list.

IN DEFENSE OF A VIETNAMESE WRITER, CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing in response to the two articles, ("Hostile Fire in Little 
Saigon," and "Expatriates Vent Anger at Author, Movie Portrayals," Jan. 16). 
</P>
<P>
 It is very sad and unfortunate that the protesters of the works of Le Ly 
Hayslip should harbor so much ill-will for this remarkable woman who has 
suffered so much but has managed to rise above it all. It is obvious that these 
protesters do not see Hayslip for what she really is: for one thing, she is not 
a communist, of which many in the Vietnamese-American community accuse her. 
</P>
<P>
 The work that her organization, East Meets West, provides for the people of 
Vietnam is a humanitarian mission, one which transcends all political barriers. 
Her desire is to help the ordinary citizens of Vietnam, and those who oppose 
her work just don't get this. 
</P>
<P>
 If collaborating with the Vietnamese government makes her a communist, then 
the people in the government of the United States must also be communists for 
having normal relations with the People's Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the voices of both Northern and Southern Vietnam have been 
heard. With the emergence of Hayslip's autobiographies and Oliver Stone's 
movie, "Heaven and Earth," it is imperative that we listen, and listen hard, to 
the voice of someone who was caught between it all: North and South, East and 
West, Vietnam and America. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have read Hayslip's two autobiographies, and have read them with 
open hearts and minds, should applaud her for her extraordinary strength, 
endurance, compassion, and vision. As for the movie, much can be said for the 
American public if "Heaven and Earth" became as popular as the first two movies 
of Stone's trilogy on Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 HUE LIEU HUYNH 
</P>
<P>
 Midway City 
</P>
<P>
 * Instead of being criticized for her political views, Le Ly Hayslip should be 
praised for her accomplishments as a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, she has an incredible will to survive. She was brutally tortured 
by the South Vietnamese, raped by the Viet Cong, abused by her American 
husband. She had to turn to prostitution and street peddling of goods in order 
to feed herself and her illegitimate son. Yet, in spite of these horrid 
experiences, and living in a schizophrenic Catch 22 situation where the 
Americans and South Vietnamese ruled by day and the Viet Cong ruled by night, 
she didn't give up, and not only survived but flourished. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, despite growing up as an illiterate country girl, she taught herself 
and wrote two books about her life experiences, which were made into the movie 
"Heaven and Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirdly, she is a humanitarian and a visionary, transcending beyond the 
triviality of politics. While many Vietnamese and Americans are still reliving 
the Vietnamese War, Le Ly has put it behind her, and is looking into the 
future. She is helping to build medical clinics to help the rural Vietnamese. 
She wants to feed the starving Vietnamese people. She wants normalization of 
relations with Vietnam to help improve its depressed economy, which will help 
the plight of all Vietnamese people, including those living in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Though her fellow Vietnamese protested her appearance in Orange County, 
criticizing her lifestyle and her seemingly pro-communist stance, I would be 
ecstatic about meeting her, as I think she is an incredible human being, one 
who faced unbeatable odds and won. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnam War was not just a battleground between deeply divergent political 
philosophies. It was also a battleground between human beings, where untold 
suffering took place on both sides. When we finally realize that people are 
human beings and not just political creatures, we will finally learn to live in 
peace and harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese people have suffered enough. It's time for their suffering to 
end and for the rebuilding of their lives to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN

</P>
<P>
 * On Sunday, Jan. 9, a small group of Vietnamese gathered to protest Le Ly 
Hayslip and Oliver Stone's movie "Heaven and Earth." I was in a shop in the 
same shopping center and was informed by the shopkeeper that he was told that 
"a communist is meeting the press upstairs." 
</P>
<P>
 This shopkeeper represents thousands of Vietnamese who are part of the 
population who can barely read and understand English to find out for 
themselves what is really happening in the world; who are being brainwashed by 
dozens of daily and weekly papers, financed by advertisers and distributed free 
of charge, and by a few Vietnamese local TV and radio stations, which include 
their personal bias, editorial comments while their so-called "newscasters" are 
reading the news. 
</P>
<P>
 I am writing to express my feeling and to point out that there are many of us 
who are educated, well-read, who have kept up with the current events and 
fortunately are able to think and judge for ourselves to feel that things are 
changing. We all must be open-minded, as well as to stop the hatred, to allow 
progress and betterment to happen to our people and our country, Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in Vietnam cannot happen overnight. Look at what happened to the 
Soviet Union. Chaos, uproar and more chaos. Vietnam must change gradually. If 
we want the current communist government to disappear, then by what way? The 
protest group is doing the protest purely for the sake of waving the old flag, 
walking around the streets, yelling ineffective words. And what for? The U.S. 
government will lift the embargo whenever it sees that it is convenient and the 
time is right, not because they will listen to a tiny group of Vietnamese they 
have not paid attention to. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that the extreme anti-communists are just a small group of 
people. But it is a popular view right now. Anyone with a different view, 
although there might be more people who hold this view, dare not voice their 
opinion because they are scared of protest, of being harassed or sometimes a 
death threat. 
</P>
<P>
 We already saw the sad but true reality that a few people who voiced their 
opposite view were immediately labeled "communist," or "pro-communists." People 
such as Dr. Co Pham, Westminster City Councilman Tony Lam, Frank Chao, to name 
a few. 
</P>
<P>
 I admire Dr. Pham for being courageous to stand up and speak out his view. 
Later, he was forced to stay silent and mind his own business. His offices, 
however, are still filled with patients. A proof that a lot of people are not 
extremists and the whole Vietnamese community does not ardently believe that he 
is a communist. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too late to spread the red scare because communism is no longer a 
powerful force. The same people who protest against communism are acting the 
same way the communists do, trying to stop others from speaking freely. People 
should not be labeled "communist" because they think the embargo should be 
lifted. I think Le Ly Hayslip should not be treated the way she was treated. 
She was a victim of a war-torn country, no more, no less. It is time for all of 
us to forget the past. The wind of change is coming and we all should adapt our 
actions and our thoughts accordingly.

 She interviewed some of the members of our Samson Strong Men (men over 70) at 
the Racquet World Gym in Canoga Park on Jan. 5. A photographer took several

COYOTE 'GAG ORDER' HAS MUZZLED ANIMAL OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your story "Officers Quit Taking Coyote Calls" (Jan. 12), painted a 
less-than-accurate picture of the coyote "gag order" placed on West Valley 
animal control officers.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the headline is misleading because it implies that the officers are 
happily passing on coyote calls when precisely the opposite is true.Contrary to 
statements by Nancy Moriarity, the animal regulation spokeswoman, the order was 
just that: an order, not a suggestion,  
</P>
<P>
 Two points must be made. First, the order has precluded animal control 
officers from responding to what they themselves consider emergency calls. 
Second, if in fact the Department of Animal Regulation being "engulfed with 
coyote calls," then clearly the coyote problem is far worse than the Department 
of Animal Regulation is willing to admit.

HANDRAILS BADLY NEEDED IN RENOVATED THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We recently went to an open house to see the renovated Alex Theatre in 
Glendale and to check out our season ticket seat locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The design changes and overall decorating are excellent, but there is a major 
flaw. The stairs in the Terrace Section do not have any handrails. These steep 
stairs are reminiscent of those in the upper deck of Dodger Stadium, behind 
home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 How the city of Glendale (which owns the theater) and its building department 
allow this safety hazard to exist is very puzzling. Even if it meets the code, 
common sense dictates that handrails down the middle of the stairs be installed 
immediately, before a tragic accident occurs.

MCA IS SELFISHLY IGNORING THE AREA'S TRANSIT NEEDS

<P>
 * Please stop the late bid to relocate the Metro Red Line station from the 
previously accepted location on Lankershim Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 A site half a mile east in Cahuenga Pass, with all its inherent traffic 
congestion and access problems as well as air quality problems with the arrival 
of 26 buses an hour, is not a sound plan.It would be great for MCA-Universal, 
and the worst thing for the community it is intended to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 I am dismayed by the campaign of misinformation and distortion being waged by 
MCA-Universal with no regard to the transportation needs and convenience of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 How can MCA, in good conscience, propose to delay completion of construction 
by nearly three years and threaten to withhold assessment funds in this very 
public display of its corporate willingness to put itself first?

INFORMED VOTERS WILL REJECT 'INSIDER' CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * With respect to Bill Spillane's endorsement of Newbury Park businessman 
Robert Hammer for California's 24th Congressional District seat (Political 
Briefing, Jan. 7), I can only say that this further illustrates the shifting 
tides of our day. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking as a mother, a homeowner and 21-year resident of Van Nuys, I have 
concluded that today's informed voter will reject hand-picked insiders come 
June 7 in favor of candidates who: 
</P>
<P>
 * Have suffered the problems of this district as we have, specifically crime 
and economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aren't afraid to stand up to Washington and Sacramento bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 * Are accountable to the people from Day 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Hammer is a respected leader in this community, a private citizen with 
zero political baggage and indebtedness (a gem for this reason alone). 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Spillane recognizes these facts. We should all follow his bold lead.

SIERRA CLUB OPPOSES BADLY PLANNED PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In her attack on the Sierra Club (Letters, Jan. 2), Soka supporter Alexis 
Byfuglin claims that the Sierra Club "did not stand up to, and even praised" 
previous big developments such as Baldwin, Micor and Ahmanson Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 She is wrong on all three counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club came out in opposition to the Baldwin development when it was 
first proposed in 1987. That opposition helped reduce the development from 
1,507 homes, 1.5 million square feet of commercial space and a very costly 
highway to 550 homes, 200,000 commercial square feet, no road and a 640-acre 
park donation. The Sierra Club did not support even this scaled down project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club opposed Micor in 1992 and helped fund the lawsuit that 
overturned the approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club opposed the Ahmanson Ranch development in December, 1992, and, 
as was reported recently in The Times, has submitted a brief in the pending 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club does not oppose all developments. We do oppose those that 
exceed prevailing land-use plans and violate good environmental planning. All 
of the above proposals were guilty on both counts, as is Soka's proposal for a 
major urban facility (almost twice the floor space of Topanga Plaza!) in the 
heart of a particularly scenic, unspoiled area of the Santa Monica Mountains.

SUNSHINE CANYON DUMP NEEDS TO BE STOPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Don P. Mullally's Jan. 9 commentary on the Sunshine Canyon Landfill is 
filled with inaccuracies, misrepresentations and omissions. For instance, the 
expansion Mr. Mullally speaks of is, in reality, a new landfill. The old 
landfill closed in 1991. The new one will not be contiguous to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The wilderness Mr. Mullally says will be lost is a forest of over 20,000 trees 
(8,000 of which are oak) and 11 acres of wetlands. His claim that this area is 
already degraded is wrong. It is intact except for the sections Browning Ferris 
Industries, the landfill's owner and operator, saw fit to violate. Mr. Mullally 
would be able to see this for himself, except that the land is privately owned. 
Visitors are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunshine Canyon Landfill will uproot thousands of animals and stop animal 
migration between the San Gabriel Mountains and the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunshine Canyon will be operated by BFI. It has one of the worst violation 
records in the United States. What makes Mr. Mullally think they will adhere to 
the mitigations agreed upon? To date, the violations in the closed dump are 
still outstanding, and the agreed-upon mitigations remain on the printed page. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunshine Canyon will contaminate ground water and probably the nearby 
reservoir that holds the drinking water for 3.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 For these and other reasons, this landfill is opposed by the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the Sierra Club, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, 
Citizens for a Better Environment, Defenders of Wildlife, Friends of the Park, 
Heal the Bay, LASER, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental 
Defense Fund, the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment, the 
Los Angeles City Council, the North Valley Coalition and other associations and 
environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other associations battling BFI landfills across 11 other states, the 
North Valley Coalition will continue to fight Sunshine Canyon Landfill.

A GAP IN CHILD SAFETY; PROTECTIVE 'CORRIDOR' PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE VALLEY 
STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley parents who have been able to look beyond the conditions 
of their homes and places of work are probably thinking of only one aspect of 
education right now. Parents undoubtedly are most concerned about the 
conditions of their children's schools after the Northridge quake and when they 
might reopen. More than two-thirds of the school buildings that sustained 
significant damage in the quake were located in the Valley, and they have been 
closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming weeks, however, when some semblance of normalcy and routine 
returns to the lives of Valley parents and their school-age children, parents 
will learn that they have been denied a chance of participating in a pilot 
program that seemed to be tailor-made for their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, high-ranking police officials, educators and politicians have announced 
the creation of so-called "safe passage corridors" in which police, community 
leaders and school officials identify and patrol school travel routes to help 
keep children safe. But the pilot plan for the Safe Corridors program will be 
launched at Dorsey High School in the LAPD's southwest division and at Lennox 
Middle School. We do not suggest that the choices of Dorsey and Lennox were 
improper. We do strongly suggest that the addition of a third school -- in the 
San Fernando Valley -- would have been most appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest anyone forget, there is still a serial child molester on the loose in the 
Valley. His distinct method of operation has included attacks on school-bound 
children only during the hours before school. 
</P>
<P>
 This case was once considered serious enough to warrant the assignment of 150 
officers, including several transferred from narcotics and auto theft 
assignments. Surely it warrants the Valley's inclusion in any "safe passage 
corridors" pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
 This is particularly true now because the Valley suffered the brunt of the 
damage and disruption from the quake. Commute times for working Valley parents 
will be much longer for months and perhaps years to come. That and other 
quake-related disruptions only lessen the chances that parents will be able to 
safely see their children off to school, or get home in time to meet their 
children on the way back from classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news here is that police in the West Valley are pushing a program 
that has equal merit: so-called safe houses that are clearly marked as havens 
for schoolchildren who find themselves in sudden danger. It is an excellent 
idea that ought to be expanded to every school in the region, and not just to 
those in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe houses are modeled after an admirable program at Erwin Street Elementary 
School in Van Nuys. It was established by police and by parents in November, 
1992. In it, trusted adults who have cleared a police criminal records check 
and who have two recommendations (preferably from neighbors) have a large, 
green triangle on a window of their homes and another on the curb of the street 
out in front. Those adults have agreed to remain at home from 7 to 9 a.m. and 
from 2 to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 That will be even more important now, with so many schools damaged by the 
quake and with the heightened possibility of widespread transfers and a return 
to year-round classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the Valley out of the Safe Corridors pilot program was a great and 
insensitive mistake, one that should be corrected soon.

FROM FIREFIGHTERS TO BUSINESSES, REGION PULLS TOGETHER IN CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many deserve sincere thanks for their actions following the Northridge 
earthquake. We include in their number anyone who offered a show of kindness or 
consideration to someone outside of their normal circle of family and friends. 
Some were dramatically heroic. Others simply offered brief respites from the 
great hardships of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them were the firefighters who braved severe aftershocks to rescue a 
critically injured maintenance worker who had been trapped under 20 tons of 
concrete at the Northridge Fashion Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Other firefighters from Orange County were involved in some of the most 
desperate efforts at the Northridge Meadows Apartments, where several people 
died. The toll there might have been much higher, were it not for the 
courageous work of three residents. Emergency medical technician Eric Pearson, 
for example, escaped from his apartment and threw fire hoses to people who 
could not make their way from the top of the wrecked building. The hoses helped 
them climb to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents Alan and Buffy Jo Fitch also escaped, making their way to the third 
floor of the building where they tied the fire hoses around the waists of 
several residents and lowered them to the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Another rescue effort at a home in Sherman Oaks failed, but that was not due 
to any lack of effort or will. A dozen or so neighbors frantically tried to 
reach the couple who owned a home that had collapsed in the earthquake. They 
dug at the wreckage in their bare feet with their bare hands, without regard to 
their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
 On Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills, neighbors began an impromptu bucket 
brigade to douse flames that threatened apartments and homes. The effort was 
not very effective, but the neighbors mastered fear and confusion and dutifully 
tried to help. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Meadows Apartments rescue effort was also notable in another 
respect. It was part of a gratifyingly swift response from local, state and 
federal officials. Among them were Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams, 
who had declared a police emergency within 31 minutes of the quake; Mayor 
Richard Riordan, who had declared a local emergency slightly more than a 
half-hour later, and officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
who quickly dispatched special medical units and 400 urban search-and-rescue 
team members from places as distant as Fairfax, Va., and King County in 
Washington. A local group of search-and-rescue team members were at the 
Northridge Meadow Apartments with enough supplies to support 72 hours of 
all-out exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks are also in order for the officials who set up the countywide emergency 
response system established after the disastrous 1971 Sylmar earthquake. That 
network helped hospitals swiftly coordinate transfers of patients to other 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same vein, appreciation ought to be extended to the staff at the UCI 
Medical Center in Orange, who rushed to the aid of Granada Hills Community 
Hospital after it was overwhelmed with earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 When infants had to be evacuated from the damaged neonatal ward at the 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center, combat helicopters from El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station were there to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployed medical workers like Charles Miseroy rushed to Holy Cross Hospital 
in Mission Hills to bandage wounds and just to help out as the hospital 
evacuated patients. "I'm certified," said Miseroy. "Why stand around and pick 
my nose?" 
</P>
<P>
 And it might not have seemed like much, but the simple courteousness of those 
who had to drive in the San Fernando Valley this past week gained national 
attention and helped out an overworked police force. Those drivers smoothly 
negotiated major intersections without a working traffic light or police 
officer in sight. That left the police free for far more important duties. 
</P>
<P>
 And we can't forget the management of the Target store in Santa Clarita. They 
handed out flashlights, batteries, propane and bottled water for free and 
worked throughout the long hours without electricity, interior walls, or 
ceiling tiles. "We had one lady who needed formula and a diaper," said Target 
employee Jane Delfavero. "Someone crawled back there and got it for her." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lucky's supermarket chain donated food, emergency supplies and bottled 
water to Red Cross and Salvation Army relief centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other merchants took a chance on customers by taking scores of personal checks 
when automated teller machines would not function. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there was the In and Out Burger restaurant in Northridge, which 
simply stayed open during the crisis. "You can't get to our refrigerator. This 
is like a public service," one customer told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's even more remarkable that folks who had endured the strongest 
quake in modern L.A. history could get excited by a hamburger, shake and a side 
order of fries.

DON'T KNOCK SELF-DEFENSE FOR KIDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your reporters missed the point in "Vendors Selling Safety to Valley 
Parents" (Jan. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't about fear. Parents and children who take my street self-defense 
classes do so for the same reason they take earthquake preparedness, CPR 
classes, or wear seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 Your reporters and the public officials they interviewed obviously don't trust 
themselves to be able to remain calm and react effectively if attacked by a 
large armed attacker, so they cannot imagine a child could do it. Fortunately, 
I do trust myself, and so do the children and adults I train.

 In our society, children and women are preyed upon. They need education. They 
need to use common sense. They need to stay out of dangerous situations if 
possible. But they also need options if they find themselves in situations they 
cannot avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 That is all self-defense programs do -- give anyone an option. Since my child 
has had this class, I will not stop educating him, leave him alone or, if I can 
prevent it, allow him to be in a dangerous situation. But if he finds himself 
in a place where he has to assert control, I want him to know that he can. 
Being a victim does not have to be the only option. He can use his knowledge to 
take control of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 My self-defense classes have not made me overconfident or foolish, only 
smarter and more confident. I believe the same will happen with my child.

BUILDING ORDINANCES DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH; IN A STATE WHERE THE EXPERTS PREDICT 
MAJOR EARTHQUAKES WILL CONTINUE, ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES MUST ENACT LEGISLATION 
THAT SAFEGUARDS THE LIVES AND WELFARE OF RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL BERNSON, Hal Bernson represents the 12th District on the Los Angeles 
City Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monday's earthquake is a tragic reminder that government must do more to 
protect the lives of its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, when I was chairman of the Building and Safety Committee, the Los 
Angeles City Council passed legislation I introduced to retrofit the 
unreinforced brick and masonry buildings in Los Angeles. This legislation 
required that more than 8,000 pre-1933 buildings be retrofitted in order to 
prevent collapse in case of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, the collapse of such buildings had 
demonstrated the necessity of making reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
 The passage of this legislation was unique and was the result of a study that 
predicted the deaths of 50,000 people and more than 100,000 injuries due to the 
collapse of these unreinforced buildings if a major earthquake occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last year, work on all but about 100 of these buildings had been 
completed. The latter were either unoccupied or were due to be demolished. 
Based on our knowledge, if these buildings had not been reinforced, most 
probably would have collapsed in Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As far as it is currently known, all of these buildings withstood the Monday 
quake -- in all probability saving thousands of lives. 
</P>
<P>
 There was tremendous opposition to the enhancement of this law by building 
owners in 1981. It took a great deal of persuasion on my part, but the City 
Council eventually proceeded with the implementation of the ordinance. It was a 
step forward to protect our citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 But was that enough?  
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, I introduced a motion asking Building and Safety to develop an 
ordinance adding a new element to the ordinance on unreinforced brick and 
masonry buildings. This legislation would have applied to tilt-up and 
"non-ductible" concrete construction. Both types of solid-wall construction 
have been shown to be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this has not been developed by the Building and Safety 
Department. Although these buildings were not particularly affected by Monday's 
earthquake, it demonstrates our need to act immediately to prioritize and 
institute changes in our current code. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tragic collapse of the Northridge apartment in Monday's earthquake, a 
new category of dangerous buildings has emerged -- those multifamily residences 
with nothing more to support them but carports. They have proved to be one of 
the most dangerous type of buildings we have. 
</P>
<P>
 All the above categories will require retrofitting. These are the same type of 
buildings that also collapsed in the Mexico City quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the state has not yet enacted legislation, even though the 
State Seismic Commission (of which I am a member) has repeatedly asked that the 
Unified Building Code include these types of regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We live in a state where the experts tell us major earthquakes will continue 
to occur. It is the responsibility of elected representatives to enact 
legislation that will protect the lives and welfare of its residents. I hope 
that the state Legislature will take notice of Monday's tragic events and pass 
legislation to enact laws immediately to protect our citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 When safety requirements are proposed, there is always an outcry that it may 
cost too much. Lawmakers must decide what degree of risk is acceptable. The 
present degree of risk is not acceptable to me.

DIFFERENT REACTIONS TO AN EXPERIENCE SHARED BY MANY; THE EARTHQUAKE TERRIFIED

 Evelyn Moriarty, 67, was shaken for a moment. Her lively fluff-ball Marco 
Polo, a 10-month-old Shih Tzu, had catapulted off the bed. Marco yelped, cocked 
his head, perked up his ears and wanted to play. Evelyn was immediately at 
ease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I was awakened a bit earlier than usual, but I figured Marco had to go 
for a walk," she said. So at 4:45 a.m., about 15 minutes after one of Los 
Angeles' biggest earthquakes, Moriarty strolled out of her North Hollywood 
apartment and acted as if nothing had happened. If Marco didn't care, she 
didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 She carried Marco over piles of glass in the lobby and through a shattered 
doorway and used a flashlight to identify her neighbors. Her carefree calm 
seemed to be infectious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fine," Evelyn said. "It was just a hassle later to find bottled water 
for Marco. I mean, I drink tap water, I don't care, but not my dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe her morning wasn't quite ordinary. After their walk, she sat down to a 
pre-dawn breakfast, pouring cereal and milk into a bowl. The Grape Nuts tasted 
odd. She squinted at the box. She was eating Marco's Eukanuba out of his 
heart-shaped dish. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As soon as I heard the epicenter was in the San Fernando Valley, where I lived 
for five years, my thoughts went to the many people I knew there. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, an earthquake is a great example of a shared experience. It 
happens to all of us at the same time. But experiences are never the same for 
different people, and as I collected the stories of my friends, I found I was 
always surprised at how each one reacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-core curmudgeons were shaken to the core. One woman saved a house from 
burning. One friend is ready to move out of California. And the ones I thought 
would be shaken up the most -- like Evelyn Moriarty -- shrugged it off as one 
of those things that happens now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Carl in Studio City remembers screaming "Nooooo!" during the shaking. He 
was trapped upstairs by a bookshelf that crashed halfway down the stairwell, 
and he found himself scaling the banister and avoiding glass shards. Days 
later, his things are stacked around his apartment and he still doesn't feel 
safe sleeping there. 
</P>
<P>

 Caryn Forrest, who lives in the trendy Encino Oaks complex off the Ventura 
Freeway, admitted she always teased her neighbor, attorney Randy Spencer, for 
having an "earthquake cabinet" of food and water. But as she crawled through 
debris in the dark, it was Randy she called to, and he rescued her and gave her 
a flashlight and radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Greg Cummins helped evacuate the building and check for damage. Caryn 
took an hour to come down because she had to tidy up. "You never know who's 
going to come into your apartment during a disaster like this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg and Caryn went in search of breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we drove down Ventura Boulevard we saw people lining up at pay phones in 
their pajamas helping each other, and there was glass all over and we saw whole 
storefronts had fallen into the street," said Caryn, who teaches at Sylmar 
Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guessed then that I probably wouldn't be going to work for a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 My friend closest to the epicenter is insurance representative Dan Niswander, 
35, who lives in Van Nuys on the fault line. Dan isn't a world-class 
housekeeper, so it was hard to tell what happened. But he wants to move, and he 
said: "I'm now aware that by living here you have to know how you're going to 
react at a moment's notice wherever you are. I'll never be unprepared again." 
</P>
<P>
 He's definitely not prepared to go back to work on the 19th floor of his Van 
Nuys office building. "I'm thankful I'm alive, I'm thankful that I've met some 
of my neighbors for the first time ever, but I'm scared," he said. "I think 
I've felt about 750 of the 800 aftershocks." 
</P>
<P>
 I knew Barbara Palermo in Woodland Hills would be worried about her three 
cats. During the quake, she clung to her husband, Phil, as the bedroom window 
blew out, the chimney crashed through their roof and plaster showered them. 
Then she checked on her cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Chester, huge and orange, lost his cool and seemed jittery all day. He 
kept sitting under a hole in the roof near the fireplace, and Barbara kept 
moving him. The other two hid. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Barbara and Phil picked through the rubble trying to remember what each piece 
used to be. Heirlooms were ground glass. Every plate was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 But a tiny bone China bowl given to them by Phil's mother three decades ago 
sailed off a cupboard's top shelf and remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, Barbara and Phil had a candlelight dinner with neighbors: canned 
pork and beans cooked on a camping stove.

evacuate her family out of Iran when the Shah was overthrown, but she was left 
shaken by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a terrible headache that just won't quit," Hayslett said. "I feel 
woozy all the time like the house is crooked." 
</P>
<P>
 A grandfather clock was destroyed, treasured sculpture became rubble, 
televisions and mirrors were swept into the trash. But a new wide-screen TV was 
saved by her disobedient 17-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tell Chapen to pick up his clothes after they're folded up, but he 
left them out that night in front of the new TV, and it landed face down right 
on the pile of clothes," Jerrianne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter Carrieanne saw smoke a few blocks away and went to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 She saw a mother and daughter crying hysterically as their house was swallowed 
by flames. Embers larger than her hand were flying toward the house next door, 
and the grass was very dry. A palm tree caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrieanne and a man she had never met cut off gas to neighboring houses and 
used garden hoses to put out fires spread by the winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Once her hair caught fire from an ember, and she was almost overcome by smoke. 
Firefighters soon arrived, and she was soaked by their spray. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the house she saved found her and said, "This is my house. I 
thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do anything unusual," Carrieanne said. "A few guys risked their 
lives for this total stranger by pushing a truck away from the fire so it 
wouldn't explode. People were helping out the homeowners, and others brought 
coffee and blankets to us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, acts of heroism and mutual aid were a dime a dozen. The people in 
the Valley, ultimate suburbia, came together in remarkable ways during this 
universal disaster and showed that people really do care about each other.

VALLEY'S ECONOMY CAN REBOUND FROM QUAKE; GOVERNMENT, INSURANCE MONEY FOR 
RECOVERY WILL HAVE A MULTIPLIER EFFECT BY GENERATING JOBS, NEED FOR HOUSING. 
BUT RESIDENTS, LEADERS MUST REMAIN UNITED IN DETERMINING AREA'S DESTINY.

By MICHAEL THARP, Michael Tharp, a land-use planning and zoning consultant, is 
chairman of the Revitalize the Valley Subcommittee of the Valley Industry and 
Commerce Assn. and represents the organization on the San Fernando Valley Unity 
Coalition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The dishes in the sink clink and rattle with less frequency. The crack in the 
sewer line under the house has a temporary fix. My bumps and bruises ache a 
little less, and I have had time to reflect on how lucky I was to come through 
the quake virtually unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 So now, like so many others in the L.A. Basin, my thoughts turn to the future. 
Many now ask, is Mother Nature really telling me it is time to throw in the 
towel and head for less volatile and maybe even greener pastures? 
</P>
<P>
 I am a native Angeleno. I grew up in Sun Valley and spent most of my adult 
life in the San Fernando Valley. My business depends largely on the economic 
robustness of that Valley, and I have no intention of going elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not based on foolish loyalty to geographic ties or desire to be near 
old friends. I am fully cognizant of the need for the economic well-being of 
the Valley if I am to continue in my chosen profession, pay my bills and keep a 
roof over my head. While I have strong ties to the Valley, emotional and 
economic, those links do not outweigh my need to provide for my family and 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, I have taken a hard look at what the future holds for me 
and my fellow Angelenos in the months and years after the Northridge quake. I 
believe its economic impact will have three phases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the first phase, the Valley's economy will suffer greatly. Stores and 
businesses will be closed as proprietors repair damage and wait for supplies. 
People will not be working while looking for basic shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be congestion and disruption due to freeway closures. Funds will be 
drained replacing damaged or lost merchandise. Productivity will be lost as 
people struggle to put their personal and professional lives back in order. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase will begin soon after the first, perhaps as early as this 
week. It will consist of rebuilding the infrastructure that was destroyed as 
well as a restoration and revitalization of the Valley's economic 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal aid will begin to be available, and insurance companies will begin 
compensating for losses. Money will be available to restock and rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley is far too important to the regional economy of 
Southern California be allowed to founder. The Golden State Freeway has been 
referred to in local broadcasts as the state's "umbilical cord." It is also the 
gateway to Los Angeles from the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Freeway and Interstate 5 will be rebuilt as quickly as 
humanly possible, reconnecting the Valley to Santa Clarita, Newhall, Palmdale, 
Valencia and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup and repair efforts will create short-term construction work, as well 
as a boom for suppliers of needed materials. People will replace what was lost 
in the quake, although possibly not as quickly, depending on the availability 
of earthquake insurance and federal disaster relief. Those dollars that are 
available will have a multiplier effect on the local economy, generating new 
jobs in service industries as well as creating the need for housing and real 
estate development. 
</P>
<P>
 The third phase of the Valley's economic recovery is linked to the desire of 
those who live and work in the Valley and their elected leaders -- state, local 
and federal -- to continue taking the necessary steps to improve their economic 
well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 After the short-term infusion of federal relief funds and insurance 
reimbursements, the success of the Valley's economic recovery will depend on 
the continuation of its ability to determine its own destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent to the 1992 civil disturbances, groups such as the Valley Industry 
and Commerce Assn.'s Revitalize the San Fernando Valley Subcommittee and the 
San Fernando Valley Unity Coalition realized no one was going to help the 
Valley unless the Valley helped itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state representatives must seek whatever relief funds are 
available. Residents and businesses can make sure local elected officials 
continue the procedures already begun to streamline the permitting process and 
make government more user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they can revert to the divisiveness, "NIMBYism" and provincial 
self-interest protectionism that lead to the economic downturn from which we 
just started to recover.

NIXON CENTER EXPECTED TO BE THINK TANK WITH CLOUT; INSTITUTIONS: YORBA 
LINDA-BASED ORGANIZATION WILL LIKELY BE A PLAYER ON THE GLOBAL POLICY SCENE, 
EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Toward the end of a lengthy ceremony last week announcing that a public policy 
center would be established at his presidential library here, former President 
Richard Nixon made a small confession. 
</P>
<P>
 "As many of you know," Nixon said, "I'm not much of a fan of think tanks." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his misgivings, Nixon said he had been assured by those planning the 
$25-million Center for Peace and Freedom that his think tank would be 
fundamentally different from the nation's estimated 1,000 to 1,200 other public 
policy centers, more than 100 of which are based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 With few details on the Nixon center available, where it will fit in the wide 
range of U.S. think tanks is a matter of some speculation among leaders of 
those institutions and the small group of scholars who study the organizations' 
growing influence on U.S. policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
 "How effective the (Nixon) institution will be depends on a combination of its 
financial and human resources," said Jess Cook, spokesman for the RAND Corp. in 
Santa Monica. "It will boil down to who does the thinking in the tank." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, scholars at other policy centers, as well as experts on think tanks, 
said various factors point to the development of a serious, substantive policy 
center with potential to be a player in decision-making in Washington and other 
world capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's main attributes include former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger's involvement on the board of directors, plans for a Washington 
affiliate and the recently announced $5-million grant from the Annenberg 
Foundation, named for former Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, their natural advantage is Richard Nixon," said Donald Schewe, 
director of the Jimmy Carter presidential library in Atlanta. "He has great 
access to a number of world leaders, as well as to people in his own 
Administration and those that followed. When a former President calls, people 
tend to pick up the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many of those interviewed pointed to the Carter Center, an 
action-oriented think tank affiliated with his presidential library based at 
Atlanta's Emory University, as providing perhaps the best model for what Nixon 
center planners may have in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 James A. Smith, considered a leading expert on think tanks, said the Carter 
Center had created a new activist mold for presidential libraries, which 
historically have served mainly as repositories for presidential papers and 
research homes for scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary information on the Nixon center would seem to place it on a 
similar track, according to Smith, whose 1991 book, "The Idea Brokers," is 
considered the most definitive study on think tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon library officials and others associated with the new center have 
stressed that Nixon's center will be innovative, activist and so different from 
any existing think tank that there is no model for it. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also have released few details that might explain how it will work, 
emphasizing that the planning remains in an "embryonic" stage, as library 
director John Taylor said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 What is known is that Kissinger will serve as a member of the center's board 
and also has agreed to play a substantive, but still undefined, leadership role 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight endowed chairs will be established, with six focusing on foreign policy 
and two on domestic affairs. An affiliated institution, the Richard Nixon 
Foreign Policy Institute, will be established in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger, who spoke to reporters after Thursday's ceremony, said the Nixon 
center will be different from existing think tanks because it will emphasize 
"middle-term problems," not short- or long-term policy questions. 
</P>
<P>
 He said examples of such issues include the changing relationships in Eastern 
Europe, South Africa and the Middle East, and the increasingly significant 
roles of China and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But announcements about such fundamentals as who will chair the center's 
board, serve as its president and fill its endowed chairs are yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Carter's center, Nixon's is expected to reflect his specific policy 
interests. Where the Carter Center is deeply -- often directly -- involved in 
conflict resolution, election monitoring and human rights at home and abroad, 
Nixon's is viewed as likely to emphasize foreign rather than domestic affairs, 
with a focus on relations between the United States and the other Pacific 
powers, Russia, China and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they're planning to capitalize on his foreign policy expertise," 
said Schewe, the Carter library director. "Virtually everyone agrees that the 
man had a great foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Carter's "way of being activist is to grab a hammer himself," as his 
library's director put it, Nixon probably will not be directly involved in 
running his policy center or determining specific areas of study, said Dimitri 
Simes, who is expected to play a leading role at the new think tank. Simes is 
currently a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and 
a frequent adviser to Nixon on Russian policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be a guiding presence, a friend," Simes said. "The center will be 
built around his philosophy of enlightened national interest, but not around 
him as a person." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, think tanks operate on the margins of the American political 
process to provide expertise to policy-makers, Smith said. There are several 
types: 
</P>
<P>
 * Institutions that emphasize serious, scholarly, social science research and 
tend to have endowments and a permanent senior research staff, like the 
Brookings Institution in Washington, the oldest think tank in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contract research institutions, like the Urban Institute in Washington and 
the RAND Corp., which produce reports often for government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * University-based research organizations, like Harvard's Kennedy School of 
Government and the research centers it houses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Institutions, often called advocacy tanks, that can be more partisan and 
ideological and more intimately engaged in the policy process. An example would 
be the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 While other presidents have public policy centers or schools named for them -- 
including the Kennedy School, Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and 
International Affairs, and Stanford's Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and 
Peace -- most are not directly affiliated with their libraries, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who served on the 
board of the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley for five years, said Nixon 
library officials had been shrewd in recognizing the potential for a powerful, 
activist presidential policy center on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reagan library was originally intended to fill that role before a decision 
was made to back away from plans for a policy center, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said the Reagan library, originally intended to be housed at the 
Hoover Institution on the Stanford University campus, also was initially 
planned to include a major public policy center. But after Stanford rejected 
its overtures and a series of other problems, the library abandoned plans for 
the think tank, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who served as an adviser to both Nixon and Ronald Reagan, said he 
expects presidential think tanks to become an increasingly important part of 
the public policy debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened is that as the number of presidential libraries grows and 
the number of living ex-presidents grows, these centers will exert increasing 
influence," Anderson said, adding that Carter has used his more effectively 
than any former President to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other interesting thing is that after these people leave office, they 
tend to become quite bipartisan," Anderson said, noting Reagan's participation 
in the dedication of the Carter center and Ford's appearances over the years at 
ceremonies and conferences at both the Carter center and the Nixon library.

RAPE STOLE VICTIM'S WILL TO LIVE, PROSECUTORS SAY; O.C. COURTS: MURDER CHARGE 
AGAINST MAN IN DEATH OF WOMAN, 79, IS UNPRECEDENTED. CRITICS SAY IT'S RACIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Ward was 79, active in her church and helped manage a Stanton apartment 
complex. Her independence was abruptly shattered by an intruder who raped her 
at knifepoint as her cries were recorded on a 911 line. 
</P>
<P>
 When she died a month after the May, 1992, attack, a coroner's investigator 
determined the cause of death was congenital heart failure and pneumonia, and 
an autopsy showed a ravenous form of lung cancer had taken hold in Ward's body. 
No one alleged that physical injuries from the rape caused her death. 
</P>
<P>
 But in one of the most novel prosecution theories ever put to the test in 
Orange County and perhaps the state, the district attorney's office hopes to 
prove that Jose Alonso Garcia, 20, murdered Ward -- by killing her spirit and 
sapping her will to live. 
</P>
<P>
 The case goes to trial Monday. Prosecutors say they intend to prove that the 
horror of the attack and Ward's feelings of shame and humiliation triggered 
depression and "post-traumatic stress" that worsened her health and contributed 
to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys, legal scholars and critics say the case could set a 
dangerous precedent as it delves into deeply emotional, even spiritual issues 
that have little basis in case law. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's lawyer denounced the theory as "voodoo." 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole case is just insanity," said Deputy Public Defender Leonard 
Gumlia. "I guess this means that if a burglar steals a treasured heirloom, and 
the owner becomes depressed and sad and later dies, that's murder too." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the controversy, a legal adviser to the Mexican government has 
accused prosecutors of targeting Garcia as a legal "guinea pig" because he is 
Latino and an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors say race played no role in the decision to press murder 
charges and that the case has already cleared several hurdles to reach trial. 
"A grand jury has looked at the facts of this case, and a Superior Court judge 
and appellate court has looked at the facts and the law in the case and 
concluded that we are not out of the ballpark," Assistant Dist. Atty. John 
Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor David La Bahn said his case will rely on showing that the rape 
hastened Ward's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury will be instructed that there need not be physical injury to prove 
the charges," he said. "It will be up to the jury to decide." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the attack, Ward was an active member of the Jehovah's Witness church 
and helped manage a Stanton apartment complex, collecting rents and handling 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 A widow with no children, Ward was a spirited woman who tried not to let her 
medical conditions interfere with visits to friends, her neighbors and friends 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward woke about 2:30 a.m. on May 22, 1992, to find a stranger splashing in the 
complex pool outside her bedroom window. Ward ventured outside to shoo the man 
away, but turned and ran inside to call 911 when the man came toward her. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Garcia followed Ward inside and began attacking her. Orange 
County Sheriff's deputies responding to the 911 call captured Garcia in the 
act, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward later told hospital officials she wished she had died, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 She refused to return to her apartment and moved to another home -- but never 
regained her sense of safety, friends said. An elder at the Jehovah's Witness 
Kingdom Hall that Ward attended recalled that Ward once panicked at the sight 
of a male groundskeeper outside the sliding-glass door of her new home. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia had lived in the same neighborhood as Ward. He worked as a dishwasher 
at an Orange County hotel, lived with relatives and sent most of his earnings 
back to his mother in Mexico, Gumlia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia had been drinking that night -- his blood-alcohol level was about 0.22, 
or nearly three times the legal limit -- and he had sought out the cool water 
on a warm night. He deeply regrets that night's turn of events, his attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He keeps saying to me that he cannot understand how he can be charged with 
murder. He says 'I never meant to hurt her, I never meant to kill her,' " 
Gumlia said, adding that he believes Garcia attacked Ward because he was 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who grew up in poverty and has only a second-grade education, has only 
one prior misdemeanor arrest for public intoxication, Gumlia said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of murder and five sexual assault charges, Garcia, a Mexican 
citizen, faces life in prison with no possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal observers say the most critical information the jury receives may 
have nothing to do with evidence, and everything to do with emotion and race. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a far-fetched, wild theory. Who better to try it on than an illegal 
alien?" said attorney Ruben Salgado, a legal adviser to the Mexican Consulate 
in Santa Ana. "I feel personally that there is some discrimination in the way 
the district attorney's office is handling this case." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego defense attorney Elisabeth Semel, past president of California 
Attorneys for Criminal Justice, agreed. "This case involves major society 
issues that are polarizing our community, mainly the role of the undocumented 
in committing crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Another disputed issue is the cause of Ward's death. Garcia's attorney 
contends that a virulent form of cancer -- that was previously misdiagnosed -- 
was found throughout her body, causing severe swelling. Ward died shortly after 
the start of radiation treatment caused her kidneys to fail, according to court 
papers filed by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecutor contends the rape was a contributing cause of death, 
crushing Ward's will to live and decreasing her ability to fight her illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecutor is charting new territory," said Gregory Christopher Brown, 
assistant professor of criminal justice at Chapman University in Orange. 
"(What) he is banking on is the jury being caught up in the emotional side of 
all this, a terrified elderly woman being raped." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA law professor Peter Arenella said there is little case law on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar cases are based on more direct links between criminal conduct and 
unintentional death. Arenella cited a noted case where a robber was convicted 
of murder because the victim had a heart attack during the heist and died. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that case, it was clear that fear generated from the robbery triggered 
immediate, powerful stress that caused a fatal heart attack," Arenella said. 
"In this case, you have an elderly woman with cancer. It certainly is a 
stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 The case will be a tough one on both sides: Jurors will despise Garcia and his 
admitted rape of an elderly woman, Gumlia conceded. But the prosecution also 
has the daunting task of proving that the brain possesses the power to give up 
on life. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the mortality experts expected to be called during the case is Prof. 
David Phillips of the University of California at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 study by Phillips documents the power of the mind in controlling life 
expectancy. Chinese Americans who subscribe to astrology are more likely to die 
during a year that is considered ill-fated for their diagnosed disease, his 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips' other studies have found that mortality rates among Jewish and 
Chinese people often drop before important occasions and rise afterward, while 
ill women also prolong their lives until after a critical event. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a wealth of anecdotal tales about seemingly healthy spouses 
dying shortly after they are widowed, or people living on for one last birthday 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Some defense attorneys also cited a common-sense belief that people possess 
the "will to live," but said such perceptions do not belong in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In a legal brief, Gumlia sarcastically argued that the prosecution's theory -- 
taken to its extreme -- means Garcia is a mass murderer since Ward's attack and 
death placed life-shortening grief on her friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question of what makes the human heart break, or what makes the human 
spirit either resilient enough to bounce back even stronger or break is not 
something the criminal law was designed to answer," said Santa Ana defense 
attorney William J. Kopeny.

QUAKE RELIEF EFFORT PICKS UP; TENT CITIES IN PLACE; U.S. PLEDGES MORE MONEY; 
DISASTER: NUMBER STILL NEEDING SHELTER DROPS, BUT RAIN REMAINS A THREAT. 
OFFICIALS CONCEDE THEY UNDERESTIMATED IMPACT. MEANWHILE, CALTRANS MAY INSTALL 
TEMPORARY BRIDGES OVER FREEWAY GAPS.

 Given at least a one-day reprieve from rain and rattling aftershocks, relief 
and repair efforts in Los Angeles accelerated Saturday as tent cities sprang up 
across the San Fernando Valley and the White House promised an additional $283 
million in federal earthquake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials preparing for this week's expected commuter crush said they are 
considering whether to erect temporary bridges over gaps in the Simi Valley and 
Santa Monica freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after the Los Angeles area was rocked by a 6.6-magnitude quake, the 
developments suggest that agencies are improving delivery of relief services 
and that the efforts, though sizable, have not been enough to cope with what 
may surpass Hurricane Andrew as the costliest natural disaster in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us realized the magnitude of it all," said James Lee 
Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In other quake-related developments Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Estimates of those sleeping outside in parks and elsewhere dropped to 9,000 
from 14,500 on Friday. Unseasonably warm weather helped Saturday, but there was 
a 60% chance of some rain by tonight, when temperatures could fall to the low 
40s. With rain possible, crews hurried to open more tent cities, particularly 
in the quake-ravaged Valley. "The rain is going to be the next major situation 
out here," County Fire Inspector Mark Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of structures declared uninhabitable in the city climbed to more 
than 1,600, encompassing 7,421 housing units. Damage to those buildings reached 
$460 million -- a figure that will grow considerably because building 
inspectors expect to be assessing damage at least for another week. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles Unified School District planned to reopen most campuses 
Tuesday. Of 30,000 classrooms, 300 remained unsafe, virtually all of them in 
the hard-hit West Valley. School Board President Leticia Quezada said: "My hope 
is that all children will be able to attend school one way or another" next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 * More creature comforts began to reach those displaced by the quake. At one 
Valley park, barbecued ribs were served up, a bookmobile was met by hundreds of 
reading-hungry people in another park, and plans were made to televise today's 
NFL playoff games for those who have taken refuge in San Fernando Recreation 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles County death toll stood at 55, though coroner's spokesman 
Scott Carrier said the number could change. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a good chance that (rescuers and construction crews) may find 
something under buildings during the cleanup period, as happened during the 
riots," Carrier said. Likewise, he said, the coroner could lower the number of 
quake-related fatalities now that overwhelmed medical examiners can re-examine 
some cases. "Some of these cases are questionable" as quake-caused deaths, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * At an afternoon briefing at Caltech, officials said the aftershock frequency 
was decreasing. Although four aftershocks of magnitude 4 to 4.6 hit in rapid 
succession Friday, only four tremors -- all magnitude 3.0 or less -- were 
recorded by 10 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Angeles, officials announced plans to open seven more emergency 
assistance shelters by Monday, bringing the total to 20. As many as 1,000 state 
workers might join in the FEMA assistance effort during the coming week, 
depending upon the need. 
</P>
<P>
 * And in Washington, one top FEMA official said that no decision on long-term 
recovery aid for Los Angeles has been made, but estimated that the federal 
government will spend at least $100 million on emergency provisions and 
shelter. Moreover, FEMA's Dick Krimm said the federal government is mindful of 
how much the state -- and particularly Southern California -- has endured the 
last two years in riots, floods, fires and quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last couple years, we have spent billions of dollars in California," 
Krimm said. "Good Lord, we are very, very sensitive to the disasters of 
Southern California." Federal Help 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by increasing criticism of red tape, officials defended their relief 
efforts, arguing that they are setting up the largest assistance program in 
U.S. history to deal with the most damaging earthquake ever to be centered in a 
major metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has estimated that damages could exceed $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now dealing with the largest mass assistance of people in an urban 
area in the history of the United States," Henry G. Cisneros, Housing and Urban 
Development secretary, said in Los Angeles on Saturday. He said the first quake 
victim to find housing under emergency federal assistance moved into an 
apartment Saturday night. The person's name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the White House announced the release of additional earthquake 
relief funds. Of the $283 million in new aid, White House Press Secretary Dee 
Dee Myers said $140 million will be for Small Business Administration loans and 
the other $143 million for a range of activities such as grants for emergency 
housing and family support and to help localities pay for debris removal, 
emergency services and repair of damaged public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration said Saturday it has provided a total of $639 
million for SBA loans, $41 million for emergency highway repairs and $143 
million for FEMA. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros defended the federal and state relief effort at a Los Angeles news 
conference along with Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of 
Emergency Services, FEMA's Witt, and Art Agnos, who was mayor of San Francisco 
when the disastrous Loma Prieta quake struck there in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "This earthquake is at least twice as bad and the response of the state and 
federal government has been twice as fast," Agnos said. "In 1989, I never saw 
the FEMA director until a week later on 'Larry King Live.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake victims have expressed anger about long lines for relief 
applications and the inability of officials to offer tangible aid such as money 
for emergency housing and rebuilding. Their anger also has been directed at 
FEMA's toll-free hot line for filing claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called and called and called, but we never got any response beyond a 
polite message to hold," said Ared McCurchin, a South-Central Los Angeles 
carpenter who was among those in line Saturday at a new center at 421 S. Avalon 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 But disaster officials said they are increasing the number of relief workers 
and centers, streamlining the application process for aid and sending 
"outreach" workers to wherever victims congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's Krimm acknowledged that the agency's phone system was overwhelmed by 
the request for claims. "On Friday, we had 15,000 calls come in one hour," he 
said. "That is far greater than we have ever had in any disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Andrews maintained that disaster workers had reduced the number of 
quake victims living in parks from 14,000 immediately after the quake to 3,900 
by sending outreach workers to talk people into going to shelters and relief 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that figure was disputed by city Parks Parks and Recreation Director 
Jackie Tatum, who said there still were 9,000 quake victims camped in parks 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said disaster workers were distributing leaflets in Spanish assuring 
quake victims that they are eligible for aid regardless of citizenship under 
federal law. Many people near Downtown in the Pico-Union area, which has a 
large community of Central Americans, fled from tenements and have been camping 
in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA set up a relief center in the area Saturday, flying experienced staff 
members in from Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims are not the only ones exhausted by the events of the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA workers Luis Monge and Richard Rodriguez opened the Pico Union disaster 
relief office at the Central American Resource Center after flying all night 
from Puerto Rico to New York to San Francisco to Burbank, where they were given 
a van and a map. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting lost, they managed to open the office at 2:30 p.m. and begin 
interviewing the 400 people who had been waiting in line for hours. Relief

 The National Guard continued setting up tent encampments throughout the Valley 
Saturday morning, hoping to provide shelter for the newly displaced. However, 
at some sites, including Reseda Park and West Valley Park, Red Cross officials 
would not allow people to start moving into the tents because no cots were on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Under bright sunshine, about 150 sweating soldiers hauled canvas out of the 
backs of trucks, pulled on ropes and drove stakes with wooden mallets at the 
Winnetka Recreation Center, where about 300 quake victims have been camping out 
all week. 
</P>
<P>
 By evening, officials said, the center would house upward of 1,000 temporary 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard members erected two sizes of olive drab tents and brought in water 
tankers called "water buffalos." The large tents can house 30 to 35 people and 
the smaller ones 20 to 25 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say their homes are fine but they're scared to go home," said 
Guard Lt. Bill Lemna, 27, a Lodi food executive. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lemna was speaking, Jake Jaroszewski, 37, an employee of Baxter Health 
Care, drove up with a truckload of donated goods 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got food. We've got medical supplies. Where do we go?" Jaroszewski 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemna directed him to an open spot on the grass and a line immediately began 
to form. Baxter employees passed out bags of groceries and plastic jugs of 
water to the grateful park residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Tony Jett of the Los Angeles Police Department stood beside the truck 
and shook his head in wonderment. "Trucks are driving up with all kinds of 
stuff -- food, clothing, water, all the necessities. It's so positive, it's 
unbelievable, people coming together to help other people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, a large yellow van drove up and out jumped Jay Lenhoff, 37, 
director of operations for Tony Roma's restaurant chain. The rear of the truck 
swung open and a team of Roma's volunteers began unloading tables, portable 
barbecues, crates of chicken, beans, cole slaw and soft drinks. "We've got 
enough food here for 2,000 people," Lenhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those contributing to the relief effort at Winnetka Recreation Center 
were a Redondo Beach couple -- Rachel Ybarra, an office worker, and her 
husband, Tracy, an electrician. "We didn't take much damage ourselves, so we 
wanted to help the people who did," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They drove onto the grass in a red pickup truck laden with supplies and 
another line formed immediately. "We brought juice, diapers, toilet paper, 
tortillas, all sorts of things. We took $250 from our savings to pay for it," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, five lines snaked out of a brick building in the middle of the 
recreation center. Hundreds of people were lined up seeking assistance from the 
Red Cross, FEMA, the Small Business Administration, state welfare officials, 
Los Angeles City Housing Authority, Internal Revenue Service and other 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the scene was calm, there was still confusion about where to go for 
certain assistance. "This is a line for housing vouchers -- or at least I think 
it's a line for housing vouchers," said Scott Sheridan, who works at a private 
school in the Valley. "But I've been in it for 25 minutes and it's hardly moved 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 An extended family of 50 has been occupying a makeshift shelter -- a plastic 
tent stretching over several automobiles and poles -- at the Winnetka center 
since last Monday. "That's a long time," said Andres Ojeda of Canoga Park. 
"With the rain coming, the tents will be a whole lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away, 750 to 1,000 people had moved into tents set up by the 
National Guard at Lanark Park in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanca Granillo, 19, said all the members of her extended family had moved 
into the camp, being administered by the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are about 40 of us in here," she said. "We were the first ones to get a 
tent Friday night. Before that we had been out in the open, and this is way, 
much better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army was providing three meals a day at Lanark Park. "Our basic 
staples are sandwiches and packaged foods," said Salvation Army Maj. Dale Hill. 
"We don't have any means of cooking anything right now. But the donations are 
generous and the food keeps coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 One added feature at Lanark Park was a dental clinic set up under a blue 
plastic awning by the Loma Linda School of Dentistry. Instead of dentist's 
chairs, patients were examined on plastic lawn furniture. Getting Around 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful that nothing can return to normal if traffic cannot move, 
transportation officials were considering the use of temporary bridges on two 
crippled freeways critical to the region -- the Santa Monica and the Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeshift structures would allow a partial flow of motorists on one side 
of the roadway while crews work to reconstruct the other. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Santa Monica Freeway, the busiest in the nation with some 340,000 
motorists traversing it daily, a temporary bridge would provide four lanes -- 
two in each direction, said Jerry Baxter, head of the local Caltrans office. 
</P>
<P>
 A temporary structure, however, would also drag out repair of the freeways, 
which Caltrans officials had pledged would be finished within one year, Baxter 
cautioned. Caltrans officials are analyzing the cost and delay that erecting 
makeshift bridges would entail, a strategy that was employed on certain Bay 
Area structures after the 1989 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, you would get half a freeway. It would be a considerable help 
and take an awful lot of the load off the city streets," Baxter said. "It has 
the advantage of getting half the freeway open earlier but the disadvantage of 
delaying construction." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's quake battered roadways, collapsing bridges, twisting asphalt and 
shutting parts of six thoroughfares -- including major arteries such as the San 
Diego and Golden State freeways. In hopes of easing congestion, Baxter said 
engineers are now considering shoring up the sagging structure on the westbound 
side of the Simi Valley Freeway for use as a temporary route. The eastbound 
side of the freeway collapsed in Monday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, Caltrans officials reopened all connectors between the 
Ventura and Glendale freeways Saturday. The interchanges were closed for one 
day. Work crews had cleared about 65% of the rubble on Interstate 5 at Gavin 
Canyon by Saturday. At the Simi Valley Freeway, workers removed about 45% of 
the fallen debris, said spokesman Russell Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan is expected to announce today 
part of a plan to diminish traffic on the city's jammed streets. Riordan is 
considering converting some streets, such as Olympic Boulevard, into one-way 
thoroughfares. He also may ask trucking companies to make deliveries at night, 
avoiding the roads during commuter rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar initiatives were used during the 1984 Olympics, with Flower and 
Figueroa streets Downtown designated one-way. And, with the cooperation of 
trucking companies, an estimated 5,000 trucks -- the traffic equivalent of 
25,000 automobiles -- were kept off the freeways during peak travel times. 
Damage Toll 
</P>
<P>
 A more detailed profile of damage to buildings in Los Angeles started to 
emerge Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the structures declared unsafe were built before codes were 
strengthened following the 1971 Sylmar quake, according to a Times analysis. 
Among these was the Northridge apartment complex where 16 people died. 
</P>
<P>
 But a handful of "red-tagged" buildings had been constructed within the last 
few years, confirming the capricious nature of the temblor. A red tag means 
that a building has been declared unsafe to occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, most of the buildings can be repaired," said Tim Thayne, senior 
building inspector. "Some will have to demolished." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Hal Bernson's northwest Valley district was hardest hit, with 
110 unsafe buildings. Next was Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's district, extending 
from the Westside to Sherman Oaks, with 94 unsafe buildings, according to the 
study by Richard O'Reilly, Times director of computer analysis, and Sandra 
Poindexter, data analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times analysis also found that half of the unsafe buildings were purchased 
in the last five years and a quarter were bought since 1991. Apartments and 
condominiums accounted for 64% of the unsafe buildings. Single-family homes 
represented about 18%. 
</P>
<P>
 Offices, restaurants, stores and parking garages accounted for most of the 
remaining 18%. Returning 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the scenes of tent cities and rubble-strewn sidewalks, there were signs 
that life was getting back to normal -- and of people trying to keep some 
perspective, even some humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, parades of joggers took advantage of picture-postcard 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda Park, a Los Angeles Library bookmobile was parked and assistant 
branch director Fontayne Holmes said hundreds of books were checked out 
Saturday by people camping out. 
</P>
<P>
 A circle of children sat attentively at the feet of Michael Eisenberg, an 
assistant librarian, as he read enthusiastically to them from from a book 
entitled "Miss Nelson Is Missing," pausing before turning each page to show 
them the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts were being made to try to meet other needs of victims. Even the need 
for football. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downtown Hyatt Regency hotel planned to set up a big-screen TV in San 
Fernando Recreation Park today so earthquake victims would not miss the 
National Football League playoff games. The hotel also planned to serve 
breakfast to 1,000 quake victims at a Red Cross shelter.

THE TIMES POLL; CLINTON'S JOB APPROVAL RATING STANDS AT 55% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he prepares to deliver his second State of the Union Address Tuesday 
evening, President Clinton enjoys broad but still qualified approval of his 
performance in office, a Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite several weeks of allegations of personal and financial misbehavior in 
Arkansas, Clinton's job approval rating in the new survey stands at 55% -- 
unchanged from a Times Poll taken in early December before the controversies 
emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Public sentiment remains uncertain about Clinton's investment in an Arkansas 
real estate venture with the owner of a failed savings and loan: Close to 
three-quarters of those surveyed said they don't know enough about the 
Whitewater Development Corp. controversy to determine whether the President and 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton did anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, respondents were inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt: The 
share of respondents who said Clinton lacks the honesty and integrity to serve 
as President had inched up only slightly since December, remaining just below 
30%. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the broadest assessment of Clinton's effect on the nation, most 
respondents remained to be persuaded. Asked if "the country is in better shape 
because of Bill Clinton's performance in office this past year," 30% said yes, 
15% said no, and 51% said he has made little difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the poll indicates that Americans continue to give higher priority 
to reduction of the federal budget deficit than to the public investment agenda 
that Clinton hopes to invigorate this year. And, like critics of Clinton's 
ambitious reform plan, most respondents said they want government to move 
slowly in remaking the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, after his early stumbles, Clinton has recovered enough public esteem to 
rank in the mid-range of job approval ratings of recent presidents at the 
one-year mark. Clinton's first-anniversary approval rating is above Ronald 
Reagan's and Harry S. Truman's, equal to Jimmy Carter's, just below Lyndon B. 
Johnson's, and well beneath the 70%-plus readings achieved by John F. Kennedy, 
Dwight D. Eisenhower and George Bush, according to Gallup polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll, supervised by John Brennan, surveyed 1,516 adults nationwide 
Jan. 15-19; it has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found a strengthening breeze of optimism about the economy. About 37% 
of those polled said the nation is no longer in recession -- the highest figure 
recorded since The Times Poll began asking the question in that form in 1991. 
About one out of five respondents said the economy remains mired in "serious" 
recession -- the lowest figure since March, 1991, and less than half the 
percentage recorded in the months before Clinton's election. 
</P>
<P>
 One out of four respondents expected the economy to improve over the next 
three months, while just one out of eight expected it to slip -- the most 
positive ratio since last January. Likewise, 28% of those surveyed said they 
expect the unemployment situation to improve over the next three months, while 
18% said they expect it to deteriorate; the 10-point positive balance is the 
most optimistic since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts said they believe that the economic numbers foreshadow continued 
high performance ratings for Clinton. "He can claim ownership of the economy 
now," said Karlyn H. Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American 
Enterprise Institute. "If the economy continues to do well through this year, I 
think he will stay in that 55-60% range." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked specifically about the economy, respondents said that they approve of 
Clinton's performance by a margin of 48% to 40%. In the wake of his tour across 
Europe and the nations of the former Soviet Union, respondents said they 
approve of his performance in foreign affairs by a 51%-33% margin, equaling his 
strongest showing in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The best news for Clinton is the extent of his inroads among groups that 
previously had reacted coolly to him and that had resisted Democratic 
presidential nominees for most of the past quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton's job rating among respondents earning less than $20,000 
annually has hardly changed since June, for instance, his positive marks have 
doubled among the most affluent. 
</P>
<P>
 The President now receives positive job ratings from three-fifths of college 
graduates and self-described moderates, nearly three-fifths of suburbanites and 
those earning more than $60,000 annually, and a majority of both whites and 
independents. Exactly half of white non-Catholic Christians give him positive 
marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who voted for Bush in 1992, roughly 3 in 10 now give Clinton 
positive job ratings; those who backed Ross Perot in 1992 now split evenly, 
with 47% approving of Clinton's performance and 48% disapproving. Those numbers 
constitute an improvement since summer, when only 9% of Bush backers and 41% of 
Perot voters applauded Clinton's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's position is solid on another measure: 57% of those polled, including 
43% of those who backed Perot, said he is "working hard to bring fundamental 
change." Just 35% -- down 6 percentage points from December -- said he 
represents "business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 But those who credit Clinton with change are divided on its effect: 43% said 
he has improved conditions in the nation, 9% said he has made things worse and 
45% said they see no difference. Not surprisingly, the roughly one-third of 
respondents who said Clinton represents business as usual hold a significantly 
more negative assessment: Just 10% said things are better because of his year 
in office, 23% said conditions are worse, and 63% said he has had no effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Other warning signs for the President appear in the survey. One is the 
disparity in intensity between his supporters and critics: Although his overall 
approval rating is quite positive, the percentage of respondents who are 
strongly negative about his performance equals those who are strongly in favor: 
one out of five. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, 25% of respondents said they definitely won't vote for Clinton in 
1996; just 13% said they are certain to support him. Those numbers may not 
predict how people will actually vote almost three years hence, but they are 
another reflection of the relative intensity that Clinton inspires in 
supporters and opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Most respondents have so far withheld judgment on the tangled questions raised 
by the Clintons' investment in a failed Arkansas land development deal. Asked 
if the President and his wife had "engaged in wrongdoing" in the Whitewater 
venture, which involved the development of resort property in the Ozark 
Mountains, just 13% said yes, 15% said no and 72% said they don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Attitudes toward Hillary Clinton have changed only slightly since December, 
with 56% expressing a favorable opinion and 25% negative. Asked if Bill Clinton 
has the honesty and integrity to serve as President, 63% said yes and 29% said 
no -- only a small change from the 68%-23% split in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, three-fourths of those surveyed said the Whitewater controversy 
hasn't affected their opinion of Clinton. One-fifth said it has diminished 
their assessment, but most of those voted for Bush in 1992. Respondents were 
ambivalent on whether the Clintons are cooperating sufficiently with the 
investigation: Half said yes, but one-fourth disagreed and the rest were 
unsure. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll also signals ambivalence on policy questions: Respondents broadly 
shared Clinton's priorities but weren't certain about his prescriptions. Asked 
in an open-ended question to say what issues Clinton should focus on this year, 
respondents echoed the President's own list: 53% cited the economy, 26% health 
care and 22% crime, drugs and gun control. Another 8% picked the questions of 
moral and cultural values that Clinton has lately emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 But the poll shows that in many areas Clinton still must strain to convert 
Americans to his solutions. Asked to define the government's top economic 
priority, just 27% called for boosting government spending on education, public 
works and research -- the investment agenda Clinton hopes to revive this year 
after largely deferring it in 1993. Deficit-reduction remained the priority for 
35%, while 21% put tax cuts at the top of the list. 
</P>
<P>
 On health care, Clinton's plan still receives tentative approval: 47% said 
they generally approved of the plan, while 32% said they didn't like it. But 
those numbers have slipped since Clinton introduced the plan in September, when 
supporters exceeded critics by 30 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Another flashing yellow light: 55% of those polled accepted the argument of 
Clinton's critics that changes in the health care system should be phased in 
over time; just 40% said reform should be implemented "as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 On crime, Clinton could be in a stronger position. Nearly three-fifths of 
respondents said they support the Administration's plan to raise fees for gun 
dealers; a similar majority said they endorse increased taxes on ammunition. 
THE TIMES POLL: Clinton Holding at 55% Approval 
</P>
<P>
 After one year in office, 55% of respondents say they approve of the way 
President Clinton is handling his job. That's unchanged from five weeks ago, 
indicating allegations of wrongdoing against the President have so far had 
little on his standing.

 Do you think we are in an economic recession? 03,20,10,10 Jan. '94 Dec. '93 No 
recession 55% 46% Moderate recession 40% 49% Don't know 5% 5% HOW THE POLL WAS 
CONDUCTED: The Times Poll interviewed 1,516 adult Americans nationwide, by 
telephone, from Jan. 15 through 19. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list 
of all exchanges in the nation. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so 
that listed and non-listed numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was 
conducted in English and Spanish. Results were weighted slightly to conform 
with census figures for sex, race, age, education and labor force 
participation. The margin of sampling error on the total sample is plus or 
minus 3 percentage points. For other subgroups the error margin may be somewhat 
higher. Poll results can also be affected by other factors such as question 
wording and the order in which questions are presented.

 Inspectors scrambled Saturday to evaluate the safety of Los Angeles public 
schools while maintenance staff feverishly worked at cleaning up debris and 
making minor repairs to ready as many classrooms as possible for students 
scheduled to return to class on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday afternoon the number of uninhabitable classrooms -- all but a 
handful in the west San Fernando Valley -- had dropped to about 300 from a peak 
of 1,000, prompting school board President Leticia Quezada to say "my hope is 
that all children will be able to attend school one way or another" next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 97 hardest-hit West Valley schools -- now slated to be closed 
Tuesday -- may be ready for occupancy later this week and no school will be 
permanently closed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 9,000 students are estimated to be without classrooms, dramatically lower 
than earlier estimates of up to 100,000, said Doug Brown, chief of district 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 By early Monday authorities will decide whether any West Valley schools can 
open Tuesday, according to Brown. Although portions of most of these campuses 
are structurally sound, many classrooms are in disarray and cleanup may take 
days or even weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more optimistic today than I was yesterday," Brown said. "But 640,000 
students back in school? That's really, really optimistic in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake's impact on Los Angeles public schools ranged from severe 
structural damage at some school buildings to minor cosmetic damage, according 
to a report released Saturday by the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, along with visits to schools from South-Central to the East 
Valley, show the scope of troubles ranging from broken windows and cracked 
walls to fallen ceiling tiles and buckled floors. More than half the district's 
640 campuses were virtually unscathed, the report showed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the good, the bad and the ugly," said a weary Vehah Assatourian, a Los 
Angeles school district construction inspector. "We're seeing lots of 
architectural and cosmetic damage with minor structural damage and some unknown 
conditions that need further investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Assatourian, who was working in the West Valley for his sixth day Saturday, 
said repairs will be costly. District officials believe damage may run as high 
as $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The district damage report, which officials hope will be significantly pared 
down by Monday, contains the shorthand notes of structural engineers and school 
maintenance supervisors sketching the random impact of the quake: 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso High School, an 84-student continuation school in Reseda, will not 
reopen soon. "All buildings unusable; major structural damage to all buildings 
on site," the engineers wrote. "One classroom building must be (demolished); 
two (bungalows) off foundations." 
</P>
<P>
 Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School in Hollywood, meanwhile, was deemed "ready 
to occupy," suffering only "minor stucco cracks on main building." 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park Elementary School was listed as having 35 unusable classrooms due 
to "major water damage" from a broken ceiling pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 At 93rd Street Elementary School in South-Central Los Angeles, minor cracks 
crisscross four classroom walls and the rooms are "approved for occupancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every school in the Valley needs to be cleaned, walkways shored up and 
barricades erected to keep students away from crumbling plaster and unsafe 
corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of schools on the Eastside, in South-Central L.A. and the harbor 
area show white space in the damage column of the district report. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Valley classrooms that will probably be in disarray Monday and 
Tuesday. Gas, water and electricity in some buildings still had not been 
checked or repaired on Saturday. Cafeteria stoves were overturned, lunch ground 
shelters were twisted, light fixtures dangled by wires. 
</P>
<P>
 At those schools and elsewhere, workers swiftly cordoned off damaged 
bungalows, swathed cracked support columns in orange plastic netting and 
segregated damaged buildings from safe ones with red and yellow tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers swept and shoveled debris out of corridors, and ripped down ceiling 
tiles to make rooms safe for habitation. Shattered windows were boarded, and 
water lines were patched and tested. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials hope to complete as much cleanup as possible by Tuesday, they 
said parents and students in many schools should brace themselves for 
classrooms without ceiling tiles and with cracked walls and soggy carpets. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene may not look reassuring, but it is safe and parents should not be 
alarmed, district leaders said. Cracks in walls and stairwells, water damage 
and broken windows are typically cosmetic damage and do not necessarily mean a 
building is unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "My people have instructions to not clear any classroom or building for 
occupancy that they would not send their own children or grandchildren into," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike J. Bargman, chief architect of Los Angeles Unified School District, said 
it will take weeks to clean up many West Valley classrooms, such as those at 
Reseda High School, even if there is no structural damage to buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot of schools, where structurally they're OK, but we've got to 
test them for gas leaks. . . . We have a lot of kitchen areas where equipment 
was juggled around and (the shaking) severed the electrical (wires). That has 
to be redone." 
</P>
<P>
 Bargman said major structural work will be needed at Encino Elementary, Reseda 
High School, Holmes Junior High, Monroe High School and Danube Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst damage occurred near the Northridge epicenter of Monday's 6.6 
temblor -- and among the hardest hit was 2,300-student Kennedy High School in 
Granada Hills, where officials say the cleanup alone will take two to three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a walk-through inspection of Kennedy Saturday, Assatourian and Jack 
Starlin, a state inspector, found a three-inch fissure in the earth snaking its 
way 200 yards from the baseball field through the girls' and boys' locker rooms 
and into the football field. 
</P>
<P>
 "That came out of left field," said Starlin, a senior structural engineer with 
the State Architect's Office. "This is one of the few sites I've seen that have 
so many deep ground ruptures." 
</P>
<P>
 Two buildings on the campus, built in 1971 before the Sylmar quake that year, 
are structurally damaged and cannot be occupied. Other classroom buildings were 
found to be structurally safe but in shambles. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspectors walked through a two-story classroom building and discovered 
badly damaged ceilings, cracks in plaster and air-conditioning vents lying on 
the floors. But as they left, armed with clipboards, flashlights and hard hats, 
Starlin said: "Give it a green light" for occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 The early district report for nearby Nobel Middle School describes in one line 
that light fixtures are down and that there is structural damage to the student 
store and arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 Assatourian and Starlin, however, are making room-by-room assessments. Their 
method is simple: "If it looks questionable, we're putting up braces and posts 
and then we'll do another assessment," said Starlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Starlin said the schools will be inspected several more times in the 
hardest-hit West Valley areas and that principals and plant managers should not 
be reluctant to contact the district's construction staff -- even if the school 
already was inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather see the same thing twice than have these people not call me," 
Starlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bargman, the chief district architect, noted that the light damage to Monroe 
High School in Northridge "just goes to show you how well these schools were 
built. This is almost ground zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles public schools in the central and east San Fernando Valley 
suffered relatively minor damage. But maintenance crews were still out in force 
at those schools, repairing broken windows, lights and surface cracks in 
interior and exterior walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The back outside wall of O'Melveny School in San Fernando was blackened from a 
fire on adjacent Wolfskill Street that ignited when a crude-oil pipe ruptured 
during the quake. But the damage did not appear to reach inside the classrooms, 
and will not delay the elementary school's opening, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Elementary School is among the most severely damaged campuses 
outside the West Valley, the district report showed. While plans are not 
confirmed, officials said, students there may have to be transferred to 
O'Melveny. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Fernando, seven rooms are destroyed, two bungalows have slid off their 
foundation, and there is no water and no gas. Making matters worse, about 10 
teachers whose homes are damaged or may be stranded may not be able to make it 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sharp Avenue School in Pacoima, administrators were working out the 
logistics of accommodating 800 additional elementary students whose West Valley 
schools are too damaged to be usable by Tuesday, according to plant manager 
Tony Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
 And when students return to San Fernando High School and Sylmar High School, 
they may find their gymnasiums still occupied by quake victims who have been 
sheltered at the schools since Monday. On Saturday, National Guard troops were 
on the school grounds helping run the shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando High suffered minor damage to its auditorium, according to 
Principal Phil Saldivar. The hot water boilers also were knocked out of 
commission by the earthquake, and again on Friday by aftershocks. But 
maintenance workers had them going again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Coughlin, Valley regional superintendent, took one look inside Tulsa 
Elementary school in Granada Hills Saturday and said no one will set foot 
inside until at least Tuesday. "It is not safe for teachers and it is not safe 
for students," Coughlin said. "That is the recommendation I'm going to make." 
</P>
<P>
 While the district report and Coughlin said the damage does not appear to be 
structural, it's those 102 dangling lights and fixtures and several gas leaks 
in the kitchen and main office that will keep everyone away from the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 At Van Gogh Street School in Granada Hills, rebuilt after the Sylmar quake in 
1971, principal Maureen Diekmann pointed to a worrisome crack that runs through 
the hallway, outside courtyard and through fifth grade Room 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "This crack goes right across the street," she said. "It goes into a house 
across the street and that house has been condemned." 
</P>
<P>
 The district report says that no children are permitted in the main building, 
because the entire structure may be unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 miles south over the Santa Monica Mountains, Konnie Fulcher, plant 
manager at Alexander Hamilton High School on the Westside, has spent all week 
supervising crews of electricians and maintenance workers who are replacing 
ceiling tiles, lights, pipes, windowpanes and myriad other building parts 
broken in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The district report for Hamilton lists three paragraphs of damage: structural 
damage to lab building, girls' gym flooded, damaged bridge structure, loose 
stairway handrails, small asbestos cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Structurally, most of the buildings on Hamilton's campus at 2955 Robertson 
Blvd. are intact. The exception may be the 63-year-old brick auditorium, site 
of performances by students in Hamilton's renowned music program. Several 
ornamental columns inside the auditorium cracked, and as of Saturday, 
structural engineers had yet to declare the building safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The second and third floor pedestrian bridges linking the science building 
with Hamilton's main building buckled in the middle. They have been declared 
unsafe and are roped off. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost a week's worth of intensive work has removed most traces of the 
damage. Classrooms on Saturday were looking tidy, and most of the ceiling tiles 
had been replaced. And work previously done to earthquake-proof Hamilton's 
three-story main building -- built of brick in 1931 -- stood the test. The 
building suffered major damage in the 1971 Sylmar quake, according to Fulcher, 
and subsequently was reinforced with steel beams. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage was similar at nearby Crescent Heights Boulevard School, a 
fourth-through-sixth-grade neighborhood school a few blocks northeast of where 
the Santa Monica Freeway collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Movable walls that fell down have been righted, and most of the ceiling tiles 
have been replaced. But cleanup work probably will not be completed in time for 
students to re-enter those classrooms Tuesday, according to plant manager 
Michael Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the condition is one fourth-grade room. Ceiling-mounted heating 
ducts are visible where tile from the dropped ceiling broke loose, and the 
carpet and desk surfaces are littered with debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet unscathed was a colorful display of children's essays, under the title: 
"What Do You Know About Planet Earth?" Damaged Classes 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's earthquake, inspectors found that more than 150 Los Angeles 
Unified School District campuses ad suffered damage that would render some 
buildings unusable. Subsequent inspections and repairs reduced that number to 
97, all in the San Fernando Valley west of the San Diego Freeway. Officials 
hope to make some of them serviceable by Tuesday.

<P>
 The numbers kept climbing as first the hours, then the days, slipped by. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The young, the old. Businessmen and homemakers. An ex-con on Skid Row. A 
4-year-old girl who loved frilly skirts and pink cowboy boots. More than 50 in 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly a third were in a single apartment complex whose upper two floors 
collapsed. One couple died when their vast collection of books and model trains 
fell on them as they slept. An electrician died when he picked up a high 
voltage wire draped across a car, an act of heroism turned to tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman may have literally died of fright as she rushed to check on her infant 
son. In the dark, a motorcycle policeman did not see where the temblor had 
opened a gash in an overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims were still in bed when Monday's quake shook the earth at 
4:31 a.m. with unrelenting anger. Others risked danger to help someone else. 
Together, they were the grimmest statistics in this, one of the costliest 
disasters in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of their stories. AMY TYRE-VIGIL: Youngest Victim Had a Last 
Beautiful Weekend 
</P>
<P>
 It had been, in Anastacio Vigil's words, "a beautiful weekend." His wife, 
Nancy Tyre, and 4-year-old daughter, Amy, had gone to a concert. He had taken 
Amy on a bike ride. The whole family had gone to the zoo. And Amy had sampled 
her first meatball Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Vigil and Tyre, both 40, had chatted happily about the future, about the 
second baby, a boy, on the way, about the new house they were going to buy once 
their Sherman Oaks home sold. Tyre, who like her husband is a family-practice 
doctor, told a friend she looked forward to having a bigger place when the baby 
came. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that, gone in an instant. Amy was buried Friday afternoon, the youngest 
victim of the temblor. More than 200 mourners said goodby to the dark-haired 
girl who loved her artwork, her nursery school, and chocolate chip cookies 
without nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother was not among those present. Instead, a rabbi went to Valley 
Presbyterian Hospital to join Tyre, seven months pregnant and bedridden with a 
broken pelvis, in reciting Yizkor, the Jewish prayer for the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy was crushed when the earthquake sent her home hurtling down its hillside, 
collapsing it into a flattened wreck of wood and stucco, tile and glass. Her 
father does not remember much about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like somebody picked up the house and just violently shook it. Nancy 
said, 'Get Amy!' As I was getting up there was a big flash of light and a 
terrible crashing sound. The next thing I remember, I was trapped." 
</P>
<P>
 In the darkness, pinned under boards, able only to wiggle his right foot, 
Vigil heard his wife moaning that she could not breathe. He listened for his 
daughter, but heard nothing. The silence worried him. He concentrated on trying 
to calm his wife. "Breathe slowly," he told her. "Breathe slowly. We're going 
to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple lay there for at least an hour on the ground amid the ruins, too 
far away to touch one another, talking as they shivered in the cold. Finally, 
they heard voices. It was the neighbors, venturing outside for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 It took an hour for the rescue workers to pick their way through the rubble. 
They freed Vigil first. "I felt a human hand on my leg," he said, "and it was 
just the most beautiful feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 He suffered a broken rib, and injuries to his leg and jaw, but he told the 
doctor who treated him at Sherman Oaks Hospital that he could not stay, that he 
needed a taxi. He had to find his wife and daughter. Sit down, the doctor told 
him. He would make some calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency physician learned that Tyre and Amy had been taken to Valley 
Presbyterian. He also learned what had happened to Amy. Gently, he told Vigil 
that his daughter had been killed. Though the crisis was mounting at his own 
hospital, the doctor drove Vigil to see his injured wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyre looked better than he expected. And the baby would be fine. 
</P>
<P>
 He grabbed her, held her close, and whispered the wrenching words: "We lost 
her." ELIZABETH BRACE: 'And Her Son Will Really Not Have Known Her at All' 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes terrified Elizabeth Brace. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young girl, her family's home had been heavily damaged by the Sylmar 
quake in 1971. Her husband, Thomas, said there was a certain way she acted when 
the earth rumbled, a kind of tenseness until the shaking stopped and the danger 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of their marriage, he was 43, she 31. They had set about quickly 
to begin a family. Elizabeth had quit her job when Michelle was born five years 
ago, followed by Christopher 3 1/2 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the Braces moved to Rancho Cucamonga in San Bernardino 
County. They wanted a bigger house and a decent school district. Elizabeth had 
become a Scout leader when Michelle was old enough to be a Daisy. She 
volunteered as a room mother a couple of days a week when Michelle started 
kindergarten this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the good life in a quiet, suburban way. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little to mark Sunday evening apart from others. Elizabeth had an 
appointment Monday morning. She was trying to earn some extra money while 
working at home and was thinking of doing the billing for a local doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, before dawn, the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple held each other in those first frightening moments. They did it 
instinctively because of Elizabeth's fears. Then, a few seconds later, she got 
up and raced for Christopher's room. Thomas went to Michelle's. 
</P>
<P>
 What Thomas remembers next was a loud noise in the next room. Not a cry. More 
like something falling. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just lying on the floor," said Thomas, a computer programmer. "She 
was unconscious and bleeding from the nose and mouth. I tried CPR but I don't 
think I did a good job of it. I'm not trained for that kind of thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called 911 and when I came back she was still," Thomas said. "I couldn't 
feel a pulse." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics arrived in minutes, but could not revive her. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early going, there was speculation that Elizabeth, 37, may have died 
when she tripped on a toy. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Bernardino coroner's office said it would take at least six weeks for 
the test results. Deputy Coroner Gabriel Morales said fright as a cause of 
death, perhaps in the form of a huge adrenal rush, is not being ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Thomas suspects: "If I were to speculate, I would guess she died 
of fright and panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, sitting on his living room couch a few days after the earthquake, 
worked hard to hold back his tears as he talked about his wife and how good 
their life had been. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was such a terrific mother and had gotten the job of raising the children 
started so well," he said. "And her son will really not have known her at all." 
HOWARD and JAMES LEE: Son Wrote His Epitaph: 'If It Weren't for Fate . . .' 
</P>
<P>
 Just weeks before his death, Howard Lee wrote his epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for fate, I might be somewhere else," the 14-year-old boy wrote 
in an autobiography for school entitled "My Life." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence proved as cruelly ironic as anything connected with the quake. 
Howard was killed in his bed, a Golf Digest he had been reading close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers who arrived at the Northridge Meadows apartments could still hear 
Howard -- a tall, always-smiling boy who was thinking of becoming a priest -- 
calling out from the ruins of Apartment 101. Around him in the darkness, 15 
other people died in the building collapse. Among them was his father, Pil, 46, 
trapped in the bathroom where he had been brushing his teeth before heading off 
to work as an RTD mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help me! Help me!" Howard shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers kept telling the voice to hold on, just a little longer. But the 
building had shifted 10 feet to the north when it collapsed and they could not 
locate them, even with the help of Howard's mother, who had been pulled from 
the wreckage earlier, along with her other son, 12-year-old Jason. Finally, 
they found a pillow and showed it to Hyun Lee, who said, yes, that belonged to 
Howard, whom she affectionately called her "big son." 
</P>
<P>
 Then they found him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This son is dead, ma'am," said the firefighter. "He is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyun Soon Lee, a deeply religious woman with a cascade of rich black hair, 
burst into tears, letting go of the thin thread of hope she had held onto for 
four hours. "Can I see him?" she asked. Hours later, her husband's body was 
brought out, the last recovered from the ruins. JOSE LOUIS HERNANDEZ: Ex-Con 
Had a Temper, but He Was a 'Fun-Loving Guy' 
</P>
<P>
 The initial news reports were sketchy: A mentally ill ex-convict had either 
jumped or fallen from a Skid Row flophouse during the quake. Good Samaritan 
Hospital called him John Doe No. 17 and said he died of head injuries caused by 
a very long fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The police report provided a bit more information: He lived in Room 610 of the 
Frontier Hotel. His window had been open. He was found by police lying on his 
back on the sidewalk, wearing only blue boxer shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 A down-and-out drifter when he died, Jose Louis Hernandez had a hearty laugh, 
a violent temper and a long criminal record. He also had four sons, a daughter 
and a granddaughter, although he had been out of touch with his family for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a temper but he was a good man," said his niece, Eileen Moreno. "He 
was a fun-loving guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Just out of state prison, the 49-year-old Hernandez settled into a studio at 
the Frontier, a once-grand hotel at Main and 5th streets that had fallen victim 
to the grittiness around it. Across the street from two porn theaters and a 
liquor store, the Frontier charges $11.99 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 A childhood friend, John Seanez, used to joke with Hernandez about his short, 
pudgy build. Growing up on the Eastside in the 1950s, Seanez and Hernandez were 
homeboys, partying together and once getting thrown off a city bus for guzzling 
beers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a pretty good guy when we were young," said Seanez, who also lives at 
the Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez drifted from his friends and drifted from his family. He also 
drifted in and out of jail. Since 1962, he served time for resisting arrest, 
petty theft, possession of heroin and cocaine, driving while intoxicated, 
assault with a deadly weapon and hit and run. 
</P>
<P>
 He once threatened a hotel employee's life when his toilet got clogged. But he 
also said "Thank you" after picking up his mail. He sometimes heard voices and 
was taking psychotropic drugs for his condition. 
</P>
<P>
 His parole officer, Robert Humphrey, had no problems with Hernandez. Since 
leaving prison on Thanksgiving, Hernandez had reported regularly, found a place 
to live and applied for government aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Humphrey: "He was doing pretty good on parole, up until his recent 
demise." CLARENCE WAYNE DEAN: Officer 'Was Quick to Help and That Never 
Changed'

<P>
 Minutes after the earthquake hit, Clarence Dean was putting on his uniform. He 
was a motorcycle cop. 
</P>
<P>
 He had spent more than half his life with the Los Angeles Police Department, 
graduating from the academy in 1968 after four years in the Marines. He had 
worked the streets -- first as a patrol officer and later as a motorcycle cop 
-- for nearly 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A colleague said his blond hair "always looked like he had just taken his 
helmet off." 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of the earthquake, Dean was not scheduled to start work until 7 
a.m., but the temblor apparently jolted him out of bed. The 46-year-old officer 
left his Lancaster home and headed for work on his motorcycle, blue lights 
flashing in the night. 
</P>
<P>
 As he drove south in the darkness, he rounded a bend on an Antelope Valley 
Freeway interchange. Dean and his motorcycle plunged 30 feet from the roadway, 
which had been severed in the quake. As he fell, the lights of the motorcycle 
continued to flash. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one called him, no one made him come in that morning," said Danny Staggs, 
president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, who knew Dean. "He was 
doing this to help people." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, the divorced father of two children, was remembered as a gregarious man 
who was quick with a joke or a story. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was quick to work and quick to help and that never changed," Sgt. Rod 
Grahek said. "You wonder what was going through his mind those last few 
seconds." KEVIN C. MAHER: 'If Anyone Needed Help, Kevin Was the First to Offer' 
</P>
<P>
 A grim reminder of one quake tragedy is burned into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 On a grassy patch at Murietta Avenue and Valleyheart Drive in Sherman Oaks, 
two charred footprints show exactly where a downed power line electrocuted 
Kevin C. Maher. 
</P>
<P>
 The line was dangling over a car with a young child inside; the distraught 
mother stood nearby. Maher, a 25-year-old electrician who grew up in Ireland, 
ran back to his apartment for tools. He ignored the warnings of others at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were yelling at him, 'No! Don't touch it!' " said James Pianezzola, 
30, who saw the whole thing. "He turned around and said, 'Don't worry, I'm an 
electrician.' But as soon as he touched the line, his body went stiff as a 
board." (The child was snatched from the car by another onlooker.) 
</P>
<P>
 Maher, who was from Carrick-on-Shannon and never lost his brogue after 10 
years in the U.S., was hailed as a hero in Ireland, his death making the front 
pages of the dailies back home. In the San Fernando Valley, his friends 
recalled him as a generous man who died doing what he always did. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone needed help, Kevin was the first to offer," said Paula Shields, a 
friend who lived in the same apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Maher's social life revolved around Ireland's 32, a gathering spot for Irish 
expatriates in the Valley. The Van Nuys pub is where his friends gather now to 
mourn his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Irish community always comes together when something like this happens," 
said Kathleen Harney, Maher's sister. "We're all far away from home so we stick 
close together out here." MARC YOBS and KAREN OSTERHOLT: Couple Labored Hard to 
Earn Their House on the Hillside 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Yobs was going places. Just ask anyone who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 32 and on top of his game. Good-looking, with a caring way and easy 
grin, he had accomplished the nearly impossible early in his career, getting a 
foot in the door into Hollywood with nary a connection. Now, he was handling 
some of the industry's biggest accounts for The Post Group, which does sound 
and special effects for film. His bosses had recently promoted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of phoniness and glad-handing in Hollywood," said Kristen 
Ralph, the company president. "Marc never had that kind of self-opinion. He was 
confident, and very bright, and quite sure of his own abilities. But he was not 
one of the let's-do-lunch types." 
</P>
<P>
 He liked fine things -- especially cars -- and he was able to afford them. He 
owned a Porsche, and he drove it too fast, often joking that he was going to 
die young. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Yobs bought the house of his dreams: a $400,000 hillside home 
in Sherman Oaks, with a sweeping view of the San Fernando Valley, where he grew 
up. He shared it with Karen Osterholt, 30, his girlfriend of nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 His older brother, Dave, was the real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I'm just going to show you a hillside home, just so you can 
compare,' " Dave Yobs recalled. "They walked in and they absolutely fell in 
love with that house." 
</P>
<P>
 The place was a showpiece. Yobs was meticulous about maintaining it, as he was 
about everything else in his life. Osterholt had a flair for decorating, and 
she filled it with antiques. If he was the go-getter, she was the quiet power 
behind him. She was with him when he had nothing, supporting him with her 
earnings as a waitress while he struggled to climb the Hollywood ladder. He 
hated shopping, but Osterholt -- who had recently taken a job as a receptionist 
at Mark Goodson Productions -- made sure he was dressed for success. They never 
set a wedding date, but might as well have been married. 
</P>
<P>
 "They balanced each other out," said her mother, Eileen Waldrop. "They loved 
their home, and they liked being together by themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The house made Waldrop nervous, no matter how many times her daughter assured 
her it was safe. It was 30 years old and had survived both the Sylmar and the 
Whittier Narrows quakes. But fears of a temblor must have passed through Yobs' 
mind, because a year ago he bought earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 seconds, it came crashing down, taking them with it. They were to be 
buried side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing left of the Sherwood Place house. It is a pile of twisted 
metal and wood. The homes to the right and left, built at the same time, by the 
same builder, according to Dave Yobs, are still standing. Uninhabitable, but 
standing. "Why his house?" Dave Yobs said tearfully. "With all those homes, why 
his?" ROBERT PAULINE and JUDITH NG: 'If There Is a Bright Spot . . . It's That 
They Went Together' 
</P>
<P>
 When they met at Riverside City College in the early 1970s, Robert (Sarge) 
Pauline had just retired from a 20-year career with the Chula Vista Police 
Department. Judith Ng, 30 years younger, was just out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple married, beginning an eccentric life together. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning the whole family was against the situation," said one of 
Ng's brothers, Kenneth. "We thought: 'What was this old guy doing with our 
sister?' But over the years, we've come to love him like family. It was unique 
but it was right for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple squirreled themselves away in their Van Nuys home, inviting neither 
friends nor family inside. In this neat suburban neighborhood, they had shrubs 
and vines shielding their house from the street. Inside, their living quarters 
were unconventional as well. 
</P>
<P>
 They were avid collectors. Everywhere, there were stacks of old letters, 
out-of-date calendars, model trains, stereo equipment and cameras. A narrow 
pathway allowed them to move around the ceiling-high clutter, said a relative 
who went in after the disaster struck. 
</P>
<P>
 When the earthquake hit, neighbors and relatives became concerned about the 
mysterious pair. Their house survived but there was no word from Ng, 42, or 
Pauline, 72. The next day, authorities entered their Kittridge Street home and 
discovered the couple in bed, crushed by hundreds of pounds of their own 
collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a bright spot to this," said Ng's sister, Kathy Ng Norwood, "it's 
that they went together."

COORDINATION OF RELIEF BECOMES DAUNTING TASK; CHARITY: A PLETHORA OF GROUPS 
CONTRIBUTE. BUT MANY VICTIMS SAY THEY HAVE SEEN LITTLE EVIDENCE OF THE EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nearly a thousand Bright Star flashlights are headed by truck from snowbound 
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., to earthquake-devastated Los Angeles. Gerber is donating 
5,000 cases of baby food. Sparkletts, Anheuser Busch and Miller Brewing are 
giving away purified water. Kawasaki is providing eight large generators. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein, accompanied by National Guard troops armed with M-16 
assault rifles, distributed hundreds of donated supermarket loaves of bread to 
newly homeless persons camped out on a Canoga Park softball field. The city 
government in Berlin, Germany, raised $60,000. The queen of Jordan called to 
lend assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-mile convoy of trucks loaded with goods ranging from diapers to pet food 
was en route Saturday to Los Angeles, after a relief drive at San Diego's Jack 
Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's earthquake has clearly spawned an outpouring of much-needed and 
much-appreciated assistance. Beyond the immediate aid, some see an opportunity 
for long-term economic benefit to depressed communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, many victims -- including dozens of families who camped out in 
MacArthur Park in recent days -- say they have seen little evidence of the vast 
relief effort. "We're on our own out here," said Isidro Alfaro, staying in the 
park with his wife and daughter after their apartment was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, responses to such disasters inevitably fail to reach everyone, 
particularly at the beginning. The job of linking donations to those who need 
help is a complicated one at best. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still trying to get through the basic stuff, and help all the people 
who aren't getting help," said Peggy Brutsche, a Red Cross official. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief workers point out that they are still identifying earthquake-related 
problems in Los Angeles' far-flung and diverse communities. "Each day the needs 
become greater and greater," said Susan Weight of Catholic Charities of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There also has emerged some of the now-familiar tension between 
community-based activist groups and large, traditional relief agencies with 
their strong links to corporate America and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see a systemic shortcoming in post-disaster relief efforts: Most 
large-scale corporate gifts are directed to venerable aid organizations, 
especially the Red Cross and the Salvation Army. While extremely capable, 
activists say, such national organizations lack the grass-roots contacts of Los 
Angeles' many nonprofit community-based groups, which are largely out of the 
corporate disaster aid loop. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these big organizations, like the Red Cross and so forth, are 
getting a lot of money, and they need it, but agencies like ours are also in 
need," said Marianne Haver Hill, executive director of Meet Each Need With 
Dignity, a Pacoima-based social service agency whose headquarters remains 
closed because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Lovato, executive director of the Central American Resource Center, 
said: "There's a severe service gap here." 
</P>
<P>
 Community representatives said their comments are not meant as criticism of 
the Red Cross, which, all agree, has been quick to respond, providing shelter 
to more than 6,100 people and serving more than 60,000 meals as of Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many suggest that the Red Cross -- severely criticized following the 
1989 Loma Prieta quake for its initial plans to use donations outside of 
northern California -- should directly assist recognized community-based 
groups, many battered by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to pressure from San Franciso Mayor Art Agnos and others, the Red 
Cross backed off from the plan to divert excess funds and agreed to keep all 
$54 million collected after the 1989 earthquake in the Bay Area, marking a 
departure in policy. Half of the funds were spent on longer-term community 
projects, some in conjunction with area nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Red Cross officials have pledged not to divert out of the area 
money earmarked for earthquake relief in Los Angeles. Moreover, many activists 
are encouraging donors to seek out grass-roots organizations badly in need of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been urging corporations not to put all their eggs in one basket," said 
Richard Walden, president of Operation USA, a Los Angeles disaster-relief 
organization. "The corporations tend to give $100,000 to the Red Cross and then 
say, 'Goodby.' It's easier for them to do that, but it's not taking a very 
broad view of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Walden and others see the possibility of marshaling the great 
welter of support for long-term projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a community that's been stricken by three major disasters in the past two 
years, we have a great opportunity to plan and evolve as a result of this 
crisis, rather than merely responding in a reactive manner," said Cynthia 
Robbins, who directs urban recovery programs for Public Counsel, a nonprofit 
legal advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials say they are eager to work with community groups. But, 
they add, the initial emphasis has necessarily been placed on setting up 
shelters, feeding centers and other essential facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community groups are close to the people, and they're very aware of 
cultural and language issues," said Brutsche of the Red Cross. "We want to 
collaborate with them." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that the Northridge quake has prompted a rush to assist 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corporate America seems to have a disaster consciousness," said Stephanie 
Mayer, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Washington. And so do ordinary citizens, who 
had donated more than $2 million to the Red Cross alone through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the major contributors: Aetna, American Express, Anheuser Busch, Arco, 
Bank of America, Bank of California, Coca-Cola, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, First 
Interstate Bank, Ford, The Gap, GTE, IBM, VNMK-Mart, Matsushita, McDonald's, 
Mobil, Pacific Telephone, Sakura Bank Ltd., Shell Oil, Times Mirror, Unocal, 
Wal-Mart, Wells Fargo and numerous others. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Friday, Red Cross officials said they had received $2.3 million in 
corporate contributions, bringing the total to $4.3 million. The United Way of 
Los Angeles said it had received about $500,000 in corporate contributions. The 
Salvation Army said it could not provide figures yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross and other organizations have mobilized thousands of volunteers, 
setting up dozens of shelters throughout the region and providing water and 
daily meals to thousands. Churches, private companies and individuals, such as 
a Redondo Beach couple who showed up at the Winnetka Recreation Center on 
Saturday with $250 worth of food, diapers and other needed items, also have 
given direct support. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines is flying in purified water from Oakland. Western Union is 
offering no-fee money transfers to quake-battered areas. AT&T has donated 
cellular telephones and provided free long-distance service. Spanish-language 
station KLAX in Los Angeles has dispatched its popular on-air personalities 
with supplies donated by listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennison's Chili provided 115,000 servings of its famous chili with beans. 
Nissin Foods is donating 100,000 meals of Top Ramen instant noodles. 
LensCrafters, an Ohio-based concern, is giving eyeglasses to those who lost 
their spectacles. Ocean Isle Software, a Florida firm, is offering remote 
control equipment to allow computer users to stay home and thus reduce traffic 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army provided 3,000 tents and 15 mobile kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Direct Relief International, a Santa Barbara-based disaster aid organization, 
has distributed more than 1,000 pounds of bandages, hundreds of suture packs, 
other medical supplies, and a mobile health van to Ventura County, where a 
regional clinic in Fillmore shut down because of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 World Vision, a Monrovia-based Christian aid group, is providing assistance to 
damaged churches, many of which double as social service agencies. 
(Constitutional restrictions on church-state relations prohibit direct federal 
assistance to repair damaged sanctuaries.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you are looking at institutions that provide a broad range of service -- 
literacy training, dropout prevention, food, emergency shelter -- and they are 
now being overloaded and finding the future for their operations very cloudy," 
said James Sanchez, World Vision's manager of disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Charities of Los Angeles is distributing baby food, diapers, infant 
formula, bottled water, juice, blankets and sleeping bags throughout hard-hit 
areas. "I've worked a lot of disasters, but I've never worked one like this," 
said Weight of Catholic Charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles is providing food, legal 
assistance and psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope of necessity has presented logistic challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bright Star Industries in Pennsylvania had 1,000 flashlights on hand, 
the company lacked the needed batteries. Consequently, Walden of Operation USA 
said he was looking for 2,000 size D batteries to complete the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like Sgt. Bilko," Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Red Cross nerve center on Wilshire Boulevard, Bruce P. Gustafson, the 
chapter's director of gifts, endeavors to fill vital needs unmet by even an 
extraordinarily broad array of donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still trying to find 12 catering trucks," said Gustafson. "We're going 
to need a lot of propane . . . We're looking for a courier service." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the magnitude of the relief effort, though, many in need have slipped 
through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 1,000 people, mostly recent immigrants, were reported last week to 
be on the streets of Pico-Union and other inner-city Los Angeles neighborhoods. 
Most fear returning to damaged apartment houses. Relatively few have benefited 
from the relief efforts evident elsewhere, activists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's 1,000 people on the streets here, and until last night (Thursday) 
they had not seen a dime of the millions or so in dollars that had come in," 
said Lovato of the Central American Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Friday afternoon, said Father Tom Rush, pastor of Mary Immaculate 
Catholic Church in Pacoima, there was a "big gap" in service to the heavily 
Latino area of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of people living on the streets; there's a need for 
something closer to the people here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Valley and in other affected regions, community groups who work 
primarily on behalf of the region's poorest residents suffered extensive 
damage. There has been a paucity of repair money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many nonprofit organizations have taken a double hit," said Jack Shakely, 
director of the California Community Foundation, one of the area's principal 
philanthropic organizations. "They are being inundated with new clients, while 
trying to operate in buildings that have been damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at least nine neighborhood clinics were shut down because of 
structural problems or staff unavailability. 
</P>
<P>
 One facility, El Projecto del Barrio in Pacoima, obtained a mobile medical van 
needed because its clinic had to close its doors after suffering building 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 T.H.E. Clinic, which treats more than 20,000 patients a year in South-Central 
Los Angeles, curtailed service after sustaining damage to its telephone system, 
computers, medical equipment and ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake forced VOICE, the San Fernando Valley-based interdenominational 
activist group, to postpone a fund raiser aimed at helping youths find 
alternatives to gangs and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the kind of community-based organizations, activists say, that 
desperately need direct assistance -- be it from companies, foundations or 
other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies, such as Wells Fargo, have already reached out. The bank has 
offered to provide grants of up to $2,500 to neighborhood groups that have 
suffered damage or are experiencing increased demands for service. "People in 
the area know best what is worthy," noted Kathleen Shilkret, a bank 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood organizations, many desperate for emergency funding, say they are 
eagerly awaiting calls from the Red Cross and others with resources to spread 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in touch with a number of potential donors, but we probably won't 
see them until next week," said Haver Hill of MEND, the Pacoima-based social 
service outlet whose meal program and medical services were disrupted by the 
quake. "Our whole medical program is trashed. We have people coming up to us, 
saying their babies are sick and literally asking us what can we do for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, representatives of area foundations -- including Arco, Irvine, 
California Community, Ahmanson, Parsons and Welk -- met to discuss their role. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, activists say, the funding decisions being made now will determine 
whether donated money will effectively reach down to the grass-roots level. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aid is good, but it needs to be channeled in a way so that communities 
are taken into consideration -- not in a paternalistic manner," said Mario 
Salgado, an Oakland attorney who worked with earthquake victims following the 
1989 quake. "There's an issue of economic development of these communities that 
could be taken advantage of at this time when money is coming in . . . There's 
actually an opportunity here."

SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AMONG DISASTER'S NEW BEDFELLOWS; SHELTERS: THOUSANDS GET 
FITFUL MOMENTS OF REST PUNCTURED BY SNORING AND BABIES' CRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One woman dubbed it the "Cot Concerto," a grating chorus of squeaks -- 
something like rubbing two balloons together -- that fills the shelter in the 
night's small hours as hundreds of bodies shift and roll on thin 
metal-and-nylon beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Also amplified through the dark, chilly Van Nuys High School gym -- last week 
"Home of the Wolves," this week home of the newly homeless -- are piercing 
wails of infants in misery, the unnerving echo of neighbors' coughing and 
sneezing. 
</P>
<P>
 But there also is the reassuring shuffle of silhouetted guardian angels -- the 
Red Cross volunteers and nurses who float through the narrow aisles bringing a 
comforting word, an extra set of cradling arms, a small beam of light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wake up in the night, maybe four times, and they are there," said 
13-year-old Kristin Chamakyan, who stirred at 5 a.m. and stood at the entryway 
of the cavernous hall, taking some fresh air. "I say: 'Am I dreaming?' And they 
say, 'Do you need water, or juice or something.' I feel very safe here." 
</P>
<P>
 A night spent at the gym Friday in the shoulder-to-shoulder confines of a 
major quake shelter offered a taste of the strain of human compression and the 
salve of human compassion being repeated at dozens of emergency housing sites 
across the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of displaced Angelenos are being urged to move to such facilities. 
It is here that many odd bedfellows of disaster -- blue-collar immigrants, 
older people and the disabled who have lost a tenuous grip on affordable 
housing -- have been marooned and must try to fit into the close-quarter rhythm 
of total strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all emphasize their gratitude to the volunteers, and many say the 
shelter is infinitely better than the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 But shelters also take a toll. "The privacy thing? There is none," said Della 
Hindan, 36, who is scheduled to deliver her second child Monday and was 
spending her fourth night at "Casa Van Nuys," as one relief worker called it. 
Bleary-eyed, 48-year-old Ibtissam Ramadam, stranded at the shelter with her 
family since Monday, said achingly, "I can't sleep. The noise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 8 p.m., the Van Nuys High main gym -- one of two emergency shelters 
operating on the campus, along with an unofficial tent city of about 100 people 
in the parking lot -- is abuzz with activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The nightly showing of a Walt Disney film in an adjacent room has ended, and 
children are everywhere -- dancing, running, hitting balloons into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whose child is this?" shouts volunteer shelter worker Rob Mills, hoisting up 
a wayward toddler who is quickly snatched by the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Hindan, the expectant mother, and her husband have fled their North Hollywood 
apartment which has no utilities. Through the luck of the draw, they are close 
neighbors of a woman with four active young boys who have decided to wrestle on 
the cots next to the pregnant woman's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do get out of hand," she said. "But I know those little Buster Browns 
have got to play. Thank God, she puts them down early." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching the lights out point is a major milestone. Officially, it's 10 p.m., 
but in reality "it's as soon as we can," said Harlow Johnson, a retired 
Claremont engineer who was wrapping up a shift as volunteer manager of the 
center. "Last night we got them out at 11." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight will be better. "Good night . . . buenas noches, " Red Cross workers 
call out as the lights dim at 10:38. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, even before the ambient rustling and shifting has begun to 
quiet down, a heavyset man against the wall has broken into a stunningly loud 
and anguished-sounding snore. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearby man quietly rises to summon help, apparently sincerely concerned that 
something must be wrong. Volunteer Red Cross nurse Anita Rose wakes the man, 
who apologizes and says doctors have said it's just his normal snore. 
</P>
<P>
 Achieving anything close to quiet, at least for more than a few minutes, is 
nearly impossible. The irritating, stretching sound of bodies shifting on the 
nylon cots seems to come in waves. Someone will roll over, letting out a 
resonating squeak. That wakes a neighbor who also shifts, and soon there is a 
chain reaction of squeaks skipping back and forth across the gym. "Near me it's 
a very loud noise," said Ramadam's husband, Robin Abdul, who after hours of 
tossing and turning was up and in the lobby at 3 a.m. for a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Through the night, the lobby serves as a refuge for the restless, the 
troubled, the insomniacs. "We've got little night owls. . . . There's always 
someone who wants to talk," said Sandy Rizowsky, the graveyard shift volunteer 
shelter manager, surveying the small sea of bodies under her charge. "So we 
just have little round-table talks." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the 27-year Girl Scout in her that makes her to do this, says Rizowsky, 
an Ontario purchasing agent who has been juggling her work, a family and the 
nighttime shelter duties. 
</P>
<P>
 This night will see a parade of lobby visitors, talking about everything and 
nothing. Among those in and out several times are three older women, whose 
senior citizen apartment complex was damaged. "It's always better in daylight," 
said 81-year-old Alice DeFreitas who was lingering in the lobby about 3 a.m. "I 
woke up about an hour ago hoping daylight will come." 
</P>
<P>
 She worried about the coughing, which seems to be increasing each night. "If 
we get a flu going around here, that's all we'll need," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's usually around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., said Rose and the other overnight 
volunteer nurse, Patti Marks, that they get "The Cry." The babies -- there must 
be at least two dozen, some as young as a few months -- all seem to wake up 
crying and hungry about the same time. And tonight they're pretty much on 
schedule. The nurses, when not treating stress and stomach ailments, try to 
rock the babies so the weary mothers can get some sleep, and the disturbance to 
others is at least reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the fun things we get to do," Marks said with no hint of 
sarcasm, as she bounced a cranky, runny-nosed 11-month-old named Fernando. 
Soon, Rose's and Rizowsky's arms also would be full, and other mothers would 
come and go from the locker-room nurse's station lending a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a few relatively calm hours, except for a toddler who rolled with a thud 
off a cot, and the man against the wall whose stem-winding snores have drawn 
the nurses back twice more, dawn is approaching. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first light breaks over the trees in the outside courtyard, DeFreitas 
says: "Dawn is pretty isn't it? Maybe it will be a peaceful day."

NO LETUP IN TRADE PRESSURE ON TOKYO, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY; ASIA: WASHINGTON 
DOESN'T SEE JAPAN'S RECESSION AS REASON TO BACK OFF. SUMMIT RUN-UP LIKELY TO BE 
TENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A few weeks ago, one of the Clinton Administration's senior policy-makers 
recalled with annoyance the time last year when Japan argued that its airlines 
were too economically fragile to permit new competition from American carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we've had bankruptcies, restructuring, a real shakeout in our own 
airline industry," the U.S. official said. "Now that we're lean and mean, they 
can't keep us out. Japan can't say we're too good and ban us from their market. 
What if we'd said that to Toyota and Datsun in the 1960s?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was just a casual remark, but it illustrated the changing dynamics between 
the United States and Japan. And it demonstrated why the relationship between 
the two countries seems headed for a period of considerable tension as 
President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa prepare for a 
summit next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The American economy is strengthening, while Japan's remains in deep 
recession. The best-selling car in America is a Ford, not a Honda. For the 
first time since Harvard professor Ezra F. Vogel published his 1979 bestseller, 
"Japan as Number One," the perception is taking hold in America that the 
Japanese economy might be downright mortal. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean the United States will ease the pressure for Japan to bring 
down its huge trade surplus with the rest of the world? 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely not, answer Administration officials. In a series of recent 
interviews, top U.S. officials made it plain that despite Japan's recession -- 
or indeed, in some ways because of it -- the United States intends to mount an 
intensive new drive for Japan to open up its markets to foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic economic facts of the world haven't changed because we're up and 
they're down," said W. Bowman Cutter, deputy director of the National Economic 
Council. "The fundamental fact is that the Japanese economy has not been as 
open as the U.S. or European economies." 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks underscored another important way in which Washington's policy 
toward Japan is changing. In the past, members of Congress like Majority Leader 
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) led the way in pressing for tough trade measures 
with Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, under the Clinton Administration, Congress is relatively quiet and the 
executive branch is leading the charge. Today, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
will meet with Hosokawa in Tokyo to discuss transpacific trade problems in 
advance of next month's summit. Clinton took office a year ago with a pledge to 
end or radically reduce the American trade imbalance with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledge that the President decided to back off 
last July while elections were pending in Japan. And he continued to avoid 
confrontation in the summer and fall after Hosokawa took over as the first 
prime minister in nearly four decades from outside Japan's Liberal Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's campaign to revamp Japanese politics suffered a severe blow on 
Friday when lawmakers voted down his package of reforms, and some observers 
said the prime minister might even be a lame duck when he faces Clinton in 
Washington -- if the summit goes ahead as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the American trade deficit with Japan still running at $50 billion to 
$60 billion a year, Administration officials realize they need to make headway 
with Tokyo quickly -- or face the prospect that the President will be 
criticized in the 1996 election for having failed in his Japan policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutter and other top U.S. officials argue that the Administration has already 
given more than enough time and breathing room to Hosokawa's coalition 
government. "We have to tell Hosokawa, 'We laid low, we gave you a few months, 
we held back. You have to come through at this point,' " another senior U.S. 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, it appears Washington and Tokyo have such vastly different 
expectations of one another that they are on a collision course. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been suggestions that, during their meeting scheduled for Feb. 11, 
Hosokawa may ask Clinton to help ease Japan's recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoichi Funabashi, Washington bureau chief for Tokyo's Asahi Shimbun, said 
recently that the Hosokawa government may seek temporary depreciation of the 
yen so Japanese companies can have "better confidence for the future." Such a 
change in the exchange rates would make Japanese exports to this country 
cheaper and U.S. exports to Japan more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials scoff at that idea, noting that there are some in 
Washington who believe the yen should be pushed to even higher levels. And more 
broadly, they reject the principle that the Administration should ease its 
trade policies to help Japan climb out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the midst of the (American) recessions of 1979, 1982 and 1989, we kept our 
markets open," Cutter said. "We lost manufacturing jobs, and Japanese industry 
gained. . . . We're not asking the Japanese to do anything we haven't done." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Japanese officials regularly insist that their economy is 
already open -- although last August, Hiroshi Kumagai, Hosokawa's trade 
minister, acknowledged that "Japanese markets are extremely closed in invisible 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials contend that the proof is in the results: Japan still 
imports far fewer manufactured goods -- when measured against the country's 
gross national product -- than any of the world's other leading industrialized 
democracies. And Japan's trade surplus, both with the United States and the 
world as a whole, remains huge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the American view, the recession in Japan has altered the dynamics of the 
negotiations between Washington and Tokyo in a number of ways. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Administration officials say the slump has inevitably increased 
protectionist pressures in Japan. "This is the scariest downturn they've had 
since the end of the war," Cutter said. "We're running into extraordinary 
resistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the recession has heightened fears in Washington that without some 
dramatic changes in policy from Tokyo, the American trade deficit with Japan 
may widen still further. Because of the downturn, Japanese consumers can be 
expected to buy fewer goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, Japan's recession appears to have touched off a new sense of resentment 
in Washington about Japan's restricted markets. Administration officials argue 
that the United States has already withstood economic pain and dislocation and 
that Japan should be prepared to do so too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese companies had unfettered access to our markets to beat the 
(expletive) out of us for years," said one senior Administration official. 
"Other countries have accepted the pain of adjustment. . . . In some sense, 
Japan forced us to get lean and mean in many sectors." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the recession has prompted the Administration to argue that opening 
markets and stimulating greater consumption would be in Japan's own interest. 
"Because the economy is weak, 100 yen ought to buy as much as possible," one 
White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutter said he felt officials in Tokyo could end the practice by which 
Japanese companies charge higher prices for goods at home than they do 
overseas. "They can do what we did in America from 1945 to 1955, which is to 
feed consumer demand. They could do that and still come out of this with a 
savings rate which is 50% higher than ours." 
</P>
<P>
 The strengthened American economy would appear to give the United States 
greater leverage than before in dealing with Tokyo. But some American critics 
believe the Administration policy is doomed to failure because Japan has no 
intention of changing the way it does business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese are playing hardball economic warfare, and the people in 
Washington aren't prepared for it," said UC San Diego professor Chalmers 
Johnson. "Hosokawa is giving the illusion of change. But the truth is that the 
Japanese are buying time." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson argued that Japan's long-term strategy is to integrate its economy 
with the rest of Asia, buying low-technology goods from its neighbors and 
feeding the fast-growing demand in places like China and Southeast Asia. "The 
Americans don't have the same leverage as in the past," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration policy, however, remains based on the premise that Japan can 
and will change. "Our goal is a Japan that is truly integrated into the world 
economy," one senior U.S. official said. "We want a Japanese economy that 
responds like a normal economy -- so that, for example, if the exchange rates 
go down, people in Japan buy more imports." 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if the Administration fails, and Japan's economy doesn't change 
in the way that Clinton and his aides are hoping? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we will suddenly declare economic warfare," Cutter said. "But 
the current direction (of economic relations) has been corrosive, and it will 
get more so." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it would be hard to build an anti-Japanese groundswell in the 
consumer sector here," another Administration official said. "Our population 
believes Japan doesn't play by the same rules. Our corporations are tired of 
it."

QUAKE RELIEF EFFORT PICKS UP; U.S. PROMISES $283 MILLION MORE AID TO L.A.; 
DISASTER: NUMBER STILL NEEDING SHELTER DROPS AS MORE TENT CITIES ARE IN PLACE. 
OFFICIALS CONCEDE THEY UNDERESTIMATED IMPACT. MEANWHILE, CALTRANS MAY INSTALL

<P>
 With a reprieve in the weather and a break from unnerving aftershocks, relief 
and repair efforts accelerated Saturday as tent cities sprang up across the San 
Fernando Valley and the White House promised an additional $283 million in 
federal earthquake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials preparing for next week's expected commuter crush also said they are 
considering whether to erect temporary two-lane bridges over gaps in the Simi 
Valley and Santa Monica Freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after the Los Angeles area was rocked by a 6.6 magnitude quake, the 
developments reflect improved delivery of relief services and recognition that 
the efforts, though sizable, have not been enough to cope with what looms as 
one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us realized the magnitude of it all," said James Lee 
Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 With a one-day reprieve from expected rains, the region began the weekend with 
no major aftershocks, no rise in the death toll of 55 from Monday's magnitude 
6.6 quake, and word that the number of those sleeping in parks and on the 
streets had decreased by thousands -- a sign, perhaps, that those who could 
return to their homes were doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 And amid scenes of tent encampments and rubble-strewn sidewalks were a few 
signs of life getting back to normal -- including joggers taking to the parks 
and streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were plenty of distressing quake-related statistics amid other 
developments: 
</P>
<P>
 *The number of structures declared uninhabitable in the city climbed to more 
than 1,600, encompassing 7,421 housing units. Damage to those buildings reached 
$460 million -- a figure that will grow considerably since building inspectors 
expect to be assessing damage at least for another week. 
</P>
<P>
 *In the city of Santa Clarita, more than 1,600 private and public structures 
were damaged by the quake, and estimated damage costs reached $127.8 million, 
city officials said. More than 120 buildings had been declared uninhabitable or 
were open only for occupants to gather belongings -- but these numbers, too, 
were expected to rise in the days to come. 
</P>
<P>
 *Estimates of those still sleeping outside in parks and vacant lots dropped to 
9,000, compared to 14,500 on Friday. The unseasonably warm weather held on 
Saturday, but there was a 60% chance of some rain by tonight when temperatures 
could fall to the low 40s. With rain possible, officials were hurrying to open 
more tent cities, particularly in the quake-ravaged valley. 
</P>
<P>
 *The Los Angeles Unified School District planned to reopen most schools 
Tuesday. Of 30,000 classrooms, just 300 remained unsafe, virtually all of them 
in the hard-hit West Valley. School Board President Leticia Quezada said: "My 
hope is that all children will be able to attend school one way or another" 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 *About 10,000 households in the northwest San Fernando Valley, mostly in 
Northridge and Granada Hills, were still without running water Saturday. There 
were up to 4,000 waterless households in the Santa Clarita Valley, officials 
there said. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Gas Co. officials said they have restored service to some 
40,000 homes as part of continuing door-to-door sweeps and have identified at 
least that many more that are still without gas. They also urged customers to 
shut off gas to any appliances that shifted during the temblor and to avoid 
shutting off gas to the whole house unless there is a gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
 *At an afternoon briefing at Caltech, officials said the aftershock frequency 
was decreasing. After four aftershocks of magnitude 4 to 4.6 hit Friday in a 
20-minute span, only four tremors -- all magnitude 3.0 or less -- were recorded 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 *In Los Angeles, officials announced new plans to open seven more emergency 
assistance shelters by Monday, bringing the total to 20. Gov. Pete Wilson 
confirmed that state workers beginning Sunday will assist FEMA in manning 
disaster centers, where quake victims have faced huge lines and long delays in 
being served. RECOVERY: 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by increasing criticism of red tape, officials defended their relief 
efforts, proclaiming that they are setting up the largest assistance program in 
U.S. history to deal with the most damaging earthquake ever centered in a large 
American city -- one where the state has roughly estimated damages could exceed 
$30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now dealing with the largest mass assistance of people in an urban 
area in the history of the United States," said Henry Cisneros, secretary of 
federal Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $283 million in new money released Saturday, White House Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers said $140 million will be for Small Business 
Administration loans and the other $143 million for a range of Federal 
Emergency Management Agency activities, including individual grants for 
emergency housing and repair of damaged public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting Saturday's funds, the Clinton Administration said it has provided 
$639 million for SBA loans, $41 million for emergency highway repairs, $143 
million in new FEMA funds and has speeded up delivery of other federal monies. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Cisneros defended the relief effort at a news conference along 
with Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of Emergency Services, 
FEMA's Witt, and Art Agnos, who was mayor of San Francisco when the disastrous 
Loma Prieta quake struck in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "This earthquake is at least twice as bad and the response of the state and 
federal government has been twice as fast," Agnos said. "In 1989, I never saw 
the FEMA director until a week later on Larry King Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, FEMA's Dick Krimm said the federal government is mindful of how much 
the state-and particularly Southern California -- has endured the past two 
years in riots, floods, fires and quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last couple years, we have spent billions of dollars in California," 
Krimm said. "Good lord, we are very, very sensitive to the disasters of 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake victims have expressed increasing anger over long lines for relief 
applications and over the inability of officials to offer tangible aid such as 
funds for emergency housing and rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 But disaster officials said they are increasing relief workers and centers, 
streamlining the application process for aid and sending "outreach" workers to 
take relief applications wherever victims congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews of the state emergency services agency maintained that disaster 
workers had reduced the number of quake victims living in parks from 14,000 
immediately after the quake to 3,900 by sending outreach workers to talk the 
campers into going to shelters and relief centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that figure was disputed by city Recreation and Parks Director Jackie 
Tatum who said 9,000 quake victims were still camped in parks Friday night. 
TENT CITIES: 
</P>
<P>
 The National Guard set up tent cities throughout the valley Friday night and 
Saturday, hoping to provide shelter for the newly homeless.  
</P>
<P>
 Under bright sunshine, about 150 sweating young men in Army uniforms hauled 
canvas out of the backs of trucks, pulled on ropes and drove in stakes with 
sledgehammer-sized wooden mallets at the Winnetka Recreation Center, where 
hundreds of people, mostly low-income Latinos have been camping out all week. 
</P>
<P>
 By evening, officials expected the center would be home to upwards of 1,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Guardsmen erected two sizes of olive drab tents and brought in 400-gallon 
water tank trailers called "water buffaloes." The large tents can house 30-35 
people and the smaller ones can house 20-25 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say their homes are fine but they're scared to go home," said 
Guard Lt. Bill Lemna, 27, a Lodi food executive. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lanark Park in Canoga Park, another of the tent camps, Spanish-speaking 
staff of county Supervisor Gloria Molina took families one at a time to their 
apartments near the park and interpreted the opinions of building inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Ortuno, 28, and his wife, Rosa Munoz, 33, stood in the bedroom of 
their second-floor apartment and heard assurances that the cracks above their 
bed were cosmetic. They walked outside, past the green tag that declared their 
building safe, and joined an estimated 750 refugees in canvas tents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when we have one day without temblors, we'll come back," Ortuno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guardsmen also pitched tents Saturday at the Valley Plaza Recreation Center in 
North Hollywood, and police said they would order quake refugees to use the 
tents if they planned to remain in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing this for security and sanitation reasons," said Los Angeles 
police Sgt. George Armenta. "We're just looking after the welfare of the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Saturday afternoon, a rumor spread that immigration officials would 
come to the park in a few days to round up illegal immigrants. Police and 
National Guard officials said they did not believe the rumor to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantino Jaime, who said he is afraid to return to his apartment at 
Lankershim and Victory boulevards, has been sleeping in his car since Monday. 
He said he and his wife and six-month-old daughter would probably stay in a 
tent instead of a shelter because he prefers to stay outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are out here for the baby," he said. "We've been back to the apartment to 
get clothes and other things, but no one is there so we are afraid to return." 
PRICE-GOUGING WARNING: 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County officials were vowing to enforce an emergency ordinance 
barring merchants and contractors from raising prices more than 10% above 
pre-disaster levels. The new price-gouging law -- similar to one already in 
force in the city of Los Angeles -- was passed Friday by county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those convicted of jacking up prices face penalties of up to six months in 
jail and a $1,000 fine, according to Los Angeles County sheriff's Dep. Angie 
McLaughlin, who said citizens could report suspected price-gouging at their 
local sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials announced Friday that they had cited about 100 San Fernando 
Valley merchants who were targets of price-gouging complaints under the city 
ordinance passed after the 1992 riots. City officials were taking complaints on 
a price-gouging hot line, (800) 897 6677. 
</P>
<P>
 There were several reports Saturday of Valley plumbing supply stores and even 
scalpers on foot charging $20 or more for strands of flexible pipe for water 
heaters that ordinarily cost $6 to $8. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Southland Corp. -- who Friday said they would terminate the 
franchises of eight 7-Eleven Store operators in the San Fernando Valley for 
price-gouging -- joined in earthquake relief efforts and image repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said they sent employees to a food giveaway in Pacoima with 
milk, toilet paper, juice and milk, and a banner proclaiming: "Don't let one 
bad apple spoil 7-Eleven image." RELIEF EFFORTS GROW: 
</P>
<P>
 Other businesses and government agencies joined in relief efforts, including 
the Los Angeles County Fire Department, which began distributing free plastic 
sheeting and nails to Santa Clarita Valley residents to protect damaged 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain is going to be the next major situation out here," said county fire 
inspector Mark Savage, adding that the sheeting will be available at all seven 
county fire stations in the Santa Clarita Valley from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. for the 
next several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Other help took the form of individual acts of kindness. Andrea and Neal Geyer 
of Agoura couldn't stand sitting in their lightly damaged home, watching their 
children eat warm oatmeal and watch Barney on TV, while earthquake victims 
slept outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 They took their old baby clothes, salsa, baby food and formula from nearby 
stores, and drove to Winnetka Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple wheeled a shopping cart through the park and with a mixture of 
broken Spanish and English matched what they had with what people needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just doing what we can," said Neal Geyer, whose leather business was 
trashed in the quake. "It's totally Third World. When you see it on television, 
that's exactly what it looks like--the Third World." 
</P>
<P>
 Others showed up to lend a helping hand, including Jake Jaroszewski, 37, an 
employee of Baxter Health Care, who drove up with a truckload of donated goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Tony Jett of the Los Angeles Police Department stood beside the truck 
and shook his head in wonderment. "Trucks are driving up with all kinds of 
stuff -- food, clothing, water, all the necessities. It's so positive it's 
unbelievable, people coming together to help other people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, a large yellow van drove up and out jumped Jay Lenhoff, 37, 
director of operations for the Tony Roma's restaurant chain. The rear of the 
truck swung open and a team of Roma's volunteers began unloading tables, 
portable barbeques, crates of chicken, beans, cole slaw and soda pop. "We've 
got enough food here for 2,000 people," Lenhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lanark Park, officials were all but overwhelmed by a bumper crop of relief 
supplies, and tried to divert donors to other parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have out-of-control Good Samaritans," said Larry Mellon, of the city 
Department of Recreation and Parks. ROADS: 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful that nothing else can return to normal if Los Angeles' roads are in 
ruin, transportation officials said considering the possibility of erecting 
temporary bridges on two crippled freeways critical to the region -- the Simi 
Valley and the Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeshift structures would allow a partial flow of motorists on one side 
of the roadway while workers constructed the permanent structure on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, Caltrans officials reopened all connectors between the 
Ventura and Glendale freeways Saturday. 
</P>

ANGRY SURVIVORS WANT ACCESS TO BUILDING; DAMAGE: ALL ARE BARRED FROM NORTHRIDGE 
MEADOWS PENDING INSPECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Survivors of an apartment collapse that killed 16 denounced the owner 
Saturday, saying that he has added insult to injury by preventing the salvage 
of their remaining possessions by failing to have the structure inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 In a chaotic and emotional meeting at a local church, survivors of the 
Northridge Meadows collapse -- the deadliest single incident in Monday's 6.6 
temblor -- demanded to know when they would have a chance to search through the 
rubble for their possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the survivors said they are living in local shelters without money, 
identification, a car or even a change of clothes, and they expressed outrage 
that five days after the quake the building had not been inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't let us in within the next two days, I'm telling you, we're 
going to bust in there," said Erik Pearson, 27, who lived on the third floor. 
"We've been going out of our minds." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to be logical about this, but I'm losing my patience," said 
Josephine Winans, who was rescued from Apartment 128 by other residents after 
the roof collapsed above her. "I have nothing, and I at least need to take a 
picture of my apartment to show that I was under the rubble, for insurance 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Cary Erdman, who lived in Apartment 112, was upset that several people had 
been able to gain access and retrieve some possessions while he and others who 
had obeyed the law were still without their things. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just hasn't been fair, and no one really understands what is going on," he 
said. "There is a lot of confusion about when people are going to be let in." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for owner Shashikant Jogani, one of Los Angeles' biggest 
residential landlords, said an engineer is expected to examine the building 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to wait," said Bill Banker, a Jogani spokesman. "Who could live with 
that on their conscience if more people died?" 
</P>
<P>
 Banker dismissed rumors that the building will soon be razed. Nevertheless, 
some survivors were clearly near panic, begging to be allowed inside. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will be allowed to enter the condemned building until it is inspected 
by engineers, said officials from the Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a crane, Building and Safety workers retrieved some survivors' cars from 
the top floor of the apartment complex's parking garage Saturday, but most 
residents were less than satisfied with that development. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other survivors, Pearson said he planned to sue Jogani. 
</P>
<P>
 "Firefighters told me that that building was not retrofitted, and that it was 
built after the '71 quake," Pearson said. "Look at the disaster and great loss 
of life in this building compared to the other buildings around here. There's a 
reason. I think there are a lot of smoke screens going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren O'Brien of the Department of Building and Safety said that he had 
spoken with Jogani personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a complete misunderstanding of the problem and how to relieve it," 
O'Brien said, adding that Jogani seemed traumatized by what had happened to his 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Johnson, a building official, said the city has condemned the apartments, 
prohibiting entry, until the owner decides what to do with the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the responsibility of the owner, at that point, to determine what to do 
with his building," Johnson said. "Whether he thinks the building is stable 
enough for people to go in, or whether he thinks the structure needs to be 
razed." 
</P>
<P>
 Jogani could not be reached for comment Saturday. He has been described as one 
of Los Angeles' most prominent landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Jogani was one of the key defendants in a class-action lawsuit 
filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by the NAACP and two civil rights law 
firms, which contended that several San Fernando Valley apartment owners 
discriminated against African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to talk above the cynical comments of the crowd, O'Brien said that the 
Department of Building and Safety will let in as many residents as they can as 
soon as possible, but not until they have a chance to examine the findings of 
Jogani's engineer. "I'm not just going to let people crawl through the rubble," 
he said. "This is a dangerous situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Until more is known, the United Methodist Church of Northridge, 9650 Reseda 
Blvd., will serve as an information center for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Every morning at 9, a list will be posted at the church noting if anyone will 
be allowed into the building and, if so, who.

 Earthquake relief and repair efforts accelerated Saturday as tent cities 
sprang up across the San Fernando Valley, the Red Cross began distributing 
food, clothing and emergency supplies in Ventura County and the White House 
promised an additional $283 million in federal earthquake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials preparing for this week's expected commuter crush said they are 
considering whether to erect temporary bridges over gaps in the Simi Valley and 
Santa Monica freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after Los Angeles and Ventura counties were rocked by a 
6.6-magnitude quake, the developments suggest that agencies are improving 
delivery of relief services and that the efforts, though sizable, have not been 
enough to cope with what may be the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us realized the magnitude of it all," said James Lee 
Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In other quake-related developments Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 * As hundreds of quake-shaken Ventura County residents sought help and money 
Saturday at disaster relief centers, homeowners patched broken roofs against 
predicted rain. There is a 50% chance of rain by sunrise today. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Red Cross opened disaster service centers in Simi Valley and Fillmore to 
try to bridge gaps left at FEMA centers in the two cities. The Red Cross is 
offering food, clothing, medicine, tools and other aid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Estimates of those sleeping outside in parks and elsewhere dropped to 9,000 
from 14,500 on Friday. With rain possible, crews hurried to open more tent 
cities, particularly in the quake-ravaged Valley. "The rain is going to be the 
next major situation out here," County Fire Inspector Mark Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of structures declared uninhabitable in the city of Los Angeles 
climbed to more than 1,600, for a total of 7,421 housing units. Damage to those 
buildings reached $460 million -- a figure that will grow considerably because 
building inspectors expect to be assessing damage at least for another week. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles Unified School District planned to reopen most campuses 
Tuesday. Of 30,000 classrooms, 300 remained unsafe, virtually all of them in 
the hard-hit West Valley. School Board President Leticia Quezada said: "My hope 
is that all children will be able to attend school one way or another" this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 * More creature comforts began to reach those displaced by the quake. At one 
Valley park, barbecued ribs were served up, a bookmobile was met by hundreds of 
reading-hungry people in another park, and plans were made to televise today's 
NFL playoff games for those who have taken refuge in San Fernando Recreation 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles County death toll stood at 55, though coroner's spokesman 
Scott Carrier said the number could change. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a good chance that (rescuers and construction crews) may find 
something under buildings during the cleanup period, as happened during the 
riots," Carrier said. Likewise, he said, the coroner could lower the number of 
quake-related fatalities now that overwhelmed medical examiners can re-examine 
some cases. "Some of these cases are questionable" as quake-caused deaths, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * At an afternoon briefing at Caltech, officials said the aftershock frequency 
was decreasing. Although four aftershocks of magnitude 4 to 4.6 hit in rapid 
succession Friday, only four tremors -- all magnitude 3.0 or less -- were 
recorded by 10 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Angeles, officials announced plans to open seven more emergency 
assistance shelters by Monday, bringing the total to 20. As many as 1,000 state 
workers might join in the FEMA assistance effort this week, depending upon the 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 * And in Washington, one top FEMA official said that no decision on long-term 
recovery aid for Los Angeles has been made, but estimated that the federal 
government will spend at least $100 million on emergency provisions and 
shelter. Moreover, FEMA's Dick Krimm said the federal government is mindful of 
how much the state -- and particularly Southern California -- has endured the 
last two years in riots, floods, fires and quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last couple years, we have spent billions of dollars in California," 
Krimm said. "Good Lord, we are very, very sensitive to the disasters of 
Southern California." Federal Help 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by increasing criticism of red tape, officials defended their relief 
efforts, arguing that they are setting up the largest assistance program in 
U.S. history to deal with the most damaging earthquake ever to be centered in a 
major metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has estimated that damages could exceed $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now dealing with the largest mass assistance of people in an urban 
area in the history of the United States," Henry G. Cisneros, Housing and Urban 
Development secretary, said in Los Angeles on Saturday. He said the first quake 
victim to find housing under emergency federal assistance moved into an 
apartment Saturday night. The person's name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the White House announced the release of additional earthquake 
relief funds. Of the $283 million in new aid, White House Press Secretary Dee 
Dee Myers said $140 million will be for Small Business Administration loans and 
the other $143 million for a range of activities such as grants for emergency 
housing and family support and to help localities pay for debris removal, 
emergency services and repair of damaged public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration said Saturday it has provided a total of $639 
million for SBA loans, $41 million for emergency highway repairs and $143 
million for FEMA. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros defended the federal and state relief effort at a Los Angeles news 
conference along with Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of 
Emergency Services, FEMA's Witt, and Art Agnos, who was mayor of San Francisco 
when the disastrous Loma Prieta quake struck there in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "This earthquake is at least twice as bad and the response of the state and 
federal government has been twice as fast," Agnos said. "In 1989, I never saw 
the FEMA director until a week later on 'Larry King Live.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake victims have expressed anger about long lines for relief 
applications and the inability of officials to offer tangible aid such as money 
for emergency housing and rebuilding. Their anger also has been directed at 
FEMA's toll-free hot line for filing claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called and called and called, but we never got any response beyond a 
polite message to hold," said Ared McCurchin, a South-Central Los Angeles 
carpenter who was among those in line Saturday at a new center at 421 S. Avalon 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 But disaster officials said they are increasing the number of relief workers 
and centers, streamlining the application process for aid and sending 
"outreach" workers to wherever victims congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 And FEMA's Krimm acknowledged that the agency's phone system was overwhelmed 
by the request for claims. "On Friday, we had 15,000 calls come in one hour," 
he said. "That is far greater than we have ever had in any disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Andrews maintained that disaster workers had reduced the number of 
quake victims living in parks from 14,000 immediately after the quake to 3,900 
by sending outreach workers to talk people into going to shelters and relief 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that figure was disputed by city Parks and Recreation Director Jackie 
Tatum, who said there still were 9,000 quake victims camped in parks Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said disaster workers were distributing leaflets in Spanish assuring 
quake victims that they are eligible for aid regardless of citizenship under 
federal law. Many people near downtown in the Pico-Union area, which has a 
large community of Central Americans, fled from tenements and have been camping 
in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA set up a relief center in the area Saturday, flying experienced staff 
members in from Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims are not the only ones exhausted by the recent events. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA workers Luis Monge and Richard Rodriguez opened the Pico Union disaster 
relief office at the Central American Resource Center after flying all night 
from Puerto Rico to New York to San Francisco to Burbank, where they were given 
a van and a map. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting lost, they managed to open the office at 2:30 p.m. and begin 
interviewing the 400 people who had been waiting in line for hours. Relief 
Arrives 
</P>
<P>
 The National Guard continued setting up tent encampments throughout the Valley 
Saturday morning, hoping to provide shelter for the newly displaced. However, 
at some sites, including Reseda Park and West Valley Park, Red Cross officials 
would not allow people to start moving into the tents because no cots were on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Under bright sunshine, about 150 sweating soldiers hauled canvas out of the 
backs of trucks, pulled on ropes and drove stakes with sledgehammer-sized 
wooden mallets at the Winnetka Recreation Center, where about 300 quake victims 
have been camping out all of last week. 
</P>
<P>
 By evening, officials said, the center would house upward of 1,000 temporary 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard members erected two sizes of olive drab tents and brought in water 
tankers called "water buffalos." The large tents can house 30 to 35 people and 
the smaller ones 20 to 25 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say their homes are fine but they're scared to go home," said 
Guard Lt. Bill Lemna, 27, a Lodi food executive. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lemna was speaking, Jake Jaroszewski, 37, an employee of Baxter Health Care 
Corp., drove up with a truckload of donated goods 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got food. We've got medical supplies. Where do we go?" Jaroszewski 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemna directed him to an open spot on the grass and a line immediately began 
to form. Baxter employees passed out bags of groceries and plastic jugs of 
water to the grateful park residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Tony Jett of the Los Angeles Police Department stood beside the truck 
and shook his head in wonder. "Trucks are driving up with all kinds of stuff -- 
food, clothing, water, all the necessities. It's so positive, it's 
unbelievable, people coming together to help other people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, a large yellow van drove up and out jumped Jay Lenhoff, 37, 
director of operations for Tony Roma's restaurant chain. The rear of the truck 
swung open and a team of Roma's volunteers began unloading tables, portable 
barbecues, crates of chicken, beans, cole slaw and soft drinks. "We've got 
enough food here for 2,000 people," Lenhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those contributing to the relief effort at Winnetka Recreation Center 
were a Redondo Beach couple -- Rachel Ybarra, an office worker, and her 
husband, Tracy, an electrician. "We didn't take much damage ourselves, so we 
wanted to help the people who did," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They drove onto the grass in a red pickup truck laden with supplies and 
another line formed immediately. "We brought juice, diapers, toilet paper, 
tortillas, all sorts of things. We took $250 from our savings to pay for it," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, five lines snaked out of a brick building in the middle of the 
recreation center. Hundreds of people were lined up seeking assistance from the 
Red Cross, FEMA, the Small Business Administration, state welfare officials, 
the Los Angeles City Housing Authority, the Internal Revenue Service and other 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the scene was calm, there was still confusion about where to go for 
certain assistance. "This is a line for housing vouchers -- or at least I think 
it's a line for housing vouchers," said Scott Sheridan, who works at a private 
school in the Valley. "But I've been in it for 25 minutes and it's hardly moved 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 An extended family of 50 has been occupying a makeshift shelter -- a plastic 
tent stretching over several automobiles and poles -- at the Winnetka center 
since last Monday. "That's a long time," said Andres Ojeda of Canoga Park. 
"With the rain coming, the tents will be a whole lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away, 750 to 1,000 people had moved into tents set up by the 
National Guard at Lanark Park in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanca Granillo, 19, said all the members of her extended family had moved 
into the camp, being administered by the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are about 40 of us in here," she said. "We were the first ones to get a 
tent Friday night. Before that we had been out in the open, and this is way, 
much better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army was providing three meals a day at Lanark Park for the 
mostly Latino group. "Our basic staples are sandwiches and packaged foods," 
said Salvation Army Maj. Dale Hill. "We don't have any means of cooking 
anything right now. But the donations are generous and the food keeps coming 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 One added feature at Lanark Park was a dental clinic set up under a blue 
plastic awning by the Loma Linda School of Dentistry. Instead of dentist's 
chairs, patients were examined on plastic lawn furniture. Getting Around 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful that nothing can return to normal if traffic cannot move, 
transportation officials were considering the use of temporary bridges on two 
crippled freeways critical to the region -- the Santa Monica and the Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeshift structures would allow a partial flow of motorists on one side 
of the roadway while crews work to reconstruct the other. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Santa Monica Freeway, the busiest in the nation with some 340,000 
motorists traversing it daily, a temporary bridge would provide four lanes -- 
two in each direction, said Jerry Baxter, head of the local Caltrans office. 
</P>
<P>
 A temporary structure, however, would also drag out repair of the freeways, 
which Caltrans officials had pledged would be finished within one year, Baxter 
cautioned. Caltrans officials are currently analyzing the cost and delay that 
erecting makeshift bridges would entail, a strategy that was employed on 
certain Bay Area structures after the 1989 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, you would get half a freeway. It would be a considerable help 
and take an awful lot of the load off the city streets," Baxter said. "It has 
the advantage of getting half the freeway open earlier but the disadvantage of 
delaying construction." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's quake battered roadways, collapsing bridges, twisting asphalt and 
closing parts of six thoroughfares -- including major arteries such as the San 
Diego and Golden State freeways. In hopes of easing congestion, Baxter said 
engineers are now considering shoring up the sagging structure on the westbound 
side of the Simi Valley Freeway for use as a temporary route. The eastbound 
side of the freeway collapsed in Monday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, Caltrans officials reopened all connectors between the 
Ventura and Glendale freeways Saturday. The interchanges were closed for one 
day. Work crews had cleared about 65% of the rubble on Interstate 5 at Gavin 
Canyon by Saturday. At the Simi Valley Freeway, workers removed about 45% of 
the fallen debris, said spokesman Russell Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan is expected to announce today 
part of a plan to diminish traffic on the city's jammed streets. Riordan is 
considering converting some streets, such as Olympic Boulevard, into one-way 
thoroughfares. He also may ask trucking companies to make deliveries at night, 
avoiding the roads during commuter rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar initiatives were used during the 1984 Olympics, with Flower and 
Figueroa streets downtown designated one-way. And, with the cooperation of 
trucking companies, an estimated 5,000 trucks -- the traffic equivalent of 
25,000 automobiles -- were kept off the freeways during peak travel times. 
Damage Toll 
</P>
<P>
 A more detailed profile of damage to buildings in Los Angeles started to 
emerge Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the structures declared unsafe were built before codes were 
strengthened following the 1971 Sylmar quake, according to a Times analysis. 
Among these was the Northridge apartment complex where 16 people died. 
</P>
<P>
 But a handful of "red-tagged" buildings had been constructed within the last 
few years, confirming the capricious nature of the temblor. A red tag means 
that a building has been declared unsafe to occupy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, most of the buildings can be repaired," said Tim Thayne, senior 
building inspector. "Some will have to be demolished." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Hal Bernson's northwest Valley district was hardest hit, with 
110 unsafe buildings. Next was Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's district, extending 
from the Westside to Sherman Oaks, with 94 unsafe buildings, according to the 
study by Richard O'Reilly, Times director of computer analysis, and Sandra 
Poindexter, data analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times analysis also found that half of the unsafe buildings were purchased 
in the last five years and a quarter were bought since 1991. Apartments and 
condominiums accounted for 64% of the unsafe buildings. Single-family homes 
represented about 18%. 
</P>
<P>
 Offices, restaurants, stores and parking garages accounted for most of the 
remaining 18%. Returning to Normal 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the scenes of tent cities and rubble-strewn sidewalks, there were signs 
that life was getting back to normal. And of people trying to keep some 
perspective, even some humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, parades of joggers took advantage of picture-postcard 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda Park, a Los Angeles Library bookmobile was parked and assistant 
branch director Fontayne Holmes said hundreds of books were checked out 
Saturday by people camping out. 
</P>
<P>
 A circle of children sat attentively at the feet of Michael Eisenberg, an 
assistant librarian, as he read enthusiastically to them from from a book 
entitled "Miss Nelson Is Missing," pausing before turning each page to show 
them the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts were being made to try to meet other needs of victims. Even the need 
for football. 
</P>
<P>
 The downtown Hyatt Regency hotel planned to set up a big-screen TV in San 
Fernando Recreation Park today so earthquake victims would not miss the 
National Football League playoff games. The hotel also planned to serve 
breakfast to 1,000 quake victims at a Red Cross shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what they will do if more than 1,000 victims show up, Lisa Haller, 
director of sales and marketing for the Hyatt Regency, said: "We'll make 
smaller pancakes, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Observed Rabbi Alan Freehling of University Synagogue in Brentwood: "The 
experience of the earthquake has been a sharp reminder about our mortality. And 
none of us has any time to waste in terms of things to say to one another and 
things we need to do on behalf of one another." 
</P>
<P>
 To aid Southern Californians, The Times today provides a special guide to 
coping with the aftermath of Monday's quake and preparing for the next one.

 Steven Spielberg won a Golden Globe and a standing ovation Saturday night for 
his direction of "Schindler's List," the searing film about a German 
profiteer's rescue of Jews caught in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Schindler's List' was the experience of my motion picture life," the 
director told the packed audience in the Beverly Hilton Hotel ballroom. "The 
sad thing for me, I don't know what I'm going to do next." 
</P>

 "Schindler's List" and the Australian-made "The Piano" led with six 
nominations each. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Hunter won the award for best actress in a dramatic role for her 
performance in "The Piano." Tom Hanks won best actor in a drama for his 
portrayal of a lawyer with AIDS in "Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 The awards for best performance in a musical or comedy were presented to 
Angela Bassett for her portrayal of rock star Tina Turner in "What's Love Got 
to Do With It," and to Robin Williams, who masquerades as a British nanny in 
"Mrs. Doubtfire." 
</P>
<P>
 After thanking "the greatest co-star ever imagined, Laurence Fishburne," 
Bassett gave her thanks to "the most generous national treasure I've ever had 
the pleasure of meeting and portraying, Miss Tina Turner." 
</P>
<P>
 The effervescent Williams made a reference to the Los Angeles earthquake: "If 
I start shaking, it's my nerves, not the room. The exits are over there and 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony began with honors to "Seinfeld" and its star Jerry Seinfeld as 
best TV series and best actor in a musical or comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
 Seinfeld could not resist a typical crack: "Wow -- there's a lot of cleavage 
in this room, and that's why the Golden Globe is the highest honor." 
</P>
<P>
 He added modestly that his hit TV show is "just having fun, which makes you 
look good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. named Helen Hunt, the newly married 
executive of "Mad About You," as best actress in a musical or comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballroom at the Beverly Hilton Hotel seemed festive despite the 
devastation of the past week in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all thank God that we're alive and well and able to be here tonight," said 
emcee Faye Dunaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The first motion picture Golden Globes were presented to Winona Ryder of "The 
Age of Innocence" and Tommy Lee Jones of "The Fugitive" as best supporting 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was said to be on location in Utah, but Ryder appeared on stage and 
commented: "It's an incredible feeling to be honored for a film that's so 
brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. attracted a stellar list of presenters, 
including Gregory Peck, Al Pacino, Mariel Hemingway, Carol Burnett, Morgan 
Freeman, Lou Gossett Jr., Laura Dern, Charlton Heston, Tim Robbins, Andy Garcia 
and Sam Waterston. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51st annual show had two presenter dropouts: Kirstie Alley and Arsenio 
Hall. The homes of both were reportedly damaged by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Globes are carefully watched by the film community because they 
often indicate who will win the Oscars.

CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR VOW BETTER SCHOOLS; POLITICS: IN FIRST THREE-WAY DEBATE 
OF MAJOR CONTENDERS, WILSON, BROWN AND GARAMENDI PROMISE EDUCATORS A RETURN TO 
EXCELLENCE. BUT THEY DIFFER ON METHODS OF FUNDING. 
</P>

<P>
 In their first face-to-face campaign encounter, the three major candidates for 
governor in 1994 pledged Saturday to restore the excellence of California 
schools, but differed in their approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and his two Democratic challengers, state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, spoke 
before the governing council of the California Teachers Assn., a group 
generally more hospitable to Democrats than Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum was at times congenial, at times contentious and at times humorous, 
and it may be the last time in the campaign that all three participate in a 
debate format. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the discussion focused on education, participants also spoke about 
the devastating Northridge earthquake. Garamendi said that Californians must 
prepare to pay for rebuilding the Los Angeles region and that the effort most 
likely will involve increases in sales and gasoline taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering his comments as a sample of leadership for today rather than 
proposals for action in the future, Garamendi said he had heard too many 
Californians beg the federal government for reconstruction funds, citing a 
meeting with President Clinton last week in which Wilson emphasized the need 
for federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will use our own means, our own money and if that means raising taxes to 
do it, we'll do it," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fail to do it and all of this discussion is rhetoric. . . . The economy will 
falter, the spirit of California will be broken and we will not make it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Brown and Wilson said Garamendi's proposals were premature because 
no one yet knows just how much reconstruction will cost. California should 
determine how much the federal government will provide before making specific 
proposals for spending at the state and local levels, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important not to rush to judgment," said Wilson, who is seeking a second 
term this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said, "We send a lot of tax dollars to Washington and I think 
California's entitled to some of that back." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Garamendi's idea of California pulling itself up by its bootstraps 
amounted to "an undisclosed tax increase from undisclosed sources to repair an 
undisclosed amount of damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The CTA, which includes the United Teachers of Los Angeles, represents an 
estimated 230,000 present and retired teachers and often has been at odds with 
the Wilson Administration. The 1,500 officials took no action after the 
hourlong session at a San Francisco airport hotel, but will meet again in March 
to consider endorsing a candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first big political event of the year -- one that Wilson aides 
regarded as his first campaign appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Between now and the June primary, the major battle is between Brown and 
Garamendi for the Democratic nomination to face Wilson in the fall campaign. 
Wilson is not expected to have any major opposition to his renomination in the 
GOP primary in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown reiterated the 13-point education program she outlined late last year 
and promised to revive the spirit of excellence in California education 
promoted by her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., who served as governor from 
1959 to 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is absolutely no more important investment that we can make than in our 
kids," she said. "That's where it begins and that's where it ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi promoted himself as a hands-on governor as symbolized by his 
campaign, during which he will work in various people's jobs throughout the 
state. Last week, he worked for most of a day with a Los Angeles street crew 
using shovels and crowbars to break up a sidewalk damaged in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 He pledged that if he is elected governor he will spend at least five days 
every year working alongside teachers in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 All three said they would work to improve the quality of education and to give 
local schools more authority in developing their own programs. But Brown and 
Garamendi drew a warmer response from the delegates by declaring that 
"qualified, certified teachers" are at the heart of the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Both oppose state support for voucher schools that could hire teachers who do 
not meet state standards required of public school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did not directly address the issue of voucher schools, but supported 
expansion of "charter" schools where teachers are "free of the micromanagement 
of the (state) education code." There was no applause from the assembled 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson defended the Administration's record on spending for education, saying 
he had had to make harsh cuts throughout the state budget in order to maintain 
spending for public education. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to come up with new money is through economic recovery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi labeled Wilson's approach as "wrong-headed," saying that California 
cannot experience lasting economic recovery until schools are improved and are 
capable of educating and training a skilled, modern work force. That will 
require more money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CTA delegates cheered and applauded when Garamendi criticized the "distorted 
priorities" of the last 12 years of Republican state Administrations in 
building 23 prisons and major jails and only one state college campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the state should do a better job of enforcing the spirit of 
Proposition 98, which requires that about 40% of the state's general fund 
budget be spent on education. She was applauded heartily by the teachers' 
representatives when she proposed that money be raised for classrooms by 
cutting the cost of administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson perhaps drew his most applause when he told the teachers: "You know 
better what to do in the classroom than the state Legislature in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
 And he got the biggest laugh in his summation when he said he had been touched 
by his teachers as a youth, including the high school football coach who told 
him that it wasn't weight that mattered on the field, but heart. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 150-pound guard, Wilson said that notion "damn near got me killed." 
</P>
<P>
 At several points Brown and Garamendi sought to put Wilson on the spot over 
the question of whether illegal immigrants should be allowed in the schools. 
The Democrats challenged the governor to confirm that his program to control 
illegal immigration into California would -- as Brown put it -- "throw kids out 
on the street and not educate them." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi put the question directly to Wilson, but CTA President Del Weber of 
Anaheim ruled it out of order. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, flourishing the page from a newspaper, Brown said: "I challenge you to 
get this on the record today. Do you support throwing kids out on the street?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson responded by saying that she had a copy of a newspaper ad he ran as an 
open letter to President Clinton on controlling illegal immigration and 
compensating California for the services it provides the illegal immigrants. 
One of his proposals was a constitutional amendment that would deny citizenship 
to the children of illegal immigrants.

ON CALIFORNIA: FINE WORDS AND FALLEN BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody knows the right words. How lucky the quake came as the city slept, 
sparing countless lives. Los Angeles people are battle-tested, resilient. Stuff 
happens. This is the price of living in paradise. The broken bone heals 
stronger. The city will survive. And, anyway, at least enjoy the sunshine; they 
are freezing to death in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the words of consolation. These are the light, quick words of the 
immediate aftermath, in the early days of shock. The first instinct is panic. 
The second borders on giddiness. What's to cry about? At least we escaped with 
our lives. Rock and Roll. Welcome to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days after the earthquake, a new emotion has set it. And it is neither 
light nor quick. There is deep dread, a broadening realization that the wound 
on the city is a grave one. The dust is down and the smoke is gone and now the 
future is easier to see, and it is relentless. 
</P>
<P>
 It is block upon block of ruined buildings; they might look fine from the 
outside, but inside they are shot. It is months of four-hour commutes. It is 
businesses that if they reopen at all will not reopen for weeks, months, who 
knows when. It is wrecked schools and hospitals. It is lost paydays. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I reached Nick at his studio. He has lived in L.A. almost 20 years. He is a 
graphic designer, one of the city's best. It was late Thursday, and he was in a 
hurry. His Los Feliz studio was, he said, "devastated." He had come to salvage 
what he could. That night he would be helping three friends in distant corners 
of the Valley evacuate ruined apartments. His own home in North Hollywood was 
also damaged. He did not know how badly, for who can find an inspector? 
</P>
<P>
 In worst shape, though, was his spirit. He spoke sourly of Mayor Riordan and 
his thumbs-up public performances: "Who is he kidding?" He spoke of huddling at 
night in the dark with his wife and two little girls, "feeling like a caveman, 
waiting to see what monster was going to come." He spoke of buying a Glock 
pistol. He spoke of all the damage out there that the news cameras had yet to 
discover, the damage known only to those who live among it. He spoke of how it 
once had seemed important to live in Los Angeles, to make a mark, bring home a 
big paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not worth the trade-off anymore," he said. "And you know what, Pete? 
It's not just the earthquake. It's all the things around the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Once before, after his sister was a victim of a carjacking in Studio City, 
Nick and I had engaged in similar conversation. Then, I had reminded him why he 
had come to L.A. in the first place. We had talked about sunshine and our 
baseball team and friendships and living in a city on the cultural edge. This 
time I didn't keep up my end of the dialogue. This time I just let Nick go. His 
mind won't be changed by any pretty words. He's out there in the middle of 
something big. He might stay. He probably will go. And Los Angeles will be less 
without him and his family. But what are you supposed to say: "Hang in there, 
Nick. Get tough, Nick." 
</P>
<P>
 What I said was good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are many people like Nick out there. Study the faces in the pictures of 
lines outside the FEMA outposts. Look down from the airplane and count the tent 
cities. Drive the streets and observe the caravans of U-Hauls parked outside 
apartment buildings. Talk to anybody engaged in any kind of business. Tell them 
this crisis will build their character. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who presume to lead this place must understand something. This is not, 
as Pete Wilson's economic adviser told a news conference last Friday, "a minor 
event." This is not, as the highway officials were preaching last week, just 
another test of commuter creativity, like the 1984 Olympics. What has happened 
to Los Angeles, and thus to California, is deep and dangerous and fundamental. 
This is not workers' comp fraud, or a few dry years in the Sierra. This is not 
a situation to be played for partisan advantage, pacified with nickel-and-dime 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Onward. Together. Persevere. Out in the streets of the city, these words fall 
like shattered stucco. Out in the streets, such rhetoric does not match the 
hard evidence. And the people loading up their broken furniture know it. This 
time they will not be sweet-talked into staying. They know the truth. They know 
how badly the city is broken. What they want to hear, from someone, is how it 
will be put back together.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; RUMORS ABOUND AS CALTECH DENIES PREDICTING NEW 
QUAKE; SCIENCE: THE SCHOOL BLUNTLY SAYS TEMBLORS CAN'T BE FORECAST AFTER THE 
MAYOR AND GOVERNOR CALL ABOUT OFFICIAL-SOUNDING REPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 First came the quake, and now come the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are even rumors about the rumors, and there is a would-be earthquake 
predictor at work in the San Jose area who is issuing dire warnings that are 
rejected by the scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, they add up to suggestions that another big earthquake in the Los 
Angeles area is imminent, suggestions that Caltech and the state Office of 
Emergency Services say are not founded in scientific fact. 
</P>
<P>
 After Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan called Caltech President Thomas E. 
Eberhart on Friday to say he had heard rumors that there would be a magnitude 7 
earthquake this morning, and Gov. Pete Wilson's office called about similar 
reports, Caltech issued a blunt statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "In response to rumors about imminent major quakes, Caltech seismologists are 
saying that earthquakes cannot be predicted," the school said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aftershocks will continue. However, the rumor of the prediction of a major 
earthquake is false. Caltech cannot release predictions, since it is impossible 
to predict earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's public relations director, Robert O'Rourke, said Saturday that he 
had been told by Deputy Mayor William McCarley that somebody was faxing 
statements written on phony Caltech stationery. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan's press secretary, Annette Castro, said the mayor's office had not 
gotten such a fax. Castro said she heard that Wilson's office had received the 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 But a press aide to Wilson said no, the governor's office hadn't received such 
a fax either. 
</P>
<P>
 A Caltech seismologist, Egill Hauksson, said he heard that someone had stolen 
some Caltech stationery and was using it. O'Rourke could not confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the rumor of a big quake is circulating in various forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Joe Surgent said the county's Emergency 
Operations Center learned Thursday "from other cops" that they had heard there 
was "a 50-50 chance of a magnitude 7.5 within 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 "We immediately put a call out to Caltech, and they said there was nothing to 
it," Surgent said. 
</P>
<P>
 And there wasn't. Friday came and went without a 7.5 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Flores, deputy director of the Office of Emergency Services, said 
Saturday that the only advisory that has been issued is that "we could have 
aftershocks any time, and the technical assessment is that there's a 30% chance 
of a magnitude 5 aftershock in the next seven days. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "A 7 or a 7.5 is without any scientific validity as far as being correct," he 
said. "It's important to quell this before the rumors get any worse." 
</P>
<P>
 An Office of Emergency Services spokeswoman in Sacramento, Katie Corsaut, said 
that a San Jose man named Jack Coles, who is not a seismologist, has been 
putting out faxes predicting quakes to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where I think the rumor got started that there would be a big quake 
this weekend," Corsaut said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Northern California telephone number listed for Coles is answered by a taped 
recording that says the caller has reached the "early warning earthquake 
detection line." 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we may very well have another quake down in the L.A. area just 
east of the Northridge area," the message declared Saturday. It said the chance 
of "another large quake" was 54%. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores pointed out that the message did not say precisely how big the quake 
would be, and that there have been some fairly heavy aftershocks occurring 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Coles, who says he uses "radio signals, magnetic anomalies and many cases of 
electrical problems" to predict earthquakes, has had a spotty record. For 
example, he predicted wrongly that the Big One would hit the Bay Area on Sept. 
11, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before the Northridge quake, Associated Press reported that he sent 
faxes to the news media, saying there was a 54% chance that a quake larger than 
magnitude 6 would occur within three days somewhere in California.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; WHILE GROUND SHOOK, SHERIFF'S COPTER WAS FLYING 
BREAD; RESPONSE: THE EMERGENCY UNIT'S AVAILABILITY WAS OVERLOOKED, OFFICIALS 
SAY. CREW MEMBERS ARE STUNNED AND DISAPPOINTED.

 Just hours after the quake hit, the elite helicopter rescue squad of the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department was in position -- whirring 500 feet above 
the devastated San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the chaos, the chopper and its crew of trained paramedics were not 
called upon to treat or airlift any of the thousands of earthquake victims -- 
not even the 21 premature babies stranded at a damaged Northridge hospital. 
After the crew and another sheriff's helicopter ferried deputies to a nearby 
jail in Castaic, the choppers were assigned to deliver hundreds of loaves of 
fresh-baked bread to the Downtown men's jail. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the crew members, who make their living rescuing people from steep 
slopes and icy waters, were incredulous that they had not been sent to help 
during a calamity of such scope. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can think about us to transfer bread, they ought to think about us to 
save lives," said Lt. James A. Di Giovanna of the Sheriff's Aero Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jack Sills, chief of neonatology at UC Irvine Medical Center, said there 
was an acute need for helicopters Monday and that delays left medical personnel 
frustrated. He said it took him 6 1/2 hours to arrange for what turned out to 
be Marine Corps helicopters to deliver two of the premature babies in 
Northridge to his hospital in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to get the experts to where the problem is as quickly as possible, 
and the best way to do it is by air," Sills said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, when we get a transfer call, we're there to pick up the baby within 
30 minutes. But because of the confusion, it took hours this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sills said he had no idea that the Sheriff's Department had an emergency 
response helicopter available Monday that could have been used to airlift the 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the medical community had known," he said, "then we could have pushed the 
right buttons." 
</P>
<P>
 Why was the sheriff's helicopter sent to deliver bread for prisoners instead 
of evacuating premature babies or aiding earthquake victims? 
</P>
<P>
 According to interviews with sheriff's officials and medical personnel, the 
helicopter unit was overlooked by its own department and its availability was 
unknown to those who needed help in the chaotic hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Capt. Tom Sams, who oversees the helicopter units, said the crew 
would have aided earthquake victims -- but no requests for such help came to 
the department's Emergency Operations Center. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same hours Monday, the Marine helicopters from El Toro flew the 
premature babies and a Channel 2 chopper pilot transported a burn victim. 
County Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses were deployed to drive 
dozens of military veterans, some with catheters still in place, from a 
quake-stricken hospital in the San Fernando Valley to veterans' facilities as 
far away as San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Sams said sheriff's officials did not learn of the babies' plight until 
Tuesday, after all 21 had been taken to UC Irvine and two other hospitals. "We 
became aware of it the next day, and we're concerned," Sams said, "because we 
could have made arrangements and flown that mission." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the bread run, Sams noted that both sheriff's helicopters had flown to 
the Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic late Monday morning to deliver department 
medical personnel because of another outbreak of racial violence there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sams said the copters were then ordered to load and deliver the bread, baked 
by prisoners at Castaic, because officials wanted to make sure that sandwiches 
could be served at the Downtown jail, where kitchen steam tables were out of 
order "and there was no way to provide hot meals." 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a concern here that delivering bread was a higher priority than 
helping babies, that certainly was not the case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sams and members of the emergency response unit noted that over the past week 
they also have transported deputies to a substation in Santa Clarita, an area 
difficult to reach because of road failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, members of the emergency response unit said they remain perplexed and 
deeply disappointed that when the community needed them most, they were not 
called on to help. They see Monday's events as part of a reduction of the unit 
that has included a cutback to four-day-a-week operations. In 1990, an official 
said, the unit logged 14,000 hours in the air; in 1993, it flew 8,500 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a rescue operation that just seems to get lost through the cracks," 
said Sheriff's Sgt. Harry Jones, crew chief of the big Sikorsky helicopter and 
its team, known as Air 5. "Our department is not as proactive in the rescue 
business as they really should be. We're not utilized to our fullest capacity. 
This (earthquake) is a perfect example of what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a 25-year veteran of the helicopter squad who vividly remembers 
"running bodies in and out" of the crumpled Olive View Hospital after the 1971 
Sylmar earthquake, said that Monday's experience was entirely different. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're cranked up, we're having an earthquake, we've got one of the best 
rescue helicopters around -- and we're transporting bread," he said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; LESSONS FROM THE PAST HOLD UP WELL; CALTRANS 
GETS CONFIRMATION OF ITS QUAKE-PROOFING REMEDIES AS MOST RETROFITTED OVERPASSES 
WITHSTAND 6.6 JOLT

<P>
 Engineers combing through collapsed freeways in the wake of Monday's 
Northridge earthquake say they knew how to prevent the destruction but simply 
ran out of time before disaster struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the last three major quakes -- Sylmar, Whittier Narrows and Loma 
Prieta -- all revealed significant deficiencies in freeway overpass 
construction, they also taught Caltrans and industrial engineers important 
lessons about quake-proofing vital arteries, and those lessons seem to have 
been learned well, experts said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the 122 Southern California overpasses that had been retrofitted 
survived the magnitude 6.6 temblor and, with one exception, the 11 that 
collapsed were on the list for future retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception was the Mission/Gothic interchange on the Simi Valley Freeway 
(California 118), close to the quake's epicenter. "If Caltrans had known it was 
sitting on an active fault, it would have been on the list too," USC engineer 
James Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The overpass collapses were traced to well-known mechanisms and "the retrofit 
remedies that have been and are being installed could almost certainly have 
saved all of these bridges," said structural engineer Nigel Priestly of UC San 
Diego. All the bridges in Los Angeles were scheduled to have been retrofitted 
by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the bridge failures in Monday's temblor could be traced to 
fracturing of the shorter columns supporting the roadbeds. Studies of collapses 
in previous quakes have shown that the rigidity and brittleness of the shortest 
columns limited their ability to flex like the taller pillars on the same 
spans. That appears to be the cause of the failures in Monday's quake as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say that fracturing can be prevented by jacketing the columns in 
steel. This has been the major thrust of retrofitting in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The retrofitting now being done is based on knowledge gained during the three 
previous large quakes. The 1971 magnitude 6.4 Sylmar quake showed engineers 
that bridge spans could slide off their supporting columns if the spans were 
not physically joined together. Since the temblor Caltrans has installed hinge 
joints -- a series of steel cables that hold the spans together -- on all 
bridges in the state, a task that was completed in 1989. Those have worked 
successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 5.9 Whittier Narrows quake in 1987, engineers were stunned when the 
supporting column on a ramp connecting Interstate 5 and Interstate 605 burst 
under compression from the quake. That triggered research on so-called 
single-column bridges, most of them on- and off-ramps, in which each span is 
supported by a single column in the center. That research led to the technique 
of jacketing the columns in steel and concrete for extra strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Close on the heels of Whittier Narrows, the magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta temblor 
in 1989 put the spotlight on overpasses with supporting columns of different 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between the two types of columns is roughly similar to that 
of the reed and the oak tree, Priestly said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a windstorm, the reed escapes damage by bending with the wind. It can be 
bent nearly parallel to the ground without being damaged because of its 
flexibility, thereby riding out the fiercest storms. But the oak tree resists 
bending, and thus absorbs the full force of the wind, eventually shattering. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar situation occurs on freeway overpasses. Tall pillars bend with the 
sideways movement caused by a quake, but shorter, more brittle ones resist 
bending. Because all the pillars are linked by the bridge, however, the bending 
of the tall pillars causes most of the force to be transferred to the short 
pillars, which are not designed to absorb such forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, they shatter, losing their load-bearing ability and causing the 
overpasses to fall. That seems to have happened at nearly every overpass that 
failed in Monday's temblor, Priestly said, including the interchange of 
Interstate 5 and the Antelope Valley Freeway (California 14) in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Some geologists have speculated that unusual vertical acceleration of the 
ground at that interchange caused the pillars to punch through the overpass, 
"but that is not our reading of what happened there," Priestly said. "The short 
column adjacent to the south abutment attracted a very high shear force. It had 
little transverse (sideways) reinforcement, so it failed, lost its load-bearing 
capacity and dragged the rest of the structure down." 
</P>
<P>
 The solution to the problem is simple, experts say, and is virtually the same 
solution as that for single-column bridges. After the 1987 Whittier quake, 
engineers began jacketing the columns in steel-reinforced concrete to bolster 
them against cracking. By preventing large chunks from shearing off, the 
jacketing renders the short columns more flexible, allowing them to bend as 
much as five inches, compared to a maximum of about one inch before 
retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 After Loma Prieta, Caltrans identified 860 freeway and highway bridges in the 
state that required retrofitting of the short columns;456 of them are in the 
Los Angeles area, according to James Roberts, the agency's chief bridge 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those 456, 122 bridges have been retrofitted -- including all single-column 
bridges -- and work is in progress on another 43, he said. Contracts for the 
remainder will be let this year, he said, and "by the end of 1995 they should 
all be finished." 
</P>
<P>
 It costs an average of $500,000 to retrofit each bridge and requires about a 
year of work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has received high marks from academic engineers for its methodical 
approach to retrofitting the bridges. At the beginning of the process, Caltrans 
assessed each bridge's age, design, traffic load and proximity to faults. Those 
with the highest ratings received first priority. The overpasses on the Santa 
Monica Freeway were of intermediate priority and, in fact, contracts for their 
retrofitting were scheduled to be issued in the next couple of months. The 
others that collapsed had lower priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caltrans has acted very responsibly within the constraints of available 
resources," said USC's Moore, one of the state's few structural engineers who 
does not receive funding from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only criticism that has been directed against the agency involves 
the collapsed ramp at the Interstate 5/California 14 interchange. The 
interchange was under construction at the time of the Sylmar quake, when a 
different ramp collapsed and was subsequently rebuilt. The ramp that collapsed 
Monday was completed under the old quake guidelines in force when construction 
began in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics, such as Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), charged this week 
that Caltrans should have held off on construction of the interchange until new 
guidelines were issued. But they were not developed until the end of 1973, 
Roberts said, and there would have been howls of outrage if the freeway had 
been delayed that long. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said retrofitting of the collapsed interchange could have been 
completed before Monday's quake had it not been held up for more than a year to 
obtain special equipment to deal with geological irregularities under the 
interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some pretty terrible geologic formations down there (under the 
footings)," he said. FREEWAY FAILURES 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a reassuring element to the roadway failures, it is that there 
were no surprises. Engineers suspected certain elements of the L.A. freeway 
system were at risk, and it was those elements that indeed failed. And 
retrofitting techniques can eliminate many of the potential trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Short Columns the Main Culprits 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers believe most failures can be traced to less flexible short supports. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a quake, long columns survive because they sway slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Short columns, unable to bend, absorb horizontal energy produced by longer 
columns and blow out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Solution 
</P>
<P>
 Jacketing short columns actually makes them more flexible, allowing them to 
bend up to five times as much. It reduces the force they must absorb and makes 
them less likely to break. 
</P>
<P>
 REPLACING THE I-10 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the Southland's busiest road -- the Santa Monica Freeway -- will have 
to be replaced from the ground up. A look at what has to be done: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Damaged freeway demolished and removed. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Columns poured, reinforced with steel 
</P>
<P>
 3. Girders go up by crane, providing a skeleton for roadway 
</P>
<P>
 4. Plywood fitted over girders as forms for roadway's lower slab 
</P>
<P>
 5. Concrete poured; plywood removed 
</P>
<P>
 6. Plywood forms placed over lower slab; concrete for road surface is poured 
</P>
<P>
 Quick Fix 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are considering erecting temporary bridges on the Santa Monica and 
Simi Valley freeways. The temporary structures would allow a partial flow of 
traffic on one side of the roadway while workers construct the permanent ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstering the Bridge 
</P>
<P>
 By wrapping older columns in steel casings, engineers can stop older columns 
from splitting during a quake. Among the other methods used to make older 
bridges more resilient in a quake: 
</P>
<P>
 Original Concrete Column 
</P>
<P>
 Steel Rebar 
</P>
<P>
 Polystyrene Wrap 
</P>
<P>
 3/8" Steel Casing Pressure Grouted to Existing Column 
</P>
<P>
 Hinges: Allow slight shifting 
</P>
<P>
 Buffers: Function as shock absorbers 
</P>
<P>
 Cable: Straps keep joints from coming apart 
</P>
<P>
 Footings: Bases enlarged and piling driven deeper (Tie-Down Rods Drilled 65 
Feet Into ground) 
</P>
<P>
 KEY FEATURE IN NEW BRIDGES 
</P>
<P>
 When the I-10 is rebuilt, its new columns will feature spiral steel rods to 
hug the components together. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Method: Before 1971, steel support bars had no side-to-side support 
</P>
<P>
 New Method: Columns are now made with steel rod wrapped around vertical steel 
supports

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DAMAGE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some facts and figures on Monday's magnitude 6.6 earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * DEATHS: 55 
</P>
<P>
 * AFTERSHOCKS: Four aftershocks of the magnitude 3.0 range occurred Saturday. 
The aftershocks were felt most strongly in the San Fernando Valley. No new 
damage was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 * DAMAGE: Of more than 2,800 sites inspected, 1,600 structures -- including 
residential buildings encompassing 7,421 dwelling units -- were declared 
uninhabitable, totaling an estimated $460 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * INJURIES: More than 6,547 people were treated and released at hospitals; 
about 1,292 were admitted for care, and 216 remain in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARRESTS: The Los Angeles Police Department has taken 239 people into custody 
in a five-day period. Most were general arrests and not for curfew violations 
or looting. On a typical day, there would be about 550 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOMELESS: Since the quake, the Salvation Army reportedly has fed about 
185,000 people, supplied about 60,000 gallons of water to victims and provided 
shelter to 5,500 people. The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened its 
13th shelter Saturday at the Kedren Community Mental Health Center, 4211 S. 
Avalon Blvd., Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * NATIONAL GUARD: A total of 2,579 National Guard troops have been mobilized. 
The National Guard has committed more than 1,000 soldiers -- in day and night 
shifts of 500 -- to conducting security patrols at shopping malls and selected 
sites in quake-damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * UTILITIES: The Southern California Gas Co. will have more than 3,400 service 
personnel working in the heavily affected earthquake areas this weekend to turn 
on gas service. The company has found that there may be twice as many customers 
in earthquake areas without service as had been estimated. DWP crews 
concentrated on blackouts in scattered homes and blocks. As of Saturday, about 
500 customers throughout the city still didn't have electricity as a result of 
broken connections and transformers. DWP lifted its boil water alert for the 
Sunland and Tujunga areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRANSIT: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority set up a line called the 
Westside Special to help commuters cope with the shutdown of the Santa Monica 
Freeway (I-10). Buses on Line 634 leave every 20 minutes during weekday morning 
and evening rush hours, or as demand warrants. The one-way fare is $1.50. 
Caltrans officials reopened all connectors between the Ventura (134) and 
Glendale (2) freeways Saturday. The interchanges were closed for one day. A 
commuter hot line, (800) 286-RIDE, has been set up to provide information on 
car pools, road closures and other information.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DEATH CAME IN MANY WAYS FOR VALLEY'S VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the epicenter of Monday's quake in Northridge, the majority of the 
victims were residents of the San Fernando Valley. Of the 55 deaths attributed 
to the earthquake, 36 occurred in the Valley, and more than a third were in the 
single infamous building on Reseda Boulevard. Here is a look at some of the 
victims: OLGA ROBLES URIBE Defying the hazards Monday morning, Consuelo Uribe 
drove to Valencia to tell her younger sister, Olga, that everyone was OK. It 
was Olga who wouldn't be. 
</P>
<P>
 Olga Uribe, 26, had followed her family's piecemeal migration from Michoacan, 
Mex., in search of work. Consuelo came first, 15 years ago, then a brother and 
a sister, then Olga. Their mother and father came last. The family, along with 
Olga's 10-month-old baby, Jovanni, lived in a small house in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters worked in Canyon Country, Olga an assistant manager at Wendy's, 
where she had worked nine years. On Monday morning, she started at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, Consuelo drove her mother and father to a relative's 
home in Van Nuys, then on to see Olga. At 1 p.m., they tried to drive home, but 
were turned back. They went to Wendy's to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7 p.m., the manager suggested he could take the sisters home. On San 
Fernando Road, just south of Sepulveda, they crossed a fissure in the pavement 
about the width of a car bumper with a two-inch rise on one side. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed to Consuelo that the earth shook again as they hit the crack. The 
car brushed a tree then rolled two or three times, stopping with its wheels in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 After the manager and other motorists righted the car, Consuelo unfastened her 
sister's seat belt and tried to save her with words of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to her," she said. "I told her to wait for her baby. I said, 'Your 
baby is here. Your baby is waiting.' She was breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was talking to her, 'Olga, your baby is waiting for you,' she was 
breathing more. After a while she didn't breathe no more. I tried to save my 
sister, but I couldn't." MANUEL SANDOVAL It was their first night in the new 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four-year-old Manuel Sandoval, the pride of his immigrant family, had 
rented it with three other Cal State Northridge students. Only one would 
survive their first 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 His father had come up from Wilmington on Thursday to help Manuel move in. 
Manuel spent part of the weekend with his parents and five siblings, then said 
goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so excited about getting the apartment," said his older brother, 
Leobardo. "It was the last time the family saw him." 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in Mexico and came to the United States with his family in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always had straight A's or Bs," Leobardo said. "He had many certificates, 
many awards, honors." 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel graduated from Banning High School and went on to Los Angeles Harbor 
College. His father, who was the family's sole support with his job at a 
fast-food restaurant, could not help pay the tuition. Manuel paid his own way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He worked, always," Leobardo said. "He had jobs, he would tutor other 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 From Harbor College he went to CSUN, where he started last semester. His goal 
was to become a math teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 During his first semester, which began in September, he lived in a dormitory 
room, but he thought that if he had his own place with other students, he could 
save money. 
</P>
<P>
 The other students who joined him in the venture were Jaime Reyes, 19, and 
Myrna Velasquez, 18, who Leobardo said were a couple. The other student, who 
has not been fully identified by authorities, survived. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, Manuel's parents turned on the television soon after the 
earthquake struck. Coverage of the tragedy at the apartment house began early. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father knew that was the building, because he was there to help Manuel 
move in," Leobardo said. LIONEL VENTURA His mother was praying for an Act of 
God, but of a different sort. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been in a coma since Dec. 17, when he was in an automobile accident. 
Chances for recovery were slight, but she had not lost hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The call that came on Monday morning from Holy Cross Hospital was not the one 
she had prayed for. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor tell me that my son expired," said Nercida Ventura. "That's what 
they say -- expired. He was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The respirator keeping Lionel Ventura, 21, alive stopped when the earthquake 
interrupted the electric power. Nurses immediately gave him CPR, but couldn't 
revive him. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a premonition back on Dec. 17 when Lionel left her house, where he 
lived with his girlfriend and 2-month-old daughter, in the company of two men 
she didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me, 'Nothing is going to happen,' " she said. "He gave me a kiss and 
said, 'Mom, I love you,' and he left." 
</P>
<P>
 She heard nothing until Jan. 6, when the police called to tell her that he had 
been in the hospital since the day she last saw him. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the hospital, they tell me that the police chased the car because it was 
stolen," she said. "I never found out anything about the accident." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that doctors said her son would never recover his mental faculties 
even if he came out of the coma, but she remained hopeful. In recent weeks, she 
said there were signs he was recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started lifting his hand," she said. "He open his eye and close it. He was 
starting to react. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in God, and I pray for a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Nercida Ventura is praying to find a way to pay for his burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me that even with prices cut, it will cost $2,503," she said. "I 
don't have that money." KAROL RUNNINGS Her son and daughter had asked her to 
move to Phoenix with them, but Karol Runnings, 48, had a boyfriend and a window 
overlooking a landscaped stream. 
</P>
<P>
 She had lived upstairs before, but moved to the first floor as soon as it was 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved her little apartment, and she wasn't going to leave it," said Julie 
Tindall. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Bill Runnings, was working graveyard shift when he saw the Northridge 
Meadows Apartments on television. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:30 that afternoon, Karol's former husband met his son and daughter at the 
airport. By 9, they stood on the sidewalk before TV cameras, pleading for 
scraps of information. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 3 a.m. that a cousin called from the morgue with the news. 
ADAM SLOTNIK The Pizzeria Uno opened in November at Northridge Fashion Center, 
and Adam Slotnik, 28, was sent by the parent company in Boston to be its 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been an entrepreneur all of his life, since he was 5," said Lisa 
Costigan, friend of the franchisee, Glenn Miller. "He wanted to work really 
hard for the next 10 years and retire young. He wanted to live the good life." 
</P>
<P>
 He died in the Northridge Meadows Apartments. TED PETER FICHTNER On the street 
in Chatsworth that took him in, Ted Peter Fichtner, 28, was "our local hero," 
said Margaret Foreman, in whose trailer he had lived for nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ted was never too busy to help anybody," Foreman said. "Even little kids 
brought their bikes to him if it needed air." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he went fishing with his brother-in-law, William Henderson, and 
caught an 18-inch trout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was one of the happiest days he ever had," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he tried to get out of bed Monday, a microwave struck him in the head. 
PEARL E. CARR Gladys Bergantzel immediately thought of her ailing 73-year-old 
friend, alone in the house she had lived in since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 When she moved into the Granada Hills neighborhood in 1968, Pearl Carr, a 
some-time secretary at MGM and some-time screenwriter, already lived around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor had found Pearl and pulled her out from under a dresser. 
</P>
<P>
 Two neighbors drove Carr to the hospital, but brought her home when the 
hospital wouldn't admit  
</P>
<P>
 her for a hip injury. Bergantzel went to get water for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was halfway down to the driveway, she sat up and started waving her 
arm. I ran and pulled open the car door and said, "What's wrong?' "She said, 'I 
feel very funny and can't breathe.' I had my arms around her and she just went 
unconscious. We didn't have any telephone service. I just lowered her back down 
to the pillow." CECILIA AND DAVID PRESSMAN The couple in Apartment 105, both 
72, had been married 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn native David Pressman had been retired from used auto sales for some 
years, but Cecilia was still the energetic office manager for a small company 
in Canoga Park, known to telephone customers for her attractive voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was going to try to retire in May," said one of her two daughters, Elise 
Kaplan of Granada Hills. "She really liked Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were found in their bed in a tight embrace in the Northridge 
Meadows Apartments. MARGUERITE BURLINGTON She was a dancer, said Yolanda Valle, 
manager of the federally subsidized Sherman Park Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very active lady, a very happy lady," Valle said. "All the time 
when I have a party here, she will always go for it. We are really going to 
miss her." 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington, 91, and her sister, Madeleine Hughes, both lived in the federally 
subsidized seniors apartment complex on Sherman Way in Reseda. 
</P>

<P>
 Ann Cerone, 80, and her husband, Daniel, first lived up the street from the 
future Northridge Meadows apartment complex and moved into it as soon as it was 
built in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was real tiny," Bill Cerone said. "Very quiet. She had the sweetest 
smile, and just lived for her family." 
</P>
<P>

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; THE STORIES OF SOME OF THE VICTIMS OF THE 
TEMBLOR

<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner has attributed 55 deaths to the earthquake and 
its aftermath. Here is a look at some of the victims: 
</P>
<P>
 OLGA ROBLES URIBE 
</P>
<P>
 Olga Uribe, 26, had followed her family's piecemeal migration from Michoacan, 
Mexico, in search of work. Most of the family, along with Olga's 10-month-old 
child, Jovanni, lived in a small house in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, Olga started work at 4 a.m. at a Wendy's restaurant in 
Canyon Country. After the quake, she and her sister accepted a ride home from 
the manager. 
</P>
<P>
 On San Fernando Road south of Sepulveda, they crossed a fissure in the 
pavement. The car brushed a tree then rolled two or three times, stopping with 
its wheels in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 After the manager and other motorists righted the car, Consuelo unfastened her 
sister's seat belt and tried to save her with words of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was talking to her, 'Olga, your baby is waiting for you,' she was 
breathing more. After a while she didn't breathe no more. I tried to save my 
sister, but I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 LIONEL VENTURA 
</P>
<P>
 His mother has been praying for an act of God, but of a different sort. 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel Ventura, 21, had been in a coma since Dec. 17, when he was hurt in an 
automobile accident. Chances for recovery were slight, but his mother had not 
lost hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Holy Cross Hospital called. "The doctor tell me that my son expired," 
said Nercida Ventura. The respirator keeping Ventura alive stopped when the 
earthquake interrupted the electric power. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother had a premonition on Dec. 17 when Lionel left her house in the 
company of two men she didn't know. "He told me: 'Nothing is going to happen,' 
" she said. "He gave me a kiss and said: 'Mom, I love you,' and he left." 
</P>
<P>
 KAROL RUNNINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Her son and daughter had asked her to move to Phoenix with them, but Karol 
Runnings, 48, had a boyfriend and an apartment overlooking landscaped grounds 
and a stream. 
</P>
<P>
 She had lived upstairs, but moved to the first floor as soon as it was vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved her little apartment, and she wasn't going to leave it," said Julie 
Tindall. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Bill Runnings, was working an early morning shift when he saw the 
Northridge Meadows apartments on television. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:30 that afternoon, Karol's former husband met his son and daughter at the 
airport. By 9, they stood on the sidewalk before TV cameras, pleading for 
scraps of information. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 3 a.m. that a cousin called from the morgue with the news. 
</P>
<P>
 ADAM SLOTNIK 
</P>
<P>
 The Pizzeria Uno opened in November at Northridge Fashion Center, and Adam 
Slotnik, 28, was sent by the parent company in Boston to be its manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been an entrepreneur all of his life, since he was 5," said Lisa 
Costigan, friend of the franchisee, Glenn Miller. "He wanted to work really 
hard for the next 10 years and retire young. He wanted to live the good life." 
</P>
<P>
 He died in the Northridge Meadows apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 TED PETER FICHTNER 
</P>
<P>
 On the street in Chatsworth that took him in, Ted Peter Fichtner, 28, was "our 
local hero," said Margaret Foreman, whose trailer he had lived in for nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ted was never too busy to help anybody," Foreman said. "Even little kids 
brought their bikes to him." 
</P>
<P>
 He had gone fishing recently with his brother-in-law, William Henderson, and 
caught an 18-inch trout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was one of the happiest days he ever had," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he tried to get out of bed Monday, a microwave oven struck him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 NORMAN H. COLE 
</P>
<P>
 "A working little guy," in the words of his neighbor Howard Zimmerman, Norman 
Cole, 79, was at it till the end. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Jeanne, migrated from Indiana in 1947, then moved into a new 
house on Knapp Street in North Hills nine years later. After retiring as an 
insurance analyst for Lockheed Corp. 10 years ago, Cole volunteered at the 
Wilkinson Multipurpose Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He kept busy in spite of a heart attack last March. As soon as the earthquake 
was over, he started cleaning up until he slipped and collapsed in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 JERRY BORMAN 
</P>
<P>
 In the hall outside the second-story Valley Oaks Village apartment in Santa 
Clarita, a neighbor handed him a flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 As his wife, Catherine, waited, Jerry Borman, 67, went back inside to search 
for his own flashlight, climbing over a fallen dresser, said his stepdaughter, 
Cathy Feldman of West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he came out, he gave the neighbor the flashlight back and he collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
 ANGELINE (ANN) CERONE 
</P>
<P>
 She moved from Rochester, N.Y., in 1963 to be near her son Bill and his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Cerone, 80, and her husband, Daniel, once lived up the street from the 
site of the Northridge Meadows apartment complex. They moved in as soon as the 
complex was built in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was real tiny," Bill Cerone said. "Very quiet. She had the sweetest 
smile, and just lived for her family." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Cerone worries that the apartment will be demolished before he can 
retrieve family photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the most important ones to me are in that building and I really want 
to get them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 JERRY GREEN 
</P>
<P>
 His sister expected him to arrive at her door, half a mile from his home in 
the Northridge Meadows apartments, shortly after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Divorced, Jerry Green, 52, was close to his sister, Sally Sawchuk. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he didn't come here, my husband and daughter went over to the 
apartment," she said. "My husband was knocking at Jerry's window on the first 
floor. My daughter said to him: 'Dad, this is the second floor, not the first.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 CONCHA QUINTANAR 
</P>
<P>
 Migrating from Sonora, Mexico, in the late 1920s, she settled with her husband 
in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years after his death, Concha Quintanar, 83, and her daughter, Yolanda 
Quintanar, still lived in the little house on Hollister Street where Yolanda 
and her brother were born. Visiting with them Monday was Concha's sister, 
Refugio, 90. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors helped them out of the shaken but undamaged house and sat Concha in 
a chair on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "All she said was that she felt very bad," Yolanda Quintanar said. "I just 
thought she fainted, but she never came out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Refugio was flown in a helicopter to Glendale Adventist Hospital and is doing 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 EVELYNN B. HENSON 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving from Taylorville, Ill., in 1961, Evelynn B. Henson brought one of the 
first coaches into the new Sunburst Park Mobile Homes on Plummer Street in 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter, Minetta Dial, followed in 1965, taking the space across the 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Little had disturbed the tranquillity of their lives until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband yelled: 'Your mother's house is on fire!,' " Dial said. "We just 
couldn't do anything. It was coming out the doors and the windows. All we could 
do was sit back and let it burn." 
</P>
<P>
 Henson was 92. 
</P>
<P>
 BEATRICE RESKIN 
</P>
<P>
 She was planning to leave the Northridge Meadows apartments, but not with much 
joy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bea Reskin, 71, had retired a month earlier from a job as a medical assistant 
to a Tarzana doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was going to move to Arizona to be near me," said Marcee Murray, one of 
her daughters. "Or to somewhere that was a little less expensive, maybe a 
retirement-type place. But she didn't want to leave her wonderful friends 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray said her mother was identified by the Star of David ring she always 
wore. 
</P>
<P>
 MANUEL SANDOVAL 
</P>
<P>
 It was their first night in the new apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four-year-old Manuel Sandoval, the pride of his immigrant family, had 
rented it with three other Cal State Northridge students. Only one of them 
would survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so excited about getting the apartment," said his older brother, 
Leobardo. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel was born in Mexico and came to the United States in 1978. "He always 
had straight A's or B's," Leobardo said. "He had many certificates, many 
awards, honors." 
</P>
<P>
 During his first semester at CSUN, he lived in a dorm, but he thought that if 
he had his own place with other students, he could save money. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved in with Jaime Reyes, 19, and Myrna Velasquez, 18, who Leobardo said 
were a couple. The other student, not yet identified, survived. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, Manuel's parents turned on the television soon after the 
earthquake struck. Pictures from the collapsed apartment house began early. "My 
father knew that was the building, because he was there to help Manuel move 
in," Leobardo said. 
</P>
<P>
 PEARL E. CARR 
</P>
<P>
 Gladys Bergantzel immediately thought of her ailing 73-year-old friend, alone 
in the house she had lived in since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bergantzel moved into the Granada Hills neighborhood in 1968, Pearl Carr, 
a sometime secretary at MGM and sometime screenwriter, already lived around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor had found Carr after the quake, and pulled her out from under 
a dresser. She then sat down in a lawn chair on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Two neighbors drove Carr to the hospital, but brought her home when the 
hospital wouldn't admit her for a hip injury. As Carr sat in the vehicle, 
Bergantzel went to get water for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was halfway down to the driveway, she sat up and started waving her 
arm. I ran and pulled open the car door and said, 'What's wrong?' 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'I feel very funny and I can't breathe.' I had my arms around her 
and she just went unconscious. We didn't have any telephone service. I just 
lowered her back down to the pillow." 
</P>
<P>
 CECILIA AND DAVID PRESSMAN 
</P>
<P>
 The couple in Apartment 105, both 72, had been married 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn native David Pressman had been retired from selling cars for some 
years, but Cecilia was still the energetic office manager for a small company 
in Canoga Park, known to telephone customers for her sexy voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was going to try to retire in May," said one of her two daughters, Elise 
Kaplan of Granada Hills. "She really liked Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were found in their bed in a tight embrace in the Northridge 
Meadows apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 MARGUERITE BURLINGTON 
</P>
<P>
 She was a dancer, said Yolanda Valle, manager of the federally subsidized 
Sherman Park Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very active lady, a very happy lady," Valle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington, 91, and her sister, Madeleine Hughes, both lived in the apartment 
complex for the elderly on Sherman Way in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle found Burlington, 91, in her room with furniture strewn about her bed. 
Nothing hit her. Valle said she believes that the earthquake scared her to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 DARLA RAE ENOS 
</P>
<P>
 She would have been busy today. Her job was surveying buildings for structural 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person that could really be out helping people perished," said Ron Agenter, 
vice president of Kaping Construction in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Darla Rae Enos, 43, outgoing and a take-charge type, moved here from Montana 
five years ago and married James Enos. Her husband recently had joined the 
Kaping company as a construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
 They were having an early cup of coffee on the couch in their Northridge 
Meadows apartment. They were thrown in different directions. Trapped under 
rubble, he saw a tremendous flash of light, and cried out for his wife. She did 
not answer. 
</P>

MORTAR FIRE KILLS 6 CHILDREN PLAYING IN SARAJEVO'S SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mortar fire killed six children as they played in the snow near their 
apartment building in Sarajevo on Saturday, hospital officials and eyewitnesses 
said. Three were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of children had been frolicking in the area, lured outside by a lull in 
the shooting on a fine winter day, but the sled run in the Alipasno Polje 
district was virtually deserted after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends and I were sliding on ice in front of our apartment building when 
a mortar fell and we started running for the entrance," gasped Muhamed 
Kapetanovic as he lay on a stretcher waiting for emergency treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to run inside but then another shell landed between me and my 
friend. He was killed and I was wounded in four places," Muhamed said, his 
anguished father hovering nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, elderly neighbors shoveled away blood-soaked snow and slush. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at the Kosevo Hospital trauma ward said the children ranged in age 
from 4 to 12 and that two of the dead were sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 A mortar barrage on a school in the same neighborhood last November killed 
three children and a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian siege of Sarajevo has killed about 9,770 people, 1,550 of them 
children. Nearly 58,000 have been wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said the shelling only a few hundred 
yards from U.N. peacekeeping force headquarters in a city designated a U.N. 
"safe area" was another Serbian snubbing of the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Muslim-led 
Bosnian government called again for air strikes to knock out artillery of 
Serbian forces that have shelled the capital for 21 months. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in Sarajevo said U.N. observers 
would analyze the mortar craters as soon as possible to determine where the 
shells had been fired from. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationalist Serbian forces typically deny responsibility for civilian deaths 
in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kosevo Hospital, neighbors carried one shellshocked boy on his sled into 
the trauma ward for treatment of a mangled leg. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearby morgue, the slain children lay on stretchers. One had a single 
mitten between his legs and a snow boot to the side. 
</P>
<P>
 A young father gazed at the decapitated body of his daughter. He could not 
speak.

BOTH SIDES ACT TO HELP JAPAN LEADER STAY ON; ASIA: POLITICIANS SAY ECONOMIC AND 
FOREIGN POLICY NEEDS CAN'T WAIT. PRIME MINISTER'S LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE 
POLITICAL REFORMS VIEWED AS FUTILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Japanese leaders on both sides of the political fence moved Saturday to help 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa stay in office, even if he fails in an 
eleventh-hour bid to salvage his political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Full efforts must be devoted to carrying out measures to spur the economy," 
said Michio Watanabe, former foreign minister and a major faction leader of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone will try to force the prime minister to assume 
responsibility" for the stunning defeat of Hosokawa's reform bills in the upper 
house of Parliament on Friday, Watanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshiro Mori, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general, also said that 
priority must be given to economic measures and foreign policy issues. Hosokawa 
is scheduled to meet President Clinton in Washington on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition's expressions of support for Hosokawa came as leaders on both 
sides predicted the prime minister's last-ditch attempt to come up with a 
compromise package and enact it by next Saturday, when the current session of 
Parliament ends, will prove futile. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa was expected to ask that both the upper and lower houses establish a 
20-member joint committee to hammer out the compromise. Any revised bills would 
require the approval of two-thirds of the joint committee but only a simple 
majority of each house. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower house passed Hosokawa's reform package last Nov. 18, but on Friday, 
a rebellion by 21 of Hosokawa's coalition members -- 20 of them Socialists -- 
sent the bills to defeat by a vote of 130 to 118 in the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
 In a debate broadcast today by NHK, the semi-governmental national TV network, 
Watanabe demanded that Hosokawa scrap his election reform plans and agree to 
enact only a bill designed to uproot corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of both the coalition and the opposition Liberal Democrats reportedly 
suggested that a "consultation committee" be established to continue debate on 
political reforms after the close of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Establishment of such a committee could sound the death knell for reform, but 
it would hand Hosokawa a face-saving way out of the pledge he made last August 
to "assume responsibility" if the bills were not enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commentators, however, said Hosokawa might resign -- without calling a 
general election -- out of personal conviction to keep his promise. In that 
case, the lower house would choose a new prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 With Japan's economy in deep recession, a sense of crisis has emerged among 
both politicians and business people who believe that the government must act 
immediately to spur growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget for the next fiscal year, which usually is compiled by the end of 
December, still has not been drawn up. And an announcement of a package of 
measures to spur economic growth that had been planned this week was expected 
to be delayed by the last-minute efforts to win approval for political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Hosokawa stays on, the blow to his leadership may prove fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 With proof in hand that he cannot count on the support of the Socialists, the 
largest group in his coalition of seven parties in the lower house and eight in 
the upper chamber, attempts to cut taxes to spur growth are likely to be more 
intractable. Socialists adamantly oppose any increase in a 3% consumption tax 
as part of a deal to cut income taxes, while the Finance Ministry insists on a 
trade-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese economists, as well as Clinton Administration officials, regard an 
income tax cut as essential to spur consumption, lift the economy and pull in 
more imports. Japan's trade surplus with the United States last year was 
expected to amount to about $56 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's defeat for Hosokawa, Japan's best hope for political change in 
decades, also called into question whether he could carry out other pledges to 
reduce government intervention in the economy, disperse central government 
powers to local administrations and put the consumer -- instead of the producer 
-- at the core of policy. 
</P>
<P>
 An agreement by Hosokawa to stay on would ensure he could make his scheduled 
trip to Washington. But both sides admit yearlong talks to conclude a 
"framework" for U.S.-Japanese economic relations remain stalemated. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa and Clinton had been scheduled to sign the framework at their 
February meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper Yomiuri reported today that Foreign Ministry officials are 
studying what to do if the Clinton Administration decides to postpone the 
meeting because of lack of hope for an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa is to meet today with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who is on the 
final leg of a 12-day international tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister's proposed political reforms would have carried out the 
biggest overhaul of Japanese politics since the post-World War II American 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 The reforms would have scrapped electoral districts from which an average of 
four representatives are chosen, created new constituencies in which only one 
candidate is elected and established a system of proportional representation in 
the lower house.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS URGE SHIFT IN U.S. CONSUMPTION; CONSERVATION: GROUP MEETS IN 
SEARCH FOR ANSWERS TO WHAT ONE ACTIVIST CALLS A WASTE 'MENTALITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Growing numbers of people in developing countries want the same standard of 
living that Americans are unwilling to give up. But if everyone on Earth 
consumed resources and threw off waste the way Americans do, analysts say, the 
environment would collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for solutions to that basic problem is a self-assigned mission of 
the World Conservation Union, an association of official agencies and 
non-governmental organizations now holding its general assembly in Buenos 
Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eight-day meeting of about 1,000 people from more than 100 countries -- 
billed as the biggest international environmental conference since the 1992 
Earth Summit in Brazil -- the union is expected to elect U.S. zoologist Jay D. 
Hair as its president for the next three years. Hair, 48, is president of the 
National Wildlife Federation, the world's largest environmental group, with 
more than 5 million members. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Hair outlined ideas for relieving pressure on the Earth's 
environment. The United States, which maintains its standard of living by using 
more than one-fourth of the resources consumed in the world, is unqualified to 
tell developing countries, " 'You can't have it,' " he said. "It's simply 
arrogant, presumptuous, and it's a non-starter." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, Americans must help change the "mentality of 
overconsumption," shifting the emphasis of consumer demand from quantity to 
environmental quality. For example, he said, consumers must learn to shop for 
clothing made with ecologically acceptable materials that will last and stay in 
style, for cars that don't pollute and can be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the consumers of the United States will be delighted to have products 
that are more recycling-friendly," he said, predicting that such changes will 
come "when consumers expect it and when private enterprise responds to the 
desire of consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Hair has been nominated to succeed the World Conservation Union's current 
president, Shridath Ramphal, a native of Guyana and former secretary general of 
the British Commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramphal, in his opening speech to the union's general assembly last week, 
noted that the world's population is expected to grow from 5.5 billion to 10 
billion by the middle of the 21st Century. And he cited a U.N. estimate that a 
child born in industrialized countries will consume at least 20 times the 
resources as a child in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 People in many developing countries aspire to a U.S. "model" of prosperity as 
seen in movies and television. But if developing countries were to approach 
such levels of consumption and waste, Ramphal said in an interview, "we would 
be heading toward exceeding the carrying capacity of the planet, so we've got 
to change the model." 
</P>
<P>
 He credited the United States and especially California with beginning such 
changes as energy taxes, car-pooling and low-pollution cars. "Those are all 
incremental steps in the right direction, but we need a lot more of them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And industrialized countries of the north should set a better example before 
criticizing developing countries of the south for damaging the Earth's 
environment, he said. "The south sees the north as the principal culprit, yet 
it is on the receiving end of lectures from the north," he said. "They're not 
going to heed those lectures unless they come with more moral authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than lectures, industrialized countries should provide technology, 
trade and investment that will help poor countries develop without degrading 
the environment, he said. For example, he said, governments of north and south 
should cooperate to impose environment codes of conduct on multinational 
companies that invest in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafe Pomerance, deputy assistant secretary of state for environment and 
development, said the United States wants to explore ways of transferring 
advanced technology to developing countries that will help protect the 
environment. "The question is, how do we make arrangements to make these things 
happen?" Pomerance said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one of many questions being discussed by Pomerance and others at the 
environmental meeting here. Another is how to cooperate in "capacity building" 
-- helping people and institutions in developing countries learn how to manage 
environmental preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks B. Yeager, director of policy analysis for the U.S. Interior 
Department, said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service already has a $1-million 
program for training Latin Americans to manage their national parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelia Davis Lawrence, the Clinton Administration's special representative to 
the World Conservation Union, said that "capacity building is one of our 
stronger points, one of the greatest things we have to contribute." Lawrence 
said that providing training and technology for environmental preservation in 
developing countries is in the United States' interest because it is in the 
Earth's interest. "Given the fact that we live in a global community, it has to 
be a priority to share this information and participate," she said.

PERES, ARAFAT HINT AT IMMINENT BREAKTHROUGH IN ISRAEL-PLO PACT; MIDEAST: 
PROGRESS IS REPORTEDLY MADE IN OSLO. THE ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER AND PLO CHIEF 
WILL MEET AGAIN SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat met here 
Saturday and held out the prospect that an agreement on terms to implement 
their historic Mideast peace plan may be just a week away. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they failed to meet rumored expectations of a breakthrough in Oslo, 
the two men announced that they will hold talks on the final obstacles next 
Saturday in Davos, Switzerland, during a meeting of the World Economic Forum, 
which they were both already scheduled to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next week will be an important date to achieve what we are looking for," 
Arafat said at a joint news conference after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some small differences which we hope to overcome. If there is a 
will, there is a way, and we are sure we both have the will to go strongly, as 
we have from the beginning, to achieve real peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides refused to go into specifics about what progress had been made in 
Oslo, but Peres later confirmed that he had brought new proposals on border 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 "May we ask your patience for another week's time, and then we shall give you 
the (working) paper," Peres said. "None of us can say with safety that we shall 
reach a total agreement, but I can say we have the proper climate to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 The talks followed more than 24 hours of intensive behind-the-scenes mediation 
in Oslo, where secret diplomacy led to the initial declaration of principles 
for peace in September. Over the next week, Israeli and Palestine Liberation 
Organization delegates will continue negotiations in Oslo as well as at related 
talks in Washington and Taba, Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening session, hosted by the Norwegian government, followed separate 
meetings that Secretary of State Warren Christopher held with Peres and Arafat 
on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The central figures in the Mideast drama were in Oslo for the funeral of Johan 
Jorgen Holst, the Norwegian foreign minister whose initiative and perseverance 
led to the secret Palestinian-Israeli talks. Holst died Jan. 13 of a stroke at 
age 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting growing U.S. concern about the bogged-down Mideast peace process, 
Christopher warned both delegations about the dangers of further delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States feels that they ought to move forward with implementation 
as fast as they possibly can," Christopher said at the outset of his talks with 
Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has been increasingly concerned about the 
escalating violence in Israel and the occupied territories, the growing 
influence of militant groups like the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as 
Hamas, and the impact the delays have on providing international aid to 
Palestinians as a means of winning broader support for the Palestinian autonomy 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official traveling with Christopher emphasized the "need to 
change life in the territories. The longer implementation is delayed, the 
greater the loss of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations have been bogged down by disputes over security arrangements 
at border crossings, the size and configuration of the Jericho district in the 
West Bank and the security of Jewish settlers in Palestinian areas. 
Implementation had been due to begin with an Israeli pullout Dec. 13 from the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 The dangers were evident Saturday in reports that Israeli soldiers shot and 
wounded seven Palestinians in clashes in Hebron in the West Bank. Troops 
reportedly opened fire on young men throwing stones and empty bottles, 
eyewitnesses told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the five-week delay in an agreement that would allow Israeli troops to 
withdraw from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, Peres said that it is still possible 
to meet the April 13 deadline for the Palestinian areas to gain autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's presence and his willingness to go into details was also a factor in 
the progress, according to U.S. officials. In his talks with Christopher, 
Arafat pulled out maps and talked at length about specific problems and 
alternatives he or his representatives had been reluctant to deal with in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 It was initially hoped that Arafat would remain in Oslo overnight to work on a 
final agreement this weekend, but he left immediately after his meeting with 
Peres because of an unspecified commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found both sides felt a need to come to agreement as soon as possible," 
State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said after Christopher's talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are clearly differences in the positions of the two sides. But both 
sides are focused on bridging those differences." 
</P>
<P>
 All sides had hoped for significant progress, in part to pay tribute to Holst. 
</P>
<P>
 During his eulogy at the service, Christopher described Holst as "at once 
imaginative and practical. He understood that change must come, not just 
through symbols but through pragmatic actions that would make a genuine 
difference in the day-to-day lives of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Israeli-PLO meeting, acting Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore 
Godal announced the creation of an emergency fund to meet the "urgent economic 
needs of the Palestinians and their institutions" during the transition to 
autonomy. Both Arafat and Peres requested that the fund be named for Holst.

CLINTON READY FOR NEXT DOMESTIC ISSUES; RADIO ADDRESS: TAKING CREDIT FOR 
BUSINESS UPSWING, THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WILL STRESS HEALTH CARE AND WELFARE 
REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton took credit Saturday for the recent upswing in the economy 
and said the Administration is now prepared to go on to other key items on his 
domestic agenda, such as overhauling the nation's health care and welfare 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In his weekly radio address, Clinton said that while the recovery is 
incomplete, the economy has "turned the corner," and the government has "built 
the foundations for a real recovery that will endure and enrich the lives of 
all our people." 
</P>
<P>
 He also projected that the federal budget deficit for fiscal 1995, which 
begins Oct. 1, would be less than $180 billion -- down from more than $300 
billion forecast last January before Congress passed his economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate indication as to precisely why the budget-deficit 
projection is so much lower than it was a year ago, but analysts said the bulk 
of the reduction most likely comes from the improvement in the economy, which 
boosts tax revenues and cuts welfare spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's remarks were designed to take advantage of a surge in his 
standing in the polls and to pave the way for him to promote his health care 
and welfare-revision plans in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is spending the weekend at Camp David, Md., the presidential retreat, 
where he is said to be working on the speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've transformed America's agenda, addressing problems long deferred or 
denied," Clinton said Saturday. He said the debate is no longer whether to pass 
legislation to reform health care or welfare, but merely over what kind to 
enact and how rapidly to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's optimism about the economy is expected to be underscored later this 
week by reports that the economy grew unusually rapidly during the fourth 
quarter of last year, possibly at an annual rate of 6% or more -- its most 
vigorous pace since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 However, few economists credit the President's program for the bulk of the 
improvement. Recent figures have shown that the pickup began before his 
election and has accelerated gradually ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also used the radio address to say the nation will rally around 
earthquake victims in Los Angeles and help them get back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in this kind of adversity, or maybe even because of it, our people have 
become more determined," he said. "We've seen neighbor helping neighbor and 
total strangers performing acts of quiet heroism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles will come back," he added. "Together with the people of Los 
Angeles, we'll help to make that happen. That's the American way." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's speech was followed by a GOP response delivered by Sen. William S. 
Cohen (R-Me.), who praised the President for tackling health care and 
welfare-reform legislation, but warned him not to "focus only on domestic 
affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen warned that Clinton must do more to counter new pressures from the 
Russian military or risk seeing Moscow back in control of states that were part 
of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said Clinton must be "equally strong" in dealing with North Korea, 
urging that the United States impose "enforceable economic sanctions" if 
Pyongyang continues to balk at complying with international inspection of its 
nuclear weapons program.

airport, in which he had secret interests.A jury deliberated for six hours 
before convicting Ira Jackson on 83 counts of mail fraud, 43 counts of 
accepting bribes and four counts of tax evasion. He was acquitted of one tax 
evasion count. Sentencing is set for April 16. Jackson faces up to 857 years in 
prison and a fine of $32.5 million. Assistant U.S. Atty. Sally Yates said she

DOLE, KEMP ATTACK CLINTON HEALTH PLAN; POLICIES: THE POSSIBLE GOP PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATES ALSO CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN AGENDA AND WELFARE REFORM 
STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two presumed GOP presidential hopefuls challenged the assumptions behind 
President Clinton's health care reform agenda Saturday and attacked the White 
House on issues ranging from foreign policy to welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting that there is "no crisis" in health care, Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) told the Republican National Committee's winter meeting that 
polls show 85% of all Americans are satisfied with their coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jack Kemp, a former GOP congressman and Cabinet member during the George 
Bush Administration, told the gathering later in the day that Clinton's health 
care package relies too much on government control. 
</P>
<P>
 Without offering a specific alternative, Kemp, now co-director of Empower 
America, a public policy and advocacy organization, suggested that Republicans 
should rally behind a plan that relies more on private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole and Kemp, considered to be among the front-runners for the Republican 
presidential nomination in 1996, appeared before their party faithful as 
Clinton prepared to address the nation on health care and other issues in his 
State of the Union speech Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton has scared the American people into thinking we've got to 
radically nationalize and have the government control all the decisions in the 
marketplace," Kemp told an enthusiastic crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacking the President's approach on health care and crime, Kemp said Clinton 
"ran in the center, but he's turning left." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole noted that Congress will begin tackling health care reform when it 
reconvenes this week and that Republicans have got some "great plans . . . that 
are almost identical" and "it wouldn't take much to put them all together." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he favored a plan put forth several years ago by Lloyd Bentsen, the 
former Democratic senator from Texas who is now Clinton's Treasury secretary. 
Dole said it extended coverage for those needing it but did not upset the 
free-market system of private health insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could add some things to make it a pretty good bill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp also criticized Clinton's handling of foreign affairs. Referring to the 
warfare in Bosnia, he said that "while your heart goes out to the people of 
Sarajevo, the Administration just blusters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world leadership developed by Ronald Reagan and George Bush is just being 
dissipated away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to welfare reform, Kemp said: "We shouldn't pass health care reform 
until we pass a radical welfare reform plan and put America back to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole and Kemp agreed that the immediate task facing Republicans is to overcome 
their minority position in both houses of Congress. Come November, all 435 
House seats, 34 of 100 Senate seats and many state governorships will be up for 
grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a great opportunity to pick up seven Senate seats, but I'm not sure 
we're going to be able to do that," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our party has always been an optimistic party," Kemp added. Referring to the 
presidency, he said: "We must go out not just in the 50 states. I want to see 
this party aim at capturing the District of Columbia." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole renewed his call for a congressional investigation of the so-called 
Whitewater affair, which involves questions surrounding the First Family's 
participation in the Whitewater Development Corp. -- an Ozark Mountain vacation 
resort in which the Clintons invested with a friend, James B. McDougal, in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal was president of a failed savings and loan and questions have arisen 
over whether he or the Clintons benefited improperly from their business 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Democrats don't want to have a (congressional) hearing, they're going 
to have to suffer the consequences," Dole said, referring to expectations that 
Republicans will make the matter a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno appointed New York attorney Robert B. Fiske 
Jr. as a special counsel to look into the matter.

 On the 21st anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision, about 
200 anti-abortion protesters knelt outside the White House to pray for 
President Clinton, his wife and top Administration officials."We pray that you 
will deliver our nation from this hand of tyranny. We pray, our God, that you 
will invade this mansion," intoned the Rev. Paul Schenck of Buffalo, N.Y. The 
First Family was spending the weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp 
David, Md. The abortion opponents complain that Clinton's health care reform 
package would cover abortion on demand.

 Beaches near San Juan may be further damaged by oil that escaped during 
removal of a barge that hit a reef and created a huge oil spill early this 
month, the Coast Guard said.Nearly 1 million gallons spilled from the barge 
after it hit the reef on Jan. 7. An additional 85,000 to 125,000 gallons 
escaped as the barge was being pulled from the reef and towed 40 miles west, 
where it was sunk in the Puerto Rican Trench, one of the deepest spots in the 
Atlantic. A Coast Guard officer said an oil slick from the new spill is moving 
toward San Juan.

TOO MUCH GOOD NEWS UPSETS CLINTON AGENDA; PROGRAMS: WITH A BRIGHTER ECONOMIC 
AND HEALTH CARE OUTLOOK, SUPPORT FOR HIS 'SECURITY' INITIATIVES COULD FADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was supposed to be the year President Clinton got to do the fun stuff, to 
enact the activist agenda that helped him get elected. 
</P>
<P>
 After an initial 12 months in which he felt compelled to swallow the sour 
medicine of deficit-reduction, Clinton planned to focus this year's domestic 
agenda on ambitious and upbeat initiatives in the areas of health care, welfare 
reform, crime prevention, education and job training. 
</P>
<P>
 Those policies provide the building blocks of what Clinton once called his 
"economic security agenda" -- his Administration's response to what it 
perceived as voters' deep anxiety about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as Clinton prepares to outline his plans for 1994 in his State of the 
Union Address on Tuesday, he faces a dilemma rich with irony. Signs of growth 
and renewal are showing up in many quarters -- earthquakes and cold spells 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Positive numbers are rolling in on employment, economic expansion, health care 
costs and America's international competitiveness. In early January, consumer 
confidence rose to its highest level since before the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is unquestionably good for the nation and its citizens could be bad 
news for Clinton and his "security" agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 With increasing evidence of economic revival, the sense of crisis that Clinton 
had counted on to generate support for his activist initiatives may quickly 
evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
 With the possible exception of a new infusion of federal funds for 
earthquake-ravaged Southern California, the public's appetite for big 
government programs is likely to wane as its confidence rises on such key 
issues as job and income security, affordability of health care and the outlook 
for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In an acknowledgment of the improving national mood, Administration officials 
now say Clinton is backing off economic security as the unifying theme of 
agenda. They say he will downplay the security refrain in his State of the 
Union Address, a speech that will be dominated by the issues of health care and 
crime prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that 'security' went over like a lead balloon as a theme," said one 
White House official. "I think you will see it only as a secondary component of 
the speech." 
</P>
<P>
 There is far more than rhetoric and symbolism at stake for Clinton. Indeed, 
the President may be about to find out just how difficult it is to get 
Washington to take forceful action when there isn't a sense of urgency in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the White House gears up for its big legislative push on health care 
reform, for example, the government's statistical gnomes churn out data showing 
that the spiraling growth of health care costs is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department reported earlier this month that medical costs rose 5.4% 
in 1993. Pharmaceutical prices rose 3.1%, less than half the rate posted in 
1992 and the smallest increase in nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in medical costs over the past decade has been a key concern driving 
the debate over health care reform. A sustained reduction in the growth rate 
could raise new questions about the wisdom of the sweeping reforms proposed by 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's plan relies heavily on government intervention in the medical 
marketplace, and critics already have accused Clinton of drafting a plan that 
is too radical to gain widespread support. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the apparent taming of medical inflation has prompted one powerful 
lawmaker, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), 
to declare that there is "no health care crisis" facing the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is inevitable that slower growth in health care costs will have a 
major political impact on health care reform," said Dr. Edith Rassell, a health 
care economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington and a supporter 
of health care reform. "There are lot of people who want to do nothing, and 
this gives them a perfect excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan and a handful of his moderate Democrat allies in Congress would much 
rather focus on the politically popular issue of welfare reform in advance of 
1994's off-year elections. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Administration, which hopes to keep the issue on the back 
burner until Congress finishes with health care, may be forced to accelerate 
the timetable for welfare reform. The competing pressures over the timing of 
health care and welfare reform is shaping up as one of the first major 
legislative battles of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the crisis atmosphere that once surrounded the issue of America's 
ability to compete with its major trading partners seems to be waning as the 
economy rouses from its stupor. 
</P>
<P>
 International competitiveness is a theme that runs through virtually all of 
Clinton's major initiatives, from health care reform to Labor Secretary Robert 
B. Reich's ambitious plan to fund new training and re-employment programs for 
displaced workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as Reich is poised to release his re-employment program, new studies 
suggest that U.S. workers are widening their lead in productivity over their 
European rivals, while at least holding their own against the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's post-World War II "catch-up" with America ended in the early 1980s, 
and the United States has increased its productivity advantage over Germany 
since then, according to a new study by the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, "Japan and the United States are likely to share productivity 
leadership in manufacturing for some time to come," German economist Bart van 
Ark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate studies show that the United States now enjoys some of the lowest 
manufacturing costs of any advanced industrialized nation; BMW and 
Mercedes-Benz are setting up shop in the South to escape the high costs of 
doing business in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials argue that much of the improvement in productivity 
has come at a high price: bankruptcies, layoffs and corporate restructurings 
that have left millions of Americans outside the economic mainstream looking 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Productivity is not the only measure of economic well-being," said Laura 
D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. "The United 
States has had stronger growth in the past year, but you still see that wages 
and incomes have been growing very slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the unemployment rate -- 6.4% in December -- has fallen nearly one full 
percentage point over the past year, and monthly job creation in 1993 was 
double the pace of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not as scared as they were a year ago. . . . People are feeling 
better, that looks to be dramatically true," said one White House official. 
</P>
<P>
 While the sense of urgency underlying Clinton's campaign proposals may be 
absent this year, the budget constraints that are facing the Administration 
remain very real. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringent new spending limitations imposed by Clinton's five-year, 
$500-billion deficit-reduction package are already threatening Clinton's 
ability to finance his legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Budget Director Leon E. Panetta warns that unless the 
Administration is successful in persuading Congress to cut spending on existing 
programs, there will be little money available to fund many of Clinton's 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the Administration has cut proposed outlays for Clinton's new 
programs for 1995 -- from $29 billion to about $16 billion -- and only five 
Cabinet departments received funding increases for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta had no choice but to slash funding for the new agenda to comply with a 
hard freeze on discretionary spending in next year's federal budget, which will 
be unveiled Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeze will remain in place at least through 1998, raising questions about 
Clinton's ability to fully fund his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 From a political perspective, the good news about the economy and health care 
is arriving nearly three years too soon. For Clinton, the state of the nation 
in late 1996 matters much more than its performance in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, fast growth today could increase the probability that the economy 
could be hitting the skids again during the next presidential election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But good news, after all, is better than the alternative. So, aides say, 
Clinton will use his address to claim credit for the positive developments: low 
interest rates, rapid job growth, increasing business investment in factories 
and equipment, and a significant decline in the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials say he will stress that his deficit-reduction package 
is responsible for a sharp reduction in long-term interest rates, making it 
easier for consumers to spend and businesses to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he will tell the public that he has done wonderful things for them 
over the past year," said a sardonic Martin Feldstein, a conservative Harvard 
University economist and former Ronald Reagan Administration official. "He will 
take credit for the business cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Countered Robert E. Rubin, chairman of the Administration's National Economic 
Council: "How will we take credit for the economy? Easily."

BOSTONIAN SEEN AS CHOICE FOR RIGHTS POST; NOMINATION: DEVAL PATRICK, A LAWYER 
WITH TIES TO THE NAACP, IS EXPECTED TO BE NAMED SOON BY CLINTON, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has settled on Boston lawyer Deval L. Patrick in a third 
effort to fill the top civil rights enforcement position at the Justice 
Department, Administration sources said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination of Patrick, 37, a Harvard Law School graduate who has worked 
closely with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc., is expected to be 
announced shortly, perhaps early this week, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President withdrew his first nominee, C. Lani Guinier, a University of 
Pennsylvania law professor, when she was criticized in the Senate as having 
advocated alternatives to one-person, one-vote democracy in order to increase 
the political power of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinier insisted that the academic writings in question had been 
misinterpreted. She professed deep hurt at the withdrawal, and many black 
leaders were angry because both the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton knew her personally and had never before expressed disagreement with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Clinton's second choice, District of Columbia Corporation Counsel 
John Payton, withdrew from consideration when some members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus spoke out against him. 
</P>
<P>
 They questioned whether Payton was committed to their view that the 1965 
Voting Rights Act allowed congressional districts to be drawn up to help the 
election of black candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Payton also incurred criticism by acknowledging that he had not always 
exercised his right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Although last-minute problems have arisen with other Clinton appointees, 
officials said Patrick has cleared the FBI's background investigation and that 
the agency recently forwarded his name to the White House, where he is 
considered the only candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his close ties to the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People, Administration sources said they expect that the nomination will help 
Clinton mend fences with African American leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Patrick, while nominally a Democrat, has never been especially 
active in politics. With degrees from both Harvard University and Harvard Law 
School, he joined the law firm of Hill & Barlow, one of the largest in New 
England, after working as a law clerk in the early 1980s for Judge Stephen 
Reinhardt of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Harvard but before entering law school, he received a 
grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to travel and study in the Third World, 
including work for the United Nations in Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was one of three finalists that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) 
considered last spring for recommendation as U.S. attorney in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick's father was a jazz musician who traveled widely and once played with 
Thelonious Monk, the celebrated pianist.

BOBBITT JURY RE-ENACTED PRE-CRIME EVENTS; TRIAL: MEMBERS SAY THESE ACTIONS, A 
SEARCH FOR THE WIFE'S THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS, WERE TURNING POINT IN 
DELIBERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA DAVIS and JANE SEABERRY, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the final hours of their deliberations, as they agonized over Lorena 
Bobbitt's state of mind on the night that she severed her husband's penis, the 
jurors kept asking themselves what she must have been thinking and feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 They tried to place themselves in her bedroom, to imagine the moment. They 
decided to re-enact the crime, some of the jurors said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A male juror played the role of Lorena at one point and held the same kitchen 
knife she had used. On a blackboard, he drew a timeline with slash marks for 
the events that had occurred in the 15 minutes before Lorena cut her husband as 
he lay sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wayne Bobbitt was represented by a paper cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it an act of irresistible impulse, as defense attorneys argued? The jurors 
listened, again and again, to the statement Lorena gave police about how her 
husband earlier had raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we did, we realized that this was not a person who was acting in a 
sane manner," juror Jeanne Elmore, 42, said Saturday. "You could see as we were 
reading her words, the emotion building." 
</P>
<P>
 Elmore and four other jurors interviewed Saturday said the re-enactment was a 
turning point in reaching the verdict that the 24-year-old woman was not guilty 
of malicious wounding by reason of temporary insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all 12 jurors did not agree on exactly when Lorena Bobbitt snapped, 
in the end they were unanimous in their belief that she did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt she'd been really abused, a victim," said a juror who asked that her 
name be withheld. "Unfortunately, over a period of time, most of us would be 
able to react" in a more rational way. "We didn't feel she was strong enough. 
She had been stripped of everything at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind in a way," Elmore said, "she went after what threatened her most." 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors said they had no trouble believing the crux of the defense team's 
case. Lorena Bobbitt, they concluded, was raped by her 26-year-old husband in 
the early morning hours of June 23 and then suffered a psychotic breakdown 
brought on by years of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 No one witness or incident convinced them of this, they said. Rather, it was 
the litany of beatings, verbal threats, sodomy and rape that they heard during 
the two-week trial. The couple's friends testified to this abuse, as did 
psychiatrists appearing for the prosecution and defense and Lorena Bobbitt 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe John raped her over the course of the years he was with her," said 
one male juror, who also asked not to be identified. "I think pretty much every 
time they had sex he raped her." 
</P>
<P>
 The juror said that John Bobbitt's acquittal in November on a charge of 
marital sexual assault was no secret to the jury. It was briefly mentioned in 
the jury room, he said, but was given no weight during the 7 1/2 hours of 
deliberations Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interviewed said they believed that John Bobbitt, a witness for the 
prosecution, actually did more to help the defense team. "I thought he was 
basically a liar," Elmore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said another female juror: "There was nothing positive about him. As far as 
his testimony, none of us got a good feeling about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jurors saw Lorena Bobbitt as a victim, they also thought she 
brought problems of her own to the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was not completely guiltless," said a juror, citing what that juror 
called the woman's temper tantrums and immaturity. "They were real bad for each 
other."

TRUCK RUNS OVER AGENT NEAR BORDER CHECKPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A truck loaded with apparent illegal immigrants ran over a Border Patrol agent 
near an immigration checkpoint Thursday night, then flipped after a chase. 
Eighteen people aboard the truck were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck severely crushed agent David Douglas' right leg. Douglas, 24, was in 
critical but stable condition Saturday after surgery at Palomar Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred when California Highway Patrol officers stopped the 
driver of a U-Haul truck at a weighing station that bypasses an immigration 
checkpoint on Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
 They called Douglas to investigate the truck, but the driver knocked him to 
the ground with the door, then ran over his legs as he sped off, said Border 
Patrol Agent Sherry Lane Feltner. 
</P>
<P>
 Border Patrol, CHP and Riverside County sheriff's officials gave chase at 
speeds reaching more than 80 m.p.h. until the truck plunged down an embankment 
and flipped. Officers ripped off the back doors and pulled out 33 screaming 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all packed together sitting, bleeding, moaning, crying. You could 
see the fear in their eyes," said Capt. Paul O'Conner of the California 
Department of Forestry-Riverside County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen people, including the driver, Juan Perez Torrez, were taken to area 
hospitals, officials said. All but one were released to the custody of the 
Border Patrol by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Carasco, 49, was at Riverside General Hospital listed in fair condition 
with a head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Border Patrol agent Mark Mendoza was injured while pulling off the truck's 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, 27, was booked into the Southwest County Jail in French Valley for 
investigation of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer and evading 
arrest. The Border Patrol also planned to file federal charges of smuggling 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was the third involving a rental truck transporting illegal 
immigrants into California this month. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 6, agents stopped a Ryder truck carrying 60 people, and on Jan. 4, a 
Ryder truck carrying about 25 people crashed into a fence, and all but five 
people scattered before agents arrived.

QUAKE MAKES IMPACT ON SERMONS, CHARITY; RELIGION: SPIRITUAL MESSAGES TODAY WILL 
STRESS PREPAREDNESS FOR DISASTERS AND DEATH. COLLECTION PLATES WILL BE PASSED 
TO AID L.A.-AREA VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Many of the faithful who attend Orange County churches today will hear 
messages of spiritual preparedness inspired by Monday's earthquake and will be 
asked to provide prayers and assistance for Los Angeles residents who are 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is prudent to stockpile bottled water and food to survive an 
earthquake, several clergymen said they will tell their flocks that it is also 
important to be ready for death coming unannounced. Spiritual readiness, they 
will warn, cannot be achieved on the spur of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "With earthquakes there is hardly any time to prepare, so you have to be ready 
at every second, and that translates into our spiritual life too," said Pastor 
David Sorensen, associate pastor at Grace Lutheran Church in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically it does teach us that we never know when disaster might strike," 
said Chuck Smith, senior pastor of Calvary Chapel in Santa Ana. "We never know 
when our time is going to come, so it pays to live a right kind of life, not to 
have any unfinished business." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said his sermon today will be about the great value God has placed on 
His people. The thought of God as a father taking watchful care of his 
children, Smith said, is comforting in a catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Sonnenberg, senior pastor of the Village Church of Irvine, said he had 
been discussing Corinthians chapter by chapter, and by sheer coincidence, the 
title of his sermon this week is "Where, Oh Death, is Your Sting." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is helpful to know when the earth starts to shake that even if this is the 
Big One, for us there is life after death," Sonnenberg said. "That doesn't mean 
people won't be scared. But I would rather be scared with hope than scared and 
hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some priests and ministers also will ask their congregations to pray for the 
quake victims of Los Angeles County and to make contributions to provide the 
needy with food, clothing and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hearts and our prayers go out to the many in our Southland whose lives 
have been impacted by the death and destruction of the recent earthquake," 
wrote the Most Rev. Norman F. McFarland, bishop of Orange, in a letter to be 
read today at all Roman Catholic Masses in Orange County. "Once again, we are 
vividly reminded of how fragile is our existence on this earth and how the even 
tenor of our lives can be overturned in an instant. It is a sobering 
realization." 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland calls on Catholics to donate money to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles 
Disaster Fund to help earthquake victims. Each parish should make its own 
decision about whether to take up a special collection, the letter says. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, of Calvary Chapel, said one of the church's ministries already has 
passed out 13,000 blankets to quake victims who are homeless and has ordered 
another shipment of blankets. In addition, he said, the church probably will 
contribute to a fund to help rebuild an affiliated church in Inglewood that was 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonnenberg said the Village Church of Irvine will take up a special offering 
today for earthquake victims and he will "encourage people to help and reach 
out. . . ." He said he expects to give his congregation's donations to a church 
in the San Fernando Valley that can distribute it to those with the most need. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the church efforts, other local organizations have mobilized to 
help their northern neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro Marine Corps Air Station is conducting a canned food drive through 
Thursday for quake victims. The Marines asked residents to drop off donations 
at the air station's main gate at Red Hill and Valencia avenues. Another 
drop-off center for donations of non-perishable food and clothing opened 
Saturday at O'Neil's Moving and Storage, 2061 S. Ritchey St., Santa Ana. The 
center, which is operated by the American Red Cross and Catholic Charities, 
will accept contributions today from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and from 10 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Monday through Friday. Beginning Saturday, the center will scale back, and 
will be open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross spokeswoman Judy Iannaccone said the donation center did not collect 
many donations its first day, but she expects activity will pick up -- about 
150 people called Saturday for directions or to ask which items are most 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Orange County Fire Department stations, all in South County, are 
collecting supplies today for earthquake victims.  
</P>
<P>
 They include Station 19 at 23022 El Toro Road, Lake Forest; Station 22 at 
24001 Paseo de Valencia, Laguna Hills; Station 24, 25862 Marguerite Parkway, 
Mission Viejo; and Station 31 at 22426 Olympiad Road, Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The fire stations are collecting blankets, along with disposable diapers, 
juice, toys and clothing for children. A small group of Orange County 
residents, led by Anaheim restaurant owner Frank Garcia, who also arranges free 
Thanksgiving dinners for the needy, loaded thousands of pounds of food on 
trucks and vans before dawn Saturday, then drove to the San Fernando Valley to 
give it to earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The hastily arranged relief shipment, organized since Thursday, included 200 
cases of eggs, 2,500 tortillas, 200 cases of canned menudo, fruit, vegetables, 
chips, milk and fruit punch, said Garcia, owner of La Casa Garcia Mexican 
restaurant in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking at TV about two days ago and saw everything was a disaster over 
there," Garcia said. "I said, 'Well, thank God we're OK, but what about our 
neighbors over there?' " 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of local branches of the Salvation Army, the Hispanic Chamber of 
Commerce, the League of United Latin American Citizens and Los Amigos of Orange 
County, Garcia and two dozen of his friends purchased, loaded, transported and 
then distributed the food to earthquake victims camping in Canoga Park and 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who paid $8,000 out of his pocket to get the food to Los Angeles right 
away, said his friends have launched a drive to repay him. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County firefighters, physicians, nurses and a search and rescue team 
have also pitched in to help residents deal with the devastation left in the 
wake of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday, most emergency volunteers had returned home, with only about a 
dozen Orange County firefighters and six emergency water trucks remaining in 
Los Angeles on standby. "They are strategically located in case there are 
fires," said Emmy Day, Fire Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Ritter, an emergency medicine physician at UCI Medical Center, drove with 
three other doctors and six nurses to Granada Hills Medical Center on Monday 
morning, followed by another UCI medical team in a helicopter Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 They found hundreds of people injured in the earthquakes waiting at an 
emergency room with only one doctor and a handful of nurses. The hospital was 
flooded, the lights were out and backup generators weren't working. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritter said that when he returned home Tuesday, he was jittery and couldn't 
sleep. But he said he realizes that in Southern California, earthquakes are 
something everyone has to live with and anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have a big earthquake in Orange County," he said, "we're going to see 
the exact same thing."

VIETNAMESE POLITICS OPENS A NEW CHAPTER; CAMPAIGN: JAN. 2 ELECTION FOR 
'PRESIDENT' OF 300,000 SOUTHLAND RESIDENTS WAS INTENDED TO UNIFY COMMUNITY, BUT 
A CLOSE VOTE ONLY ESCALATED INFIGHTING. THE FORMAL WINNER WILL BE DECLARED 
TODAY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fierce campaign for the hearts and minds of the people of Little Saigon 
officially ended early this month. 
</P>
<P>
 On a brisk Sunday morning, more than 5,000 Vietnamese filed patiently past a 
bank of computers at a high school gymnasium to pick a "president" to champion 
the Vietnamese of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the symbolic election was to anoint a leader who could unite the 
splintered factions of the nearly 300,000 residents of Vietnamese descent 
scattered through Southern California into a solid political force, and to take 
control of a cash-poor organization that had closed its offices and had been 
largely moribund because of infighting for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the immediate result was an old-fashioned political slugfest featuring 
impassioned debate, mudslinging, flag-waving, patriotic declarations, 
Communist-bashing and accusations of physical threats. 
</P>
<P>
 And the photo finish has been as controversial as the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 One vanquished candidate -- a Pomona pediatrician who lost by a slim margin of 
82 votes -- challenged the outcome, leveling charges of voting irregularities 
that will be aired today at a four-hour hearing at a Vietnamese club. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning candidate, Ban Binh Bui, a charismatic Little Saigon businessman 
in suspenders and matching tie, is savoring victory, but worrying about 
retaliation. He has increased his insurance to cover any losses due to 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 All this effort is for a presidential post promising a two-year term with hazy 
powers, a minimal budget and decidedly mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics complain privately that this presidential post sends confusing 
messages to many new immigrants who believe they are voting for a government in 
exile. But supporters insist an election was necessary to give leaders the 
status and credibility to represent the Vietnamese American viewpoint in likely 
negotiations to lift the trade embargo and restore diplomatic relations with 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade issue is a particularly sensitive theme in Southern California. The 
burgeoning Vietnamese population in Orange County -- centered in Little 
Saigon's thriving commercial area in Westminster and Garden Grove -- is 
regarded as the largest concentration outside Vietnam. And within the Little 
Saigon community the delicate issue of normalization has prompted 
demonstrations, hunger strikes and even vandalism aimed at businessman who 
dared to support restoration of trade.  
</P>
<P>
 For the record, all three tickets fielding candidates for president opposed 
lifting the trade embargo. But even so, they were poised for change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are living here, but we are still thinking about our country," said Bui, 
the apparent president-elect and leader of the winning slate of 14 cabinet 
officers dubbed Ticket No. 3. "Our main issue with normalization is that when 
people to start making decisions they should understand what we're thinking 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget -- we're here." 
</P>
<P>
 If Bui actually is formally declared the winner today by a volunteer election 
committee, the Westminster businessman and his slate will assume control of the 
Vietnamese of Southern California organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in the late 1980s, the group held informal elections in 1989 at a 
supermarket parking lot in Westminster to select leaders. According to local 
Vietnamese political observers, this latest election was the first time the 
group had tried to create an elaborate campaign and election system that 
included computerized voter registration and frequent debates on Little Saigon 
radio and Vietnamese-language television shows.  
</P>
<P>
 Chau Tue Carey, a lawyer from Vietnam, said she agreed to head a volunteer 
committee to organize the election because she considered it an opportunity to 
educate new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to teach the Vietnamese community about what is democracy," she said. 
"And we wanted a representative for the community who could represent most of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 But during early attempts to revive the organization, some Vietnamese people 
privately lobbied against such a formal election. Critics questioned how a 
group could represent Southern California without polling places in Los 
Angeles, Riverside and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I'm against it," said one prominent Vietnamese resident who 
refused to participate. "I have my elected officials who represent me in the 
(state) Legislature, so I don't see the need. People cannot just represent the 
Southern California Vietnamese American community. Why did they do this? We're 
in a very transitional situation because of the forthcoming normalization and 
they wanted to be able to speak. Frankly, I think it's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The role of the new president is not very clear and some critics worry that 
the leadership could try to usurp the powers of the only local elected official 
of Vietnamese descent, Westminster City Councilman Tony Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam himself has qualms, but said he is willing to work for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an advocate of unity," Lam said. "I think it's deplorable that some 
groups can't admit defeat. It will be embarrassing to have continued division 
in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that the way the election was conducted was not really professional 
and it leaves room for complaint. But this is significant because for the first 
time so many people realized that they should try to come together." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the tickets that vied for the presidency were dominated by immigrant 
businessmen such as Bui and Huu Dinh Vo, the Pomona physician that headed the 
Ticket No. 1 slate. The third slate was formed by young Vietnamese 
professionals who were raised and educated in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have the kind of money or support as the other tickets, but we were 
trying to send the message that the younger generation should be involved," 
said Chung Hu Nguyen, a computer analyst with ambitions to run for Congress. 
"We were trying to raise excitement."  
</P>
<P>
 But it was the older generation that provoked the most controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Their free-wheeling debates wandered from arguments about homelessness and 
youth gangs to a magazine writer's controversial suggestion that the national 
anthem for South Vietnam should be dumped ("Over my dead body," one candidate 
declared.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We also talked about health care," said Thang Tuong, a member of Bui's 
winning slate. "Many of the Vietnamese don't have medical care and we need to 
help them. We also questioned each other about how strongly opposed we were to 
communism. We talked about the embargo and how we could bring about democracy 
in Vietnam. " 
</P>
<P>
 Before one forum, a shouting match erupted over whether candidates could 
debate each other directly. Steamed over the procedural shift, one slate 
candidate made a comment about rich people that Bui interpreted as a threat to 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 When election day finally dawned on Jan. 2 at Bolsa Grande High School, the 
real political battle was waged by the older pols who engaged in a fierce drive 
to get out the vote. The victorious slate, headed by Bui, hired van drivers who 
ferried voters to the high school. Some participants noted that Bui's slate -- 
which included several Catholic candidates -- was aided by the fortuitous 
arrival of worshipers leaving Sunday Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Early the following morning, Bui's group was declared the winner with 2,273 
votes, with Vo's slate close behind with 2,191 votes and the younger Vietnamese 
group trailing with 622. 
</P>
<P>
 Bui's razor-thin victory set the stage for yet another round of political 
firefights. 
</P>
<P>
 Vo's slate complained that the voting was allowed to continue 40 minutes past 
the scheduled closing time of 6 p.m. They also questioned a 162-vote 
discrepancy between the tally of the computer registration list and the actual 
vote. Some demanded a runoff election between the top finishers. The winners 
countered that Vo's slate had agreed to the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, Vo remained circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is appropriate to discuss until a decision is made 
Sunday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, Bui remained diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm waiting for the election committee to take a stand. But I'm sure that no 
one is going to go against the will of 5,000 people on Jan. 2," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday night, Bui and his cabinet officers gathered in their spare new 
headquarters at Brookhurst Square to launch their first project, a collection 
drive for earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 As they loaded the bags of canned goods and sodas, they passed under a 
campaign banner still draped across the white-washed shopping mall that housed 
their office.  
</P>
<P>
 The slogan expressed their wistful hope: "United together we will serve."

DANA PARSONS: THE VERDICT IS IN: MOCKING EXPRESSION IS MY BEST DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's all just one big masquerade ball, isn't it? You think it's real life, but 
everywhere you look, harlequins and farceurs dominate the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 How else to explain this thing we call modern-day America? 
</P>
<P>
 It's been written of the ancient Greek philosopher Democritus that he found 
the human condition so ridiculous he never appeared in public without a mocking 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
 America has never imitated Athens as much as today. Should any of us step 
outside these days without a mocking expression to shield us? 
</P>
<P>
 Never have things been less like they seem. If you can handle a world where 
all bets are off, you've come to the right place. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week came the news that 12 people couldn't convict Erik Menendez of 
murder. The jury deadlocked after a couple weeks, and a mistrial was declared. 
Jurors couldn't find it in their hearts to convict a son who fired a shotgun 
blast into his mother's head as she tried to crawl away. Although we don't know 
the exact jury tally, some or all of the 12 apparently accepted Erik's claim 
that he felt endangered by his parents the night he and his brother killed 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 As of this writing, Lyle Menendez's jury still is deliberating, apparently 
stumped by the situation, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 To many of us, it is almost stupefying that the brothers haven't been 
convicted by now. Even if we accept their pronouncements against their father, 
what about Mom ? Apparently, putting someone out of their misery with a shotgun 
is now a legal defense in this state. Life is now so cheap that murdering your 
mother can be explained away. 
</P>
<P>
 And since we know that life is that cheap, imagine what a lousy old penis is 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest there be any doubt, the Lorena Bobbitt jury answered that one for us last 
week. To avoid the inevitable snickers, the jurors probably took a sacred oath 
early on not to come back a hung jury. With the pressure on, therefore, they 
only took several hours to find that Mrs. Bobbitt wasn't criminally responsible 
for dismembering her husband as he slept. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the Menendez brothers argued a form of self-defense, so did Lorena 
Bobbitt -- with surprising success. I say surprising, because her self-defense 
claim required the jury to believe her when she said that one reason she took 
such drastic action was that her husband had said he would track her down and 
rape her if she ever left him. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem with that logic, it seems to me, is that dismembering him did 
nothing to keep him from tracking her down. Indeed, you would think it would 
make him much more motivated to track her down, even with the alleged rape 
threat no longer a viable option. The jury apparently didn't dwell on such 
things, however, perhaps convinced that John Bobbitt was a brute and that, what 
the heck, the darn thing got sewed back on anyway, so what's the big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Lorena Bobbitt's attorney, Lisa Kemler, said, "This case was not about 
a penis." To which men across America offer the hearty rejoinder: "Easy for you 
to say!" 
</P>
<P>
 I must be succumbing to the acceptance of brutality myself, because I can't 
say with much earnestness that I wanted to see Lorena Bobbitt in jail for 
several years. I'm somewhat assuaged by the prosecutors, who conceded that John 
Bobbitt was an abusive husband -- although that must rankle Mr. Bobbitt 
inasmuch as a jury acquitted him on such charges two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy of these cases, of course, remains to be written. They are surely 
not going to be legal comets that only show up once every 75 years. One fears 
they will begin showing up once every 75 days. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, battered wives have been able to persuade juries that they 
acted in self-defense when they were, in fact, under assault. Taking the 
offensive while your husband sleeps opens up a whole new vista of 
possibilities. On the other hand, if that puts the fear of God into abusive 
husbands, so be it and amen. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Menendez brothers, I eagerly await hearing from their respective 
juries. How two men of their ages could have felt so threatened that they 
killed their parents is a defense I had passed off as pathetic grasping until 
Erik Menendez's jury deadlocked over it. God only knows how many wheels are 
spinning in other troubled kids' heads as they follow the brothers' trials. 
</P>
<P>
 As for me, I am going to try and follow the example of Democritus. In that 
vein, is it too much to ask that Lorena Bobbitt someday meets the Menendez 
brothers at a singles' convention? 
</P>
<P>
 And with that, I must go. The Mocking Expression store is about to close, and 
I must pick up my wares.

ROHRABACHER PROPOSES LEGISLATION TO DENY FEDERAL QUAKE RELIEF TO ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants who suffered losses in the Northridge earthquake should not 
receive federal relief funds, U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 An outspoken critic of illegal immigration into Southern California, 
Rohrabacher said he plans to introduce legislation that will require disaster 
victims to show proof of legal residency before receiving funds from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the people of California to understand that hundreds of millions of 
dollars that should be going to them as citizens and legal residents are 
instead going to illegal aliens, and it's absolutely outrageous," said 
Rohrabacher, who believes that federal policies encourage illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once people realize that there is free money available, the line will be 
never-ending and will reach all the way to the border," the three-term 
congressman added. 
</P>
<P>
 An immigrant-rights activist called Rohrabacher's comments racist Saturday, 
accusing him of trying to further his political career on the backs of illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think that there was anyone that cruel," said Arturo Montes, state 
director of urban affairs for the League of United Latin American Citizens. 
"This is a situation where someone is drowning and he wants to say, 'Show me 
some ID before I rescue you,' " Montes said. "This is racist, and it's worse 
than those people selling a loaf of bread for $10," Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman said he was aware that his comments would bring some 
criticism, but said he believes that federal funds should go only to legal 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that there are limited amounts of emergency funds in the 
country," said Rohrabacher, who added that his comments are in keeping with a 
longstanding position against illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not kicking anybody when they are up or down. I'm saying we have to use 
our hearts, but we have to use our heads," he said.

SCOTT HARRIS: HE TAKES RECOVERY ONE PUTT AT A TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He lives -- or rather, lived -- in a Granada Hills condominium complex called 
Rinaldi Village. He works -- or rather, worked -- at a Van Nuys aerospace firm 
called Kaiser Marquardt. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many people, Steve Lomas, 53, was dealt a double dose of trouble by the 
events of 4:31 a.m. Monday. His condo has been judged uninhabitable. And Kaiser 
Marquardt, which builds thruster engines for the space shuttle, suffered so 
much damage that employees have been placed on indefinite furlough. Lomas has 
already applied for unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Lomas' damage exceeds the norm. But last Friday, Lomas didn't join the 
multitudes seeking aid from FEMA, the city's Building and Safety Department or 
local charities. He had another way to find relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Lomas played golf. "This," he explained, "is where I'm happiest." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you play the game, you might think it strange, even inconsiderate, that 
people would be golfing at a time of crisis. Much of Los Angeles lay in ruins 
-- and yet some Angelenos insist on going out and having fun and acting as if 
nothing whatsoever is wrong in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what they say about golfers," said Dave Williamson, working the 
starter window at Griffith Park. "If Charlie drops dead on the tee, you hit the 
ball and drag Charlie." 
</P>
<P>
 This was true even on Monday, even at daybreak, just a couple of hours after 
all of Los Angeles was violently awakened to a world of wreckage and darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Leyra of Sunland told this story over a mug of beer at the proverbial 
19th hole. The quake shakes him awake. At dawn, he's driving to work through 
Pacoima. To his amazement, a foursome is strolling down the first fairway at 
Hansen Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, man, that's crazy," Leyra said. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend corrected him. "They're dedicated," Ian Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, plenty of people canceled reservations. Last week, the Recreation and 
Parks Department was kind enough to forgive the usual $2 penalty for golfers 
who fail to show up at their appointed times. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Paz, a teaching pro and shop assistant at Griffith Park, said some 
friends played on the Wilson course on Monday, taking advantage of the 
no-shows. Besides, they figured, is there a safer place to be? 
</P>
<P>
 "They said that after a big aftershock, they could hear the trees kind of 
cracking. They figured if they kept the ball on the fairway, there'd be no 
problem," Paz said. 
</P>
<P>
 If what Paz says is true, this is one golfer who is glad he waited until 
Friday to return to the links. My game is too wild to brave cracking trees. I'm 
more of a duffer than a golfer -- the kind of player who requires just one 
sweet shot to keep coming back for more abuse. For years to come, I'll remember 
just one thing about Friday's round -- a four-iron that soared 185 yards in a 
perfect arc and settled 18 inches from the pin. Damn near got an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 19th hole, I made the mistake of asking Leyra, Franklin and their pal, 
Bob Baldridge, about their scores. Leyra and Franklin both shot 85s. Baldridge 
shot an 87. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to use that," Baldridge said, "be sure to mention that it's 
the first time either of these guys beat me. I'm proud of them." 
</P>
<P>
 They did high-fives and ordered another round.  
</P>
<P>
 Then Baldridge turned to me: "What'd you shoot?" 
</P>
<P>
 I was too embarrassed to be specific. Rather than boasting of my magnificent 
four-iron, I told them about a two-foot birdie putt that was headed straight 
for the cup, then suddenly broke right. That putt cost me a birdie and four 
skins. 
</P>
<P>
 "You choked!" Baldridge said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Naw. 
</P>
<P>
 Must have been an aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were, in fact, several strong aftershocks Friday, including ones that 
measured 4.7 and 4.6 on the Richter scale. Had I been at our Chatsworth office 
just a few miles from the epicenter, I may well have been diving under my desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I was hacking away on the Woodrow Wilson course. And I didn't feel a 
single aftershock. Neither did my partners. So what if it wasn't such a great 
round? It was an excellent, if temporary, antidote to the tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lot to be said for putting your troubles on hold and seeking a 
silver lining. Yes, we have earthquakes -- but we also play golf in January. 
Back East, they just freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Lomas -- his home unlivable, his job in peril -- found a couple of 
reasons to smile. Lomas, a UCLA graduate, says it's nice to see Bruin 
basketball back on top. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his golf game, he shot a 79. 
</P>
<P>
 He said this with a shrug and a hint of a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shot my handicap," he said. No wonder he's happiest on the golf course.

RUMBLING EARTH DOESN'T CRUMBLE REUNION PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire brought them together, and an earthquake wasn't going to keep them apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Barbara and Dave Norton, whose home was destroyed in the Oct. 27 
Laguna firestorm, have vowed to hold their long-planned reunion today to help 
their former USC classmates, despite new hardships for some in the group from 
Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still want to raise anyone and everyone's spirits after these disasters," 
said Susan Frisk of Seal Beach, who helped organize the party in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Frisk and Nancy Blair, sorority sisters of Barbara Norton at USC's Gamma Phi 
Beta in the late 1960s and early '70s, said they started planning the reunion 
soon after learning of their friend's disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Frisk had seen the Nortons' Caribbean Way address in the newspaper, listed 
among the more than 400 homes destroyed or damaged by the firestorm. Others had 
seen the Nortons on television the morning after the fire, sifting through the 
rubble of their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Word spread quickly. All wanted to help in some way. A reunion was planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came Monday's Northridge quake, which devastated many parts of Los 
Angeles and complicated travel throughout the region. Nevertheless, Frisk, 
Blair and the 50 others expected to attend the reunion decided that it should 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all need to be together," said Blair, who is helping to organize the party 
in her hometown. "Everyone needs a little calming and reassuring. I thought it 
would be fun to look forward to something good for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Norton said she was "blown away" that her friends, some of whom she 
hasn't seen in nearly 25 years, didn't want to cancel the reunion following the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something, the way people put their own needs on the back burner during 
a tragedy," she said. "You really see the best in people." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family from points throughout Southern California, including Santa 
Monica, Tarzana and other locations in the earthquake zone, plan to attend the 
reunion. None of the friends traveling from the San Fernando Valley lost their 
homes in the earthquake, although some of their houses sustained damage, Frisk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Nortons lost their address book in the fire, Blair and Frisk were 
able to track down many of the couple's college classmates. Barbara Norton 
graduated from USC in 1971 with a bachelor's degree in journalism and public 
relations. Dave Norton also finished his undergraduate work at USC in 1970 and 
graduated in 1974 from the USC School of Dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Invitations to the party call on family and friends to "Raise Our Spirits in 
'94!" and help the Nortons get started again. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Nortons, who lost nearly everything in the fire, the most treasured 
gifts friends will bring are pictures of the couple from their college days. 
Blair and Frisk have also put together an address book. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nortons said said they can hardly wait for the party, a much-welcomed 
break from the demands of trying to rebuild. The couple and their two sons, 
ages 11 and 17, have moved three times since the fire. And each day brings new 
wrangling over such things as insurance coverage, banking and city building 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you feel really good that all your friends are thinking of you and 
want to help," Dave Norton said.

STATE LAWMAKERS WARN THEY WON'T STAND STILL FOR EARTHQUAKE TAX HIKE; 
LEGISLATURE: THE LOCAL DELEGATION IS ALREADY VOICING CRITICISM OF PROPOSED 
INCREASES TO FIX THE FREEWAYS. MANY SAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD SHOULDER 
MUCH OF THE REPAIR COST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As state legislators scramble for money to repair earthquake-damaged freeways 
in Los Angeles, they face one near certainty: If it comes down to a tax hike, 
the Orange County delegation won't provide much support. 
</P>
<P>
 With the state on the brink of insolvency even before the temblor struck, 
legislative leaders have proposed a variety of tax increases to raise revenue 
for quake repairs. But lawmakers from Orange County, though sympathetic to the 
plight of their neighbor to the north, heartily object. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earth hasn't even stopped shaking and we're talking about tax increases," 
said Assemblyman Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside), whose district includes a swath of 
South County. "Hold the phone. Not so fast. We'll never get out of this hole if 
we keep taxing ourselves deeper." 
</P>
<P>
 While estimates of damage from the quake run as high as $30 billion, 
authorities remain unsure just how much it will cost to fix the freeways, 
including major bridge collapses along Interstate 5 and the Santa Monica 
Freeway, the world's busiest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Californians are very resilient, but they're beginning to feel we have four 
seasons -- flood, drought, fire and earthquake, with every leap year a riot," 
said Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). "The economic costs are 
unbelievable, and the desire of government to right every wrong is really 
stretching the state's pocketbook." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the ultimate price tag for the earthquake repairs, it will be huge -- 
big enough that Democrats are floating a range of ways to raise new revenue, 
among them a temporary quarter-cent sales tax increase, a gasoline tax hike or 
a $2-billion bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Orange County lawmakers say they are willing to look at a bond 
measure, but none want any part of a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every solution is tax," complained Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange). "I 
think new taxes should be the last resort, not the first thing out of our 
mouths. We have taxed ourselves almost out of existence as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton) suggested the idea of a "temporary" 
sales tax hike is dubious given recent history. After the Loma Prieta 
earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989, the Legislature 
imposed a half-cent tax for repairs. Today, much of the work still isn't done 
-- and the tax has been made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look what happened before," Johnson said. "You know that saying: Fool me 
once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. I'd be very hesitant there." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the state should push hard on the federal government to bear the cost 
of fixing the freeways, Johnson said, noting that Congress financed relief 
efforts after Hurricane Andrew in Florida and last year's Midwest floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears the federal government stepped to the plate and took care of those 
problems," Johnson said. "Given that, I would certainly feel it's entirely too 
premature to look at increasing taxes in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many state lawmakers from Orange County see opportunity amid the 
misery of the quake to push some of the conservative ideas they have long 
espoused. They want to cut regulations and see the state tighten its budgetary 
belt to pay for repair work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to start all over with the budget," said Sen. John R. Lewis 
(R-Orange). "We have to re-examine everything, look for savings and 
efficiencies across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Others suggest that the state should suspend environmental permit requirements 
that could slow freeway reconstruction. "You shouldn't have to get an 
environmental impact report to rebuild a freeway that was already there," 
reasoned Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove). "We've got to get rid of 
this legal and environmental morass that will hold this work up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) has already introduced legislation to reduce 
the "prevailing wage" for quake-related public work projects. That legislation 
was defeated in committee the week before the earthquake. Hurtt estimated that 
the drop in wages could mean a savings of about 20% on most projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats are sitting there saying, 'Raise taxes,' " Hurtt groused. "But 
this is the perfect opportunity to make some fundamental changes and stop 
adding to our already bloated state government." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt also suggests the state adopt across-the-board cuts to pay for repair 
work, reasoning that "if everyone takes a hit, that will alleviate the chances 
of special interests pounding away on us" with complaints of unfair treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Democrat-dominated Legislature has scoffed at such proposals, 
but Orange County lawmakers say the earthquake and looming budget crisis could 
combine to change attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think opportunities are created when a crisis is there," Pringle said. 
"This is a crisis. It may spur many of those who have opposed these ideas to 
consider them."

C-O-A-L-I-T-I-O-N SPELLS RELIEF; AID: VICTIMS OF THE OCT. 27 FIRE CAN FIND 
COUNSELING, CLOTHING AND A 'CONNECTION CENTER' AT THE LAGUNA FIRE RELIEF 
COALITION, WHICH RECENTLY OPENED ITS NEW HEADQUARTERS.

 Surrounded by piles of donated supplies at the Laguna Beach fire relief 
center, John Velasquez stood clutching a box of oatmeal and a sack of pasta to 
his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 minutes later, he was wrestling with a large box filled with goods, 
including bathroom tissue, a hair brush and a new sweater. Almost everything he 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably have to go to Sav-On for the sponge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez, whose home burned to the ground in the massive Oct. 27 fire, is one 
of the about 400 survivors who have signed up for support with the Laguna Fire 
Relief Coalition, a group formed after the blaze that destroyed 366 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Vowing to stick together for as long as needed, the coalition opened its new 
headquarters recently and soon afterward launched its first project of 1994 -- 
distributing identification cards to fire survivors that may help them get 
discounts from local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we realized the recovery was going to take more time and mean a lot more 
effort than feeding people and handing out food in the immediate aftermath, 
everyone involved realized we better dig in for the long haul," said Anita 
Mangels, director of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The group is composed of representatives from community, church, business and 
artist groups that began meeting at Laguna Presbyterian Church two days after 
the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of the devastating 1991 Oakland fire showed the demand for relief 
services did not peak until about seven months after the disaster, Mangels 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition secretary Doug Landrum said the Laguna group's food and supply 
distribution center in the Boat Canyon shopping center, which now serves as its 
headquarters, has become a regular stop for fire survivors who need continuing 
support 2 1/2 months after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some come in daily, others come in every three or four days," he said. "There 
are people who just have not gotten to the point where they feel like they can 
deal with all the issues they're going to have to deal with to recover their 
lives after the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the center helped distribute Christmas toys and about 90 turkeys, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez said stopping at the relief center fills a variety of needs for fire 
survivors like him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come here there's a sense of respect and a sense of courtesy. You 
feel welcome. . . . A lot of it is psychological. Coming here (is) much easier 
than going to a grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just the material things but the connection," he added. "It's become 
kind of a connection center." 
</P>
<P>
 Also stopping for supplies one day last week were Brenda Kirby and her 
husband, who lost their Mystic Hills home in the blaze and are renting an 
apartment in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been down here quite regularly, usually about once a week," she said. 
"We've been given T-shirts, food, clothing. At Christmas, they gave us turkey 
and ham. The people have been very generous and very wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition board member Joe Orsak, who is also this city's Chamber of Commerce 
president, hopes to involve all city businesses in the relief group's latest 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been soliciting our members and requesting they offer some kind of 
discount to fire victims if they shop in their stores," Orsak said. "We will be 
putting out a flyer to all the businesses asking they do this for our residents 
and our neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Sauls, an environmental consultant who helped found the coalition, said the 
group's "unmet needs committee" is evaluating how to help survivors in the 
future. "We're going to consider what those needs might be over the next 12 to 
24 months and direct the organization to provide those services." 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members say those who require ongoing help include victims who had 
no insurance or were underinsured, those who need temporary housing and those 
struggling to qualify for loans or grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have close to 400 families and individuals signed up for fire relief," 
Mangels said. "They may not need to go into facilities on a frequent basis, but 
they're certainly availing themselves of the services on a consistent basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the relief effort, professional counselors are continuing to 
staff a hot line for fire survivors. But counselor Judy Albert said calls have 
dwindled since just before the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones we get are really worthwhile and needy, but they're few and far 
between," she said. "It's a proud community, so it's hard to know if people are 
just getting good neighborhood support." The telephone number for both the 
coalition center and crisis counseling is (714) 376-9288. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, a nonprofit group which incorporated last month, also has in 
place a "survivor care program" under which volunteers "adopt" several families 
or individuals, making sure they know when new help becomes available and are 
kept abreast of information such as the dates of insurance seminars or 
deadlines for filing claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect that, judging by the Oakland experience, we will probably continue 
for about two years to provide various kinds of assistance," Landrum said. 
</P>
<P>
 While a federal grant helps provide the crisis counseling, Mangels said the 
group will hold fund-raisers and solicit grants to help pay for other services, 
which they estimate will cost about $800,000 in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire victims can also get help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
and the state's Office of Emergency Services, which has an office next door to 
the coalition's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most valuable things Velasquez has collected from the coalition's 
center were two philosophy books. Velasquez, a philosophy instructor at Rancho 
Santiago College in Santa Ana, said he lost all of his books in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I discovered one day, 'I have no books,' and I felt so impoverished," he 
said. "It's not just food for the body but food for the soul we get from a 
place like this."

APPLIANCE WORKER ARRESTED IN ALLEGED MURDER ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An employee at an Orange County appliance store was arrested on suspicion of 
attempted murder Saturday after he allegedly shot a customer with whom he had 
argued inside the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a situation that just went way out of control," Garden Grove Police 
Sgt. Joe Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the dispute began when the employee, identified as Andrew Ban, 
waited on a customer just before taking a lunch break at the Orange County 
Appliance Parts store in the 10000 block of Stanford Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not know the reason for the argument, but said it spilled into the 
store's parking lot about 12:35 p.m., when customer James Vincent Lannon 
followed Ban outside to his car. The customer allegedly yanked Ban out of the 
car and began fighting with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said Ban then pulled out a .38-caliber revolver and fired one shot, 
hitting Lannon in the leg. Both men were still at the scene when police 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Ban, 30, of Huntington Beach, was taken into custody. Lannon, 37, of Corona, 
was transported to UCI Medical Center, where he was listed in stable condition.

TWO HOMES TO MOVE INTO NEW BUENA PARK HISTORICAL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remnants of Buena Park's past will get a permanent home in a newly created 
historical district on Beach Boulevard, across from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, acting as the Community Redevelopment Agency, on Tuesday 
unanimously approved relocating two historic homes from their current park site 
on Manchester Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitaker-Jaynes estate was built at the site in 1887 by Andrew Whitaker, 
the brother of the city's founder, James A. Whitaker. The Bacon House, a 
squatter's shack built sometime in the 1850s, was moved to the site from its 
original location on Beach Boulevard. The city owns both homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving the historic homes will make way for expansion of the city's auto 
dealerships along Manchester Boulevard, next to the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved the plan to establish a historical district as well 
as to purchase the property where the homes will be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Total cost of the project is $568,000; the money will come from the 
Redevelopment Agency. The new site for the homes is within a redevelopment 
project area. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Dixon, a board member of the Buena Park Historical Society, told the 
council that its members support the move in order to preserve what's left of 
the city's past. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think (the council) has shown foresight and leadership that will further 
the cause for historic preservation," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon said some people believe the Whitaker-Jaynes home should remain at its 
original site. He said a purist in historical preservation believes that moving 
a building from its original site diminishes its historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dixon said that tearing down the homes would be worse than moving them. In 
addition, moving the houses will increase security for the structures and 
collections inside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The houses will be in a controlled situation instead of a public park," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The historical district will be on the west side of Beach Boulevard, between 
9th and 10th streets, south of the Santa Ana Freeway. Other landmark structures 
in the area include the First Congregational Church and the former Stage Stop 
Hotel, now a residence. These structures and possibly other buildings may be 
included in the historical district. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon said the historical society will continue to give tours of the homes 
once they are moved; plans are also underway to create a walking tour of the 
area. DEBRA CANO

FINDINGS WILL BE RELEASED ON FIREFIGHTERS UNION PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The investigation of Paul Gilbrook, the president of the Westminster 
Firefighters Assn., has been completed, and the findings will be released next 
week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Atlas of the law firm Liebert, Cassidy & Frierson, the city's labor 
lawyer who conducted the investigation, will probably submit his 
recommendations to Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. on Monday, according to City 
Atty. Richard Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco could fire Gilbrook or not discipline him, depending on the outcome 
of the investigation, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook, a fire truck engineer, was investigated for allegedly driving a fire 
engine with a suspended driver's license in February and for allegedly cashing 
in sick leave that he had used. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been suspended with pay since Dec. 28 while his case was investigated. 
He remains suspended with pay, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook insists that he did nothing wrong and that the charges against him 
were made to silence him for his vocal support of a recall drive against Mayor 
Charles V. Smith and three other City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally feel that this so-called investigation is a circus," Gilbrook 
said. "But (city officials) will try to terminate me, so people will say there 
is corruption in the (Fire) Department and they will not sign the recall 
petition." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the firefighters union are circulating a petition to recall 
Smith and council members Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Gilbrook is separate from the inquiry being conducted by 
the Orange County district attorney's office into charges of widespread 
overtime fraud in the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 An audit of city's financial records indicated that in six years, the Fire 
Department has incurred more than $4 million in overtime costs, including 
nearly $300,000 during a 10-week span from July to September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have asked the district attorney to investigate whether the 
overtime charges were made fraudulently and, if so, who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook acknowledged that his driver's license was suspended for 30 days, 
starting Feb. 12, 1993, following a drunk-driving conviction. He said he could 
not remember if he had driven a fire engine between Feb. 12 and 18, when he 
took a one-month leave, which city officials approved. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that the system has built-in checks to catch irregularities. BERT

TRAINING SITES TO BE ANNOUNCED; SOCCER: OXNARD COLLEGE A LIKELY FACILITY FOR 
CAMEROON WORLD CUP TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The soccer team from Cameroon, one of three African nations that will 
participate in this summer's World Cup, is expected to use Oxnard College as a 
training site during first-stage competition in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup Organizing Committee this week officially will announce team 
training sites, including four in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee already has submitted to FIFA, the sport's worldwide governing 
body, a list of the training sites selected by the competing countries, and the 
committee is awaiting FIFA approval. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an informed source, Colombia will train at Cal State Fullerton, 
Sweden at UC Irvine and Romania at Loyola Marymount. Those three teams, 
Cameroon and the United States will play first-stage matches at the Rose Bowl 
beginning in mid-June. The U.S. team will continue to train at its Mission 
Viejo complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon and Colombia also will play first-stage matches at Stanford Stadium 
in Palo Alto, and the United States, Sweden and Romania also will play at the 
Pontiac Silverdome outside Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The team from Cameroon, known as the Indomitable Lions, will play in Group B 
during the first stage with Brazil, Russia and Sweden. The United States, 
Romania, Colombia and Switzerland will play in Group A. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the four foreign teams that will be based in the Southland 
toured the training sites in late December and told the organizing committee 
which they preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the three delegations that visited us seemed to have the same 
priorities," said Jorge Brescia, Oxnard College men's soccer coach. "One team 
placed more importance on the swimming pool, another was more interested in the 
tennis courts." 
</P>
<P>
 Brescia, a former player and coach in his native Argentina, is a member of the 
group that made its pitch to the World Cup Organizing Committee on the school's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the training site at Oxnard will feature two adjacent world-class 
soccer fields with Bermuda turf. One will have bleachers and both will be 
fenced. School officials hope to have lights installed on at least one of the 
fields, although none of the teams that inspected the facilities requested 
lighting. The Cameroon team would stay at an Oxnard hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Brescia said the Oxnard group is trying to raise construction funds through 
the private sector, although the city of Oxnard has guaranteed $60,000 toward 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The site must be ready by late May, when the teams are scheduled to start 
arriving in the United States. After the monthlong 24-team tournament concludes 
with the championship match at the Rose Bowl on July 17, the Oxnard fields will 
be used by local teams and leagues, Brescia said.

MOTIVATED BUYERS FUELING SURGE IN O.C. HOME SALES; REAL ESTATE: FIRST-TIME AND 
MOVE-UP SHOPPERS FOUND ENOUGH INCENTIVES FOR A 1.1% INCREASE IN 1993, A REASON 
FOR OPTIMISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly four moribund years, Orange County's housing market seems poised 
for a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 A gradual increase in home-sales activity late last summer was clearly a trend 
by the final quarter of 1993: Figures just released show that nearly 31,000 
homes, condos and townhouses changed hands during the year. Almost two-thirds 
of those transactions were in the last half of the year. That strong finish 
pushed 1993 ahead of 1992 by 1.1% for the county's first annual home-sales 
increase since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 A window of opportunity for buyers has opened because home prices have been 
falling since the recession began three years ago, and interest rates are the 
lowest in more than a decade. An economic recovery would slam that window by 
pushing up property values -- and that possibility is prompting potential 
buyers to act now. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rushing in are as diverse as Enrique and Cecilia Farias, who are about 
to close escrow on a duplex in central Santa Ana and will become landlords 
where they previously rented; and Jeff and Lia Brouelette, who recently moved 
out of a Costa Mesa apartment and into a townhouse in Foothill Ranch, one of 
South Orange County's newest planned communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing (sales) improvements in almost all the price ranges," said 
James Righeimer, a Fountain Valley real estate broker. "It begins at the 
starter level because people are finally seeing that what they can buy that 
first-time home for is so much cheaper than it was just a few years ago. And 
when the first-timers buy, the people they buy from become move-up buyers and 
the market starts recovering." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Farias says he is "very, very happy" to be part of that turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 The 34-year-old beverage buyer for Newport Beach Country Club has rented ever 
since moving here from Mexico 15 years ago. But he has always wanted to buy, 
and, though his gross income is only $24,000 a year, he has been setting aside 
money every month. Several years ago he used most of his savings to buy a home 
in his native Sahuayo -- a town about two hours south of Guadalajara. That 
investment enabled Farias and his wife, Cecilia, 34, to move quickly when the 
owner of the Santa Ana duplex they rent defaulted on his loan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fariases got in touch with real estate agent Ernesto Campos, who 
specializes in foreclosed properties for Century 21 Casa Grande Realty in Santa 
Ana and was representing Home Savings of America in the sale of the duplex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have looked before," Enrique Farias said, "but I found that the ads didn't 
always tell the truth. I would go to see the salesman, and he would tell me all 
kinds of other costs that were not in the ad, so I couldn't qualify. But this 
one was all there." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Farias said, he probably wouldn't have made an offer had it not been 
for Campos' assurance that he could become a homeowner and a landlord at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of duplexes and multiple units for sale and in foreclosure" 
in central Orange County, Campos said, "and whenever I can I encourage people 
to get into one so they can be investors, too." A majority of such units are 
low enough in price that they qualify for backing by the Federal Housing 
Administration, Campos said, "and FHA gives higher loan limits for duplexes, so 
it can be easier to qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 Latino buyers have made up a sizable chunk of central Orange County's 
first-time market in the past year, Campos said. "For the most part, our buyers 
are pretty conservative. They are really scared about that first home. We see 
as we fill out loan applications that these are buyers who have no credit 
cards, they pay everything in cash, and their down payments usually come from 
savings. My job is to educate them to the benefits of buying." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Fariases, Campos put together a plan that called for the couple to buy 
in partnership with Enrique Farias' brother, Alberto. Combining their earnings 
gave them an annual family income of $48,000, and that, plus an FHA allowance 
of $700 a month -- $8,400 a year -- for rental income from the second unit 
enabled them to qualify for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 They will make sacrifices to be property owners. Alberto Farias probably will 
move in with his brother's family to reduce the partners' monthly expenses for 
the first year -- but the net result will be a big tax benefit, lower housing 
costs and a stake in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to buy to stop paying rent and have something of our own," Enrique 
Farias said. "This is a good thing that has happened for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brouelettes also think ownership is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple celebrated their first anniversary in December, in part by moving 
into their first home -- all according to a plan they developed before their 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We set a goal of having our own place within two years," said Lia Brouelette, 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Jeff, 26, chose a townhouse in John Laing Homes' Vineyards development 
at Foothill Ranch. The condo is in one of the newest communities in the county 
-- tucked into the base of the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains at the 
terminus of Portola Parkway. As with many brand-new developments, theirs is a 
few miles from the nearest shopping malls, theaters or restaurants -- though a 
supermarket just opened a new neighborhood center. 
</P>
<P>
 The relative isolation is one reason many of the homes there are what 
marketing mavens call "value-priced." The Brouelettes paid $163,900 for theirs. 
Pooling incomes -- he is an accountant, she is a loan processing officer at a 
savings and loan -- gave them a qualifying annual income of $55,000. The 
$12,300 down payment came from savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did they choose to deplete their cash reserve to buy a house now? Because 
they concluded that interest rates and prices won't go much lower, Jeff 
Brouelette said. "We started looking last summer just to see what was out there 
because interest rates seemed so low, and we saw a lot of nice homes in Aliso 
Viejo and Rancho Santa Margarita, and that perked our interest." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brouelettes, who both work in Newport Beach, had been paying $800 a month 
to rent a one-bedroom apartment in Costa Mesa. After a 5% down payment, their 
monthly mortgage payment -- including property taxes and $150 for homeowner 
association dues -- is $850. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy with the house" and with the financial deal, which includes 
a first-time buyers' break on the mortgage interest rate, Lia Brouelette said. 
"It's great to be an owner." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeff: "After our income tax savings from deducting interest, we're within 
$50 a month of what it cost us to rent. And here we have a pool and a 
recreation room, and we're building equity." 
</P>
<P>
 The continued health of the real estate market in a developed region like 
Orange County, however, depends on move-up buyers too -- people who already own 
houses but are ready for something newer, bigger or in a better location. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1993, for the first time since 1989, there was a marked increase in 
move-up sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Among buyers in that market segment are Kevin and Yayoi Christiansen, who 
found that low interest rates, eager mortgage lenders and reasonable prices 
made it hard to justify keeping an older home that they have outgrown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got into the market now because of opportunity," said Kevin, 33. "We live 
in a house I bought in 1986, before we were married, and we've always wanted to 
have a brand-new one." 
</P>
<P>
 The Christiansens -- he is 33, she is 32, and both work as computer 
programmers in Santa Monica -- want to stay in Orange County. And the 
Westminster area, Kevin said, "is just about the only part of Orange County we 
can look at and still have a reasonable commute -- if you can call an hour each 
way reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 When the couple saw the sign for CenterStone Co.'s new single-family home 
development last summer in a field near the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station, 
they decided "to jump at it," he said. "We had this fear that, if we didn't 
take this opportunity, there might not be any more coming along." CenterStone's 
development of 46 homes is the first new tract in Westminster in almost 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple also have seen prices of homes in their current neighborhood start 
to creep up after losing value for most of the past three years, "so we know 
that things are starting to turn a little," Yayoi Christiansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's combined annual income hit $100,000 last year, and they could 
have afforded bigger and more expensive homes, Kevin said. "We did look at one 
development in Cypress with bigger lots, but the houses were almost $100,000 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Yayoi: "One reason we decided on CenterStone is that we wanted to step up 
but not be stretched." 
</P>
<P>
 The Christiansens have reserved their house with a $1,000 deposit but haven't 
opened escrow yet -- that step is scheduled for next month -- and have not yet 
applied for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Geller, a sales agent with Sterling Realtors in Fountain Valley, which is 
handling sales for CenterStone, said that even though nothing has been built at 
the site, 10 of the 46 homes have been reserved -- a positive signal that there 
is a market for move-up housing. 
</P>
<P>
 To finance their deal, the Christiansens plan to sell their house to Kevin's 
brother for $170,000. That's about $10,000 below market value, but because they 
aren't using a real estate agent, the couple figure they'll net about the same: 
about $80,000. "It's a good deal for us and a good deal for him," Kevin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house we have now took all my savings, and I had to use credit cards to 
buy furniture. We don't want to do that again." 
</P>
<P>
 John Shumway, president of Market Trends, a Costa Mesa real estate consulting 
firm, said stories like those of the Christiansens, Brouelettes and Fariases 
"are what is happening out there. After four years of doldrums, the market is 
starting to coming back. People have a better feeling about the economy and are 
reassessing their priorities. Things have been bad for four years, and they've 
been saving. But now a lot of them think it's OK to spend, they've saved enough 
for a down payment, and there's a strong desire in most of us to buy a new 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 One emotion that seems to have taken a back seat, however, is the speculative 
fervor that helped fuel the market in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are more conservative now," said Margaret Goedeke, chief executive of 
Donmar Ltd., a Newport Beach real estate brokerage. "They are not buying the 
maximum amount of house they can qualify for, like they did in the '80s. 
They're not pushing the price envelope." 1993 Home Sales

 December was the biggest Orange County home-sale month in 1993, with those in 
the $175,000-$250,000 range being the top sellers. The average price for all 12 
months was $242,515. 05,22,10,10,10,10 Price range Jan. Feb. March April

WEAK LINKS SEEN IN OPENING OF CHAIN OUTLETS; FRANCHISES: THE INDUSTRY IS 
BOOMING, BUT COMPLAINTS FROM ENTREPRENEURS FEELING PRESSURE FROM THEIR 
LICENSERS IS CAUSING REGULATORS TO REASSESS LAWS.

 Sports writer Cary Koegle had spent more than half his life working for 
someone else, but the newspaper journeyman from Bellflower had always wanted to 
be his own boss. 
</P>
<P>
 So in 1991, Koegle retired early from the Pasadena Star News, cashed in his 
employee savings plan and went shopping for a business. At a franchise trade 
show in Anaheim, the Sign-A-Rama booth caught his eye. After investing $30,000 
in a franchise, Koegle and his two sons opened a sign-making outlet in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 But Koegle's dream faded as the business faltered. His financial woes 
worsened, and he was forced to sell his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Last January -- on moving day -- Koegle had a heart attack. Two days later, 
the 48-year-old entrepreneur was dead. His son places partial blame for 
Koegle's death on stress generated by the failed business. "He knew he had been 
naive," Charles Koegle said last week. "He felt very depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Koegle's story is one of many unhappy tales in the booming franchise industry. 
The complaints have grown so loud that state and federal regulators are 
considering an overhaul of franchise laws that in many cases haven't been 
updated in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista) on Monday will introduce a 
franchisee-protection bill that would allow California-based franchisees to sue 
their out-of-state franchisers in state courts rather than file in the 
franchiser's home state. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers to the business aren't the only ones with complaints: 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard L. Cohn, a Chicago businessman who has owned Taco Bell franchises 
since 1983, alleged in an August lawsuit that Taco Bell engaged a corporate spy 
in an attempt to drive him out of business. Taco Bell denies the allegations 
and says it hopes to prevail in a Chicago courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also last summer, a frustrated Carl Karcher Enterprises franchisee sued the 
company for willfully misleading him on the value of a dozen Carl's Jr. 
restaurant franchises in Arizona. What made the suit unusual was that the 
plaintiff was Frank Karcher, the company's former vice president of franchising 
and a brother of founder Carl N. Karcher. The suit was eventually dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a closely watched case with nationwide implications, longtime Coca-Cola 
distributors in New York have been told that their soft-drink routes -- some 
dating back 30 years -- will not be renewed in 1995, when company employees 
will take over distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 * A frustrated Taco Bell franchisee in Missouri maintains that the fast-food 
giant is withholding additional licenses from him as punishment for joining a 
franchisee organization not sanctioned by Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchisers offer their own litany of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies argue that longstanding franchisees won't acknowledge a 
dramatic change in consumer-buying patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole industry has changed," said Jonathan Blum, spokesman for Taco 
Bell, which is alienating some franchisees by selling its Mexican-style fast 
food through a growing array of unconventional outlets, including kiosks, carts 
and grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Other franchisers argue that agreements signed decades ago are woefully out of 
date. "We're trying to ensure that we don't become tomorrow's Hula Hoop, and 
(franchisees) aren't willing to help," fretted one franchising executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators and regulators beyond California are seeking ways to settle the 
feud. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.) has introduced three federal franchise 
bills that would force franchisers to make full financial disclosure and 
bolster protection for franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland legislators last week joined the growing ranks of those reviewing a 
groundbreaking law passed last year in Iowa that established what proponents 
call a "franchisee bill of rights." 
</P>
<P>
 A federal court struck down part of the Iowa bill of rights, and franchisees 
lost a hard-fought battle last year for similar protection in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 But "franchisees tasted blood in Iowa, and they're going after the same 
protection elsewhere in the country," said Susan Kezios, president of the 
Chicago-based American Franchisee Assn., a newly formed group. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchisers argue that self-policing is better than added regulation, which 
could result in "both sides throwing stones at each other or having the 
attorneys shoot it out," said Michael Sawitz, 46, a Lake Forest franchiser and 
co-founder of the 2-year-old California Franchise Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is more talking, more communication between franchisers and 
franchisees," Sawitz said. "When you look at it, there's just one bottom line 
here: a growing, healthy franchising industry. . . . If franchisees are 
unhappy, I'm going to be unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
 While legislators consider new laws, franchising continues to flourish, 
especially in the retail, restaurant, and home and office service sectors. The 
nation's 542,496 franchise units accounted for $803.2 billion in retail sales 
during 1992, according to the International Franchise Assn. in Washington. 
Total franchise sales are projected by the trade group to hit $1 trillion by 
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 While franchising is changing the way Americans eat and shop, it is also 
changing the nation's workplaces. Franchising is an especially appealing 
alternative for people who have lost jobs with big companies -- or who start 
businesses on the side in anticipation of being laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchising is also attracting employees tired of playing the corporate game, 
said Sawitz, who ended a successful career to open his small but growing chain 
of AIM Mail Centers. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no shortage of opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The cover of Entrepreneur magazine's January issue boasts that in California 
alone there are "over 777" different franchise opportunities. The magazine is 
chock-full of advertisements that promise financial security, big money and 
unlimited income. 
</P>
<P>
 The variety is staggering. For example, a Mississippi-based company offers 
franchisees with $599 entry to the "$12-billion a year untouched market (for) 
renewing tennis shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything, it seems, can be franchised, including love. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchises are being sold for matchmaking services and wedding planning 
guides. Franchisees will arrange receptions and honeymoons. Franchisers also 
are packaging services for when the honeymoon ends -- everything from maid 
service to the collection agency that chases deadbeat ex-spouses for 
child-support payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are bombarding potential franchisees with print advertisements, 
computer programs and videos that promise everything from exclusive territories 
and comprehensive training to high profits and low start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, more than 6,000 Southern Californians are paying $7 each to 
attend a trade show at the Long Beach Convention Center, where more than 100 
franchisers have booths. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is one of 90 to be put on nationwide this year by Santa Barbara-based 
Spectrum Blenheim Shows, which expects total attendance to top 100,000. 
Thousands more -- many from Europe, Asia and South America -- will attend the 
company's international exposition in Washington in April. 
</P>
<P>
 But franchising's dramatic growth is generating controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints filed with the state Department of Corporations "have definitely 
been on the uprise in the last couple of years -- partly because of the 
proliferation of franchise trade shows that target all the people who have been 
laid off from work," said Judy Hartley, a lawyer for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shows have a lot of start-up companies still trying to get a base 
established, as well as fly-by-nights there to grab someone's initial fees and 
run to the next state. 
</P>
<P>
 "There needs to be more federal regulation, but it's the states that can 
regulate the day-in and day-out activities of these businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Spectrum Blenheim Shows, which counts the International Franchise Assn. as a 
co-sponsor of its weekend expos, urges consumers to "do their homework, to 
check with lawyers and accountants," said Andy Trincia, an association 
spokesman. "We are always telling people that if it seems to be too good to be 
true, then it probably is." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, franchisers are "casting a wider net, and they're catching people who 
don't have any business getting into franchising," said Douglas Carden, a Los 
Angeles franchise law attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Carden also encounters disreputable franchisers intent on making a quick buck 
by selling worthless licenses, then disappearing. "We see people who have lost 
everything because they didn't investigate carefully," Carden said. "The 
venture goes south, the franchiser dissolves, and they're left holding the 
bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Sagar, economist for the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, notes 
that "a whole franchise industry developed in the mid-1980s -- enormous chains 
were set up merely to sell franchises. Unlike the established franchisers, such 
as McDonald's, these new franchisers (don't) have a proven concept." 
</P>
<P>
 Some established franchisees, dealers and distributors also are grumbling 
about what they perceive as shabby treatment from their longtime corporate 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing concern is encroachment on a license holder's territory by other 
franchisees -- or the company itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisees maintain that parent company KFC Inc., 
owned by soft-drink giant Pepsico Inc., set aside longstanding agreements and 
opened competing restaurants that are stealing their revenue. "All of a sudden, 
the franchiser has become the franchisees' worst competitive nightmare," said 
Andrew Selden, a Minneapolis attorney who is representing 650 KFC franchisees 
in a class-action suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda resident Danny Stone, who operates a Snap-On Tools franchise, 
complains that the company has shrunk his territory in recent years. "It's like 
having a gym floor that takes one guy an hour to sweep -- you could hire three 
more guys, cut everyone's salary, and get the job done in 15 minutes," said 
Stone, 42. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snap-On doesn't care if it's hurting the dealers. . . . It's just looking for 
ways to make more money for itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Clark, Snap-On's director of franchise operations, defended the 
Wisconsin-based company's decision to cut back Stone's previous territory to 
225 customers from 300. "If you call on your customers once a week, there's no 
human way you could service more than that," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Taco Bell, which has alienated some franchisees by expanding its 
distribution system to include kiosks, carts and products for sale at 
supermarkets, believes its expansion is good for consumers. "We put our 
customer first," said Taco Bell spokesman Jonathan Blum. "Their lifestyles have 
changed . . . and we're trying to meet their expectations about where and how 
they can purchase our foods." 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell is inviting franchisees to share in the growth of its 
less-conventional distribution points but is not soliciting franchisees for new 
restaurants. Instead, the company will run any new restaurants itself, Blum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Change also is in store for 350 soft-drink distributors in New York City who 
have been advised by Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of New York that their contracts -- 
some dating to the 1960s -- won't be renewed when they expire in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has offered to pay distributors a fee for their businesses, but 
distributors said the offer falls far short of the fair market value of their 
routes. They have gone to court to force Coca-Cola to pay "fair market value" 
for the distributorships, spokesman Ron Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly militant franchisees are banding together to exchange information and 
lobby legislators. Two new trade associations for franchisees have sprung up in 
the past 18 months alone. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, the Chicago-based American Franchisee Assn., has been in 
existence just over a year and already claims 13,000 franchised locations under 
its umbrella. The association counts among its members the holders of some of 
the nation's best-known franchises, including Taco Bell, Dunkin' Donuts and 
Jack in the Box. 
</P>
<P>
 Another organization, the San Diego-based American Assn. of Franchisees & 
Dealers, says its charter is "providing a counterbalance in the franchising 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of those groups hasn't gone unnoticed by the International 
Franchise Assn., long the industry's dominant trade group. Last year the IFA 
took the unprecedented step of inviting franchisees to join the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old IFA, which represents most of the biggest franchise names, 
also created a voluntary dispute resolution program and crafted what its 
officials describe as a tough professional code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, the vast majority of franchisees are happy and making money, 
but there are some who aren't happy, and there's enough dissension that the 
(IFA) board of directors recognized that it's time for more teamwork," IFA 
spokesman Trincia said. "There's no room for the 'us and them' mentality that's 
sprung up." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials at the newly formed franchisee organization question whether the 
IFA's invitation to franchisees is sincere. "I think that's a pretty hysterical 
move, after 30 years of representing the franchisers," American Franchisee 
Assn. president's Kezios said. "I think their decision to admit franchisees is 
a testament to how effective the AFA has been in just 18 months." 
</P>
<P>
 Flexing its newfound muscle, the AFA announced that it will hold its first 
national meeting in Las Vegas in February -- on the same days that the IFA has 
claimed for its own annual meeting.

FRANCHISE FAILURE RATE RESEARCH STIRS DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Timothy M. Bates, a researcher at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for 
Scholars in Washington, stirred up a hornet's nest late last year when he 
suggested that the failure rate of franchised businesses is higher than that of 
independent start-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in the (research) business for a long time, and I've never seen a 
reaction like this," Bates said of response to the franchise study."I must have 
gotten 200 phone calls" from disgruntled franchise holders and their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates' findings clash with longstanding research funded by the 
Washington-based International Franchise Assn., which uses data gathered by the 
Gallup Poll and Arthur Anderson & Co. to back its claim that franchisees are 
more likely to succeed than independent businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bates, who analyzed federal Census Bureau data, said that franchises are 
more likely than independent businesses to fail in the formative years and that 
franchisees seem to take longer to recoup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates said that the success rate of the nation's best-known franchise names is 
noticeably higher than for new franchising operations that aren't as well 
known: "It indicates that you get what you pay for." 
</P>
<P>
 IFA statistics provide a decidedly rosier view of franchising: The Gallup Poll 
reported that 94% of franchisees are satisfied with their investments. GREG 
JOHNSON

PDA ENGINEERING APPOINTS NEW PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PDA Engineering, an engineering design software publisher that has quietly 
become one of Orange County's largest software companies, said Friday that it 
has promoted Thomas C. Curry to president. 
</P>
<P>
 Curry, vice president and general manager of PDA's software products division 
since 1989, will report to Louis A. Delmonico, who drops the president's title 
but remains chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 PDA also reorganized its management structure from two separate divisions into 
a single operating entity with six functional areas,each headed by a corporate 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Stanton, former vice president of new business development, takes the 
title of chief technical officer. James Tung, a vice president for Infotron 
Systems in Asia, was appointed PDA's vice president of international 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 PDA had sales of $43 million for the fiscal year ended June 30 and has about 
275 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's fortunes have been rising as it markets its three-dimensional 
animated design and analysis software for engineers, Patran 3, which the 
company has described as bringing Macintosh-style graphics to the engineering 
software. PDA launched the product in 1991 after spending $30 million and four 
years developing it. 
</P>
<P>
 PDA's customers are engineers at manufacturing companies such as General 
Motors Corp. and Boeing Co., which need to engineer parts quickly and use 
software to simulate the physical strengths and weaknesses of the designs.

LEON LEYSON OF FULLERTON WILL NEVER FORGET THE NAZIS OR THEIR BRUTALITY. BUT 
HIS STRONGEST MEMORY IS OF THE HUMANITY OF OSKAR SCHINDLER, WHO PUT HIM ON A . 
. .; SURVIVORS' LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The memories, Leon Leyson says, have not diminished with time. 
</P>
<P>
 Memories -- of German troops invading Poland in 1939 and his family being 
herded into the Jewish ghetto in Krakow when he was 9. . . . Of hiding in a 
cramped attic crawl space to avoid being killed or sent to a death camp by SS 
commandos who periodically swept through the Jewish quarter. . . . Of living in 
a concentration camp run by a sadistic SS commandant who would shoot Jews for 
sport. . . . Of wondering whether he'd have enough bread to eat for the day or 
whether he'd even live until tomorrow. . . . And of a German industrialist -- a 
war-profiteering Nazi Party member -- who saved Leyson's life and the lives of 
1,100 other Jews who worked for him: 
</P>
<P>
 The memories of a Schindlerjude, a Schindler Jew. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very good to me," Leyson says of Oskar Schindler, the true-life hero 
of "Schindler's List," Steven Spielberg's critically acclaimed movie adaptation 
of Thomas Keneally's fact-based novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson was 13 when he joined his other family members working at Schindler's 
enamel works factory. Schindler frequently ordered that Leyson be given extra 
soup, and he called the skinny boy who had to stand on a box to operate a lathe 
"Little Leyson." 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson's father -- a tool-and-die maker -- was one of the first Jews to go to 
work at Schindler's factory, which produced mess kits and pots and pans for the 
German army. Ultimately, Leyson, his mother, a brother and a sister would all 
work for Schindler -- one of the few families to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Leyson's older brothers, however, did not survive the war. One, who was 
taken from the Jewish ghetto, died in an extermination camp. The other was 
murdered by the Nazis, along with 500 other Jews living in the Leysons' 
hometown on the northeastern border of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson, 63, who teaches industrial arts at Huntington Park High School, hasn't 
talked much about that time of his life. "Periodically," he says, "some things 
come out in conversations with people." But for the most part he has kept his 
memories to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Elisabeth, his Ohio-born wife of 28 years, has often urged him to talk about 
his experiences. "I think it's a miraculous story that many people would find 
inspirational and really amazing," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Leyson's children -- Daniel, 24; and Stacy, 25 -- are familiar with their 
father's background. But Leyson says his sister, Aviva, who now lives in 
Israel, once started to tell her story for an oral history project and couldn't 
finish. "I can identify with that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with "some real reservations" that Leyson recently agreed to talk 
about his wartime memories and about "Schindler's List," the movie that tells 
the story of the man who made a fortune in the war by using unpaid Jewish labor 
and then spent that fortune to save their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson sat on the edge of a white sofa in the living room of his two-story 
house in Fullerton, thousands of miles and a lifetime away from the Jewish 
ghetto and concentration camp where he spent five years of his youth.  
</P>
<P>
 His arms resting on his knees and his hands tightly clasped, the soft-spoken 
Leyson said he saw "Schindler's List" at an invitational screening for other 
Schindler Jews in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't know what to expect of the movie, which was shot on location in 
Poland, but he found it "startlingly effective and quite authentic. I was 
amazed to see these places looking very much like I remember." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, he said, watching the film "was like having an out-of-body 
experience because those little kids who were running around and hiding and 
trying to get away from the Sondercommando (the brutal SS commando troops), 
that was me. That was my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His family, Leyson said, had moved from their hometown near the Russian border 
to Krakow a year before the Germans arrived in his country. His father, Moric, 
worked in a glass factory across from the Jewish-owned factory Schindler would 
eventually take over. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Germans invaded Poland, Leyson said, they had heard that the 
Germans were mistreating Jews inside Germany, "so we had some inkling of it, 
but nothing of the sort that it ended up to be. We had no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The only experience his parents had had with the Germans was during World War 
I. "To them, yes, the Germans forced people to work, and they would release 
them after they finished their work. So it looked like in the beginning that it 
was the same thing. But it was nothing like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Within six months, Poland's Jews were forced to move into a newly closed-off 
area of Krakow. Leyson's parents piled as many belongings as they could into 
suitcases and onto sheets, which they tied up at the corners and made into 
bundles.  
</P>
<P>
 "We just loaded everything up on a wagon," he recalled. "Whatever we couldn't 
move we just left there."  
</P>
<P>
 Their home had been in an apartment building not far from the Jewish ghetto. 
One of his father's co-workers at the glass factory had been living in the 
ghetto area and, not being a Jew, had to move out. So the two families traded 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leysons lived for two years in the ghetto, an area of only 16 square 
blocks surrounded by a newly erected brick wall whose rounded-off top reminded 
Leyson of grave markers. "I don't think that was an accident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, two or three families lived in a single room. The Leysons 
divided up their sole bedroom with blankets and shared it with an older Jewish 
couple, German refugees who would later be hauled off to a death camp.  
</P>
<P>
 Food was scarce. Meat -- chicken mostly -- was a luxury. Some food was bought 
on the black market or smuggled in by Jews who were allowed to work on the 
outside. Although Jews working in Schindler's factory were not paid, Leyson 
said, "there was a benefit: You got a loaf of bread once in a while, and you'd 
get a bowl of soup at lunch time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, killings in the ghetto were sporadic. "Here and there a 
soldier would decide he wanted to kill somebody," said Leyson. You could never 
tell when that might happen, "so you always walked around with that funny 
feeling in the back of your head, that you don't know who was pointing a gun at 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 "To give you an idea, the whole time that this was taking place -- from the 
time of the ghetto to the time of liberation -- there were only two thoughts in 
mind: to have something to eat and keep yourself from getting killed." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long before the killings became more organized. SS commandos 
would surround the ghetto and then move through, carting off families to a 
railroad station where they would be sent to extermination camps. Anyone who 
resisted or was found hiding or was infirm was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were several actions like these where they kept removing people from 
the ghetto and shrinking it," said Leyson. "At one point, you had to have a 
special card, and if you didn't have that you were taken away. My father had a 
card, and so we were not taken away. But my older brother was supposed to have 
his own card. He didn't have it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie, Schindler is shown going to the train station to rescue his 
Jewish accountant from a death camp-bound train. Also on that train was 
Leyson's older brother, Betsalil, whom Schindler also tried to save.  
</P>
<P>
 The Leysons later learned, however, that Betsalil's girlfriend was with him 
and he wouldn't get off without her. He died in the concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
 One time when the SS commandos surrounded the ghetto, Leyson said, it was 
obvious what was going to happen. His father and brother David were already 
working for Schindler, and Schindler advised his workers not to go back home 
after work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept them in the factory," said Leyson, who, along with his mother, was 
inside the ghetto. This time, he said, no ID card could prevent them from being 
removed. "It was just if you got caught you were gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So he and a few other boys climbed up into the attic crawl space in a 
one-story structure attached to their apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson's mother, Anna, and another boy's mother said they were not going to 
hide, that they'd take their chances. But at the last minute, as the sound of 
gunshots and the commandos shouting for people to come out of their homes 
echoed through the streets, Leyson's mother climbed into the cramped hideaway 
-- setting down the teapot full of water she had intended to hand up to the 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire time the SS were operating in the courtyard, Leyson said, his 
mother's teapot was sitting there. And as they frighteningly peeked down at the 
courtyard through cracks in the wooden building, they saw the other mother, 
trying to look inconspicuous by sweeping the ground, taken away by the 
commandos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can recount dozens of times where if I had stepped . . . to my left, I 
would have been gone, or if I happened to step to my right," said Leyson. "It 
wasn't anything like being smart or clever or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Just luck, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One time he and a friend took an old woman to a hospital inside the ghetto on 
a stretcher and they were a few minutes late for the curfew. As they walked by 
one of the gates, a guard spotted them and took his rifle off his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson's friend, who was a few steps ahead of him, ran past the soldier and 
into the house where they lived. The guard fired at him and missed, then turned 
and fired a shot at Leyson, who ran in the opposite direction and ducked into 
the recessed entry of an apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily, someone let me in," he said. "It could have happened that the people 
were scared enough not to open the door, but they did, and I spent the night 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "that's just one small incident, and it wasn't long before 
things got really, really awful." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1943, the ghetto was liquidated, soldiers dragging families from their 
apartments and again shooting anyone who resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Jews who worked in factories, however, were assigned to Plaszow, a 
forced-labor camp on the outskirts of Krakow. Each group of factory workers 
marched out together, but before Leyson's group was out of the ghetto, a guard 
pulled him out of line, saying, "Jew, you come later." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't smart enough to know something bad is going to happen, but I knew 
enough that I didn't want to 'come later,' " said Leyson. Not wanting to be 
grouped with children or old people who were certain to be killed, he sneaked 
back in line with another group. 
</P>
<P>
 At Plaszow, which was built on a Jewish graveyard, Leyson and other Jews were 
forced to dig up the graves, smashing the grave markers into pieces to use for 
a road in the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp was run by a psychopathic commandant named Amon Goeth, who is 
depicted in the movie sitting on the balcony of his hilltop villa and shooting 
at Jews below with his rifle. Leyson says the movie was an accurate portrayal 
of the brutal Goeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the most sadistic, unpredictable person that you can ever meet," said 
Leyson, adding that Jewish workers passing through the gate in the evening 
would ask among themselves what the "score" was that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson had several encounters with Goeth. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Leyson was working the night shift in the camp brush factory 
when Goeth and his henchmen came through. For some unknown reason, Goeth pulled 
out his gun and shot a man. 
</P>
<P>
 They then took everyone outside and began separating the workers into two 
groups. Leyson, who was now about 13, was told to go to the side with the young 
and the old. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't look good to me," he said. Again, as the guards were walking back 
and forth, he was able to sneak back to the other side and "sort of blend in 
with the others." 
</P>
<P>
 Another time he was among a group working on the road when Goeth came through 
and didn't like the way things were going. He then lined everybody up and had 
the guards pull people out of line and give them 25 lashes. "I was the lucky 
recipient of 25," said Leyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Goeth lost interest and left. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? 
</P>
<P>
 "The story has it that sort of toward evening time, Schindler came by to visit 
and word was sent to Goeth that Schindler was there, and so the whole thing 
stopped and he went back over to visit with Schindler." 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson said that he knew Schindler quite well and that one of his 
disappointments with Spielberg's movie is that more of Schindler's "basic human 
decency " wasn't portrayed on screen.  
</P>
<P>
 Schindler is accurately portrayed as a womanizer and a war profiteer who used 
bribes and his considerable charisma to reap massive profits through his Nazi 
connections, but the man Leyson knew frequently displayed a sense of decency, 
of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Schindler, at the request of Leyson's father, brought Leyson's 
mother, brother and sister over to work in Schindler's factory -- keeping an 
entire family together -- is one example, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson recalls working night shifts with his brother and father and seeing the 
flamboyant Schindler come through the factory after a night of partying with 
his Nazi friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't have to look to know that Schindler was there," he said. "He was 
all perfumed up and smoking these cigarettes. And he'd come through and he'd do 
things, not grandstanding or anything. He'd just quietly come up to my father, 
put his arm around his shoulder and say, 'Don't worry; everything is going to 
be OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, Leyson said, Schindler would leave a lighted cigarette or a 
half-filled pack next to his father's workstation and casually walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the kinds of things you don't see in the movie, Leyson said. "He was 
a womanizer -- everybody knows that -- and he liked a good party, but you have 
to judge the man by what he did. He did great things, actually." 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson has no doubt that Schindler was motivated to draw up his now-famous 
list for humanitarian rather than profit-making reasons: to move 1,100 Jewish 
workers en masse to a new factory in relatively safe Czechoslovakia.  
</P>
<P>
 Leyson never knew why, but he, his father and brother were mistakenly left off 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
 They were lined up and getting ready to be shipped out to an extermination 
camp when Schindler came by with several people. Wanting to get his attention, 
Leyson started moving toward the front of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 A guard hit him with his rifle butt, and Leyson dropped the Thermos he had 
been holding. Schindler heard the noise, turned and saw Leyson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I yelled out, 'We're not on the list, my father, brother and I,' " Leyson 
recalled. "He immediately ordered that we be put on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 But more significant than that, Leyson said, Schindler "went back to where the 
others were kept who were on the list and told my mother not to worry." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the most harrowing sequences in the movie, the trainload of women 
from Schindler's factory are mistakenly routed to Auschwitz, where they are 
herded into the showers, not knowing whether gas or water would come out. 
Leyson's mother and sister were on that train.  
</P>
<P>
 Schindler, who refused an offer to replace them with 300 other workers, used 
his money and influence to get them back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once he was into this business of transporting us from Poland to 
Czechoslovakia, and especially his accomplishment of getting the women from 
Auschwitz to Czechoslovakia, you knew that he was not doing it to make a 
profit. He was simply doing the right thing," Leyson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Czechoslovakia, the 1,100 Jews spent the next eight months working in 
Schindler's new factory and living in an adjoining concentration camp, a time 
Leyson remembers being the hungriest he had ever been. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler, accompanied by several older Jews, left in the middle of the night 
to avoid being captured by the Russian army. Before he left, however, his 
workers gave him a gift: a ring made of gold from one of his worker's teeth and 
inscribed with the Talmudic verse: "Whoever saves one life, saves the world 
entire." 
</P>
<P>
 The Leysons and the other Schindler Jews were repatriated to Poland. "But soon 
after we got there we realized that Poland was not the place for us. We were 
not greeted warmly, to say the least. There were a lot of people rioting 
against the returning Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 A year after returning home, he said, "we had to go hide again." 
</P>
<P>
 They smuggled themselves across the border back into Czechoslovakia. From 
there they traveled to Austria and then to Germany, where they wound up in a 
displaced-persons camp. And there they remained until 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Leyson's aunt, who had lived in the United States since the early 
1900s and had thought they had perished with the rest of the Jews in Poland, 
learned through a search organization where they were and arranged for them to 
come to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler's life, too, changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Penniless after the war, he and his wife immigrated to Argentina, where he 
turned to farming. After 10 unsuccessful years, he left his wife and returned 
to Germany, where he was taken care of by his former workers, the Schindler 
Jews.  
</P>
<P>
 Leyson would meet Schindler again, on a visit Schindler made to the United 
States a few years before he died in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 He was among a group of Jews who met Schindler at the airport.  
</P>
<P>
 "I started to tell him who I was," recalled Leyson. But he didn't need to. 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler grinned at the middle-aged man standing in front of him and said, "I 
know who you are, you're little Leyson."

SNEAKS 94; DRESSED TO KILL . . . AT THE BOX OFFICE

 It's not just the fabric that's making a stretch in this, the 1994 film 
lineup, whose highlights can almost be read as a series of bizarre fashion 
statements: 
</P>
<P>
 John Goodman tries on a toga. Drag-savvy Johnny Depp dons a dress. Julia 
Sweeney flies the ambisexual flannel. Robert Altman puts on a Paris runway 
show. Seemingly half the young actresses in Hollywood -- starting with Sharon 
Stone -- put on cowgirl hats. Meryl Streep puts on an American accent (and a 
life jacket). Jack Nicholson finally gets hair enhancement and then some. And 
Tom Cruise, newly tooth-augmented, sucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's pray the movie year doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, there's every reason for hope. The year just past -- besides being 
basically boffo at the box office -- was the first in recent memory in which 
critics didn't carp en masse that there weren't enough good movies to fill out 
a Top 10 list. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Can the spillover effect 
possibly fail us? Aren't we on a roll here, or will astrologers break the news 
that "Schindler's List," "Short Cuts" and "The Piano" were produced as the 
result of an unrepeatable planetary conjunction? 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the usual depressing litany of sequels, remakes and pictures based 
on cartoons or skits. Forget Casper, Lassie, Black Beauty, Fred 'n' Wilma, Pat, 
Picard, the Saint, slickers, karate kids, ninja moppets and Mighty Ducks -- for 
the moment, while you still can. 
</P>
<P>
 Disregard the fact that the lineup is full of unpromising-sounding Westerns, 
no doubt inspired by the thought that if a depressingly revisionist genre piece 
like "Unforgiven" could bring in the masses, a return to the classically hokey 
Western could really clean up. Block out the inordinate number of action 
thrillers pitting lawmen with tragic pasts against maniacal genius villains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mind cleared? Good. Now visualize some of the low-concept films coming from 
strong, idiosyncratic and occasionally commercially viable directors; imagine a 
1970s-style renaissance of the American auteur in which the knife of personal 
vision carves some niche space amid all the moviemaking by committee. As John 
Lennon said, it's easy if you try: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Crooklyn" finds Spike Lee taking a gentler tack, reportedly, stepping away 
for the moment from direct focus on racial disharmony for a 
semi-autobiographical early-'70s period piece starring his sister Joie. (If it 
works, Lee will have proved to his critics his polemics aren't his means of 
avoiding the personal.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Natural Born Killers" has Oliver Stone -- on the mend from the diminishing 
returns of his 'Nam trilogy -- recuperating outrageously with a violent, 
100%-'merican black comedy about serial killers, based on a Quentin Tarantino 
script. (If it works, Stone will have proved to his critics he does have a 
sense of humor.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Pret-a-Porter" promises Altman doing what Altman (almost always) does best: 
the deadpan satirical ensemble piece -- this time set amid the world of high 
fashion, which the filmmaker professes to have quite a non-predatory affection 
for. (If it works, he'll have proved nothing he didn't 20 years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ed Wood" is one of the big question marks of the year. As punctuation goes, 
it ended in a period for Columbia, which finally decided that it was worth 
ticking off Tim Burton not to green-light it (Disney is releasing it). Depp 
plays Wood, the cross-dressing director of some of the worst movies of the 
'50s, in this black-and-white biopic that, presumably, plays out as 
tragicomedy. (If it works . . . well, it's hard to imagine it would, but we're 
dying to see it just the same.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Hudsucker Proxy" marks the return of the Coen brothers, working in a 
Howard Hawksian vein with a period farce centered on industrialist Paul Newman 
and smart-mouthed newspaper reporter Jennifer Jason Leigh. (If it works, it 
could usher in a new era for the articulate screwball comedy, and erase the 
damage done by last year's "Born Yesterday" remake.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other director-driven American films promising sub-blockbuster pleasures 
include Michael Tolkin's "The New Age," Woody Allen's "Bullets Over Broadway" 
and Alan Rudolph's "Mrs. Parker." 
</P>
<P>
 From overseas, "The House of the Spirits" brings former Bergman collaborator 
Bille August back with a formidable cast that includes Meryl Streep and Jeremy 
Irons. Alan Parker directs man of the moment Anthony Hopkins in "The Road to 
Wellville," based on T. Coraghessan Boyle's acclaimed comic novel, such a long 
shot for filming you want to root for it in any instance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Say the auteurs fail us, though. There could still be enough fun to salvage 
the year just in some of the big-ticket projects with impressive pedigrees. 
Five picks for probable popular and possible critical success, from the 
high-concept and -budget lot: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Lion King" is Disney's newest animation blockbuster-in-waiting, with 
music again by Alan Menken. The studio has been using the opening musical 
number as a trailer all by itself, to great results, setting up the easy 
assumption that the following 80 minutes are as good. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" has Robert De Niro as the misunderstood 
patchwork -- plus articulation, sans bolts -- with Kenneth Branagh playing God 
both as the monster's maker and the movie's director. (But no Emma, or Elsa.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wolf" aims to make Jack (" Heeere's Johnny") Nicholson fearsome again, 
though with director Mike Nichols trying his hand at horror for the first time, 
the outcome is anything but predetermined. It could work: Will Nichols' famous 
penchant for long, uninterrupted takes result in filmdom's first five-minute 
werewolf transformation shot? 
</P>
<P>
 * "Interview With the Vampire" has Neil Jordan at the helm and Cruise at the 
crucifix-defying crux. No movie this year will have as much speculative 
naysaying to overcome, which will put "Vampire" in the enviable position of a 
mammothly expensive picture perceived as an underdog; come Thanksgiving, expect 
lots of folks saying they knew it would work all along. 
</P>
<P>
 * "True Lies" lives up to its oxymoronic title, for starters, by casting 
Arnold Schwarzenegger as a brilliant government spy. In anyone else's hands you 
might think " Really Last Action Hero," but if "Terminator" creator James 
Cameron can't restore Arnold's good name and make sure that his astronomical 
budget actually shows up on the screen, no one can. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the curiosity-rousers. What's anticipation without the possibility 
of failure? There are, to be sure, surer commercial bets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a clampdown on advance publicity, "The Flintstones" is well-known 
enough that by now probably everyone has imagined John Goodman yelling 
"Yabba-dabba-doo!," so that the actual act might seem anticlimactic. It could 
hardly miss; if everyone who contributed to the script bought a ticket, it 
would make a fortune. Among the other two-dimensionalities made flesh on the 
way is Macaulay Culkin, playing against type -- not -- in "Richie Rich." In the 
romantic comedy vein, Julia Roberts as a newspaper reporter sparring with Nick 
Nolte in "I Love Trouble" is perceived as the surest thing, though the track 
record of Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers doesn't bespeak sophistication. The 
year's other big newspaper-themed film, Ron Howard's "The Paper," looks to 
eschew the screwball, with Michael Keaton polishing up his dramatic side as a 
big-city editor under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 An untitled Nora Ephron project, known around town as "The Night Before Xmas," 
could well be the dramedy causing moviegoers to laugh through their hankies 
next winter; sanguine Steve Martin works through the holidays on a suicide 
hotline. And Robert Redford's historically based "Quiz Show" sounds like the 
soul-searching stuff Oscar nods are made of. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer long shots most worth spotlighting amid the pre-sold properties include 
Robert Zemeckis' big but risky "Forrest Gump," a fantasy with Tom Hanks, and 
Meryl Streep waxing Willis-like in "The River Wild," as an unlikely action 
heroine fighting back against baddies in the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of "It's Pat" may rest on the marketers' ability to draw a combined 
male/female demographic -- literally. But you can almost start tallying the 
receipts now on "Mighty Ducks II," "Beverly Hills Cop III," "City Slickers II," 
the John Grisham-based "The Client," the Harrison Ford/Tom Clancy reteaming 
"Clear and Present Danger," Mel Gibson as "Maverick," Kevin Costner as "Wyatt 
Earp" and Warren Beatty's "Love Affair," a remake of "An Affair to Remember." 
</P>
<P>
 As these glide into their foreordained grosser spots, we'd just as soon keep 
our eyes on the possible train wrecks -- such as James Brooks' now non-musical 
"I'll Do Anything," which, word has it, is much improved without a song in its 
heart; the Baldwin/Basinger starrer "The Getaway," which is being touted from 
the inside as campy fun, never a good sign for a movie with such a 
straight-faced trailer; and Gus Van Sant's "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues," which 
sounds like the sprawlingest all-star counterculture mess since Dennis Hopper 
got a studio allowance to make "The Last Movie" a quarter-century ago.

 The year gets off to at thoughtful start -- punctuated, of course, with the 
occasional slam-bang action ride, such as Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger's blood 
and body-heat remake of "The Getaway," or popcorn offering, like "8 Seconds," 
featuring teen throb Luke Perry as a rodeo champ. Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons 
reunite for the first time since "The French Lieutenant's Woman" in "The House 
of the Spirits," based on the Isabelle Allende book about a Chilean dynasty. 
From Vietnam comes the quiet, introspective "The Scent of Green Papaya." 
</P>
<P>
 Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. In a bizarre sequence of events, the Miami 
Dolphins mascot -- a pet dolphin that makes field goals -- and quarterback Dan

(Fine Line) 
</P>
<P>

Mercedes-Benz, the boy is devastated. Things get interesting when the car's 
owner, a major money launderer, hastily gives the kid a check but doesn't write 
in the amount. The kid writes in a cool $1 million, and the fun starts. Brian 
Bonsall stars. (Walt Disney) 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Car 54, Where Are You? David Johansen plays Gunther Toody and John C. McGinley 
is Frances Muldoon in the action-comedy based on the buffoonish TV series of

film that has been on the shelf for a spell. (Orion) 
</P>
<P>
 The Cement Garden. Inspired by Ian McEwan's novel of the same name, this 
unusual film follows what happens when four recently orphaned children shatter 
conventional family wisdom and form their own morality in a strange and 
isolated house. Charlotte Gainsbourg stars. (October Films) 
</P>
<P>
 8 Seconds. The title refers to a pretty impressive ride on a bucking bronco. 
Luke Perry, as rodeo champ Lane Frost, hopes to stay vertical as long as 
possible. John G. Avildsen directs this look at the rough-and-tumble life -- 
both in competition and out -- of the rodeo legend. (New Line) 
</P>
<P>
 Fiorile. This romantic fable spans several centuries of the Benedetti family. 
The saga begins during these times but soon flashes back to the late 18th 
Century, slowly wending its way back. Paolo and Vittorio Taviani direct;

</P>
<P>

Allende's best-seller, chronicling the turbulent tale of Chile's Trueba family 
against the backdrop of political upheaval. (Miramax) 
</P>
<P>
 I'll Do Anything. Writer-director James L. Brooks once envisioned a splashy 
musical starring the likes of Nick Nolte, Albert Brooks and Julie Kavner. Well,

in this story of an actor dad who is suddenly in charge of his mercurial 
6-year-old daughter. (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>

people who are completely unaware of his gaze. Lena Olin is the lusty villain, 
Annabella Sciorra his wife and Juliette Lewis his mistress. (Gramercy)

COMING AT YOU, FAST AND FURIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If you're the sort of moviegoer who feels overwhelmed by the barrage of movies 
that open every Christmas season and at the beginning of every summer, then 
brace yourself for all of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be more movies coming at you this year than any year in recent 
memory: 170 major studio releases by the count of Exhibitor Relations Co., a 
Beverly Hills firm that tracks box-office data. That number is higher than the 
150 in 1993, and significantly higher than the 133 in 1992. When the smaller, 
specialized films are added in, that comes to 229 total releases, or nearly 
five new movies a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame the flood on Warner Bros. and the Walt Disney Studios. Each is trying to 
grab the lion's share of the marketplace through sheer volume of theatrical 
feature films. They know what all the major film companies have come to 
realize: The more films they release, the greater the value of their film 
libraries in the coming 500-channel cable-TV age, when software demand could be 
virtually unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, as one theater exhibitor quipped: "The more shots you take, 
the more chances you have of a hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitor Relations' John Krier believes '93's healthy box-office grosses and 
the expansion of international sales also encouraged filmmakers to enter the 
arena. The year is only 3 weeks old and already Disney's three movie divisions 
have released three movies, Disney Pictures' "Iron Will," Touchstone Pictures' 
"Cabin Boy" and Hollywood Pictures' "The Air Up There."  
</P>
<P>
 Disney distribution president Richard Cook said the Disney company movies will 
number 40 in 1994, up from 27 last year. The number reaches about 60 if you 
count the output of Miramax Films, which this year has ecome part of the Disney 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our view," Cook said, "each picture isn't competing with each other, 
each is appealing to a different audience segment." 
</P>
<P>
 The glut will also mean a back-up at the neighborhood six-plex. "There isn't a 
weekend without at least one new film opening," said Jeff Blake, Columbia 
Pictures president of domestic distribution. "It's going to mean a squeeze in 
finding enough theaters and then doing enough business to hold them before the 
next batch comes along and bumps them off the screen." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, the tradition of avoiding opening new movies on Super 
Bowl weekend -- a weekend when much of the audience is otherwise distracted -- 
bites the dust this year. "No one ever used to open a movie that weekend. This 
year, for God's sake, two will open" (Orion's "Car 54, Where Are You?" and the 
Samuel Goldwyn Co.'s "Golden Gate" both open Jan. 28). 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the biggest collision course of the year was going to happen over 
Memorial Day weekend, when three high-profile titles were caught in a crush: 
"City Slickers 2" (from Columbia), "Beverly Hills Cop III" (Paramount) and the 
live-action "The Flintstones" (Universal). They had been scheduled to open in 
the wake of "Maverick" (Warner Bros.), with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James 
Garner, which will open the week before. 
</P>
<P>
 To the relief of the other studios, Columbia recently moved the Billy Crystal 
comedy "City Slickers 2" to June 10. Of course, that now means Crystal bumps 
into another big competitor, Danny DeVito, in Disney's "Renaissance Man." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, that's the kind of year it's going to be. It seems that anywhere a 
film is moved, it's likely to crash into another.

 Because the Sneaks issue of Sunday Calendar tries to predict the year's 
biggest movies from a mid-January vantage point, looking back at how our picks 
panned out is always good for a laugh. And then there are years that aren't so 
funny.Last year, for example.  
</P>
<P>
 We made one smart decision: We stuck our neck out and guessed that Steven 
Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" would be popular. And we were right, to the tune of 
$341.3 million, so far. Our Sneaks '93 cover creature turned out to be one of 
the year's larger stars -- "Jurassic" 's T-Rex. 
</P>
<P>
 If only we had quit there. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to predict the year's top movies with photographs on page 3 of 
Sneaks '93, we had some luck: "In The Line of Fire" and "The Firm," both summer 
hits that brought in $102 million and $158 million, respectively. We picked 
"The Age of Innocence," which was at least a critical success, and "Rising 
Sun," which had a strong opening weekend before sinking fast. Our other 
forecasts: the summer disappointments "Sliver," "Poetic Justice" and "Last 
Action Hero." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the issue we marked photos from movies we thought would be the 
year's highlights. Our record? 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: Indecent Proposal" 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere between a Hit and a Miss: "Sommersby," "Falling Down," "Hot Shots! 
Part Deux" and "Dennis the Menace." 
</P>
<P>
 Trending toward a miss: "Fearless." 
</P>
<P>
 Clear misses: "Mr. Jones," "Born Yesterday," "So I Married an Axe Murderer," 
"Hocus Pocus" and "M. Butterfly." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury's Still Out: "I'll Do Anything." Postponed to Sneaks '94, it opens Feb. 
4.

PRIME TIME'S NEW MAN ABOUT 'TOON; POMPOUS, LOUD, A ZERO WITH WOMEN -- OK, SO 
JON LOVITZ'S 'THE CRITIC' ISN'T THE COOLEST GUY AROUND. STILL, THIS NEW 
CREATION OF THE 'SIMPSONS' TEAM AIMS TO BECOME THE FIRST ANIMATED SHOW TO 
REPEAT THE SUCCESS OF BART AND CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, Daniel Cerone is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind a glass partition in a small, wood-paneled recording studio on the Sony 
Pictures Entertainment lot, Jon Lovitz reads and rereads some lines of dialogue 
into a big black microphone. Flanking him on the other side of the glass, 
giving him patient directions and guidance, are Al Jean and Mike Reiss, the two 
unassuming guys who wrote his lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean and Reiss, self-described nerds in high school, rose from staff writers 
to executive producers of "The Simpsons," which they left after last season to 
create ABC's new series "The Critic." The broad animated parody, premiering at 
8:30 p.m. Wednesday, revolves around Lovitz as a pudgy, balding and unlovable 
film critic whose gunky hair comes out of a spray can. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is yet another attempt by the networks to find a prime-time cartoon 
hit like "The Simpsons" -- but this time with people who actually worked on 
Fox's breakthrough series: Jean, Reiss and co-executive producer James L. 
Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A date for the theater. Let's check my little black book," Lovitz says spryly 
into the mike, sounding very much like the snobby character he developed for 
the "Get to Know Me" sketch he used to do on "Saturday Night Live." "Hmmm. AAA 
Escort Service. Sister Dominica. Glenn/Glenda." He's not happy with any of the 
names he reads. "Ahhh, hello, Helen!" 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, according to the script, Helen is still trying to scrub her 
body clean after her last date with Lovitz's character, Jay Sherman. So Sherman 
tries to find a date by holding an impromptu trivia contest on his movie-review 
TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, ladies, just call in if you know the name of Spielberg's adorable 
extraterrestrial," Lovitz says, still reading from the script. "I'll take the 
29th caller." There's a pause. Lovitz appeals pathetically: "Cute little alien. 
Anyone? I'll give you a hint: E . . . Oh! We have a caller. The alien's name 
was?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Dreyfuss," drawls an actress with a hoarse, throaty voice, standing 
beside Lovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovitz sighs deeply. "Uh, do you have a sister?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiss cuts in and says, "OK, that was good. Now, let's try it again." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if it was so good, why are we doing it again ? Let's cut through the 
crap," Lovitz says, affecting the pompous attitude of a big shot, turning his 
nose up and puffing an imaginary cigar. "And when are you going to rename this 
building after me, the way you promised?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jean and Reiss look at each other and bust out laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Critic," a half-hour comedy set in New York, Sherman reviews movies on 
his own cheesy cable-TV show, rating them from cold to hot on his 
"Shermometer." His big catch phrase is "It stinks." His only real fans are 
drunken frat boys who like to make fun of him. 
</P>
<P>
 The movies Sherman critiques are all parodies, such as "Rabbi P.I.," in which 
an Arnold Schwarzenegger knockoff plays a Chicago cop who goes undercover as a 
Hasidic Jew. In the film clip Sherman reviews, an animated Schwarzenegger holds 
a scalpel and stands nervously over a baby. A mob boss commands him: "All 
right, if you are a real rabbi, circumcise this child." Suddenly, the 
Schwarzenegger character hurls the scalpel, hitting the mob boss in the heart, 
and says, "Hava nagila, baby." 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not reviewing movies, the divorced Sherman is giving bad advice to 
his son, Marty; seeking advice from his hunky Australian actor friend, Jeremy; 
or trying to trade on his questionable celebrity for dates with women or a good 
seat in his favorite restaurant, L'Ane Riche (translation: the Wealthy 
Jackass). 
</P>
<P>
 Jean and Reiss, college roommates who started working together on the Harvard 
Lampoon in the late 1970s, know all too well the odds against success for a 
prime-time cartoon series. In one scene from the 1992 "Simpsons" Halloween 
special they produced, the camera panned across tombstones in a pet cemetery 
engraved with the names of the shows that tried to follow in "The Simpsons' " 
footsteps: Steven Bochco's "Capitol Critters" on ABC, "Fish Police" from 
Hanna-Barbera Studios and "Family Dog" from Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton on 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's time for Jean and Reiss, who have a development deal with Brooks, to 
put up themselves. Their credits included "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny 
Carson," "Sledge Hammer!" and "Alf" before landing at "The Simpsons" in 1989. 
They became executive producers, supervising the writing and all creative 
aspects.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is tough," Reiss said. "The other animated shows that came after us 
weren't very good, and they really got slammed, but it's a very hard process." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, "The Simpsons" is the only prime-time cartoon series to find lasting 
success on one of the networks since "The Flintstones" three decades earlier. 
In general, the networks have shied away from prime-time animation because it's 
extremely expensive and time consuming: A half-hour sitcom may air two weeks 
after shooting, while a half-hour episode of animation takes roughly nine 
months to produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guardians of the market at the networks have an agenda that they have to 
deal with, and animation is difficult for them to fit into their agenda," 
observed Fred Seibert, president of Hanna-Barbera Studios. "The really tough 
challenge the networks have is dealing with the lead time of animation. They're 
used to much quicker turnaround in their schedules and much smaller episode 
commitments than are affordable in animation." 
</P>
<P>
 "We immediately jumped right into 'The Critic' with no reservations 
whatsoever," deadpanned Stuart Bloomberg, vice president of programming for 
ABC, who ordered 13 episodes of "The Critic." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, really? 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course not," he said. "It's animation. It's really scary. All of the 
problems that animation brings loom heavy. It's that whole timing situation, in 
which you have to commit to a series really without seeing much of anything 
first. You sort of close your eyes and hope. You know, there were smart people 
behind 'Capitol Critters,' and it didn't work for any number of reasons -- pick 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jean and Reiss, there's no real mystery why the other prime-time animated 
efforts didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference between 'The Simpsons' and, say, 'Fish Police,' is that we 
just poured a tremendous amount of time and money into the writing," Jean said. 
"We had a staff of Emmy winners, people who had done some of the best work on 
TV, working nonstop and really honing these scripts, making sure that they were 
human and believable. 
</P>
<P>
 "To pick on one of the other shows: When I read the script for 'Fish Police,' 
I said, 'This is all puns about fish. I don't know why they think that this is 
the same as "The Simpsons." ' I mean, 'The Simpsons' is clearly written to 
appeal to all ages, with adults in mind, and the other one seemed like it was 
written just for kids 8 and under." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike "The Simpsons," which was spun off from animated shorts that Matt 
Groening did on Fox's "The Tracey Ullman Show," "The Critic" was sold to ABC 
strictly on the strength of the pilot script. "Hava nagila, baby," Bloomberg 
said, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it as a gamble, sure. But it's hard to deny these scripts," added 
Bloomberg, who already has ordered an additional 13 scripts to be written and 
ready to go into production for next season in case "The Critic" does catch on 
with viewers. "I mean, they are just consistently funny. We've said no to a lot 
-- a lot -- of animation. Certainly after 'Capitol Critters,' it's got to take 
something pretty special. This was very difficult to say no to." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the writing sharp on "The Critic," Jean and Reiss carefully selected a 
stable of writers with experience in sophisticated comedy -- not screwball 
animation. Their writers include "Seinfeld" producers Tom Gammill and Max 
Pross, Nell Scovell from "Murphy Brown," former "In Living Color" writer Steve 
Tompkins, former "Simpsons" writer Jon Vitti, former David Letterman writer Ken 
Keeler and Patric Verrone, who worked with Johnny Carson on "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, I don't want to be cocky," Jean said, "because there's a huge 
chance this will fail, but we're at least trying to approach it in the 
'Simpsons' manner, using all the best writers we can find and really working on 
the scripts before they get filmed." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, animation is a writer's paradise because there are no limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "On 'The Simpsons,' and we do it a lot on this show, you can say Homer Simpson 
is stupid and fat and ugly and he smells," Reiss said. "If they were real 
actors, you just couldn't write that. You couldn't write those jokes. Actors do 
have feelings. That's why you don't hear fat jokes on 'Roseanne,' even though 
if you were going to take a shot, that's the first one you would take." 
</P>
<P>
 And the characters in "The Critic" don't pull any punches. "I sort of have a 
theory that the only way the kind of people we're writing about in 'The Critic' 
can be sympathetic is if you draw them," Brooks said with a wry smile. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside is the long lead time: None of "The Critic" movie parodies can be 
very current. As a result, "We're doing a lot of different 'Jurassic Park' 
jokes, and we hope people will remember the movie in six months," Reiss said. 
There are also more timeless sequel satires -- such as "Home Alone 5," in which 
the kid is 23 with a beard and still living at home holding his head screaming 
-- and parodies of such genres as movies adapted from TV shows (in one bit, 
Marlon Brando receives $8 million to play Mr. French in "Family Affair: The 
Movie"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I said it should look nothing like me!" Lovitz cried, staring at a new 
lapel pin featuring his squat character -- a sort of cross between Danny DeVito 
and Charlie Brown. "I don't want to become Mr. Magoo," he said in reference to 
the popular animated character who ended up typecasting the voice actor who 
played him, Jim Backus, because the two bore a vague resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovitz, whose film career is taking off, seriously considered passing on "The 
Critic" for fear of becoming stuck in people's mind as the guy who does that 
cartoon : "I was watching a movie on TV where the guy who did Fred Flintstone 
(Alan Reed) was playing a lawyer. I said, 'Hey, that's Fred! He's not right for 
that role.' So it's a legitimate concern. But most people said, 'Well, you're 
already known and established, so it wouldn't be like that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lovitz was persuaded to do "The Critic" after reading the pilot script and 
also seeing the critical praises heaped upon Robin Williams as the genie's 
voice in "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 "When Robin Williams did 'Aladdin,' everyone knew it was him and it was fun," 
Lovitz said. "After something like that, animation almost becomes hip to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks was won over by Lovitz's comedic abilities when he saw an advance 
screening of "A League of Their Own." Many critics thought Lovitz stole the 
show as the obnoxious talent scout Ernie Capadino in what turned out to be a 
career-making role. After that, film offers began pouring in, and Lovitz now 
has several movies awaiting release. He plays the lawyer of Elijah Wood, who 
divorces his parents in director Rob Reiner's "North," and he's Billy Crystal's 
brother in the sequel to "City Slickers." He's now working on the comedy "Home 
for the Holidays," in which he's Nicolas Cage's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was because of Lovitz's busy film schedule that "The Critic" is 
animated at all. Brooks initially wanted to do a live-action TV series in 1992 
about a morning network news program from the perspective of the makeup woman, 
with the film critic as a peripheral character. Once Brooks envisioned Lovitz 
as the film critic, however, he decided to make the critic the star of the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lovitz didn't want to commit to the full-time chores of a live-action 
comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had actually used John as a guest star on 'The Simpsons,' " Jean said. 
"When we recorded 'The Simpsons' with him, we were laughing so hard we were 
ruining the takes. Honestly, we were. So he was the only one we ever wanted. 
And we said, 'Well, if he's going to do movies, we can make it animated and 
probably make the whole thing work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks wasn't excited about that prospect, given the grueling task of 
producing animation. After "The Simpsons," Brooks said, "there was a little bit 
of never again. It's always been a desperate struggle to get 'The Simpsons' 
right. It's not like we figured out one day, this is what works, and then 
everything was easy. As a matter of fact, 'The Simpsons' continues to be the 
most exhausting show on television. The burnout rate is amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then here we are," Brooks said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason he agreed to go through it again? Because he really wanted Lovitz. 
Now, Lovitz can spend just a few weeks each season in the recording studio 
taping an entire season's worth of episodes, leaving him free to pursue movies. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "There will never be another genesis for a show like this again," Brooks said. 
"This has been the longest journey to get a specific actor for something, 
because it went on forever. But it ended up the way it seemed like it was 
supposed to end up."

OUT OF THE SHADOW?; AFTER ALMOST LEAVING THE MARK TAPER FORUM LAST YEAR, ROBERT 
EGAN IS NOW EVEN MORE OF A FORCE THERE SINCE BECOMING PRODUCING DIRECTOR. YET, 
HE SAYS, HE, THE THEATER AND MENTOR GORDON DAVIDSON ARE STILL EVOLVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Robert Egan, the Mark Taper Forum's producing director, takes a deep breath 
after sliding into a restaurant booth. He's just completed another long day 
directing rehearsals for Ariel Dorfman's "Death and the Maiden," which opens 
Thursday on the Taper main stage. He'd rather be eating at home, but Egan's 
troubled marriage has suddenly dictated that he find shelter elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Peering through horn-rimmed glasses, Egan, 43, sighs. "It's such an 
interesting time of transition," he begins. "The Taper is going through many 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Since being hired by Taper Artistic Director Gordon Davidson in 1984, Egan has 
played an ambiguous role. Yes, he's responsible for creating the Taper's 
influential New Work Festival, a program that has helped develop a remarkable 
number of American plays, including Pulitzer Prize winners "The Kentucky Cycle" 
and "Angels in America," and the Broadway hit "Jelly's Last Jam." Yes, Egan has 
directed numerous Taper main-stage productions, including "Sansei" by the 
jazz-fusion band Hiroshima. And he has made a profound impact on Jon Robin 
Baitz, directing the acclaimed young playwright's first major work, "The Film 
Society," at Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet few know this man. Despite his many claims to fame, Egan remains a 
backstage figure, in the shadow of his ever-in-the-spotlight boss. When 
Davidson is out of town, Egan runs the show at the Taper. He also directs at 
least one main-stage show annually, in addition to directing and organizing the 
New Work Festival. And he's involved in all the day-to-day activities at the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, Egan resembles the man Davidson was when he founded the Taper in 
1967. Both are charming, articulate and diplomatic. Both are workaholics. Both 
have dedicated their lives to the American theater. Both are drawn to plays 
evoking contemporary political issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Davidson gave Egan the title of producing director, creating the 
position to keep Egan from leaving the Taper. The promotion also appears to 
confirm the longstanding rumor that Egan is being groomed to one day succeed 
Davidson, now 60, when he retires. Ask Egan if this is true and he'll respond 
diplomatically: "Gordon is very aware that part of his responsibility as a 
leader is to prepare for transitions. He didn't create this institution over 27 
years to have it destroyed. He should create a kind of leadership that he 
believes will continue what is essentially the work of this theater. I think 
it's one of the reasons I'm still here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Davidson if this is true and he too will respond diplomatically. "I'm 
neither leaving nor retiring" from the Taper, Davidson says by phone from 
Manhattan, where he's directing Sybille Pearson's "Unfinished Stories" for its 
February opening at the New York Theatre Workshop. "But I do feel there are 
different ways to look at both the job I do and the job that other people do. I 
certainly would be happy to be unburdened from the day-to-day administration 
details. Putting (Egan) in the job of producing director places him in a prime 
leadership position to deal with whatever changes come up in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Egan is obsessed with a far different ambition: Recently separated 
from his wife of 11 years, actress Kate Mulgrew, he's attempting to apply the 
painful insights gained from his personal crisis to directing "Death and the 
Maiden." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sadly, it's a great time in my life to be directing this play," Egan 
confides. "This personal crisis that I'm in has taught me that if you don't 
confront truthfully what's going on between two people, there's no future. And 
if you don't confront truthfully the past, there's no way forward. You'll 
always be in the prison of these warped and confining rituals from the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorfman's political thriller was a late addition to the Taper schedule, 
replacing David Mamet's "Oleanna" when Egan and Davidson refused to approve the 
playwright's casting. It depicts a triangular struggle among a torture victim, 
her husband and her torturer. Jimmy Smits, a former regular on "L.A. Law," 
plays a human-rights lawyer appointed by the new democratic government of a 
South American country to investigate abuses by the previous dictatorship. An 
accident brings a doctor (Tomas Milian) into his home, where the lawyer's wife 
(Wanda de Jesus) accuses the stranger of supervising her torture and rape, 
often to the music of Schubert's "Death and the Maiden." The question becomes 
whether she is telling the truth or suffering a nervous breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragedies in one's life help fuel your understanding for art," Egan says. 
"Pain and grief and mourning and suffering help you peel a layer back." Egan 
pauses, swallows, reflects. 
</P>
<P>
 Egan has always pondered questions of conscience; a third-generation Irish 
American, he was reared in Washington, D.C., by a social-worker mother and an 
FBI agent father, and was trained early in rigorous self-analysis by demanding 
Jesuit high school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living with another person, you get absorbed into habitual kinds of 
behavior," he continues on the subject of marriage, "which is why these 
rehearsals have been so important to me. The individuals in this play are 
attempting to stop the behavior of 15 years, during which she never confronted 
the demons. (The wife) had them in their little box and kept controlling and 
maintaining them, but she would not allow herself -- and her husband would not 
allow her -- to confront the demons and get to this moment of truth and 
honesty." 
</P>
<P>
 Egan's ability to intellectualize experience is a result of his considerable 
academic background. A graduate of Oxford and Stanford universities, Egan 
studied Marxist literary theory, economics and literature, and he prizes 
research. In preparing for "Death and the Maiden," he organized weeks of 
round-table discussions with his cast and crew, diagnosing case histories. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be in the theater, one's commitment has to be evangelical," Egan says. 
"For any of us in the theater, there's never going to be a financial reward. 
You've got to believe in something else about theater that's collegial, that's 
spiritual, that's intellectual, that's political." 
</P>
<P>
 Egan initially discovered theater as a profession while studying at Oxford. 
The British political playwrights -- Howard Brenton, David Hare, David Storey, 
Edward Bond -- gave dramatic expression to the moral, social and economic 
debates that Egan was obsessed with. While studying dense theoretical tomes, he 
volunteered backstage at the Oxford Playhouse theater, gathering invaluable 
practical experience. 
</P>
<P>
 After Oxford, Egan pursued further studies at Stanford. Midway through his 
doctoral dissertation, Egan interrupted his studies to run the graduate program 
in political studies at the University of Washington. While in Seattle 
administering the program, Egan was hired in 1979 by Seattle Repertory Theater 
director Daniel Sullivan to create a new play development program. In 1980, he 
formed his own theater company, Home Productions. Then, four years later, 
Gordon Davidson beckoned Egan south to the Taper. It was an offer he couldn't 
refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really loved the idea of coming to a theater whose primary reputation was 
built on political work, which was very much a part of Gordon's aesthetic. 
Also, Gordon wanted me to rejuvenate the new play side of the Taper." But there 
was a second reason, too, for accepting Davidson's offer. Egan was married to 
Mulgrew after meeting her during a touring production. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife said: 'I need to get to L.A. to get my career going again. Either I 
go with you or I go without you.' So I chose for us to go together." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Taper, Egan champions new work and has helped make reputations for 
once-obscure playwrights, including Shem Bitterman, Oliver Mayer, Han Ong, John 
Steppling and Kelly Stuart. His controversial staging of "Richard II" included 
a multi-ethnic cast that became a topical focus of discussion, since the play 
ran during the 1992 riots. He also developed and directed the world premiere of 
"Sansei." 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to call Bob the fifth member" of the band, says Hiroshima co-founder 
Dan Kuramoto. "It was through him we fleshed out 'Sansei.' We felt really good 
about his work with Asian Americans. Robert's crucial to this city right now. 
His vision of theater in Los Angeles is very grass-roots. Gordon (Davidson) is 
an extraordinarily savvy theater guy, but I would like to see the next 
evolution of the Taper focus on relevant Los Angeles. I'd love to see the L.A. 
street energy have a voice in theater. I think Egan has a great passion for 
doing this. I can think of no one in theater who would be more plugged into it 
than Egan." 
</P>
<P>
 Another opinion of Egan's work at the Taper is offered by Mick Collins, 
co-founder and artistic director of the Circus Minimus theater and workshop. 
"Bob is this corporate director," Collins says of his experience acting under 
Egan's direction on Steppling's "The Dream Coast." "He has that efficient, 
intelligent approach to directing that is going to give you a top-notch show 
and satisfy the subscribers. But as far as passion, he seems tethered to this 
intellectual post, doing his job as defined by the Taper, Gordon and the 
corporate institution. He just seems so bound to his obligations, intellectual 
and corporate, that he never breaks free." 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking free is something Egan almost did do, however. In 1992, he took a 
six-month sabbatical (it actually only lasted four months) to re-examine his 
priorities. When he returned, he was on the verge of leaving the Taper. He had 
been offered jobs elsewhere, including one in film and television, one in 
academia and another as artistic director of a prominent theater he would not 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew my journey at the Taper had to go forward," Egan says. "I had to take 
more responsibility. . . . I was going to leave. In order to recommit, I needed 
a certain amount of responsibility to exercise my leadership. I'd been an 
associate artistic director for 15 years. It was time for me to move on, either 
here or to somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 When Davidson met with Egan after the sabbatical, their discussion was candid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to figure out the next step," recalls Davidson, "including the 
possibility of Bob having to leave. I know he looked at a few other theaters 
because he wants to run a theater. I couldn't give enough definition to 
associate artistic director, so I kind of invented the idea (of producing 
director) based on my feelings. It came from his own interests and energies to 
help revitalize aspects of the production work, and it eliminated the confusion 
over succession." 
</P>
<P>
 Could that mean Egan is Davidson's chosen successor? 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson answers ambiguously: "Some of that decision will be his choice, some 
mine, some of it the (Taper) board's. We're dividing (responsibilities) up 
differently. I said we'd talk about what he'd do (later) and see where I am at 
the end of this period," Davidson said, referring to the current downtime at 
the Ahmanson, which is being remodeled, and the fact that Davidson is now 
spending a lot of time on projects in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Taper Consulting Dramaturg Leon Katz, currently assisting Davidson in New York 
on "Unfinished Stories," offers insights into the nature of succession at the 
Taper: "With Gordon, it's not as though he handpicks people," Katz says. 
"People sort of wear into (a position) over the course of years. You work your 
way up from the mail room, so to speak. Egan has the capacity to be extremely 
judicious and at the same time get things done very expeditiously and 
courteously. But people near the top are not exactly sure what their terrain is 
at the Taper." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the restaurant interview, such career ambitions are far from Egan's 
thoughts. Now he's talking about "spending lots of time with my boys," 
9-year-old Alec and 10-year-old Ian, and how proud he is of their soccer 
prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's talking about how sad the marital crisis has made him. And how 
uncomfortable it is to spend nights in a friend's unheated cottage, without 
electricity or a phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's in a major moment of transition," he says with a sigh, "and 
where it's going to go, nobody knows."*

 Luther Vandross, having paired with Frank Sinatra on "The Lady Is a Tramp" for 
Ol' Blue Eyes' recent "Duets" album, is finally finishing his own 
long-discussed album of standards. The collection is due in the spring. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Raitt is set to follow the March 22 release of her "Longing in Their 
Hearts" album with a European tour beginning in May and an extensive North 
American swing starting in July. . . . Lou Reed has a guest guitarist role on 
the upcoming Smithereens album, due in April. Among the song titles on the Don 
Dixon-produced collection: "Everything I Have Is Blue," "Miles From Nowhere" 
and the grunge-mocking "Sick of Seattle." . . . Just months after the release 
of their "Very" album, the Pet Shop Boys are following with a U.S. release in 
March of "Very Relentless," a double-CD, previously available only as an 
import, that adds six extended dance tracks to the "Very" material. And word is 
that chances are slim that the Boys will tour this year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Siouxsie & the Banshees are in France working on a new album due in April or 
May. . . . The new Sonic Youth album, "Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No 
Star," due in April, is said to feature a darker, more haunting sound than the 
band's recent albums. . . . And Sonic fans might be interested in guitarist Pat 
Metheney's upcoming "Zero Tolerance for Silence" album, inspired by the 
experimental wall-of-guitars sound associated with the likes of Sonic Youth and 
Glenn Branca. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 British pop-soul singer Tasmin Archer's album due in March is in part a 
tribute to one of her heroes -- Elvis Costello. Half of the songs are old Elvis 
tunes -- "Shipbuilding," "Deep Dark Truthful Mirror," "All Grown Up" and "New 
Amsterdam." The other four tracks are live versions of old Archer tunes. . . .

RESTAURANT NEWS: QUAKE TAKES A TOLL ON SOUTHLAND CELLARS; MANY TOP RESTAURANTS' 
WINE COLLECTIONS WERE HIT HARD BY MONDAY'S TEMBLOR; VALENTINO MAY HAVE 
SUSTAINED THE MOST DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Dan Berger is The Times wine writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fact that wine, from the most humble to the most exalted, is packaged in 
breakable containers becomes a critical issue in earthquakes. And when Monday's 
temblor hit, Southern California lost some of the greatest wine in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Many restaurant wine cellars throughout the Southland were hard hit, but the 
largest loss, reported in Wednesday's Times, occurred at Valentino, the Santa 
Monica Italian restaurant that had one of the world's finest restaurant wine 
collections. Owner Piero Selvaggio had acquired hundreds of selections over the 
years, including many irreplaceable older wines from great vintages. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's next, locusts?" asked owner Selvaggio's wife, Stacy. The couple lost 
their home in the Malibu fire three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the losses at Valentino were wines such as multiple bottles of 
1969 Romanee-Conti, three cases of 1978 Sassicaia, untold numbers of bottles of 
La Tache from vintages like 1969, 1971 and 1972, three cases of 1990 Leroy 
Burgundies, and collections of rare and expensive ports and grappas. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30,000 bottles of wine were jolted from the wine bins in one of his two 
second-floor wine storage rooms and broken; wine in his other storage room was 
mostly boxed in cases and sustained less damage. With a collection of some 
80,000 bottles of wine, Selvaggio says he lost more than 40% of his collection. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got upstairs, I couldn't open the door for a while because the broken 
glass was waist high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selvaggio said the loss was hard to calculate in dollars, but in wholesale 
cost, he said, it was at least a quarter of a million dollars -- the 
equivalent, he estimates, of 20 years of profits. He had no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Other restaurants that didn't have as much money tied up in wine inventory 
were far luckier, though many lost glassware.  
</P>
<P>
 Joachim Splichal at Patina, who stores his wine in individual wine racks that 
are attached to walls (not in free-standing bins) lost just two bottles of wine 
at his Patina Restaurant on Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
 However, his impressive glass-faced wine case in the front of his Pinot 
restaurant in Studio City tipped over and $18,000 in wine was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 At Campanile, wine manager Manfred Krankel said the restaurant was "pretty 
lucky" to lose only $4,000 in wine. Among the bottles: some El Molino Pinot 
Noir, Grace Family Cabernet, Chateau d'Yquem, a few bottles of First Growth 
Bordeaux, 1990 Chateau Rayas, Williams and Selyem Pinot Noirs and other odds 
and ends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the Daily Grill in Encino, manager Michael Hill said he lost "lots of wine, 
including a dozen bottles of Silver Oak Cabernet and a case of Jordan 
Cabernet," a total of about $5,000 in all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake gods didn't favor any one label," said Joshua Armstrong, wine 
manager forI Cugini in Santa Monica. "We lost all the grappa and about 15 cases 
of wines including a six-pack of 1989 Solaia. Overall, it was pretty evenly 
distributed in terms of breakage." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Knoll at Knoll's Black Forest in Santa Monica had a significant amount 
of glassware and stein breakage. He also lost many collectible German wines. 
Among domestic wines, he lost bottles of 1975 and 1978 Mondavi Reserve 
Cabernet. 
</P>
<P>
 His family-owned restaurant was not insured: "For a commercial operation, 
earthquake insurance is extremely expensive, if available," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Kerkhofs at Le Dome said, "I'm fortunate I didn't lose more. The irony 
is that I prepared for an earthquake by putting all of my good bottles as low 
as possible on the racks. Unfortunately an imperial of 1985 Lynch-Bages was 
broken when a cheap bottle of Beaujolais that I had stored on top of the rack 
fell on it." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Le Dome on Sunset Boulevard lost a lot of Champagne, but three bottles 
of 1985 Petrus fell to the floor yet did not break. In all, he estimated his 
wine loss to be about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At Il Mito in Studio City and at Monty's on Topanga Canyon Blvd., owners were 
so busy cleaning up the mess and taking a rough inventory they couldn't 
estimate their losses. At Il Mito, a spokesman said, "We lost all the wine," 
and said it would be a week before a full inventory was done. 
</P>
<P>
 At I Cugini Monday night, Armstrong said that people were ordering wine at the 
restaurant as if they were celebrating -- celebrating surviving yet another 
natural disaster.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CURIOUS HORDES; LOOKY-LOOS FLOCK TO AREAS OF 
DEVASTATION

 The Northridge Fashion Center, heavily damaged in last week'searthquake, 
became the most popular photo opportunity in Southern California on Saturday, 
judging from the hordes of camera-toting sightseers who flocked there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get some of this on film," said Jeremiah Jennings of Acton, 
peering into the eyepiece of a video camera pointed at the wreckage of the 
mall's parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings was one of thousands of people attracted by the mass destruction this 
weekend. Motorists cruised the damage route next to the mall along Tampa Avenue 
and Nordhoff Street, taking advantage of every pause in the backed-up traffic 
to jump out of their cars and take snapshots of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Another popular tourist destination was the site of the Northridge Meadows 
Apartments, where 16 people died. As if the residents in the surrounding area, 
cleaning up after the quake, were invisible, people strolled down the streets 
toting video cameras and still cameras. They took pictures of cracked walls, 
broken windows and shaky stucco facades. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those who came by apparently felt guilty about intruding on the misery 
of others and offered to pitch in and help quake refugees haul and load 
furniture onto the moving trucks that lined the street, said Mindi Renner, 
whose grandmother lived in one of the nearby buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Other visitors, however, claimed a valid reason for coming by. Jennings said 
he came to help his daughter, who lives nearby, dig out from the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents Susan and Paul Opel came to find out if Northridge 
suffered as badly as news reports had described. They felt that their city, 
which also was hit hard, has been ignored in the crush of news coverage focused 
on the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel much better now," said Paul Opel, as he gazed at the growing mountain 
of twisted steel and cement being formed from the demolition of Bullock's and 
the adjacent parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Patterson of Inglewood came to visit a family friend who was evacuated 
from her Northridge home after the quake. He brought his video camera to 
document the scene for posterity. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids are 9 and 6 now, and they're going through trauma," Patterson said. 
"When they get older I'll show this to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary Los Angeles police officers directed traffic, trying to keep cars from 
slowing or completely stopping along streets already clogged with moving vans 
and residents trying to clear out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just doing a great, big circle around the mall trying to keep traffic 
flowing," said Officer Sean Meade, as he and partner Dave Tulk ordered 
motorists to keep moving, like cowboys on a cattle drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was also diverted around the Northridge Meadows Apartments in the 9500 
block of Reseda Boulevard, forcing those who really wanted an up-close view to 
park their cars and walk over to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Espin of Westchester and Kathryn Boorer of Mar Vista admitted they came 
out to the Valley to snap pictures and view the effects of the killer quake for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wondered if people would hate us if we showed up," Espin said. "We don't 
feel that comfortable about doing this," he said, fiddling with a camera that 
hung from his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of the evacuees in the 19000 block of Nordhoff Street, gawkers were 
hardly the problem, said Sid Whittert, who lost his home of 22 years and a 
lifetime of personal mementos in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't pay attention to it, we're just concerned with ourselves," said 
Whittert, carrying stereo equipment to his car from his battered condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out alive, and that's all we want," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Roth of Pasadena, who came to help salvage what he could of his 
grandmother's belongings from the same building, said he understands why the 
curious would want to catch a glimpse of the devastation. But he still wished 
they would go away. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are just coming out to see the damage, they should just stay 
home," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The looky-loo phenomena isn't unique to earthquakes, pointed out Carol Weiss, 
who was helping her elderly parents move from their devastated Nordhoff Street 
condominium out to her home in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look what happens whenever there is a fender-bender on the freeway," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody stops."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; WOMAN, SON SAY GOODBY TO 2 KILLED IN DISASTER; 
TRAGEDY: FAMILY AND FRIENDS MOURN THE DEATHS OF PIL AND HOWARD LEE, WHO DIED 
WHEN THE QUAKE COLLAPSED NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS APARTMENTS.; BUT THE RIGHTEOUS, 
THOUGH THEY DIE EARLY, WILL BE AT REST. -- FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON

<P>
 And Jesus wept.  
</P>
<P>
 As Cardinal Roger M. Mahony spoke these words, mourners bid farewell to 
earthquake victims Pil and Howard Lee and tried to fathom why a family so close 
and so faithful would be pulled apart by the God in whom they believed. Why a 
boy considering the priesthood would be struck down at 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the length of years that proves how much God loves us," Mahony said 
Saturday at a funeral Mass for the Lees. "Rather it is the grace, how we let 
that love in." 
</P>
<P>
 By now, most of the country has seen the images of the Northridge Meadows 
Apartments, where early Monday morning, Pil Soon Lee, known to most as James, 
and his son, Howard, 14, died in Apartment 101 as the building crumpled around 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the image that should endure, that the television didn't capture, Mahony 
said, is of a family huddled together in prayer the night before they would 
part. An image of the two who died and the two who remain -- mother Hyun Lee 
and 12-year-old Jason -- kneeling together as they did every night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lee family's journey has not been an easy one," Mahony said. "But at the 
root of their lives was a deep faith, an enduring and abiding faith that God 
walked with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a failed business forced them out of their home and into a small 
two-bedroom apartment. Pil Lee, trained as a metallurgical engineer, took a job 
as a mechanic. The family, led by Hyun, who clung to her faith, attending the 
Eucharist every day, held together. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, as they said goodby to father and son, family and friends held even 
more strongly to that faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes before the 11 a.m. Mass began at St. Charles Borromeo Church in North 
Hollywood, the frantic pulse of sirens drowned out the organ chimes of "Ave 
Maria" and rows of shoulders shuddered. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, they turned to watch Jason Lee, his crushed feet bandaged in thick white 
gauze, being wheeled up the aisle before his brother's casket. His head bowed, 
Jason held in his lap a gold-framed portrait of Howard -- smiling, spectacled, 
hopeful in a shiny red robe.  
</P>
<P>
 "Since that very terrible Monday, the news media, television and newspapers, 
have tried to pinpoint where the center of this earthquake was as well as they 
can on maps," Mahony said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The real center is not a geographic location. But it is in the hearts and 
lives of so many people. It was indeed in the hearts and lives of the Lee 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Before celebrating the Eucharist, Mahony asked the congregation to comfort 
each other. They turned -- sniffling children, women with heads draped in lace, 
men old enough to have weathered tragedy of their own -- and grasped hands, 
embraced or just bowed, chanting, "Peace be with you. Peace be with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, mourners filled the aisles, shuffling past caskets draped in white and 
gold cloth, past a gold-framed portrait of Pil, past the smiling Howard, who 
had been a freshman at Our Lady Queen of Angels Seminary in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 They walked back to their seats, still chewing on the taste of wine and bread 
and nodding at others. "Peace be with you."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; OFFICERS PUT OTHERS FIRST IN QUAKE'S CALL TO 
DUTY; POLICE: LEAVING BEHIND THEIR OWN DAMAGED HOMES AND SHAKEN FAMILIES, LAPD 
PERSONNEL AID COMMUNITIES RAVAGED BY TEMBLOR.

<P>
 They bolted to work despite broken bones and broken houses; some even left 
wives in the throes of labor. 
</P>
<P>
 While everyone else still reeled, they sped along buckled freeways in the 
pre-dawn darkness. One answered the call so fast he drove his motorcycle off 
the severed Golden State Freeway to his death. Another hobbled to work on 
glass-shredded feet, only seeking medical help two days later when he could no 
longer put his shoes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Since those first horrible moments after the earthquake brought the region to 
its knees, the officers of the Los Angeles Police Department have put their own 
personal disasters, anguishes and fears on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 With their homes in disarray, their routes to work blocked and their offices 
trashed, the LAPD has been coping with the business of fighting crime as best 
it can. 
</P>
<P>
 Looting, luckily, has been minimal, and so have most other crimes -- less than 
300 arrests were made last week citywide, police said. But for all the LAPD 
personnel deployed in the field -- including those usually sitting at desks and 
doing plainclothes detective work -- there have been other problems and 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 For 12 hours at a stretch, they have roamed demolished areas and prohibited 
insistent tenants from entering unsafe buildings. They have directed endless 
rows of traffic and endured the rantings of frustrated motorists. Several even 
helped deliver a baby in a Reseda park, LAPD officials said, while others made 
sure donated food got to hungry mouths and applicants for federal aid behaved 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, police engaged in the general business of crime-fighting 
during the long week. Then, many got in their cars for a four-hour commute home 
to the northern reaches of the county, and turned around the next morning to do 
it all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time a tragedy occurs, the firefighters are the heroes, and the cops 
are the forgotten ones," said one sergeant. "But we are dedicated. We do care. 
When that battle cry was broadcast, those officers were there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Sean Meade was with his wife as she was in labor in the delivery room 
at Kaiser Permanente in Woodland Hills. Then the lights went off at 4:31 a.m. 
Monday and the building shuddered. 
</P>
<P>
 After making sure she was all right, Meade, 28, rushed to the Devonshire 
Police Station and reported for duty. He was one of the first on scene at a 
Northridge apartment building where at least 16 people died, keeping vigil and 
helping rescued tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leaving your wife behind when she was about to have a baby, that was real 
tough," Meade said Friday. "But I felt I had to be here, to help the city. It 
is at those moments when we are needed most." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Yehuda Packer did the same thing -- leaving his wife as she was about 
to go into labor to report for duty. His house too was heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are required to respond immediately in times of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 And when they got to Valley police stations Monday morning, that is just what 
they found. Meade said that in the pitch blackness, all the lockers at the 
Devonshire station were overturned, the phones were down and there was no 
water. He spent 90 minutes helping others dig out police radios and other 
equipment from underneath piles of rubble so officers could grab them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Devonshire station, located near the quake epicenter, was without power 
for a time, and without water for several days. Other Valley stations also were 
without water and power for part of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Police Chief Martin H. Pomeroy, who commands all Valley police, said 
the interiors of the Van Nuys station and Valley police headquarters were 
upended but none of the five Valley Division police stations suffered major 
structural damage. "Devonshire took a beating," Pomeroy said, "but all of them 
were severely impacted." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown, police headquarters at Parker Center was also hit hard. Those 
officers first on scene found broken pipes and glass, water damage -- and 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day was rough," Officer Art Holmes said. The phones were not 
functioning, the lights were out, people were afraid to traverse darkened 
hallways and elevators. "You couldn't even get into your uniform unless you had 
a light," he said. "It was definitely not business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 For police, commutes have been far from business as usual too. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Los Angeles officers live in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, 
areas cut off from Los Angeles by broken freeways. One LAPD civilian employee 
from Santa Clarita described the harried scramble to work Monday as "the drive 
from hell." 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could have, I would have quit that day," she said, asking that she not 
be identified. "I got up at 3, left at 4 a.m. and got home at 1:30 the next 
morning. Then I got up two hours later and did it again. And I'll be doing that 
for the next week." 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, police were beginning to patch up the stations. Officers also had 
begun inspecting their damaged homes and trying to solve commuting problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has made arrangements so that officers can take the Metrolink 
train from Santa Clarita to Burbank, where police buses pick them up and 
transfer them to their stations by 6 a.m. At night, they are taken back in time 
to catch the evening train home. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many others must drive. Some, police officials say, have been ferried 
home during some emergencies by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the beginning, the officers made it to work whatever way they could, 
and in whatever condition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Raquel Duarte, 26, remembers her Granada Hills apartment convulsing, 
and then digging out from the rubble with her boyfriend. "When we finally got 
out, I checked on my sister who lives down the street, and then I came in to 
work," said Duarte, who works at Foothill Division. When she returned Tuesday 
night, she found that the building had been condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost pretty much everything," she said. "I've been living out of a bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Dan Taylor, who patrols the Devonshire district, has worked through 
the week too, even though he also lost his Granada Hills townhouse and 
everything in it. "I live out of a suitcase," he said. "It's hard on you." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Tim Whisenhunt has been coming to work with a broken wrist suffered 
in the quake, and returning home to a battered house. He didn't go to the 
hospital until Tuesday because no broken bones were protruding through his 
skin, and the hospitals were swamped. His house, the pipes and the garage are 
damaged, and the place may have to be condemned. But he won't be there this 
weekend when the structural engineer comes. He'll be working. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no statistics on how many police lost homes, or were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 100 officers in the LAPD's Van Nuys earthquake command post, 70 
reported damaged homes, some of the damage "very significant," police said. One 
in five had injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems kind of odd," Sgt. John Herkowitz said. "They're out here helping 
everyone else, when they need help themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Dennis Zine, who now works for the police union, agreed. "We all have 
those feelings, emotions and that fear," he said. "But we all have been there 
on the line, doing what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Paul McMillan, logistics officer at the LAPD earthquake command post in 
Van Nuys, said "quite a few" officers have destroyed or damaged homes. What 
McMillan didn't say is that when the quake hit, he ran through his house 
barefoot, crunching broken glass in the darkness, said Herkowitz, who works 
with him in the command post. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wiped the blood off, pulled out the glass and came to work," Herkowitz 
said. "By the third day, the swelling got so bad he couldn't put his shoes on, 
so he went to the doctor. Then he came right back to work, and this is where 
he's stayed." 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan also suffered significant damage to his house, Herkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's getting real tired," Herkowitz said, "but they are still showing 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, some Valley detectives were returning to their caseloads. Other 
officers from throughout the force continued to pitch in, with help from the 
National Guard and county sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been an upside to all this self-sacrifice by police; some in the 
community have taken notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been doing a heroic job in a time of crisis," said Eric Rose, 
Valley Councilwoman Laura Chick's liaison to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time since March 3, 1991, since the Rodney King incident, 
officers are experiencing a warm feeling from the public," Rose said. "As they 
drive down the street in their black and whites, they say, they are getting 
waves and thumbs up from people. And that hasn't happened in several years."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; HER HOME IS THEIR HOME; CANOGA PARK NURSE TAKES 
IN 8-MEMBER FAMILY DISPLACED BY THE EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ann Koshy, a registered nurse who runs her own home care nursing firm, lives 
in a beautiful 2,800-square-foot home in Canoga Park with her two teen-age sons 
and a dog. But her boys left for boarding school in San Diego on Thursday, 
leaving her alone with the dog in a big empty house. 
</P>
<P>
 So Friday night, after cleaning up earthquake debris in her Woodland Hills 
office, she decided to stop by Winnetka Recreation Center to see if she could 
find a family that needed help. 
</P>
<P>
 It took her less than 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Koshy and her business partner, Dan Deen, saw a doctor talking to a family 
sitting in a car. The family had a 2-week-old baby boy and had been sleeping in 
their car at the park since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, God, I better take that baby home," Koshy said. "I asked 
them if they would like to come home with me, and they said yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Koshy, a native of India who has been in the United States for 20 years, 
downplayed her generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't do this, then who would?" she said. "This is humanitarian. It 
could have easily been me that was left homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sandoval family, Rodolfo and Griselda and their six children, are 
appreciative of Koshy's kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very grateful to her," said Sandoval, his family surrounding him. "I 
never expected anyone to offer their home to us. We had planned on sleeping in 
the park again tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the children, ages 13 to the newborn, were able to take their first 
baths since Sunday and did not have to stand in line to get dinner. With their 
wet hair slicked back, the children gobbled pizza that Koshy had bought for 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 While Koshy fed a bottle of formula to the baby, Rodolfo Jr., 4, chased 
Koshy's dog, Sugar, around the room, forgetting for the moment his fear of the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's afraid of returning to the apartment," the boy's mother said, adding 
that the boy was nicked on the nose by a falling headboard during the 
earthquake. "When we go back to the apartment to get clothes he starts crying." 
</P>
<P>
 After eating their fill, the children stretched out on a comforter and 
blankets that Koshy laid out for them on the floor of the den and watched a 
Spanish-language soap opera on Koshy's big-screen TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it here," said Joana, 13, the oldest child. "It's more warmer." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodolfo Sandoval said he is unsure if his apartment on Bryant Street in 
Northridge is habitable. He said there are cracks all around the building and 
he does not believe it has been inspected yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Koshy said the Sandovals may stay in her home until they find other shelter. 
But while Sandoval searches for housing, Griselda is just happy that her family 
is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be suffering," she said, looking over her brood of children, "but the 
family is together."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; NO REST FOR THE 'HOUSE DOCTORS'; BUILDINGS: 
HUNDREDS OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS FIND THEMSELVES OVERWHELMED BY PEOPLE SEEKING 
DIAGNOSES OF THEIR HOMES AND BUSINESSES. 
</P>

<P>
 Decked out in stone-washed denims, Hawaiian shirt and low-top Nikes, Leo 
Parker looks more like some goateed party boy on a three-day Vegas blowout than 
expert counsel to countless Los Angeles property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Parker can quickly tell you, looks can be deceiving -- in both people 
and in buildings rocked by a major earthquake. As he cruises up the long 
driveway of a Chatsworth mansion last week, its hand-wringing owners awaiting 
his attention, Parker is a steely eyed consultant who can give the good word on 
worrisome temblor damage. Or, like some perverse high priest of science, sound 
a residential death knell. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a house doctor, one of hundreds of local structural engineers who have 
made 18-hour-a-day house and condominium calls since Monday's quake rocked both 
buildings and owners off their once rock-solid foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 As the city building inspectors clear out, tens of thousands of property 
owners are looking for on-the-spot expertise from independent structural 
engineers such as Parker who have gained a newfound professional status akin to 
that of brain surgeon or cardiologist: Their opinions are considered with the 
full weight of a medical diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, Parker has been tailed by anxious owners who await his every 
word, seeking his colorful, straightforward explanations on everything from 
bedroom cracks to fallen fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 As Irwin and Sherry Learhoff looked on in rapt concern, the 36-year-old Parker 
explained why most of the damage occurred to the upper floors of their 
11,500-square-foot Chatsworth home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the mayhem is upstairs because the house shook off the quake like it 
would a shiver that accelerated up its spine," he said. "It built up force as 
it went along. It crested at the top, like a skyscraper rocking in a stiff 
breeze." 
</P>
<P>
 The cracks, he said, told the real story of the quake's damage. Some internal 
fissures running up and down or across a living room wall simply followed the 
form of the reinforcing plywood sheets beneath them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most disturbing cracks, Parker said, were the diagonal ones -- 
signifying that half the support had twisted one way and the rest the opposite, 
much like a chiropractor releasing tension from a human joint. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple nodded knowingly. Then Irwin Learhoff shook his head: "Geez." 
</P>
<P>
 They were lucky to reach Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demand has been so great my head is still spinning," Parker said. "We 
have three structural engineers in our firm, far too few to handle the hundreds 
of requests we've had. We finally had to stop taking new business. It's simply 
incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, there are 3,000 certified structural engineers, a flock of strange 
scientific birds who outdistance most colleagues nationwide in one critical 
aspect: analyzing major earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "California probably has the best-trained structural engineers in the world 
outside Japan," said Robert Boyens, a Lawndale engineer and spokesman for the 
Structural Engineer's Assn. of Southern California. "While other states have 
wind and water forces, we also have the distinction of having the ground 
convulse. Our job is to make sure buildings can withstand not only vertical 
loads but unpredictable seismic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, we have played an invisible role in the building process, working 
with builders and architects. But all that has changed after the quakes. Now, 
we're very, very visible. Suddenly, people know who we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin and Sherry Learhoff know. 
</P>
<P>
 For a $250 fee, Parker visited their house in the north San Fernando Valley to 
hear their story: They were away when the quake hit, avoiding the light 
fixtures that came crashing down atop their bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the couple walked about like solemn funeral-goers, pointing at 
a crumbled second-story fireplace, the telltale crow's feet around each window 
and deck, kicking at the shards of brick, fallen helter-skelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aftershocks are killing us," Irwin Learhoff said. "Every one of them 
keeps chinking the armor. It drives you crazy. But I'm no professional engineer 
who can read this stuff. We need help to figure out if our home is still 
livable." 
</P>
<P>
 With the couple in tow, Parker circles the house, picking through rubble like 
an archeologist at some suburban excavation site. He stops suddenly and they 
immediately give way, watching his flashlight beam pinpoint troublesome stress 
cracks as he jots notes like some homicide detective. 
</P>
<P>
 The Learhoffs want answers now. Because once the insurance company settles 
their claim, they know there is no going back with any new problems. On this 
day, Parker has only good news: Sure, the damage looks unsightly, but none is 
structural. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Learhoff isn't sure if she wants to come back home just yet. The place 
just doesn't feel right anymore. It's like living in a house possessed. "You 
have to ask 'What's really safe when you have a 12-month-old?' " she said. "My 
first impulse is to fix up the place and sell it." 
</P>
<P>
 At dawn the next morning, the house doctor is making yet another call. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks, he is greeted by an anxious brood of a dozen condominium 
owners who surround him as they would some prophet, or a celebrity. In the 
quake's aftermath, many have moved in with relatives. Like unruly 
schoolchildren, each pushes to get a front position in a semi-circle 
surrounding Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are our lives going now? To the state of confusion forever?" said Diana 
Harrison, an eight-year resident of the La Ventana condominiums. "My place 
looks like a bomb hit, like I live in Beirut. My possessions are mostly gone. 
But that's OK, I've had them 70 years. But I still need a place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Like patients attending some impromptu counseling session, other residents 
seek deeper answers: When will their fears go away? When can they hang their 
pictures again? When can they get a good night's sleep without popping pills? 
</P>
<P>
 Walking slowly, saying little to the crowd in tow, Parker calmly examines the 
outside foundation and moves through a few selected rooms. Behind him, the 
group purrs as he finally gives a preliminary clean bill of health for their 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "From here, your building looks just fine," he tells one owner. "If you don't 
live in the corner units where most of the stress occurred, I'd say you can 
move back in." 
</P>
<P>
 The beaming woman turned to a friend and said: "That's absolutely wonderful. 
C'mon, let's go to Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone gets such good news. Some grumbling homeowners are told they must 
stay away until further tests are done. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when it gets tough," Parker said. "People hire you to give them good 
news. When they don't get it, they want to shoot the messenger. They get angry. 
But I tell them 'Hey, I didn't cause this earthquake.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Structural engineers have also disagreed with city inspectors on a building's 
safety status. "I had one 13-story place where the owner wanted his apartments 
filled as soon as possible," Boyens said. "The city had given him the go-ahead, 
but I still had some problems. But I'm just an adviser. I told him what I 
thought. I don't know what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 As the morning haze settles into the San Fernando Valley, Parker leads the 
clutch of homeowners like some learned professor directing a university field 
trip. As he leaves each unit, its relieved owner relaxes at the thought that 
the engineer's learned eyes have at least come to rest on their damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nasrin Rousta won't sleep any better. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just want the place condemned so you can move away and never think about 
it again," she said pensively. "It's like a badly damaged car. You really don't 
want it fixed, you want it totaled. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want something new, something without memories."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CRIPPLED WATER SYSTEM HINDERS FIRE RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As yet another hindrance of an earthquake-crippled water system, Los Angeles 
firefighters Saturday were forced to bring their own supply to a late-afternoon 
blaze at a two-story Porter Ranch home. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the single-family house in the 11500 block of Vimy Road 
suffered about $250,000 in damage.There were no injuries. The home's owners 
left town shortly after the quake, said Paul Gutierrez of the Los Angeles Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 While firefighters were able to ameliorate the water problem, there was little 
they could do about the many cars that blocked their route, Gutierrez said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of civilian traffic impeding our way to the fire," Gutierrez 
said. "The house was on a hill, with a Valley view, so people who were driving 
around looking for the quake damage saw fire and went up to see what was 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of damage to area water mains, firefighters drew water from two 
2,000-gallon tankers to fight the blaze, which began at 5:13 p.m., Gutierrez 
said. Firefighters put out the blaze in less than 30 minutes.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; OUT-OF-TOWNERS MISS EARTHQUAKE RIDE; UNIVERSAL 
STUDIOS: BUT SOME LOCALS ARE RELIEVED TO FIND THE ATTRACTION HAS BEEN CLOSED 
SINCE THE TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Earthquake ride at Universal Studios remained closed Saturday, much to the 
irritation of out-of-town visitors such as Rama Vadgama of London. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Earthquake ride is the main attraction. That is why we are here," said 
Vadgama, who, with her husband was visiting relatives in California. "Our 
friends told us that it's an experience we shouldn't miss." 
</P>
<P>
 Locals who just came through the big Northridge quake, however, said they were 
not disappointed in the least that they would not get a chance to sample the 
simulated temblor. The ride would have ruined their visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got an earthquake ride less than a week ago. I don't need that today," said 
Robin Brown, 34, of Los Angeles, who was at the park with her three young 
children Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earthquake ride, which features a trip through a faux subway tunnel, where 
the ground begins to shake, causing a water main break and the crash of an 
approaching train, closed immediately after the earthquake hit Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Humphrey of Thousand Oaks, who has been on the ride many times before, 
said the ride is nothing like the real thing. "After going through a 6.6 quake, 
that (ride) is such a fake 8.3 quake," she said. "They are going to have to 
jazz it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Park employees said the Earthquake attraction, along with the King Kong ride, 
are closed indefinitely out of respect for local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like flying a flag at half staff," said Joan Bullard, spokeswoman for 
the theme park. She added that she does not know how long the attractions will 
remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
 A third attraction, the Collapsing Bridge, is also closed, but that one was 
under repair before the temblor hit. None of the rides suffered serious enough 
damage to force their closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to scare any more guests," said one employee working at the 
information center. "The King Kong attraction is closed because he shakes the 
building, and that is similar to an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Carmen Garcia's second visit to the theme park, but the Arcadia woman 
was not at all troubled that she missed the Earthquake ride again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still a lot of aftershocks, and I didn't want to get caught inside," 
said Garcia, 34. "I will not go on any indoor rides."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, some visitors said the decision about whether to ride should have been 
left to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we are going in if all these attractions are closed," said 
Tony Bauchamp, 21, of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that it's closed," agreed Manfred Loschmann, 34, of Austria. "I 
will come back some day to see it. I heard it's the number one attraction."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; VOLUNTEERS FROM SEATTLE AND TEXAS PITCH IN FOR 
SANTA CLARITA; RELIEF: WORKERS SERVE MEALS TO SANTA CLARITA'S HOMELESS QUAKE 
VICTIMS. METROLINK'S PARKING LOT IS EXPANDED. AND THE DAMAGE TOLL GROWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To witness Santa Clarita bouncing back Saturday from last week's earthquake, 
you just had to stop by a few parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Firing up huge kettles, relief workers from Texas were cooking ravioli for 
homeless quake victims in a K mart parking lot on Valencia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away, city workers were compiling new damage reports from inside 
tents in a parking lot beside a quake-battered City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 In a parking lot at the local sheriff's station, physicians and medical aides 
from Seattle were setting up an emergency treatment center for those injured or 
displaced by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a paving crew was creating more parking spaces at the city's jammed 
Metrolink lot to encourage local commuters to use the train instead of the 
clogged highways near Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the widespread moves toward recovery, the damage totals continue to be 
grim. 
</P>
<P>
 At a midday briefing, Santa Clarita officials said 1,010 private buildings and 
528 public structures had been damaged by Monday's earthquake, bringing the 
toll to $127.8 million within the city limits alone. Santa Clarita inspectors 
had examined more than 1,000 buildings as of 11 a.m. Saturday. Forty-six 
structures -- 21 homes, 18 businesses, six apartments and one church -- were 
ruled uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also marked 76 buildings for limited entry, allowing residents to 
remove their belongings. They included 51 homes, 11 apartments, 13 businesses 
and one church. 
</P>
<P>
 They also warned that the picture could grow grimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this number will continue to grow as we get more information," said 
City Manager George Caravalho. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city's figure did not include damage to three local libraries 
operated by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 As city leaders reviewed the physical damage, relief workers sought to feed 
those who had been forced out of their houses by the quake and others who were 
simply afraid to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 Working out of a bustling parking lot behind a K mart store, local Red Cross 
volunteers joined a Baptist church men's group from Texas collecting supplies 
and preparing meals for quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Donated goods included canned food, cleaning supplies and other necessities. 
"We've gotten almost a warehouse full of diapers donated by one firm," said 
John Anson, an assistant Red Cross supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Saugus High School football and basketball teams helped unload 
donations and distribute them to local shelters. The Red Cross served meals at 
Saugus and Canyon high schools, Newhall Park Center and the Santa Clarita 
Valley Senior Center in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the meals were being prepared by a nine-member Southern Baptist 
Convention Disaster Relief crew, which drove in by truck from Texas. On 
Saturday, the Texans cooked vats of scrambled eggs for breakfast, then made 
sandwiches for lunch and ravioli for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a little trouble rounding up enough lunch meat," said John La Noue, 
who was supervising the crew's Santa Clarita relief effort. "We're trying to 
make 2,000 sandwiches!" 
</P>
<P>
 Other out-of-state assistance to Santa Clarita included the Seattle-King 
County Disaster Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Deployed by FEMA, the 37-member medical team includes emergency physicians, 
nurses, nurse practitioners, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, a 
structural engineer and a counselor. The team will be stationed in the back 
parking lot of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station and will operate from 
9 a.m. to 9 p.m. until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army sent crews from central and Northern California to aid 
quake victims, including those camping out in Newhall Park. On Saturday 
afternoon, the team was serving hot dogs to people living in makeshift tents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've given out hundreds of blankets," said Salvation Army Lt. Lola Downey, 
from the Fresno area. "We've given out clothes, meals and water." 
</P>
<P>
 She said some of the people in the park were too frightened to sleep inside 
the shelter provided by the Red Cross. "We've made sure they all have blankets 
and are warm at night," Downey said. "But I'm not going to force someone to go 
inside when they're uncomfortable about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials believe the number of residents using evacuation shelters 
in Santa Clarita has stabilized, but they said they were concerned about 
forecasts of rain.  
</P>
<P>
 About 660 residents slept in the four Santa Clarita shelters Thursday and 
Friday nights, a decrease of about 60 people as senior citizens displaced from 
nearby convalescent homes were relocated by Los Angeles County. Red Cross 
personnel served 4,815 meals Friday to Santa Clarita residents, up from 2,500 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Smyth, an aide to Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), said all 
beds were filled Friday night at the Newhall Park shelter, with another 150 
people camping outside. Because of the rain predictions, Red Cross officials 
were planning to open a second shelter at a nearby school. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses were stationed at each shelter to provide basic medical aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita officials continued to operate Saturday from a tent in the City 
Hall parking lot, coordinating building inspections and providing information 
to residents via a 24-hour phone bank. 
</P>
<P>
 They planned to return to work Monday in the building, which has been declared 
structurally sound but needs $2 million in repairs, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 600 calls have come in daily from residents wanting inspections 
of their homes and workplaces, according to Gail Foy, city public information 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Major roads inside and outside of the city remained congested Saturday. The 
California Highway Patrol closed the north- and southbound on-ramps to the 
Golden State Freeway at the Magic Mountain Parkway because of their proximity 
to the Santa Clara River bridge, which is considered unstable, said Sgt. Ernie 
Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 At times on Saturday, traffic on the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway near 
Santa Clarita was backed up for two hours, according to Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers blamed some of the congestion on sightseers trying to get a 
glimpse of some of the most dramatic earthquake damage. They urged motorists to 
stay away from the quake-damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage more residents to travel by train instead of by car, Santa 
Clarita city officials said they had ordered the paving of a vacant lot near 
the Santa Clarita Transit Center, adding 500 parking spaces to the present 
1,200 spaces for Metrolink commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther north, the cities of Lancaster and Palmdale were working through the 
weekend on Metrolink platforms that can be used when the service is extended to 
the Antelope Valley on Monday morning.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; PRIDE BOTTOMS OUT IN 'TOP OF LOS ANGELES'; 
SYLMAR: FACADE OF AFFORDABLE RESIDENCES IN A SEMI-RURAL SETTING HAS CRUMBLED 
FOR MANY. ERRATIC DAMAGE PATTERNS SUGGEST CONSTRUCTION FLAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN and REBECCA BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The community that proclaims itself "The Top of Los Angeles" has long been the 
place where the middle class could accomplish the improbable -- own a 
condominium or rent an inexpensive apartment in an area where horses still 
roam. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Monday morning, the Northridge earthquake shattered that facade for many 
newcomers, revealing bitterness, anger and uncertainty where pride once stood. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the difference between what withstood the temblor and what didn't remains 
elusive in Sylmar, where condominiums and apartment complexes sprung up like 
weeds throughout the 1980s. Erratic damage patterns left ringing questions: 
Were these dwellings not just affordable, but cheap? Were amenities like 
first-floor parking fatal flaws? 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past couple of days people keep asking me, 'Why did these buildings 
fail?' " said Dave Keim, Los Angeles' principal building inspector. "You know 
what I'm telling them, sort of tongue in cheek? 'We had an earthquake.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only so much you can design for and still be cost-effective. What if 
your rent was three times what it is now? What are people willing to pay? 
That's a big trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Nieto thinks he traded off quality. He packed his belongings from the 
damaged Sunflower Condominiums on Foothill Boulevard near Bledsoe Street, and 
rued the day he bought one. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a lousy job," Nieto said. "In '89, when you couldn't afford a house, 
it was great to get it. But now, we have something that's not worth the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally and David Mejia swore they'd never return to the Sunflower unit they 
bought four years ago. "I don't think they're well built," Sally Mejia said. "I 
think the newer houses and townhouses are made cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
 But another resident at Sunflower, Richard Overton, said he wasn't 
disappointed with the building's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "These places did excellent," Overton said. "On either side of us there's 
major damage. There are cracks in the back, but it's just cosmetic." 
</P>
<P>
 An official with Lordon Management Co. of Covina, which manages Sunflower, 
referred calls to the company president, who was not available for comment. 
Building records show Sunflower was built to code, and inspectors found no 
subsequent violations. As of Friday, inspectors had not posted safety 
assessments at the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, Leslie Bradbury and a half-dozen fellow residents of 
Stoneman Villas bragged about the intact beams and smooth walls in their 
25-year-old buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they put those up down there, I felt like they went up in three weeks," 
said Bradbury, motioning to a row of damaged apartments and condominiums across 
the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the deadly apartment collapse that killed 16 people in 
Northridge, some experts blame the very amenity that made Sylmar so affordable 
-- ground-floor garages that let builders put more housing in less space. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoneman Villas, which survived, has attached, rear garages. Sunflower sits 
atop parking areas, and while it stayed up, numerous walls cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 At Shadow Trails Apartments, farther west, two buildings pancaked onto their 
ground-floor garages. But even so, rooms remained remarkably intact, and no one 
was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Even near the deadly Northridge Meadows collapse, almost identical structures 
weathered the tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Bedard, vice president of the Community Planning Advisory Council in 
Sylmar, hoped the quake would slow down condominium and apartment development 
and force officials to reconsider codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We designated one area in Sylmar to be for condos," Bedard said. "Now it's 
just mushrooming away. It's just one after another. . . . They just threw them 
together. They're shabby," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Silverman, the Los Angeles city planner assigned to the Sylmar area, 
says he hopes to consider tighter restrictions on ground-floor garages in the 
next draft of the area's community plan. "That's something that I feel as a 
professional I should bring up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a professional demolition worker, David Bibins scoffed at current codes, 
while unloading his possessions from a collapsed building at Shadow Trails on 
Foothill Boulevard near Glenoaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can just take a look at some of the older buildings around here -- 
they're still standing," said Bibins. "Plaster? Drywall? Come on. It's like 
saying, 'Huff. Puff. Blow my house down.' "

 It began, said Robert Shorte, as a desire among a small group of black actors 
to unearth the "gems and pieces" by emerging playwrights who needed to see and 
hear their works read aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 So Shorte, artistic director of the home-grown Chesley Playhouse in View Park, 
opened up the 60-seat theater to such a possibility, and in 1992 the Chesley 
Playreader's Society was born.Coordinated by actresses Theressa Rice, Julie 
Serquinia and Cynthia Urich, the society meets every other week to stage 
readings of contemporary and classic works, although the emphasis is on the new 
and untried.  
</P>
<P>
 "We laid the groundwork for this as a way to see plays we didn't even hear 
about," said Rice. "It not only gave writers a chance to air their material, it 
gave us, as actors, the chance to work immediately and bypass the Hollywood 
pecking order."  
</P>
<P>
 The society also feeds the playhouse works that could be produced in coming 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Two original one-acts recently read at the playhouse, "Garage Sale" and "Body 
Politic," will be produced this spring. "Zooman and the Sign," a sobering tale 
of street life by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Charles Fuller, will be 
read today.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chesley Playreader's Society meets at 2 p.m. today at Chesley Playhouse, 5131 
Chesley Ave., View Park, (213) 294-4096, 285-3307.

VOICES: THE POLITICIAN PRINCIPAL; IN ACHIEVING DIFFICULT INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, 
A MIDDLE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR ADHERED TO ONE OVERRIDING GOAL: THE STUDENTS' 
NEEDS COME FIRST.; GUADALUPE SIMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG, Guadalupe Simpson, 49, has instituted sweeping changes at 
Nimitz Middle School in Huntington Park since she became principal in 1986. The 
3,600-student school, 98% Latino and 55% limited-English speaking, has replaced 
about two-thirds of its teaching staff and expanded its counseling staff, and 
three years ago was awarded a $280,000 computer grant from IBM. Simpson was 
interviewed by Mary Helen Berg. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I first came here I just wanted the kids to have an education equal to 
middle-class or upper-middle-class kids. I just wanted us (teachers) to believe 
that the kids here could make it and that they wanted to make it, (but that) it 
was just more difficult. That's really a big vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I re-evaluated, and now I take littler steps. My approach has changed 
dramatically. I didn't really analyze the way things worked or considered (the 
school's) very political structure. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to have open discussion with teachers and talk about instructional 
change. I was shocked that people didn't want that. There was a power structure 
in place. I thought, "What's going on here?" 
</P>
<P>
 I've changed in what I look for in teachers. At first I used to look for 
someone who was organized and did a lesson plan and had some work ethic. But 
that wasn't enough. I mean, why is it that you're organized and have a pretty 
classroom but the kids still aren't going anywhere? 
</P>
<P>
 Now I look for someone who has these skills but who is willing to learn new 
ideas and techniques and someone who believes the kids can learn. We focus our 
job interviews now more on a belief system than on your knowledge of English or 
math. We focus on your commitment and whether you understand how difficult it 
is to work with kids in a poor urban area and how demanding their needs are. 
That's most important. 
</P>
<P>
 I started working with the teachers where they had strengths. At this school, 
many teachers had an interest in technology. We became part of the California 
Model Technology project, where the state gives money to school districts to 
promote technology in creative ways, and I started working with small groups of 
teachers who wanted me to be instrumental in helping them change and improve 
the instructional program. 
</P>
<P>
 We also have an IBM building. Two-thirds of it is funded by IBM with a 
$280,000 grant to improve writing. All 15 teachers who work in that building 
have been trained by Cal State Dominguez's department of education through the 
California Literature Project to use computers in their teaching to enhance 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids are really motivated by technology. I watched kids waiting at 7 a.m. to 
get in to use a computer. It's a modern-day gimmick, a new way of learning. The 
computer entertains in a way and it's very non-threatening. No one is marking 
your paper, and when the kids sit at a computer they can write more. Maybe 
because no one is watching them. Teachers can go into any child's work and look 
at it and correct it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in order to have a strong instructional program, you have to have a 
strong discipline program. If you don't have the discipline, then kids can't 
learn. But discipline has to be fair. Strong discipline doesn't mean (to) just 
punish kids. 
</P>
<P>
 At this school with such large numbers, some kids were being referred for 
discipline over and over. So I decided we needed more and better counseling so 
kids could learn how to take charge of their behavior and function in a 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly I got one extra counselor, then another. The parents bought into the 
idea and newer teachers bought into it. Now we have 10 counselors. For a school 
this size it's not enough, but it's a start.  
</P>
<P>
 I truly believe that if you tell kids, "You are really wonderful; you are the 
best class in the school," the kids will believe it and they will produce.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year I had a lot of teachers tell me, "Mrs. Simpson, this class of 
sixth-graders is the best class I've ever had." Finally one teacher figured it 
out. He said, "This is the class (that will graduate in) 2000, and they've been 
told since kindergarten they were wonderful and they were going to make a 
difference -- and they've been telling them and telling them. That's why 
they're wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some administrators who can get things done because they're 
politicians. I don't like to be a politician. I like to be a person who is an 
advocate for children. But to be really, really effective, to get things done, 
you have to be a politician and an advocate for children. 
</P>
<P>
 I never forget that I'm trying to do it for children. If I'm going to do it 
for my ego or because I want to make some teachers happy, that's not the way to 
do it. You have to truly analyze and study how it's going to better the 
children and how it's going to better their future, and then you can fight for 
it. And I don't let anybody get in my way. 
</P>
<P>
 When we applied for the IBM grant we were told that the district was not going 
to allow schools to apply for it individually. We already had a science grant 
with IBM, and IBM wanted us to apply for this grant for English. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I had to evaluate, after I had gotten all these teachers' input and parental 
input, and done politics with the union, whether I was going to take on the 
district or tell these teachers and everyone that they couldn't do the project. 
So I decided I would innovatively tell the district what I had to. I basically 
took the district my application and just told them I didn't know I couldn't 
apply. I took it the very last day and I played stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what we call innovative intervention. You know what my boss told me? 
"I'm really proud of you, but don't ever apply for a promotion because you're 
done in." I said, "I didn't do this for a promotion. I did it because it's very 
important for our instructional program." 
</P>
<P>
 How do you work within the district? You have to have a vision. You have to 
play politics. I guess I would have an easier time if I were not so 
strong-headed, but if we lose our focus that children are our No. 1 priority we 
can't do what's right for kids. Kids here have nothing, no parks, no recreation 
areas. They just have us.  
</P>
<P>
 I read this article that said when we start fighting about the school and 
fighting for kids, that's when change is going to happen, instead of fighting 
about money and power.  
</P>
<P>
 We'll get there. It'll take a long time, but we'll get there.

 MARIO VILLEGAS SR.: East Los Angeles , 65-year-old retired tool serviceman: 
"In 1987, we had some major damage to our chimney and a few cracks in the 
walls. This time, a few pictures fell down, but nothing major happened to my 
home. Sitting here, watching all the news channels show all the devastation is 
kind of heartbreaking. I really feel for these people who worked so hard to 
build something and had their lives damaged and lost all they had." TANIA 
ACOSTA: 22-year-old Cal State Los Angeles student "It scared me about the 
future in Los Angeles, but it has not changed my plans about living here. In 
other countries and everywhere you go, people are going to have certain kinds 
of problems, whether it's war or poverty. The earthquake made me more aware of 
my family, being a college student and living away from home. The more you are 
away from your family, the more you realize disaster can happen to you or 
someone you know." STEPHANIE LEWIS: 23-year-old lab assistant from the Crenshaw 
area "Earthquake preparedness is more prominent now for me. We need to take the 
necessary precautions with water and canned food. We aren't really prepared for 
the Big One. Lives were lost in the (1989) Bay Area earthquake, but what I have 
seen on TV of what happened here is so close. I know people who have had damage 
or lost their homes. It tells me we need to be prepared for the inevitable and 
anything that might happen." GABRIEL ORTIZ: 44-year-old truck driver from 
South-Central "I was glad nothing happened to my family except for losing power 
and phone lines for a day. We have always had bottles of water, so we were 
ready. I am very lucky to have my job, but the freeway closures and road damage 
will make things hard on me as a semi-truck driver. It doesn't matter how long 
it takes for me to make my deliveries because I will still get paid, but it's 
going to be real boring having to go so slow." ELOISE HOWARD: 37-year-old 
unemployed clerical worker from the USC area "I feel like we're sitting on a 
time bomb. I feel so helpless. I feel so numb and a little terrified. Praying 
is giving me some reality to hold on to, and I'm relying on the strength of 
God. Right now, I still feel uncertain about tomorrow. We did not have power or 
water for an entire day, and we have not had heat in our apartment complex 
because a pipe burst and the damage has not been repaired. The danger of 
natural disasters is more defined in my mind, but I still have a spooky feeling 
something else is going to happen."

GAME OF THE WEEK; IT'S SHOWTIME AS CUBS PREVAIL IN OVERTIME; COMMUNITY 
COLLEGES: BROWN STARS AS LACC DEFEATS COMPTON, 106-101, IN THE CUBS' FIRST 
TELEVISED GAME.

<P>
 Markee Brown was cognizant that Los Angeles City College basketball team was 
playing in its first televised game. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he butted chests with his teammates for inspiration or taunted his 
defender after making a clutch basket, Brown put on quite a performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman guard hit six three-pointers, including one at the start of 
overtime, to boost LACC to a 106-101 win over Compton College in a Southern 
California Athletic Conference game at home Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who led the Cubs (20-3, 2-0) with 29 points, was 9-for-18 from the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's preparation," Brown said, who was 6-for-9 from the three-point line. "I 
come in the gym early before the game and shoot, so I am ready when my team 
needs me." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown hit a crucial three-pointer with 4:30 in overtime to open the Cubs' 13-8 
onslaught over the Tartars in the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 LACC took a 73-65 lead midway through the second half before Compton's Michael 
Whittaker put on an offensive display of his own. Whittaker, who had a 
game-high 32 points, scored 14 of Compton's next 21 to tie game at 86. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittaker sent the game into overtime on a slicing layup between two defenders 
to knot the score at 93 as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 LACC Coach Mike Miller was not surprised at Compton's (14-11, 0-2) resiliency. 
"They put us to a test," Miller said, "I wasn't surprised at their effort 
because they are much better than their record indicates." 
</P>
<P>
 When LACC All-American Marty Conwright fouled out 5:26 into the second half 
with only five points and four rebounds, it appeared that Compton would have a 
decided advantage in the middle. But guards Derrick Higgins, who scored 23 
points including six in overtime, and Mike Dorsey, who added 15, combined for 
10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't get the rebounds late in the game and that really hurt us," 
Whittaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the play of forward Brian Tyler, the Tartars had neither scoring nor 
rebounding problems in the first half. Tyler, who made 23 points and grabbed 
six rebounds, hit three consecutive three-pointers to stretch Compton's lead 
to, 37-33. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael (Whittaker) and I are the go-to guys, so we step up when the team 
needs points," Tyler said. "(Scoring) is an every-night thing for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Records: LACC 20-3, 2-0; Compton 14-11, 0-2.

BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; GOLDEN EAGLES GET THEIR WINGS CLIPPED

 It was a short stay alone atop the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
standings for the Cal State Los Angeles men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A., seeking its first conference title since 1960, entered the 
Thursday night game at Cal State Dominguez Hills as the association's only 
unbeaten team but left with a 76-61 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Eagles' defeat has created a battle for the top seed in the 
four-team CCAA postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A. fell to 3-1 and into a tie for the conference lead with Cal 
State Bakersfield, the defending NCAA Division II champion, heading into 
Saturday night's home game against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Dominguez Hills 
and UC Riverside were tied for second at 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a really huge win for us tonight," said Cal State Dominguez Hills 
center Alex Del Hierro, a 6-foot-8 junior from Bell High. 
</P>
<P>
 "All week long we were focusing on Cal State L.A., knowing that they were on 
top. Our main focus was getting in their face, making them rattle. Once the 
shot goes up, box out and clean up the boards." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a job well done for Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Eagles, who made 23 of 55 shots (41.8%) were out-rebounded, 32-28, 
and managed only seven offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Paul led Dominguez Hills with 15 points, while former Verbum Dei star 
Joe Bertrand added 12 rebounds to his conference-leading total. The Toros 
connected on 24 of 44 shots from the field (54.5%). 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Lattimore had a game-high 20 points, including four three-point baskets, 
for Cal State L.A. teammates Rodney Harris and Lorenzo Ball scored 11 and 10 
points each and Antoine Burwell had six assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros broke a 16-16 tie on a Mike White three-point basket with 8:57 left 
in the first half and never trailed again. A layup by Del Hierro gave Dominguez 
Hills its first double-digit lead, 49-38, with 12:59 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A. closed the gap to 53-48 on a breakaway steal by Rodney Harris 
with 9:59 left, but the Toros went on a 15-to-4 run over the next six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Cal State L.A. 8-10, 3-1; Cal State Dominguez Hills 12-5, 3-2.

 Southwest L.A. 76, East Los Angeles 69 -- East Los Angeles men's basketball 
Coach Jorge Calienes hasn't scouted many opponents this season. And don't 
expect Calienes to change his itinerary after the Huskies' latest defeat 
against Southwest L.A. in a Southern California Athletic Conference game 
Wednesday night at East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to fix the repairs in our house and our problems before we can go out 
and scout," the sixth-year coach said. "There's no need to find out what other 
people are doing when you don't know what you are doing yourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies do know they've faced some of the state's top community college 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of their losses have come against team's ranked among the top 15 in 
Southern California by the Junior College Athletic Bureau, including 
second-ranked Cerritos and third-ranked Long Beach City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies trailed 66-56 with 7:26 to play, but used a 10-to-2 run to climb 
within 68-66 on a layup by sophomore guard Danny Barajas with 2:51 remaining.

 "Wyatt Earp, Wyatt Earp / Brave, courageous and bold..." 
</P>
<P>
 So went the theme song from the TV show about the Old West's best-known 
lawman. Just how brave, courageous and bold, however, depends on whose movie 
version you believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, Hollywood has portrayed Wyatt Earp as a stuffy do-gooder, but a guy 
who stood up to lawlessness when lawmen shot first and asked questions later. 
Yet Hollywood never gets tired of the story of Earp and his brothers, as they 
faced down the Clanton gang at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Ariz., on Oct. 26, 
1881. This season features "Tombstone," starring Kurt Russell. When "Wyatt 
Earp" hits screens this summer, Kevin Costner will become the latest to play 
the legendary peace officer. Here's how the versions most readily available on 
video stack up.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; JOINING THE HALVES OF BERLIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETRA FALKENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Germany's long-divided capital is gradually growing together. Subway trains 
are once again operating along the entire length of the popular U-2 line that 
runs from the northern suburb of Pankow in the former Communist east, through 
the heart of the city to the Olympic Stadium in the leafy western outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 For 32 years, the line -- like the city it served -- was cut in half by the 
Berlin Wall, with a 2.5-mile void in the middle. But on Nov. 13, with city 
officials laying on free soup and beer to all passengers as part of an 
inaugural celebration, the breach was finally closed, enabling Berliners once 
again to traverse the heart of the city by subway. 
</P>
<P>
 The line includes one of Berlin's most famous stations, Potsdamer Platz, the 
heart of the city during the period between the two World Wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilt after being damaged by Allied bombers during World War II, Potsdamer 
Platz existed on the edge of the political divide, serving as the last station 
in the east before it was closed completely by the construction of the Berlin 
Wall in August, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the station seems destined to once again serve the heart of a 
democratic Germany's capital. The old streets leading into the platz have 
already been rebuilt, and major investors, including Daimler Benz and Sony, 
have announced plans to relocate there. 
</P>
<P>
 The area around Potsdamer Platz will also be within a short walk of several 
ministries when the government moves back to Berlin by the end of the century.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; A VIKING FESTIVAL COMES TO YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ancient city of York in northern England fell under Scandinavian rule in 
the middle of the 9th Century when Vikings sailed up the River Ouse from the 
North Sea, took the city by storm and renamed it Jorvik. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the Vikings welcomed the approach of Spring with Jolablot (winter 
festivities), so York brightens up the otherwise dreary month of February with 
its annual Jorvik Viking Festival.This year the city's celebration of its 
Nordic past is set for Feb. 4 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 5, English and Scandinavian oarsmen will board traditional Viking 
longships for a race on the Ouse and later that day there will be a Viking 
feast in the 14th-Century Merchant Adventurers Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will feature almost daily Viking-style activities including a 
torchlight procession, boat-burning ceremony, Viking dramas, lectures on Viking 
food and culture, concerts, folk dancing and displays of Roman, Viking and 
medieval arts and crafts.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; SAYING 'I DO, I DO' ITALIAN-STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fancy tying the knot with an Italian twist? 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Luxe International Inc. specializes in custom weddings in Italy. Founder 
Lisa G. Habicht of Allendale, N.J. (who also owns Cuendet U.S.A., which offers 
rental property throughout Italy), says she can deliver on any dream, be it an 
intimate ceremony in a castle in Tuscany or an elaborate party in a grand 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The largest wedding we've done involved a bride and groom who lived in 
Washington, D.C., but had relatives all over the world," Habicht says. "The 
bride was from the Middle East and the groom from Denmark. So they decided to 
get married in the middle -- in Tuscany." 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Luxe will make the usual wedding arrangements -- reception, photographer 
and flowers -- along with the unusual, including gondolas and 17th-Century 
costumes. That's the easy part. 
</P>
<P>
 More important -- and far more complicated -- is cutting through the Italian 
red tape. The Italian Government Tourist Board in Los Angeles will send 
Americans who are considering a wedding in Italy three pages of convoluted 
rules and regulations. Those who have done it themselves shudder at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes Habicht's staff of three in the United States and delegates in Italy 
to make arrangements. Fees range from $500 to $1,000, which cover faxes, 
telephone calls, documentation and leg work. She prefers to have at least six 
months, but "we've done it in four weeks." 
</P>
<P>

ADVENTURE TRAVEL: NEW YORK: SKIING HUT TO HUT; WEEKEND CROSS-COUNTRY 
ENTHUSIASTS TACKLE THE WILDERNESS TRAILS OF THE ADIRONDACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SILK, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kapow! In the dark forest around Kunjamuk cabin, the trees are popping like 
firecrackers. It's 30 degrees below zero, and the bone-stinging cold that 
cloaks the cabin in a mantle of ice is freezing the sap in the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Bang! And the expanding veins of solidifying sap burst in the trees like rifle 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Kablam! The moon is full. A pillar of smoke churns its way into the night sky, 
rising from a woodstove the size of a locomotive. The smoke is a reassuring 
sight on this frigid night. It means a roaring fire blazes inside the lonely 
log cabin here in the middle of the Siamese Ponds Wilderness Area, deep in the 
Adirondacks of Upstate New York. And without a fire, well, let's just say the 
nine cross-country skiers holed up inside the cabin would not be happy campers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapow! Here at Kunjamuk, the snow is two feet deep. The cabin is miles away 
from the nearest road. The scene is set for a Jack London-style battle pitting 
a small band of adventurers against arctic elements. There's no doubt about the 
outcome, though this is a wilderness adventure all right -- but one that's 
carefully planned for weekend warrior types. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the folks on this two-day cross-country ski trip display the most 
rudimentary of ski skills (several need instruction in hill-climbing techniques 
at the first incline), but anyone game enough to contemplate covering about 10 
miles a day on skis is welcome on an Adirondack Hut to Hut Tours outing. (Real 
beginners may spend their weekend exploring trails nearer the base camp.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake. These trips are a touch rugged, as anyone who's got to make 
the 10-yard dash through the snow to the icicle-covered outhouse will tell you. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Blank, owner of the ski-touring company, is often the first to warn 
potential customers away from his hut-to-hut trips. "I don't want anybody to 
think we're going from the Ramada Inn to the Holiday Inn across the golf 
course," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Any lingering doubts about a lack of luxury are dispelled the morning skiers 
shove off from Chimney Mountain Lodge at King's Flow near Indian Lake. One of 
the final preparations for the first day's eight-mile ski is making your own 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are few other chores -- skiers' gear is shuttled into the cabin via 
snowmobile. All a skier need haul is something to eat and drink, a camera and 
perhaps a few extra layers of clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 The ski trip begins with a gentle downhill coast to King's Flow, now an ice- 
and snow-covered marsh. Back in the heyday of Adirondack logging, nearly all 
the trees in these parts were stripped away by woodcutters. Across the flow, 
skiers zigzag through a patch of second-growth forest and onto the shores of 
Round Pond. Spreading out, the group of nine scuttles across the wind-swept 
pond and past a series of beaver dams before ducking back into the pines to 
follow the old Kunjamuk Road, a former stagecoach trail running between Indian 
Lake and Speculator. During the next two days, they'll ski along frozen creeks, 
across ponds and down barely bushwhacked tracks.  
</P>
<P>
 The gentle but constant shuffling motion of cross-country skiing keeps the 
subzero temperatures at bay, but whenever there's a halt, the cold sneaks into 
your bones with an icy caress.  
</P>
<P>
 There's a good side to the deepfreeze -- the snow is perfect. And abundant. 
Skis slip through about a foot of wispy powder that's more like smoke than 
snow. That fresh layer of dust smothers a deep, firm base. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the place to discover what cross-country skiing is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know the sport only by skidding across a golf course or circulating 
through a crowded trail system cannot guess at the exhilarating sense of 
freedom gained by really going cross-country, over hill and down dale, through 
forests and across ponds for mile after mile after mile.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of the terrain is overly taxing. The few steady climbs aren't too steep 
and the downhill runs are gentle and, for the most part, free of the 
cross-country skier's nemesis -- quick, sharp, do-or-die turns. Even beginning 
skiers manage to take on the ups and downs, albeit with falls aplenty. 
</P>
<P>
 The two guides, Dick Collins and Tom Kligerman, represent opposite poles of 
the skiing spectrum. Dick, in his homemade down vest and wooden skis, shuffles 
along with hard-won grace, earned by hundreds, if not thousands, of trail 
miles. Kligerman, decked out in head-to-toe Gore-tex and coasting along on 
metal-edged telemark skis, moves in state-of-the-art style. The gear their 
charges use covers the broad range between the two.  
</P>
<P>
 Deeper in the woods, the knot of skiers spreads out as the more accomplished 
ones take the lead with one guide, while the others struggle on with another. 
Regardless of a skier's ability, it's hard not to be taken in by the spell of 
the winter forest. Pine boughs droop under the weight of snow. Quick gusts of 
wind sweep the snow from the branches, and the flakes glint like tiny jewels as 
they drift through beams of sunlight that spear the forest canopy.  
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, the skiers glide toward the cabin. The temperature is 
dropping. Punching a path through the snow to the nearby woodshed, the skiers 
form a human chain and pass dozens of logs into the cabin and on into the fiery 
maw of a just-lit, giant woodstove made from an old water boiler. After 
darkness falls, there's dinner, a hearty meal of salads and spicy burritos. In 
the icy night, Orion ushers the moon into the sky. The trees start popping. All 
is cozy in the now-warm cabin. The skis are outside, waiting. Tomorrow, there 
will be more tracks to make. GUIDEBOOK

 Getting there: Chimney Mountain Lodge, the starting point for most Adirondack 
Hut to Hut Tours, is in the Adirondack Mountains near Indian Lake, N.Y. Driving 
time from New York City to the camp is about 5 1/2 hours. Because the isolated 
lodge can be hard to find, get precise directions from the tour company. 
</P>
<P>
 Available tours: Adirondack Hut to Hut Tours offers a variety of cross-country 
ski tours. The popular two-day ski to and from Kunjamuk cabin is offered almost 
every weekend during winter, conditions permitting. The $155 price includes 
meals, accommodations and informal instruction on the trail.

 I used to be in the hotel business and the article, "How the Ritz Rates" (Dec. 
19), almost made me ill.Two days at the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna Niguel for only 
$1,003.05. It is this type of hotel operation that gives "luxury" hotels such a 
bad name. It has nothing to do with elegance . . . On the contrary, it caters 
to the self-indulgent, arrogant, stupid and vain and it emphasizes the greed of 
management.

A MATTER OF TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have to wonder whether David Haldane really knows good Mexican food after 
reading his comments on Mi Casa in Cabo San Lucas ("Econo-Dive," Jan. 2). 
</P>
<P>
 We have traveled extensively in Mexico for more than a decade and . . . 
recently spent a week in Cabo San Lucas.Out of seven nights, we ate at Mi Casa 
three and at Ponchos three; the other night at the charming Hotel Hacienda. 
True, Mi Casa may be expensive, but it is more than worth it. They feature 
sauces from all parts of Mexico. You don't go there to eat an enchilada! The 
only place where we were unhappy with the food was our hotel -- the lovely 
Pueblo Bonito -- because it was too Americanized and poor quality. Very 
surprising because everything else is tops. 
</P>
<P>
 We're ready to return to Cabo so we can enjoy Mi Casa's fine cuisine.

 How can anyone possibly write an article on Malta ("Malta, a Mediterranean 
Mecca," Jan. 9) without including the valor of those involved in fighting off 
Axis forces during World War II and saving this tiny (and highly strategic) 
island that was vital to victory in the Middle East. Malta holds the dubious 
distinction of being the most bombed and devastated area in history.

THE 6.6 QUAKE; ON THE REBOUND: A GUIDE TO RECOVERY AND RESOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The glass is being swept up, many supermarkets are restocking their shelves, 
ATM machines are working again and the lights are on in all but the most 
grievously savaged neighborhoods. But the thousands of Southern Californians 
jolted out of their daily routines by the Northridge quake still face 
formidable obstacles to normalcy.Those who suffered property damage find 
themselves in a bewildering maze of insurance forms, loan applications, 
demolition and building permits. Scores of decimated classrooms spell 
continuing upheaval for thousands of students and their families. The rupture 
of a number of freeways is forcing commuters to find new routes to work, and 
creating a new dependence on buses and trains. Long after safe waters flows 
again throughout the San Fernando Valley, after the streets are patched and 
detours posted, after the wounded are healed and the dead are buried, the 
complicated business of recovery and readjustment will continue. At the same 
time, prudent Southern Californians will be dusting off their earthquake 
preparation plans and taking inventory of batteries, water and first-aid 
supplies. Today's special report provides a comprehensive guide to resources 
and offers step-by-step help not only in coping with this quake but also in 
girding for the next one.

THE 6.6 QUAKE; ON THE REBOUND: A GUIDE TO RECOVERY AND RESOURCES; MAKING IT A 
HOME AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may have been home sweet home a week ago, but it sure looks like a mess 
now. For renters and homeowners trying to decide what to do next, help is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a road map through the tangle of tasks ahead, from assessing the 
damage to making repairs; from filing an insurance claim or an emergency loan 
application to paying the mortgage; from making sure your present house is 
comfortable to finding a new apartment when the one you had swayed and buckled. 
Getting an Inspection 
</P>
<P>
 * If your home or building was not inspected by the Building and Safety 
Department, call for an inspection at the following numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 213 area code: 237-0920, 237-0921 or 237-1487; 485-1936, 485-1937 or 
485-1938; 485-7091, 485-7092, 485-8573 or 485-7093. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no special numbers in the 818 or 310 area codes; the above numbers 
are for all damaged structures in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 805 area code: 497-8611; 529-6864, Ext. 421; 583-6723; 583-6700; 
524-7125; 524-7121; 933-4218; 388-4270; 385-7936; 654-7869; 986-6515; 640-2555, 
or 654-2771. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your home or building was inspected by the Building and Safety 
Department, a red, yellow, or green tag will be attached to the structure. Red 
means unsafe, do not enter or occupy. Yellow means limited entry and enter at 
your own risk. Green means no apparent hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city encourages residents to hire private inspectors to assess the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look in the Yellow Pages under home inspections or call the Structural 
Engineers and Architects Assn. of Southern California, (310) 908-6131, which 
can refer you to licensed structural engineers in your area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Private inspectors will assess the damage and give you a written report that 
you can submit to a contractor. Hiring a Contractor 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has hit and now you want your home or business back in one piece as 
soon as possible. The Building Industry Assn. has chapters throughout the area 
with lists of licensed contractors who are members. The Greater Los 
Angeles-Ventura chapter's number is (818) 591-2001. Here are some guidelines if 
you need to hire a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before randomly picking a contractor, owners should do a spot inspection: 
Walk around the property and check the ground for muddy spots that would 
indicate a broken water or sewer pipe; check gas meters for leaks -- a 
rotten-egg smell is a giveaway; check all overhead electrical and phone lines 
for damage, and check water heaters, furnaces and air-conditioning units for 
leaks, broken wires or broken plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 * When a home or business has broken windows, it may be smarter to board them 
up -- and have them inspected -- instead of immediately replacing the glass. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get several bids. Remember that a deal that sounds too good to be true 
usually is. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask to see the contractor's wallet-size license and a driver's license or 
other form of identification. 
</P>
<P>
 * A full-service inspection, including checks for roof, plumbing and 
structural damage, should cost about $200. 
</P>
<P>
 * Call the Contractors State License Board's toll-free line, (800) 321-2752, 
to ensure that the license has not been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask to see a copy of the contractor's certificate of workers' compensation 
and liability insurance coverage. Call the contractor's insurance carrier to 
verify that the policy is in force. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your insurance isn't paying the bills and you have to borrow to finance a 
repair job, be wary of contractors who insist on helping you select a lender -- 
you could become a victim of a kickback scheme that will increase your costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insist on a written contract that spells out what will be done, what 
materials will be used, brand names of any materials you prefer, the estimated 
time it will take to do the work, when each payment is due and how disputes 
will be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 * Under state law, contractors cannot ask for more than $1,000 upfront, or 10% 
of the job's price excluding finance charges, whichever is less.

THE 6.6 QUAKE; ON THE REBOUND: A GUIDE TO RECOVERY AND RESOURCES; MORTGAGES, 
REPAIRS AND OTHER PRACTICAL MATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monday's devastating temblor left many homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters 
asking questions about paying their mortgages, replacing necessities, making 
repairs, seeking property tax relief and other matters. Here are answers to 
those and other questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Must I continue making mortgage payments if my house was damaged or 
destroyed? 
</P>
<P>
 A. While payments are technically due regardless of damage, many lenders are 
allowing customers to defer payments for several months. Bank of America, for 
example, will give current customers a payment moratorium of up to three 
months. Union Bank and Countrywide Mortgage also say they will work out 
deferred-payment arrangements with borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about paying my credit card and home equity loans? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Same deal. Payments are due but, if you contact your lender, you may be 
able to delay payments or even increase your credit line for emergency 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 But shop carefully and ask a lot of questions -- hundreds of dollars in 
interest costs can hang in the balance. For instance, Bank of America will 
increase credit lines for its Visa and MasterCard customers who are earthquake 
victims. The bank is also offering unsecured lines of credit of up to $7,500 
for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 If you take the credit card deal, you'll pay between 16.9% and 19.8% interest, 
depending on whether you have the variable- or fixed-rate card. If you take the 
personal line of credit instead, you get a 5% loan for up to four years. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd pay at least $238 more, annually, for borrowing $2,000 against the 
credit card instead of borrowing the same amount on the credit line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My next property tax installment is due Feb. 10, but my house was damaged. 
Can I get property tax relief? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes. If you suffered more than $5,000 in home damage, contact your county 
assessor's office. In Los Angeles County, that's (213) 974-7394; in Ventura 
County, (805) 654-2181. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask for two forms -- one seeking a reassessment of property damaged by 
"misfortune or calamity," and another seeking a temporary deferral of payment. 
File both forms within 60 days of the date the damage occurred and include 
photographs. The assessor's office will send an appraiser to determine the 
extent of the damage and reassess your home. If you've owned the home for a 
long period, however, don't expect the reassessment to fully account for the 
cost of damage, said Kenneth P. Hahn, Los Angeles County assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Proposition 13 has kept your property tax assessment 
artificially low. Assessors will prorate tax reductions based on the difference 
between the true market value of your home and the value for property tax 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 So if your house is worth $100,000 but is assessed at only $70,000 because of 
limitations from Proposition 13, your $10,000 lost chimney may reduce your tax 
assessment by $7,000 -- or the prorated value of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My house wasn't hurt by the quake, but some of my neighbors have damage. 
I've got my house up for sale. Is this going to affect its salability or price? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Generally, home values suffer in disaster areas for several months, partly 
because the neighborhood doesn't have its usual luster. 
</P>
<P>
 But, assuming that your neighbors get their houses repaired, prices should 
bounce back up relatively soon. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's no real reason why you must move in the wake of the disaster, you 
might want to hang on to the house a few extra months to get the benefit of the 
bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I've had substantial damage to my home, but I'm debating about repairing it 
now because of the constant aftershocks. If I wait, will I jeopardize my 
insurance coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Not usually. The only time your insurance would be affected is if you were 
negligent about securing your belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if your chimney fell down, exposing part of your home to 
outdoor weather, the insurer would expect you to seal off the opening so rain 
didn't come in and cause more damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, you should immediately make any repairs that are necessary to 
ensure your safety and the safety of your family and guests. 
</P>
<P>
 If these repairs need to be done twice because aftershocks damaged the 
repairs, the insurer will pay to fix it again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I don't have earthquake insurance and I had substantial losses. Can I get a 
tax deduction? 
</P>
<P>
 A. For very substantial losses, yes. But to claim a so-called casualty loss, 
you must have unreimbursed damage in excess of 10% of your annual income, plus 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if you earn $50,000 a year, you can write off only those 
damages that exceed $5,100. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that once an area has been officially designated a federal 
disaster area, you have the option of claiming your casualty loss on the 
previous year's tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 That would allow you to get a refund processed immediately and have the money 
when you need it. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gives you the option of claiming the loss in the year -- this year or 
last -- when you would be eligible for the greatest casualty loss deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 If your income was lower last year than this year, for example, you would get 
a bigger deduction because the 10% threshold would be lower. (If you earned 
$40,000, you can write off losses exceeding $4,100.)  
</P>
<P>
 But casualty loss claims can trigger a tax audit. So keep receipts, 
photographs and other appropriate documentation to substantiate the claim.

THE 6.6 QUAKE; ON THE REBOUND: COPING WITH THE QUAKE; HOW TO GET FEMA ON THE 
JOB FOR YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People who lost homes and property in the earthquake can apply for local, 
state and federal assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
repair property or to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and tenants can qualify for relocation grants, which cover typical 
rents for up to 18 months. Citizenship or proof of legal residency is not 
required. Call (800) 462-9029, a 24-hour number, to register with FEMA or visit 
an office. An inspector will visit within 10 days. Callers need to provide the 
following information: 
</P>
<P>
 * Date of earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Social Security number. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family's gross income before the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * A telephone number where applicants can be reached or where a message can be 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 * Any insurance coverage, company name, agent's name and telephone.  
</P>
<P>
 * Directions to the home from the nearest intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 This information will be used as the basis for an application for the Disaster 
Housing Program. Even if you have insurance coverage, FEMA will send out a 
damage verifier. The Disaster Housing Program will determine what type of 
assistance you require to meet your housing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * FEMA can provide aid for small repairs and grants for such needs as 
replacing essential household items. Those grants, typically awarded to people 
on fixed incomes, can be used to pay for quake-related medical expenses or 
funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 * The disaster relief agency provides low-interest loans, processed by the 
Small Business Administration, to cover the loss of uninsured residential 
property and personal effects. 
</P>
<P>
 * The maximum loan is $120,000 ($100,000 real estate, $20,000 personal) and 
can be used to rebuild, replace or repair your residence. Renters can apply for 
loans up to $20,000 for personal property damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * There is no list of guidelines that determines eligibility. Officials 
emphasize that they evaluate applications on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * The loan program will not approve a loan if you cannot afford to repay one. 
If you cannot repay a loan, you will be referred to the Individual and Family 
Grant Program. 
</P>
<P>
 * The grant program is administered by the state and can grant up to $12,200, 
in addition to a state supplemental program providing an additional $10,000.  
</P>

THE 6.6 QUAKE; ON THE REBOUND: A GUIDE TO RECOVERY AND RESOURCES; NAVIGATING 
INSURANCE WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if you have applied for FEMA aid, it is important to also contact your 
insurance company or agent to file a claim for damages. You should file a claim 
against your various insurance policies for the following kinds of damage: 
</P>
<P>
 * Homeowners and Renters: if your home or personal property was damaged, or if 
you cannot live in your home. Most homeowners' and renters' insurance will pay 
limited housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vehicle: if your vehicle was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medical: if you or a family member were injured or had a medical device, 
including eyeglasses, damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dental: if you or a family member had a dental injury or had a dental 
device, including dentures, damaged. TO FILE A CLAIM 
</P>
<P>
 * Gather all important papers that may be needed to file a claim. These may 
include various insurance policies, the deed to your home and an inventory of 
the contents of your home, including any photos or videos of your property. 
</P>
<P>
 * Review your policies. Does your policy include earthquake coverage? The 
typical homeowners' policy can have up to five separate coverage limits, 
including ones for structure, contents, landscaping and temporary living 
allowances. Also, review your other policies. For example, damage to your car 
may be covered under your automobile insurance and renters may be covered under 
their rental policies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prepare a list of losses or damage to your property. Photos or videos are 
helpful when filing a claim. Save any receipts related to your loss, such as 
additional living expenses if you have to find other accommodations while 
repairs are made to your home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Phone your agent or company as soon as possible. Follow up your call in 
writing. Most claims must be made within a set period of time. Some useful 
questions to ask include: 
</P>
<P>
 Am I covered? Does my claim exceed my deductible? How long will it take to 
process my claim? Will I need to obtain estimates for repairs to structural 
damage?  
</P>
<P>
 * Consider alternate sources of recovery. You may be eligible for state or 
federal grants, loans or other forms of emergency assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you are not clear on some aspect of your coverage, ask questions. If you 
need more time to file and process a claim, ask for it. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information: 
</P>
<P>
 * Western Insurance Information Service: (800) 397-1679. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insurance Information Institute: (800) 331-9146. 
</P>
<P>
 * National Insurance Consumer Helpline: (800) 942-4242, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST, 
Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a dispute with an insurer: 
</P>
<P>
 * California Department of Insurance consumer hot line: (213) 897-8921. BUYING 
INSURANCE 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes can wreak serious financial damage, whether you own or rent. After 
an earthquake, most companies put a 10- to 60-day moratorium on issuance of new 
quake coverage. Other things to know about earthquake insurance: 
</P>
<P>
 * Premiums are based on property value, type of construction and location. 
</P>
<P>
 * The cost for wood-frame construction ranges from $1.50 to $3.00 per $1,000 
of coverage, depending on location. Lower rates apply in the central part of 
the state; higher rates in the coastal counties and thoses along fault areas. 
Coverage is typically written with a deductible of 10% of the insured value of 
the dwelling and contents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earthquake-caused fires are typically covered under homeowners' policies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Coverage of aftershocks varies by company, says Patricia Lombard, director 
of the Western Insurance Information Service. "Aftershocks tied to an 
earthquake are covered under the initial claim so that the deductible would not 
apply again," she says. "But when two to four days separate the aftershock from 
the initial quake, it becomes more questionable whether it is an aftershock or 
a new quake." Ask before you buy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Renters can add earthquake insurance to an existing fire or renters' package 
to cover damage to household contents and personal belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Condo owners can buy insurance to cover the contents of their unit. 
Condominium associations sometimes buy coverage on the real property. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earthquake-caused damage to automobiles is not covered on an earthquake 
insurance policy, but it will be covered under most automobile policies. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you had substantial damage to your home, including exposing part of your 
home to outdoor weather, your insurance company will expect you to seal it off 
so rain will not cause more damage and to immediately make any necessary 
repairs to ensure your safety and the safety of your family and guests. If 
these repairs need to be done twice because aftershocks damaged the repairs, 
the insurer will pay to fix it again. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you do not have earthquake insurance and had substantial losses, you can 
claim a so-called casualty loss on your taxes, but only if you have 
unreimbursed damage in excess of 10% of your annual income, plus $100. For 
example, if you earn $50,000 a year, you can write off damages only in excess 
of $5,100. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once an area has been officially designated a federal disaster area, you 
have the option of claiming your casualty loss on the previous or current 
year's tax return. Keep receipts, photographs and other appropriate 
documentation to substantiate the claim.

 The road to recovery will be slow and hard for schools damaged by last 
Monday's magnitude 6.6 earthquake, which caused hundreds of millions of dollars 
in damage to campuses in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 If school officials have any advice for parents, it is to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it is trying, you want to get your kids in school, you want to get 
them some good supervision," Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Sid 
Thompson said. "But our No. 1 priority is safety, and then getting kids back 
for an education." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when school districts are grappling with the most massive budget 
shortages in history, they now must also cope with the formidable task of 
cleaning up and rebuilding after the devastating temblor, which collapsed 
classroom walls, toppled ceilings, destroyed equipment and knocked bungalows 
off their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, it remained unclear whether schools had the resources 
and personnel -- electricians, plumbers and other trained workers -- to deal 
with the mounting reports of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now seeing losses we weren't even aware of on Monday or Tuesday," one 
weary administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hard-hit Los Angeles district, about 300 of its 640 schools sustained 
damage, 108 of those in the San Fernando Valley. Thompson announced Friday that 
97 schools will remain closed indefinitely. All those schools are located west 
of the 405 Freeway in the San Fernando Valley. No public schools in the West 
San Fernando Valley will be open. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they are hoping that safe portions of the 97 campuses 
-- where 100,000 children are enrolled -- can be opened soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff at West Valley campuses will meet Monday with building inspectors to 
discuss how long it may take to prepare a portion of their schools for 
students. Many schools had no water or power, and at least 300 classrooms were 
deemed unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage in the Central and West Valley is severe, but we believe that we 
will be able to operate parts of those campuses," Thompson said. "We do not 
believe at this time that we have a school (that is) totally inoperative." 
</P>
<P>
 Leticia Quezada, school board president, said the district wants to reopen all 
schools as soon as possible. But, most importantly, she said, "We want to make 
sure students are safe." 
</P>
<P>
 If schools have to be closed for "any length of time," she said, district 
officials will transfer students to other facilities as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make every effort to convince state and federal officials that 
 
</P>
<P>
 we need lots of money yesterday" so that damaged schools can be repaired, 
Quezada said. It will take at least $700 million to repair the schools, 
according to district estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250,000 of the district's 640,000 students will return to campuses that 
are habitable but will be in disarray or have unsafe areas. The unsafe sections 
will be cordoned off to ensure pupils' safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The district was also devising emergency plans to route school buses around 
the region's quake-ravaged thoroughfares. Six hundred bus routes serve the 
Valley, which receives thousands of students from overcrowded, inner-city 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley, who will tour damaged schools 
today, said his department "is fully committed to making sure that we do 
everything necessary to help restore the Los Angeles schools."

child is inexplicably and suddenly disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
 Children react differently to earthquakes and to their aftershocks. According 
to the experts, children need to be constantly calmed, but they also need to 
keep busy -- to keep a routine. Soothing Children 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1989 Whittier earthquake, psychologist Ruth Torres counseled 
elementary schoolchildren. She offers the following tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage children to talk about their feelings and to draw pictures. "We 
did this on and off for a week. Many of the children were afraid of sleeping or 
taking a shower for fear another quake would strike. Many were worried about 
lost pets," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintain a child's routine as much as possible. "There's a sense of safety 
in routine," Torres says. After the Whittier quake, she says, "a lot of 
children said they felt safer at school than at home after the quake." 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents should control their emotions in front of children. If parents can 
handle an earthquake, kids are likely to handle it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents should monitor television watching, particularly among younger 
children. News reports of a major quake can be very frightening to them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fears can be alleviated beforehand if schools and families have a quake 
emergency plan. Practicing this plan gives children a sense that they are in 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 * Children tend to cling to parents after a quake, so try to make them feel 
safe. They will gradually get back into old patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 * If anxieties don't lessen over time, get professional help for your child. 
Keeping Children Busy 
</P>
<P>
 * Think of the aftermath of a major earthquake as a "36-hour car ride through 
the desert with your kids," says Dr. Neil Kaufman, head of ambulatory 
pediatrics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. "Parents should have a bag ready 
with books, age-appropriate toys, cookies and crayons to keep their children's 
minds off the fear." 
</P>
<P>
 * It is helpful for children to participate in post-quake repairs and shopping 
trips for emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Four San Fernando Valley YMCAs either are creating or already have day-care 
programs for children not in school. 
</P>
<P>
 They are: 
</P>
<P>
 * East Valley YMCA, 5142 Tujunga Ave., North Hollywood; (818) 763-5126. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mid Valley YMCA, 6901 Lennox Ave., Van Nuys; (818) 989-3800. 
</P>
<P>
 * North Valley YMCA, 10925 Columbus Ave., Mission Hills; (818) 365-3231. 
</P>
<P>
 * West Valley Family YMCA, 18810 Vanowen St., Reseda; (818) 345-7391.

LUCHA POR ACOMODAR MILES DE ESTUDIANTES DESALOJADOS POR EL DESASTRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El camino hacia la recuperacion sera lento y dificil para las escuelas 
perjudicadas por el terremoto del lunes, que causo cientos de millones de 
dolares en danos a las escuelas de los condados de Los Angeles y Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 La recomendacion de los funcionarios escolares a los padres de familia es que 
tengan paciencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Se que es dificil, uno quiere tener sus hijos en la escuela, bajo buena 
supervision", expreso Sid Thompson, superintendente del Distrito Escolar 
Unificado de Los Angeles (LAUSD). "Pero nuestra prioridad numero uno es la 
seguridad y luego reincorporar a los chicos para educarlos". 
</P>
<P>
 En una epoca en que los distritos escolares luchan con la peor crisis 
presupuestal de sus historias, ahora tambien deben hacer frente a la formidable 
labor de limpieza y reconstruccion despues del devastador temblor, que derribo 
muros y techos, destruyo equipos y levanto edificios de sus cimientos. 
</P>
<P>
 Para empeorar las cosas, sigue sin estar claro si, para hacer frente a los 
crecientes reportes de danos, las escuelas cuentan con los recursos y el 
personal, incluyendo electricistas, plomeros y otros trabajadores capacitados. 
</P>
<P>
 En el asediado distrito angelino, aproximadamente 300 de las 640 escuelas 
sufrieron danos, 180 de ellas en el Valle de San Fernando. Thompson anuncio el 
viernes que 97 escuelas permaneceran cerradas indefinidamente. Todas estas se 
encuentran al oeste de la Autopista San Diego (405) en el Valle de San 
Fernando. No abrira ninguna escuela publica del Oeste del Valle de San 
Fernando.  
</P>
<P>
 El personal de las escuelas del Oeste del Valle se reunira el lunes con 
inspectores de edificios para discutir cuanto tiempo podria tomar la 
preparacion de una porcion de sus escuelas para los estudiantes. Muchas 
escuelas no tenian luz ni agua, y por lo menos 1,000 aulas fueron declaradas 
inutilizables. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los danos en el Oeste y el Centro del Valle son severos, pero creemos que 
podremos utilizar sectores de los recintos", aseguro Thompson. "En estos 
momentos no creemos que tenemos una escuela (que este) totalmente inoperativa". 
</P>
<P>
 Leticia Quezada, presidenta de la junta escolar, manifesto que el distrito 
quiere reabrir las escuelas lo antes posible. Pero agrego que, aun mas 
importante: "Queremos cerciorarnos que los estudiantes esten seguros". 
</P>
<P>
 Si las escuelas tienen que permanecer cerradas durante "cualquier periodo de 
tiempo", explico, funcionarios del distrito procederan a transferir estudiantes 
a otras instalaciones lo antes posible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haremos todos los esfuerzos para convencer a funcionarios federales y 
oficiales que necesitamos mucho dinero 'para ayer' " para que las escuelas 
puedan ser reparadas, indico Quezada. Tomara por lo menos $700 millones reparar 
las escuelas, segun calculos del distrito. 
</P>
<P>
 Aproximadamente 250,000 de los 640,000 estudiantes del distrito regresaran a 
recintos que, aunque habitables, tendran areas inseguras. Estas seran 
acordonadas. 
</P>
<P>
 El distrito tambien esta elaborando planes de emergencia para trazar nuevos 
recorridos de aquellos autobuses escolares que de otra forma transitarian por 
autopistas danadas por el terremoto. Seiscientas de estas rutas estan en el 
Valle, que recibe a miles de estudiantes de los sobrepoblados planteles del 
centro de Los Angeles.

 Los vidrios rotos ya se recogieron, los supermercados se reabastecieron, los 
cajeros automaticos estan funcionando de nuevo y la luz ha vuelto a la mayoria 
de las casas y oficinas. Pero los miles de angelinos cuya rutina resulto 
alterada por el terremoto de Northridge siguen enfrentando obstaculos 
formidables para volver a la normalidad. 
</P>
<P>
 Quienes sufrieron dano en sus propiedades encaran un confuso laberinto de 
formularios de seguros, solicitudes de credito, permisos para demoler y 
construir. La enorme cantidad de escuelas danadas anuncia nuevas dificultades 
para miles de estudiantes y sus familias. El derrumbe de autopistas obliga a 
descubrir nuevas rutas para llegar a los trabajos y crea una nueva dependencia 
en el transporte colectivo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mucho despues de que el agua potable vuelva a fluir por el Valle de San 
Fernando, que las calles hayan sido reparadas y las desviaciones senalizadas, 
despues que los heridos hayan sanado y los muertos reciban sepultura, 
continuara el complicado proceso de recuperacion y reajuste. Llego la hora de 
desempolvar los planes de preparacion en caso de terremoto y hacer inventario 
de baterias, agua y primeros auxilios. 
</P>
<P>
 Este reporte especial le ofrece hoy una guia de informacion practica y 
asistencia para ayudarle a superar el impacto del terremoto. Contiene listas de 
escuelas cerradas y abiertas, senala graficamente las vias de circulacion 
cerradas y sugiere rutas y vias alternas de transporte. Tambien le informa a 
donde acudir para solicitar ayuda financiera y como prepararse para el proximo 
terremoto.

THE 6.6 QUAKE; ON THE REBOUND: A GUIDE TO RECOVERY AND RESOURCES; A GAME PLAN 
FOR THE FUTURE; WHAT YOU NEED TO HAVE AND NEED TO KNOW TO BE READY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After every big earthquake, you say to yourself, "Gosh, I really ought to 
stock up on all those supplies I didn't have." Or: "Gee, it would have been 
nice if I had had a quake game plan with my family or with my neighbors." Time 
goes by, the next quake hits and there you are, without a flashlight and 
without a clue as to who lives next door. Here it is -- what you need to have, 
what you ought to know before a quake comes. SUPPLIES 
</P>
<P>
 The California Office of Emergency Services advises supplies for a minimum of 
72 hours of self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Home 
</P>
<P>
 * A flashlight and fresh batteries or rechargeable flashlights should be handy 
in every room. It doesn't do much good if you are in bed when a quake strikes 
and your flashlight is in the kitchen.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Because grocery stores may be closed for several days, experts advise keeping 
a three-day food supply for each individual. Here are some guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose foods that store well without refrigeration, such as canned meat, 
fish, soup, macaroni, beans, chili, vegetables, spaghetti, ravioli, fruit, 
juice, nuts, peanut butter, jelly, pudding and dried milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store staples such as crackers, cereal, rice cakes, snack bars, dried fruit 
and legumes in plastic jars. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buy foods that are low in sodium. You don't want to deplete your water 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store food in a dark, cool area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't forget the fifth major food group: snacks. Chocolate can be soothing 
after a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rotate foods once or twice a year to avoid spoilage. 
</P>
<P>
 * If power is out, first eat food from the refrigerator. Next, freezer food 
and lastly, non-perishables. (Frozen food lasts several days if the freezer 
door is kept closed.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not use canned foods that are bulging or leaking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not use food from open containers near broken glass or spilled household 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not eat perishable foods that become warm. Bacteria grow rapidly without 
refrigeration and may cause food poisoning. WATER 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping water in your body is critical. Symptoms of mild dehydration include 
impatience, fatigue, emotional instability and apathy. Symptoms of severe 
dehydration include headache, sunken eyes and cheeks, difficulty breathing, 
weakness, mental confusion and rapid but weak pulse. Here's what you'll need: 
</P>
<P>
 * 2 gallons of water per day per person. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alternate sources of water are soda beverages, melted ice or snow, liquid 
from canned foods, toilet tanks (not bowls) -- a toilet tank can provide up to 
7 gallons of water. Do not drink if chemical disinfectant or bluing agent was 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 * To rely on a hot water heater for drinking water, flush at least once every 
6 months to remove rust and mineral deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't drink water stored in vinyl plastic containers, such as water beds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quickly running water from streams should be filtered and purified. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dew does not usually require purification. It can be collected by wiping 
from low vegetation, rocks and grasses with a rag. PURIFYING WATER 
</P>
<P>
 Dysentery, infectious hepatitis and typhoid fever are diseases that can result 
from contaminated water. After an earthquake, you can't assume water from water 
lines or reservoirs is pure. Instead, choose one of the following purification 
methods: 
</P>
<P>
 * Boiling -- Boil water vigorously for five minutes. Without power, place a 
steel cup directly over hot coals until red hot, then place directly into 
container of water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Filtering -- Allow collected water to stand for several hours to settle 
heavier particles. Pour the clearer water through a piece of cotton cloth so 
the suspended particles are filtered. Repeat until water is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purification Tablets -- Effective in removing most biological pollutants; 
available at drugstores. INFANTS 
</P>
<P>
 The following items should be on hand for babies, says Dr. Neil Kaufman, head 
of ambulatory pediatrics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center: 
</P>
<P>
 * Extra packages of disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water and other liquids. ("Babies can live without food for several days," 
he says, "but they need a minimum of 1 1/2 ounces of liquid per pound each 
day.") 
</P>
<P>
 * At least a three-day supply of ready-made formula. 
</P>
<P>
 * An extra supply of baby food. If you run out, it's perfectly fine for 
parents to chew up food for their infants. 
</P>
<P>
 * An adequate supply of food for breast-feeding mothers. ("Nursing moms should 
add 20% to 30% more calories and hydration to the average adult requirements," 
Kaufman says.) PETS 
</P>
<P>
 According to Warren Eckstein, host of KABC-AM radio pet show, you should: 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure your pet has an ID tag with both your home telephone number and 
that of a relative in a different area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure your pet's license is up-to-date. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure your pet's earthquake kit includes leashes, collars, a pet carrier 
in case of evacuation, a few days of food and water, and a fresh supply of any 
special medications. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep medical records on file. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have your veterinarian's phone number handy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish a relationship with a fellow pet lover in the neighborhood. In 
case you are not home, there will be someone to help your animal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have the telephone numbers of humane organizations in your area. FIRST AID 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what you'll need: 
</P>
<P>
 * Prescription medication. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antibiotic rub. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pain reliever/aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anti-diarrhea medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laxatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anti-gas medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dressing materials, including bandages, gauze pads, Ace bandages, tape. 
MONEY 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure you have cash on hand. ATMs rely on computers and a continued supply 
of cash, both of which are affected during major quakes. Merchants may not 
accept personal checks. Credit cards could also become useless if the 
electronic network is out of commission. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 
</P>
<P>
 According to Capt. Ron Leydecker of the Los Angeles City Fire Department, many 
common household products pose a risk of fire or accidental poisoning after a 
quake. Here's what you should do beforehand: 
</P>
<P>
 * Common household cleaners -- such as chlorine bleach, ammonia and oven 
cleaner -- should be stored in a safe place. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep quantities small and stored in plastic bottles away from ignition 
sources and living areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chemicals should be secured so they won't tip over in a quake, and locked up 
so that children and pets can't get access. 
</P>
<P>
 * Flammable liquids such as paints should be stored in the garage, but away 
from such appliances as the hot water heater and furnace. NEIGHBORS 
</P>
<P>
 In Scotts Valley, an isolated area near the epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta 
quake, advance planning by a group of residents saved houses and possibly 
lives. The neighbors learned each other's house layouts, and exchanged keys and 
telephone numbers. They set up caches of food, water and emergency supplies. 
Stephanie Mann, author of "Safe Homes, Safe Neighborhoods" (Nolo Press, 1993) 
offers advice on organizing: 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why are neighbors important after an earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 A. There's a lot that neighbors can do for each other. They may rescue your 
child or pull you out of debris. It's important that you know that you may have 
a doctor, nurse or firefighter in the neighborhood. You also need to help your 
neighbors. If one house goes, the whole block can go. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How can neighbors organize? 
</P>
<P>
 A. All 20 houses in my area of Orinda have an emergency neighborhood map with 
names, phone numbers and symbols for gas and electricity. We have all agreed 
that a red symbol on the mailbox indicates a problem and a white symbol 
indicates that everything is OK. IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * According to the California Office of Emergency Services, documents should 
be stored safely in a fireproof storage box or safe deposit box, a freezer 
(with documents tightly sealed in a freezer bag), or with an out-of-town 
contact's residence (send copies, not originals). 
</P>
<P>
 * To expedite insurance claims, keep both a written inventory of personal 
belongings and receipts for major items. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other papers to store include Social Security cards, birth certificates, 
marriage and death records, drivers licenses, credit cards, insurance policies, 
income tax returns, mortgage or rental receipts, paycheck stubs, deeds, stocks 
and bonds, savings and checking account books, wills, health history and recent 
photos of family members.

THE 6.6 QUAKE; ON THE REBOUND: A GUIDE TO RECOVERY AND RESOURCES; SOME 
COMMON-SENSE WAYS OF GETTING THROUGH IT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first few days after a major earthquake can be terrifying. You are fraught 
with worry for yourself, your children. You worry about the possibility of 
fire, structural damage. You fear being alone. Here are tips for getting 
through it. WARNING SIGNS 
</P>
<P>
 * Gas fumes -- Shut off main gas valve with a wrench by turning it in either 
direction until perpendicular to pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water leak -- Shut off water by turning the first valve after it leaves 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frayed wires, sparks, smell of hot insulation -- Shut off electricity; 
single breakers first, then main breaker. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chemical spill -- Clean up, isolate area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creaking, severe cracks -- Indicates structural damage. Move to a safe area. 
FIRE 
</P>
<P>
 If the fire department is unavailable, you may need to fight your own fire. 
(The Los Angeles City Fire Department offers community group training.) Direct 
the extinguisher at the base of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighting method depends of type of fire as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cloth, paper, rubber, wood -- Fire extinguisher with "A" symbol or 
non-potable water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Flammable liquids such as gasoline, kitchen greases, oils, paint -- 
Extinguisher with "B" symbol or baking soda, sand or dirt. No water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electrical equipment such as fuse boxes, wires, appliances, motors -- Turn 
off electrical current. Use "C" symbol extinguisher, water, sand or dirt. If 
you cannot shut off current, do not use water. (Note: Extinguishers with 
combined "A," "B" and "C" capabilities are sold.) HOME SECURITY 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some quick fixes that can keep the wolf away, says Los Angeles "Home 
Doctor" Gary Abrams: 
</P>
<P>
 * Broken windows or holes in the roof -- Plastic sheeting secured by duct tape 
will not only help insulate the house, it may dissuade people from entering. 
Unlike plywood, which has to be cut with power tools, sheeting can be cut with 
scissors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unhinged doors -- Drive three nails into the door jamb at an angle within 
1/4-inch of the door surface so they can be removed. Place one nail on top, one 
in the middle and one on bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stuck doors -- Keep a crowbar in the bedroom in case the quake jams a door 
shut. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apartments -- Residents in second-story units may want to invest in an 
emergency ladder that hooks over the window sill. Ladders allow tenants to 
evacuate if apartment doors are jammed. NO ELECTRICITY 
</P>
<P>
 Life without power requires significant adjustments. Here are some ways to get 
along without our juice: 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep ready-to-eat foods on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store a manual can opener. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store charcoal, propane or camp stove fuel, matches, plastic utensils, paper 
plates, cups and aluminum foil. Cook outdoors with charcoal grill or camp 
stove. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you depend on electric power for life support or use an electric 
wheelchair, buy a small emergency generator, extra fuel or batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Place emergency power failure lights in halls and in bedrooms. These are 
constantly charging flashlights that operate without electricity for about 4 to 
6 hours. NO WATER 
</P>
<P>
 If the water supply is cut off after a quake, the days of long, hot baths will 
be just a memory -- for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 * Immediately after a quake, fill the bathtub with water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water heaters can provide 40 to 50 gallons of bathing water. 
</P>
<P>
 * You can use pool water for flushing toilets and bathing. (Pool water used 
for bathing should be filtered and chlorinated, says Jack Petralia, director of 
environmental protection, Los Angeles County Health Service Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the short term, ocean bathing is OK, although Petralia warns that ocean 
salt is hard on the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Office of Emergency Services recommends keeping on hand extra soap, 
shampoo, toothpaste, deodorant and moist towelettes. SANITATION 
</P>
<P>
 If sewer lines are damaged and bathrooms are unavailable: 
</P>
<P>
 * Empty the toilet bowl of water and line with a heavy plastic bag or use 
waste paper baskets lined with plastic bags. When bag is full, tie securely and 
store in tightly covered garbage can away from living and dining areas. Add 
disinfectant: toilet chemical or chlorine bleach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buy a portable toilet.

ON THE REBOUND; PREPARING FOR THE NEXT ONE; BEFORE ANOTHER ONE STRIKES; BRACING 
YOUR HOME FOR THE NEXT EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With aftershocks from Monday's quake still rumbling underfoot, there is no 
better time to put your house in earthquake order. Many households suffered the 
kind of damage that can be prevented by spending a few dollars and a few hours 
securing objects in the home, from china cabinets to water heaters. The 
precautions will help limit damage to your home and possessions and, more 
important, reduce the chances that you or members of your family will be 
injured in a quake. Because, while much in this world is uncertain, there is no 
doubt that the recent quake won't be the last. In the attic 
</P>
<P>
 If your home has a chimney, nail plywood to the ceiling joists around the 
chimney to help protect from falling bricks. Foundation/framing 
</P>
<P>
 * Look at exposed framing to see if the wood is secured to concrete foundation 
by foundation bolts. Older homes are less likely to be secured and may need to 
be retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Determine whether there are vertical studs extending from foundation up to 
the floor. If so, and if they are exposed, nail plywood sheeting to the studs 
in order to strengthen the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 * On exposed framing, use metal connectors to strengthen joints where beams 
and posts join. Use nails or lag screws to fasten connectors to exposed framing 
in such places as porches, patio covers, garages and basements. Walls 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure heavy mirrors, pictures and wall hangings are anchored in studs, 
not just through the wall. If possible, remove such items and substitute 
something lighter, particularly above beds. Hanging lights, plants 
</P>
<P>
 * Anchor lights, plants or other hanging objects in wood beams rather than 
simply through plaster or other ceiling panels. Close open hooks by bending 
them shut with a pliers or wrapping them with wire. If you are using heavy 
plant pots, consider changing to something lighter. Kitchen, dining room 
</P>

 * Install latches on cupboards and cabinets. Plastic latches sold for 
child-proofing are an inexpensive, easy-to-install option that does not change 
the appearance of cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a china cabinet, small pieces of tacky adhesive or putty can help keep 
collectibles in place. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Remove heavy objects from top. Mantles, tabletops 
</P>
<P>
 * Objects that must remain loose, such as vases and mantle clocks, have a 
tendency to "walk" or jiggle off tabletops during a quake. A piece of

 * Keep a basic first-aid kit, flashlights and a supply of bottled water in 
your house for use in a quake or other emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep flammable liquids and other hazardous substances (paint, cleaning 
fluids, chemical sprays) in the garage or an outside shed.

RESIDENTS CLEAN UP AFTER QUAKE, PONDER OPTIONS; RECOVERY: ALTHOUGH THE REGION 
WAS SPARED MOST OF MONDAY'S DESTRUCTION, MANY HOMES AND BUSINESSES SUSTAINED 
DAMAGE, AND THE NEWLY HOMELESS WONDER WHERE THEY WILL END UP.

<P>
 Although the San Fernando Valley took the brunt of the Northridge quake, 
Central Los Angeles did not escape devastation.  
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude 6.6 quake drove many Central Los Angeles residents from their 
homes and into makeshift encampments or temporary quarters. Already beleaguered 
merchants are counting their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of skittish residents camped out in vacant lots on Hoover Street. The 
dome atop the Metropolitan Community Church on Washington Boulevard collapsed. 
Gas lines ruptured in Watts, chimneys toppled in West Adams, and glass 
shattered everywhere. There were countless images on television of the 
collapsed Santa Monica Freeway, and countless questions on how long Mid-City 
residents will suffer gridlock conditions because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Older buildings throughout the area were chipped and cracked, many to the 
point of being uninhabitable. Preliminary estimates late last week indicated 
268 structures in Central Los Angeles sustained damage totaling about $6.9 
million. City officials were quick to point out that those figures were certain 
to rise as building inspectors continue surveying. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hardest hit were residents of two apartment buildings near Adams and 
Crenshaw boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2557 Bronson Ave., one block east of Crenshaw Boulevard, the pale blue 
apartment building, home to about nine families, was evacuated and sealed off 
by police officers Monday morning. The building, estimated to be 70 years old, 
shifted on its foundation, knocking over part of a wall between it and another 
apartment house. The quake tore a crack along the bottom of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the residents escaped through windows on the south side of the 
building, pushing aside safety bars. Furniture and mattresses sat outside as 
residents stared in disbelief at what was once their home. 
</P>
<P>
 The building stood vacant for most of Monday, with a few residents such as 
Evangelina Diaz and her family managing to crawl through windows into their 
first-floor apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Miguel Enrique Cortez, had managed the building for nearly a 
year. As he struggled to lift a small heater, he looked back and shrugged. "A 
lot of stuff will stay. We're just trying to get the clothes, tables and chairs 
out," he said. "For now, the most important thing is to get out. We'll come 
back when they let us, that's if they don't destroy it first." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear when residents would be allowed to return to retrieve personal 
items. The building, which was in foreclosure, will have to be demolished 
because of the structural damage, said George Willert, a court-appointed field 
supervisor who is overseeing the foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already relocated some of the families who were still there, and 
another family has gone to stay with family," Willert said. "We're looking for 
space in some of our other buildings right now."  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I just have to wait," said Raul Sanchez, 34, a roofer. "I didn't 
manage to get anything out, not even a change of clothes to go to work 
tomorrow. But I guess I can't go to work because then I won't be able to get my 
things out."  
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez and three roommates spent the night in his car at a parking lot. They 
said they planned to move to another apartment nearby but had to gather money 
for rent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner at 2334 Crenshaw Blvd., Raphael Garcia joined the ranks of 
Good Samaritans around the Southland who extended a hand to their neighbors. 
Garcia helped rescue a family trapped on the second floor of the apartment 
building where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people were banging on doors and they were trapped," said Garcia, 
33, a factory worker who was preparing for work when the earthquake struck. "I 
was out here (in front of the building) with my family, and another guy showed 
up and he said to me: 'We got to help, there are people trapped in there.' I 
can't even tell you what he looked like or who he was because it was dark 
outside still, and I'd never seen him before in my life, but we went in and 
started pushing open doors." 
</P>
<P>
 While Garcia and two others helped pry doors open for neighbors, they realized 
a family with at least two small children was trapped in a second-floor unit in 
the rear of the Spanish-style building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow (the parents) got some sheets and tied them together and managed to 
let the kids down. I can't even tell you how many there were," Garcia said.  
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is we're all human and neighbors, and I had to help." 
</P>
<P>
 The building, which has about 18 units, was heavily damaged. The front steps 
were split in half from top to bottom, and the wall on the southwestern corner 
had buckled to a 45-degree angle. The earthquake left a large crack across the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Garcia and his family need help. Nearly 12 hours after he helped rescue 
his neighbors, Garcia, his wife and two children were trying to find a place to 
live. His sister, who lives nearby, offered to put them up for a time until 
they can find another apartment, but Garcia worries that a shortage of money 
and safe dwellings may prevent them from moving. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In West Adams, most of the wooden two- and three-story Queen Anne, Victorian 
and Craftsman homes built between the late 1800s and the 1920s escaped major 
damage, said Norma Latimer, president of the West Adams Heritage Assn. "These 
older houses stood up pretty well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she added, the earthquake jolted a few homes on Adams Boulevard west of 
Arlington Avenue, shifting them on their foundations and knocking down 
chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalie Neith, a heritage association board member, said that on the 2100 
block of 20th Street, a chimney fell onto a neighbor's new car and two chimneys 
toppled from the roof of a vacant house next door. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had ours rebuilt, so it's OK, but a lot of chimneys look like they're 
severely damaged," Neith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar problems were reported on other blocks in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At apartment buildings in Echo Park, Pico-Union, Westlake, Koreatown, 
South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles, residents jittery about the 
possibility of another large earthquake set up makeshift tents or huddled under 
blankets on sidewalks, in vacant lots, parks or in cars.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were scared to stay in there with the kids," said Dora Alvarado as she sat 
with her two children, husband and father-in-law in an empty parking lot on 
Hoover Street that she and several other neighbors have transformed into their 
temporary home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building isn't really that badly damaged, but they say there will be a 
lot of aftershocks and it's too scary to stay in there," she said, pointing to 
a multistory stucco building directly behind the parking lot. "We only go into 
the apartment to cook, and then we rush out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado and other apartment dwellers said they were waiting for clearance 
from building inspectors so they could return to their homes. The inspectors, 
stretched to their limit, had not reached all the questionable structures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police at the 77th Street Division received several calls about traffic 
accidents and people sustaining minor cuts and bruises, but said the load of 
calls was no heavier than usual. In the 4000 and 4100 blocks of South Figueroa 
Street, several buildings suffered damage running into the thousands of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Old two-story buildings along several major thoroughfares sustained cracks, 
sending bricks and plaster cascading to the sidewalk. One Vernon Avenue 
building lost its entire facade, which ended up in a two-foot-high pile of 
bricks and steel beams in the street. Elsewhere, cinder block walls tumbled 
into alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 One heavily hit building was the main office of Founder's National Bank at 
3910 Martin Luther King Blvd., which sustained structural damage estimated as 
high as $500,000. Employees were relocated to other branches, and the main 
office remained closed while crews worked to shore up pillars and clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Downtown area, businesses reported that although nerves were shaken, 
damage was limited to broken windows and cracked walls. Still, many businesses 
remained closed Tuesday to allow for damage assessment and the return of power 
and water. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Library sustained no structural damage; even pictures and wall 
hangings remained intact, according to Bob Reagan, library spokesman. But the 
library and all the branches were closed Tuesday to allow workers to put fallen 
books back on shelves and assess damage at the harder-hit sites in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Little Tokyo, the carpeting in the Japan America Theatre on San Pedro 
Street sustained some minor water damage when sprinkler pipes jostled by the 
earthquake broke, according to Jerry Yoshitomi, executive director of the 
Japanese Cultural and Community Center. But Yoshitomi said the theater would be 
"up and running" in time for its next show, the Los Angeles Philharmonic New 
Music Group on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese American National Museum on 1st Street was closed Tuesday and 
Wednesday while workers straightened artifacts and historic photographs that 
were knocked from their stands. * 
</P>
<P>
 Store owners found merchandise strewn about and shelves knocked over when they 
opened their doors Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Crenshaw Boulevard, most stores and businesses were closed and the 
normally bustling corridor was eerily still. Shards of glass littered 
sidewalks, window panes were hastily boarded up and a few business owners were 
assessing damage and beginning the arduous process of cleaning up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo Aquarium in the 4600 block of Adams Boulevard looked as if a river 
ran through it, with fish tanks knocked to the floor and their former occupants 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was water all over the floor," said Hong Suk Kang, who has owned the 
store for about 15 years. "I'm afraid the fish will die. We have no electricity 
to run the tanks."  
</P>
<P>
 Kang's wife, Yeo Soon, looked around the store and bowed her head. "We don't 
have any quake insurance. What are we going to do?" she said. "We have fire and 
other insurance but no earthquake insurance." She estimated the damage to be at 
least $50,000.

 The Los Angeles Lakers paid a visit to Ramona Gardens last week to dedicate a 
refurbished outdoor basketball court funded by the NBA team and Foot Locker 
shoe stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The asphalt court was repaired and painted and new hoops were installed, said 
Rhonda Windham, assistant director of public relations for the Lakers.She would 
not disclose the improvements' cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a facility that desperately needed refurbishing," she said. "There 
was a giant hole in the middle of the court. I guess that's good for your 
ball-handling skills, but it's not safe when you're driving down the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Freddy Gonzalez, 12, and his 8-year-old brother, Mike, were practicing their 
shots last week at one of the four new backboards. They said they come out to 
the court frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rims were crooked and over there you could see the sewer. There was a 
hole," Freddy said, pointing to the middle of the court.  
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers have planned basketball clinics for the residents in the near 
future, Windham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beginning of developing a relationship with the residents of 
Ramona Gardens," Windham said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
 A South-Central man who pleaded no contest to slumlord charges in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court was fined $3,559 and put on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Barry Kohn ordered Heliodoro Gutierrez, 43, to earmark $1,000 of 
that fine as a charitable contribution to the Toberman Settlement House, L.A. 
Men's Place or Midnight Mission nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez pleaded no contest Jan. 4 to the charges after city inspectors found 
exposed wiring, a blocked fire exit hallway, missing fire extinguishers, 
cracked paint and plaster, broken plumbing and cockroach infestation at his 
30-unit apartment building at 248 N. Chicago St. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohn set Feb. 1 as the deadline to complete repairs at the building or face 
additional penalties.  
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez could not be reached for comment, but at his initial court 
appearance, he said in an interview that the violations were found shortly 
after he bought the building. He said he was working to improve the building 
when he was charged with six fire, health, and building and safety codes.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's Slum Housing Task Force inspected the two-story building between 
March 30 and Sept. 9 last year and also found a loose handrail and window 
security bars without quick-release devices.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Michael R. Wilkinson, who handled the case, said he asked 
Kohn to impose the donation to a charitable organization because it is less 
severe than imposing a sentence of community service, jail or house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do it for people who are making some very good efforts at making repairs," 
Wilkinson said. "The idea is it puts something back in to charities that 
provide help for people, frequently for the homeless or very, very poor people 
in the areas where these buildings are located." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson added that Gutierrez has made progress on bringing the building up 
to code and is optimistic that he will make the Feb. 1 deadline. MARY ANNE

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; BOOK SALE BOOSTS LIBRARY AWARENESS 
</P>

<P>
 The East Los Angeles Library celebrated its Dia de Los Tres Reyes Magos book 
sale and storytelling festival recently to raise money and awareness for the 
branch and continue a tradition of celebrating Three Kings Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Friends of the East L.A. Library and Chicano Resource Center, 
the Jan. 8 book sale raised $150, selling books in Spanish and English for 25 
to 50 cents. Organizers hope to make the sale an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 The book sale, held on the lawn of the library at 4801 E. 3rd St., helped draw 
the attention of passersby who stopped, perused the books, and went inside for 
poetry readings and storytelling by local poets, said Sophia Chavez, treasurer 
of the Friends group, which formed in November and numbers around 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first books to go were the Spanish books, so that just shows how popular 
they are," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children received free books and balloons. Pan dulce , a Mexican sweetbread, 
was served. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration of Dia de Los Tres Reyes Magos honors the bringing of gifts to 
the newborn Jesus by the three biblical kings. Celebrated Jan. 6 in parts of 
Latin America and the United States, it is primarily a family event. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas-oriented stories and poems were read, and artist Jose Luis Reyes, 
whose works incorporate pre-Columbian motifs, told the children about an Aztec 
god who is celebrated during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this was to get people to come down and see the library as not 
just a place where there are books, but poetry and storytelling," Chavez said. 
"We did want to alert them that there is a crisis. . . . We got a very positive 
response from the people. They were surprised to hear that it was in danger." 
</P>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles branch laid off staff and reduced its hours by almost 
half after the county slashed its budget last summer. There is no money in the 
budget for new materials, Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friends group meets the first Saturday of each month at 10 a.m. at the 
library.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; THE CHALLENGE BEGINS FOR ACCIDENT VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cindy Gonzales sits on her bed with her twin, Sandra, going over math problems 
that the high school freshman learned long ago.  
</P>
<P>
 They review the work, along with reading and spelling, because 14-year-old 
Cindy, who had been making A's and Bs, now tests at a third-grade level in math 
and at a sixth-grade level in reading after she was struck by a drunk driver 
Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 She does not remember the accident, but can relay what happened from what 
police, friends and family tell her. The former Lincoln High School student is 
preparing to enter Eagle Rock High School in February to catch up with her 
schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her mother, Beatrice, 49, is gathering signatures to petition the 
city to put a traffic light at North Broadway and Sichel Street, where Cindy 
was hit. Relatives and friends have conducted fund-raisers, such as carwashes 
and breakfasts, to help the family defray medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something bad has to be for something good (to happen), and you have to turn 
it around to something good," Beatrice Gonzales said. "I figure the only thing 
is I want to do something for my daughter. I want to try to stop this (the lack 
of a traffic light) from hurting another person." 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy and a friend, Frank Cifuentes, 16, were crossing North Broadway in a 
crosswalk when they were hit by a car. Cindy was thrown 30 feet and Frank 
suffered a broken leg, cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have half my memory," Cindy said, explaining that the car hit her on her 
right side, fracturing her right leg and affecting the vision in her right eye 
and agility in her right arm. She was in a coma for 15 days. She has short-term 
memory and sometimes needs help in simple tasks, even in spelling her name. 
Released from Childrens Hospital last week, Cindy walks with the aid of a 
front-wheel walker and occasionally uses a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, John Joe Gomez, 30, of Lincoln Heights, pleaded guilty to felony 
drunk driving with bodily injury Dec. 27. Police say Gomez, who has two felony 
convictions for driving under the influence, drove away from the scene but 
returned shortly thereafter.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think I hit something but I'm not sure if I did. I'm responsible," he is 
quoted as saying in the police report.  
</P>
<P>
 Gomez faces three to seven years in prison when he is sentenced March 29 in 
Superior Court, said police Detective Richard Lopez. "They'll evaluate whether 
they think he's made an effort to clean his act up or whether he's a menace to 
society," said Lopez of the Central Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago Cindy's father, Alfred, 56, and Sandra were seriously hurt when 
their car was hit by a delivery truck. The family had to sell their Chatsworth 
home, liquidate their furniture, move in with Alfred Gonzales' mother and rely 
on public assistance to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Gonzales, who made a living in real estate, now relies on Social 
Security and a settlement from the accident to provide for his family, who 
moved into their Lincoln Heights home in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they are facing a new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy underwent surgery to drain excess fluid from her brain and explore for 
internal bleeding, and had a tracheotomy to clear her windpipe. She wears a 
scarf to hide short-cropped hair where doctors had to drill into her head. 
</P>
<P>
 She wants to attend Gomez's sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so mad," Cindy said. "I'm going to tell him." MARY ANNE PEREZ

 The beginning of a new year found Tony Sandoval not only principal of the 
largest student body in the nation, but in the middle of a controversy 
surrounding his hurried appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval, 46, began his tenure as principal of South Gate Middle School two 
weeks ago amid protests that the community was not properly involved in the 
selection process by Los Angeles Unified School District officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a right to have a choice," said Jaime Jaime, president of Concerned 
Parents. "If they don't respect us as human beings, they should at least 
respect us as taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-member group is scheduled to meet with school board member Victoria 
Castro on Tuesday to ask for a district review of its decision and to replace 
Sandoval with the one of the school's assistant principals, Henry Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime said his group believes Torres is more qualified because he has been 
more involved in the school and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval, a 23-year district veteran, was chosen after Pete Ferry announced he 
would leave his post Dec. 15 as principal at South Gate Middle School to become 
principal at Millikan Middle School in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials were forced to choose Sandoval within a 48-hour period in 
order to have a principal on the job when the school year began Jan. 3, said 
John Liechty, director of the district's middle school unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval was transferred into the position because he had previously worked at 
South Gate as an assistant principal in charge of attendance, and because he is 
a Latino who speaks fluent Spanish, Liechty said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district could not consider Torres for the position because of a policy 
that does not allow assistant principals to be promoted within the school they 
are working, Liechty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval inherits a 4,100-member student body with a 92% attendance rate. The 
school, which is on a year-round schedule to accommodate its large student 
body, is 98.5% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy surrounding the district's decision to transfer Sandoval from his 
position as an assistant principal at Irving Middle School in Glassell Park to 
South Gate erupted after the district could not show on paper that it had met 
with the community, said Willene Cooper, education commissioner for South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents also asked to see a list of qualifications used by the district to 
select Sandoval, but the district was unable to provide such a list, Cooper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A list of qualifications for new administrators is supposed to be drawn up by 
the community and district officials as part of a school-based management 
system, Cooper said. This system is not in place at South Gate Middle School, 
Liechty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper has also demanded that Torres be appointed acting principal while the 
district reviews its decision with parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It angers me when the district tells us we're part of the process and we're 
not," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Liechty agreed Sandoval's appointment was a "bad judgment call," but said he 
knew what the community wanted in a new principal after numerous meetings with 
parents during Ferry's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who do I go to to get input when time after time, year after year, I have 
heard that the community wants a principal who is bilingual and Hispanic?" he 
said. Sandoval said he empathizes with parents' concerns and has been trying to 
quell the controversy by meeting with different groups. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he will fight for parents' "First Amendment rights" but does not 
plan to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal remains to get as many parents involved in the school as possible. If 
this isn't a partnership, then the kids will suffer." JENNIFER OLDHAM

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; TEACHER ENTERS PLEA OF NOT GUILTY 
IN SEX CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Huntington Park High School French teacher has pleaded not guilty to charges 
that he engaged in sexual activity with a 16-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
 Faud Aqleh, 55, is scheduled to appear in North Orange County Criminal Court 
on Feb. 14 for a preliminary hearing on two felony counts of unlawful sex with 
a minor and oral copulation of a person younger than 18. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jo Escobar, Orange County filing deputy district attorney, Aqleh 
admitted having sex with the student. 
</P>
<P>
 Aqleh's attorney, David Penner, refused to comment on that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 The student's name is being withheld because of her age and the nature of the 
offense, said Lt. Stephen Peeler of the Huntington Park Police Department's 
detective bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation into the alleged incident was launched in late October after 
school administrators notified detectives that Aqleh was suspected of engaging 
in sexual activity with the student, Peeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators said their suspicions were raised by rumors circulating in the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Aqleh befriended the sophomore, who is a former student of his, 
and took her on trips to Disneyland, Magic Mountain, Universal Studios and 
Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Aqleh, who is married, engaged in consensual sex with 
the student following one of these outings, Peeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office filed charges against Aqleh in late November 
after receiving results of the Huntington Park police investigation, Peeler 
said. Aqleh, a Huntington Beach resident, then turned himself in to the court 
in early December. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Aqleh could be reduced to misdemeanors pending the results 
of an investigation into his background by the probation department, Escobar 
said, adding that Aqleh has cooperated with authorities. Aqleh was released on 
his own recognizance, Penner said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the charges are not reduced, Aqleh faces up to three years in state prison 
and a $1,000 fine for unlawful sex with a minor, and three years, eight months 
and a $10,000 fine on the oral copulation charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Aqleh, who had taught French at Huntington Park High School for six years, 
retired from his position after he was placed on administrative leave by Los 
Angeles Unified School District officials following his surrender, said Walt 
Green, director of employee relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Aqleh has had his teaching credential revoked pending the outcome of the 
preliminary hearing, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 If acquitted, Aqleh will have 39 months to request a return to the district, 
but officials will also have the opportunity to determine whether they wish to 
rehire him, Green said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<P>
 South Gate school administrators, city officials and business owners will be 
introduced to "Cable Connections," a local cable-TV show that features math 
tips from teachers and students, at 4 p.m. Monday at Liberty Cable, 3125 
Firestone Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is invited. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will be given a list of materials, volunteers and cash donations 
needed to get the twice-weekly, half-hour show off the ground, said Janet 
Fujii, a member of the program committee and a math resource teacher at South 
Gate Middle School.  
</P>
<P>
 Project coordinators will provide an overview of the show, along with an 
outline of the program committee's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The community volunteers will be asked to recruit individuals to staff a phone 
bank to raise money for the program and to star in the show itself, Fujii said. 
</P>
<P>
 Start-up costs could be nearly $20,000, said Robert Mellonig, Liberty Cable's 
director of programming. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has also scheduled its first monthly "Fast Saturday" math 
workshop for March. The workshops, which will emphasize lessons discussed on 
the show, will rotate among the local elementary and middle schools, Fujii 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cable Connections" is scheduled to begin in April on Liberty Cable's SGTV, 
community channel 3.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; YAOHAN WORKERS PICKET OVER WAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joined by members of other labor unions, employees of Yaohan markets picketed 
the local store to protest the Japanese supermarket company's refusal to grant 
periodic wage increases to workers at its nine U.S. stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying protest signs written in Japanese and English, several dozen workers 
picketed in front of the store at 333 S. Alameda St., where the headquarters of 
Yaohan U.S.A. Corp. are also located, for about two hours Jan. 14. The 
demonstrators distributed bilingual flyers to customers and chanted, "Contract 
now!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Yaohan grocery employees, who are represented by the United Food and 
Commercial Workers union, were joined by representatives from Justice for 
Janitors, the AFL-CIO and Local 11 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees' 
Union, as well as by members of local teachers and garment workers unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaohan U.S.A. is part of Yaohan Group International, a worldwide company with 
department stores and supermarkets in Hong Kong, Great Britain, Japan and the 
United States. The supermarkets feature Asian foods and groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400 to 500 workers at Yaohan U.S.A.'s six Southern California stores and 
its San Jose, Chicago and New Jersey sites have been without a contract since 
their three-year pact expired in September, according to United Food and 
Commercial Workers officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The bone of contention has been the company's adherence to a merit-raise plan. 
The union contends such a system encourages favoritism and discrimination by 
management, breeding discontent and low morale. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, union members claim the company has granted raises to management 
officials, most of whom are Japanese, while denying them to hard-working and 
loyal produce workers, janitors and other grocery workers, many of whom are of 
other ethnicities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to work out a reasonable wage-increase table and make sure everyone 
gets an increase periodically," said Art Takei, spokesman for the Los Angeles 
chapter of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, a national organization 
of union members of Asian ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Dec. 28 letter to Yaohan U.S.A. administrators, Ed Miyakawa, president of 
the alliance's local chapter, wrote: "We are concerned with the public 
perceptions of Yaohan Co. You are a company owned by a Japanese corporation. As 
such, you are obligated to live up to our rules of enlightened labor relations 
where your employees are treated in a fair and just manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Akio Kawai, an administrator for Yaohan U.S.A., contended the company's 
international negotiator in late December presented to national union leaders a 
modified compromise proposal that stopped short of offering across-the-board 
raises but included "several things we felt the company could afford regarding 
wages." 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we're pretty close to reaching agreement," Kawai said. "It's 
disappointing that the local unions, not knowing what's really on the table, 
are doing this. As a company, we value our employees. They're our No. 1 
resource. We're constantly improving our benefits and wages." 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrea Zinder, director of research, collective bargaining and education 
for local 770 of the United Food and Commercial Workers, vowed to step up 
publicity efforts -- which she said could lead to boycotts or employee walkouts 
-- until the issue is settled. "After six months of negotiations with this 
company, they still refuse to recognize simple union demands," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Asian American labor leaders also chastised Yaohan at the recent rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Susan Minato, an organizer with the Hotel and Restaurant Employees union: 
"As a person of Japanese ancestry, it makes me ashamed, and as a believer in 
the Los Angeles community, it really (ticks) me off." IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; 6 SOPHOMORES WIN COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS

<P>
 Six local high school sophomores were named last week as the latest Yasuda 
Scholars, students who will be paired with mentors from the Yasuda Trust and 
Banking Co. and will be eligible for $4,000 college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's scholars are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Carlos Dominguez of Manual Arts, 
</P>
<P>
 * Tony C. Marshall Jr. of Washington, 
</P>
<P>
 * Yvonne Olivares of Dorsey, 
</P>
<P>
 * Oscar A. Sosa of Eagle Rock, 
</P>
<P>
 * Alison Thompson of Locke, 
</P>
<P>
 * and Troy Yates of Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The six will each be eligible for a $4,000 scholarship upon entering college. 
And to assist them through their high school years, each student will be paired 
with an employee from Yasuda Trust, a Tokyo-based banking company with an 
office at 725 S. Figueroa St.  
</P>
<P>
 In the four years of the program, Yasuda has assisted 33 local students, four 
of whom are now attending college. 
</P>
<P>
 The program aims to help students with the potential for academic success but 
who are at risk because of socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. The 
program tries to provide a financial incentive as well as personal motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 The mentors and students spend time together in informal, recreational 
settings such as baseball games and amusement parks, at informational meetings 
with groups such as the Anti-Defamation League and on college campus field 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are chosen through recommendations made by school counselors. 
Yasuda officials ask counselors to nominate at least two sophomores, according 
to Frederick C. Jones, vice president and manager of human resources for Yasuda 
Trust. The students don't submit any information themselves and aren't even 
aware they are being considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Yasuda Trust committee makes the selections, Jones visits each campus 
and meets the winners to learn more about them to find appropriate mentor 
matches. IRIS YOKOI

 The Food for All organization has awarded $5,000 to Grupo Latino Echo Park in 
recognition of its community service work on behalf of residents of the 
Temple-Beaudry and Echo Park neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Grupo Latino Echo Park, formed about eight months ago, combines advocacy on 
community issues and direct service to neighbors on tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were impressed with how grass-roots they are," said Linda Hamilton, 
regional director and founder of Food for All. "Their application included a 
compelling statement on the affect of hunger in their community, especially on 
children. We thought this grant would really increase their impact."  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to lobbying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for better 
bus service for Latino passengers and protesting the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's plan to build a high school in Temple-Beaudry, the group distributed 
turkeys in November and toys in December to needy families. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year Food for All, a fund-raising and public education organization based 
in Redlands, presents the Nancy Chandler Award to groups working to prevent 
hunger in their neighborhoods, Hamilton said. The award is named for a former 
Lucky employee who was an anti-hunger activist and helped set up Food for All's 
donation system in the chain's supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Mavropoulos, the local group's spokesman, said the grant will help 
fund four food giveaways this year. "We were planning to do the first one 
around Easter, but now with the earthquake we'll have to look at the needs of 
the community and maybe have one sooner," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: TEMPLE-BEAUDRY; ANCIENT TONGUE NOW IN THE COMPUTER 
AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the sophistication of computers accelerates the race toward the future, 
Hector Santos uses his to rescue a piece of the Philippines' rich past. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos has completed a design of computer-generated fonts, or typefaces, to 
print the ancient Tagalog script, which was in danger of being lost and 
forgotten because it could be written only by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagalog, an indigenous language spoken in the Philippines, is rendered in 
print today using the Roman alphabet. But before the 16th-Century Spanish 
conquest of the archipelago, Tagalog was written with a squiggly script, known 
as alibata or baybayin , Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Spanish came they found the people to be literate" in the natives' 
own languages, Santos said. The script, generally written with a knife and 
carved in bamboo, "was in the hands of the masses." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the heavy Spanish influence, the script fell into disuse and was 
almost completely replaced by the Roman alphabet by the end of the 18th 
Century, Santos said.  
</P>
<P>
 However, scripts related to the ancient Tagalog one are still used by the 
Hanunoos and Buhids of Mindoro and the Tagbanwas of Palawan, Santos said, 
referring to indigenous peoples on two Philippine islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Santos is developing computer fonts for those scripts as well, his 
work is of interest not just to scholars but also to those who want to preserve 
minority ethnic cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 With Santos' software, texts using the ancient and existing scripts can be 
quickly produced via computer keyboard instead of drawn by hand. One tangible 
benefit Santos foresees is the production of new books for Hanunoo children 
eager for reading materials, which until now could be prepared only with 
painstaking effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The fonts are available for Macintosh and personal computers in PostScript and 
TrueType formats and can also be used in design programs such as Adobe 
Illustrator and Aldus Freehand. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos, 52, runs a Silver Lake-based graphics design and desktop publishing 
company, Sushi Dog Graphics. Previously, he worked as a computer systems 
engineer with Northrop Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 He dabbled in paleography, or the study of ancient scripts, for years. After 
he began his research on the Philippine scripts last year, he designed the 
computer fonts in about two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started doing it for fun, but now it's become a mission," he said. "There's 
a visual uniqueness to (the script) that isn't Spanish or Chinese. It is 
genuinely Filipino in shape and form." 
</P>
<P>
 Santos conducted much of his research at the Pilipino-American Reading Room 
and Library in Temple-Beaudry, said Helen Brown, the librarian and a fellow 
Filipino. He found some information on indigenous scripts in the library's 
collection, teaching himself by poring over artifact samples and in scholarly 
articles. He uncovered clues to other resources and contacts in bibliographies 
that he found in the library.  
</P>

 "He's more advanced in terms of his technology than researchers in the 
Philippines," Brown said. "What his work shows is that our history goes way 
back. It's a big thing that's creating a lot of pride in me and other Filipinos 
who hear about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Santos attended an international paleography conference in the 
Philippines and presented free copies of his software to the Philippine 
National Museum and several research and education organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started, I didn't know if there'd be any interest or need for 
this," Santos said before leaving for the conference. "But I'll be talking with 
people who are developing books and in charge of research.  
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't taught about the remote areas (of the Philippines) or the 
subcultures," Santos said of his childhood in Manila. "This is enjoyable."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; KING PARADE NOW PLANNED FOR APRIL 23 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poised to launch an event a year in the making, Larry E. Grant found his 
Kingdom Day Parade -- as well as the entire Martin Luther King Jr. holiday -- 
violently displaced by the 6.6-magnitude Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade honoring the late civil rights leader was shut down before it even 
began, in the wee hours of Jan. 17, the official observance of King's birthday, 
by the largest earthquake in modern Los Angeles history.  
</P>
<P>
 "Under the circumstances, we had to cancel," said Grant, the 68-year-old 
retired banker who has privately sponsored the parade for nine years. "The 287 
police personnel and 200 transportation workers we expected to be working with 
us obviously had to be utilized for emergency purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant, the parade committee and city officials have rescheduled the event for 
April 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant not only had to return 550 traffic-controlling wooden horses to the 
city, but also had to send several real ones back home. The Buffalo Soldiers 
equestrian unit, eight of the parade's 8,000 participants, had to make tracks 
back to Tucson, Ariz. The majority of the parade's 166 entries, which were 
overwhelmingly local, were told not to report to Crenshaw and King boulevards, 
the parade's starting point. 
</P>
<P>
 Parade committee chairman Celes King said that aside from the obvious dangers 
resulting from the quake, not having enough public safety personnel on hand 
posed too great a risk. "Our first thought was for the youngsters, and the 
second thought was for the city itself," he said. "There was no way to predict 
the disruption that might occur without proper protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant said that although a few entries may drop out by spring, particularly 
those from out of state, he expects the April event to be big. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be on a Saturday, which should draw more people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went on when a war broke out in Kuwait, when there was torrential rain. 
There would have to be another monster earthquake to keep us from going on this 
time." ERIN J. AUBRY

INSPECTION TAG'S COLORS DEMYSTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Monday's earthquake, anyone concerned about the condition 
of their home or business can look for placards posted by the city Department 
of Building and Safety indicating that an inspection has been done. The 
18-by-24-inch placards are in three colors:  
</P>
<P>
 * Green placards indicate it is safe to enter and occupy a building; 
</P>
<P>
 * Red placards indicate that the building is unsafe and should not be entered; 
</P>
<P>
 * Yellow placards indicate entry is restricted; occupants may enter at their 
own risk to gather belongings, but may not stay and occupy the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Specific restrictions are indicated on yellow placards. For instance, the 
restriction may only apply to one part of a building. 
</P>
<P>
 The placards generally are posted at main entrances.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; FREE SEMINAR TO DISCUSS LEGAL RIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Karen Ackerson, who defended Henry K. Watson in last year's Reginald O. Denny 
beating case, and eight other attorneys will address legal rights at a Saturday 
seminar at the West Angeles Church of God in Christ, 3045 S. Crenshaw Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers will address such issues as personal injury, contracts, renters' 
rights, entertainment law and criminal law at the free two-hour seminar, which 
will begin at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 West Angeles community relations director James Thomas said the forum is 
intended to educate residents about their legal rights and securing legal 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we're finding is that blacks are forced into dealing with 
the legal system in a reactionary way," Thomas said. "We want to make sure 
South-Central residents know their rights, that they know how to document 
things and keep records as evidence.  
</P>
<P>
 "What you don't know can cost you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum is a pilot project for a legal-rights center that West Angeles plans 
to establish, Thomas said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; KOREAN OFFICIAL URGES BETTER COMMUNICATION 
</P>

<P>
 The need for more social and cultural exchange programs topped the agenda of a 
meeting Wednesday between the consul general of South Korea and members of the 
Kedren Community Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hourlong morning meeting, Consul General Hang-Kyung Kim called for 
increased communication between the African American and Korean American 
communities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must go beyond stereotypes of mistrust," Kim said. "As leaders, we must 
provide opportunity for our teen-agers to meet and exchange ideas, and the 
young people must be willing to break down the anger." 
</P>
<P>
 Kedren, a nonprofit health center that also runs 18 Head Start programs in Los 
Angeles, will open another Head Start center in Koreatown later this year, 
according to Robert Owens, executive director of Kedren. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a black organization," Owens said. "We are a group of people who 
work together and we want to do this throughout the city. Sometimes we create 
biases against others and we, as leaders, have to combat that." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the 20 guests at the meeting at 710 E. 111th Place were teen-agers 
invited to voice their views to the consul general, organizers said. Other 
guests included representatives of several Korean American churches and a 
representative from the Korean-American Grocers Assn. of Southern California's 
KAGRO Foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a general matter, as a business matter, it is in our interest to reach out 
to the communities we serve," said Ryan Song, executive director of the KAGRO 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The need to improve communication between store owners and residents was among 
the questions broached. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're supporting your businesses, but nothing is coming back into our 
communities, and we still feel caged in," said Jeffrey Coprich, 28, who runs 
the Youth-In-Action program at Kedren.  
</P>
<P>
 Kim said he hopes cultural exchange programs between area churches and the 
Kedren Center could alleviate the tension. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

SHOULD YOUNG CRIMINALS GROW OLD IN PRISON?; WITH INCREASING NUMBERS OF YOUTHS 
BEING ARRESTED FOR VIOLENT CRIMES, A GROWING CHORUS OF GET-TOUGH ADVOCATES IS 
CALLING FOR STIFFER PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At age 15, Shawn Fudge was convicted of second-degree murder for a 
gang-related shooting in Watts. The victim was 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Incarcerated at the California Youth Authority prison in Chino, Fudge, now 23, 
still remembers turning his head away as detectives waved a photograph of the 
murder scene in his face. Lying in a puddle of blood was the dead boy, a bullet 
wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just shot the gun 'til the gun wouldn't shoot no more," Fudge said of the 
July, 1986, shooting, which also left four others wounded. "I was just a kid. I 
never thought about the consequences." Because Fudge was under 16 at the time 
of the murder, he was tried in Juvenile Court and sentenced to the Youth 
Authority system. State law requires that all juvenile offenders be released 
from the Youth Authority at 25, regardless of the crime. Had he been 16, he 
could have been tried as an adult and sentenced to life imprisonment without 
the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Fudge's case and many others like it lie at the heart of a nationwide debate 
about youths and violence. With increasing numbers of teen-agers being arrested 
for violent crimes, a growing chorus of get-tough advocates is calling for 
stiffer penalties for kids who kill, rape and rob. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, more than a dozen bills in the Legislature have been proposed 
to toughen the penalties facing juveniles, ranging from sentencing youths as 
young as 14 as adults in murder cases to allowing gang members as young as 12 
to be tried as adults regardless of their crimes. On the national level, a 
Senate anti-crime bill would allow people as young as 13 accused of violent 
federal offenses to be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has particular significance for Central Los Angeles, where youths 
carrying guns has become increasingly commonplace. "Without a doubt, more kids 
are involved in this cycle of violence," said Lt. Sergio Robleto, commander of 
the Police Department's South Bureau homicide detail.  
</P>
<P>
 But is treating youths as adults the answer to reforming a juvenile criminal 
justice system that many agree has failed to keep up with escalating levels of 
violence during the past decade? 
</P>
<P>
 Stiffer sentences, proponents argue, would protect society by locking up young 
offenders longer and deter violence by causing youths to think twice before 
committing crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many kids in their early teens are already hardened criminals. And if they do 
the crime, they should do the time," said Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena), 
who introduced the bill that would make it legal to try 12-year-old gang 
members as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, contend that locking up youths for longer periods will only 
create hardened criminals, many of whom will ultimately be released back on the 
streets meaner than before. What is needed, they say, are more social programs 
that address the causes of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can incarcerate people longer and build more prisons, but you will just 
create people who come out more brutalized," said Constance L. Rice, western 
regional council for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "You can't 
lock up everyone forever -- that's not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The state law that sets the minimum age limit for adult trials at 16 was 
established in 1975. It applies to felonies ranging from murder and arson to 
sodomy and kidnaping for ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, police and judges say many gang leaders order young associates to 
carry out shootings, knowing that they will be released at 25 no matter how 
heinous the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that law was written, we didn't have the sophistication and violence 
that we have today," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott Carbough, who heads the unit 
that prosecutes hard-core gang members in South-Central Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, across the country, violent youth crime is on the rise. The national 
murder arrest rate for people between 10 and 17 more than doubled from 1983 to 
1991, from 5.4 arrests per 100,000 youths to 12.7 arrests, according to the 
National Center for Juvenile Justice, a Pittsburgh research organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the number of youths incarcerated for homicide, rape, robbery 
and assault increased from 44% of the prison population in 1987 to 61% in 1992, 
Youth Authority data shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, 31 youths ages 10 to 17 were arrested for murder in 1993 in the 
Police Department's South Bureau, up from 21 the year before.  
</P>
<P>
 Experts point out that in New York and Florida, which for years have had 
tougher juvenile laws, crime levels are among the nation's highest. New York 
permits adult murder trials for youths as young as 13, and Florida tries more 
youths as adults for violent crimes than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been no evidence that get-tough policies have had much impact on 
violent crime," said Marc Mouer, assistant director of the Sentencing Project, 
a Washington-based think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mark Soler, executive director of the Youth Law Center in San Francisco: 
"The thing to remember is that most them are going to be released one day and 
will come out more hardened." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as 20-year-old Jose Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 By age 11, Rodriguez was running with a gang in his Watts neighborhood, 
smoking PCP and vandalizing local schools. Two years later, in 1987, he was 
convicted of attempted murder for the drive-by shooting of a rival gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus began a seven-year cycle in and out of detention centers for Rodriguez -- 
an experience that only hardened him. Surrounded by other criminals and 
frustrated by a system that he says offered little support, he became filled 
with rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just held a lot anger inside," said Rodriguez, who has his gang logo 
tattooed on his neck. "I just told myself, 'When I get out, anyone who talks 
---- to me, I'll take their head off.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1988, nine months after his attempted-murder conviction, Rodriguez 
was paroled. He was arrested one month later, this time for armed robbery and 
brutally beating two men. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, now at the Chino youth prison for possessing a gun, says he regrets 
the robbery and longs for his girlfriend and their 14-month-old son. He will be 
released at 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouldn't have done it. I can picture myself being in their position. I 
wouldn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on his troubled past, he says he wanted to go to prison as a 
teen-ager -- to earn respect in a gang subculture that honors those who have 
done time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked forward to going inside," he said, as sunlight filtered through the 
barred windows of the prison visiting area. "I wanted to come here to see what 
everything was like." 
</P>
<P>
 Such attitudes are not uncommon among troubled teens, said Fred Williams, 35, 
executive director of the Common Ground Foundation, a Watts nonprofit 
organization that works to keep youths in school and out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prison doesn't scare them. It's a home away from home," said Williams, who 
was convicted of manslaughter at 14 for fatally shooting a rival gang member in 
South-Central. He served a year in detention camp and reformed after embracing 
Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who favor lowering the age for adult trials disagree over how it 
should be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue, experts say, are responsibility and redemption: At what age is a 
young person capable of understanding the consequences of a crime? And since 
the goal of the adult penal system is incarceration -- as opposed to education 
and job-training in the juvenile system -- should youths be committed to an 
environment where there is little chance for rehabilitation? 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time you are 14 or 15, you know the difference between right and 
wrong. And if you commit something as cold and calloused as murder, then 
society has to be protected from you for as long as possible," said Rex 
Frazier, an aide to Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush (R-San Jose), author of 
the bill that would lower the adult age in murder trials to 14. He introduced 
the measure after a 15-year-old hacked an 8-year-old boy to death with a 
machete in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, oppose 
across-the-board age limits and favor allowing prosecutors to determine when a 
youth should be tried as adult. Each case is different, Garcetti said, and some 
younger than 14 could be mature enough to be tried as adults, while some 
16-year-olds should be treated as juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to take violent youngsters off the street for as long as possible," 
Garcetti said. "On the other hand, we as society have to be prepared to deal 
with that youngster who is capable of being rehabilitated." 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians are not the only ones calling for tougher laws. Many families of 
murder victims believe that life imprisonment is just retribution for the loss 
of loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who kills should be locked up forever," said Heladio Lopez, whose 
17-year-old daughter was slain in a Watts housing project in July, allegedly by 
a 16-year-old boy. "I'll never get my daughter back." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of stiffer sentences maintain that if teen-agers know they are 
likely to be tried as adults, they will think twice before committing crimes. 
But several violent offenders argued otherwise in prison interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're out there getting ready to do a drive-by, you're not thinking 
what's going to happen to you if you get caught," said Robert Fuiava, 21, who 
was convicted of seven counts of attempted murder at age 14. "You're thinking 
about pulling that trigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuiava, who grew up in Compton, said he followed his older brothers and 
cousins into gang life. He says he was carrying a gun at 9 and had committed 
"dozens of shootings" before he was arrested on the attempted murder charges in 
1987. In that incident, he fired on rival gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he had ever killed anyone, Fuiava said: "When you do a shooting, 
everybody falls down, regardless if they get hit. So you don't really know." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuiava, a soft-spoken man with long hair and a goatee, hopes to put the 
associate of arts degree in sociology he earned in the Youth Authority to good 
use when he is released from Chino in four years. He would like to become a 
counselor or social worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my last stop," he said, his body covered with tattoos with the name 
of his gang and his family that he received behind bars. "I don't want my 
(1-year-old) daughter calling someone else daddy." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Fuiava, Michael Clark does not believe that the threat of an adult 
sentence will stop would-be criminals. He ought to know -- he was tried as an 
adult, convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison at 17.

 "It's not going to stop crime," said Clark, who killed a rival gang member in 
South-Central to avenge a friend's slaying. Now 24, Clark will soon be 
transferred from the Youth Authority facility in Chino to the adult prison 
system. Many youths tried as adults and convicted of violent crimes first do 
time at the Youth Authority before being transferred to the state Department of 
Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ------ my life up. But because of my faith, I have hope," said Clark, who 
embraced Islam three years ago and leads prison prayer sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Nidorf, chief probation officer for Los Angeles County, has seen 
hundreds of youths like Clark and Fuiava in his 28-year career. He, too, 
believes that lowering the adult trial age for youths will not deter violent 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed, Nidorf and others say, is more funding for social programs 
that address the underlying causes of violence: poverty, gangs, broken homes 
and unemployment. Society will benefit in the long run, they say, noting that 
gang-intervention programs run about $2,000 a year per youth, as opposed to 
about $25,000 for housing a prisoner for a year in the Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prisons are important. On the other hand, we have to stop violence in the 
first place," said Ron Flick, a judge at Compton Juvenile Court. "Obviously, 
the only answer is to address the root causes." 
</P>
<P>
 In four years of trying cases from South-Central to Carson, Flick said, 
dysfunctional family life has been the biggest common denominator among violent 
criminals. "Most of them come from broken homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Including Shawn Fudge. 
</P>
<P>
 Fudge grew up without a father in the tough Jordan Downs housing project in 
Watts. "I don't know what happened to him," Fudge says. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Patricia Williams, said her husband was a drug addict who was in 
and out of jail. He took off years ago, Williams said, leaving her to raise 
three boys and five daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said her oldest daughter is also in prison, for drug-related 
offenses. She has assumed legal custody of her three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't approve of the bad things people do, but they do it to survive," said 
Williams, 45, who was laid off from her job as a cook several years ago and 
survives on state welfare and child-care payments. "There's no hope, no jobs 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Her neighborhood is typical of many inner-city areas, where criminal justice 
policies such as the war on drugs have resulted in astronomical incarceration 
rates and left many young men unable to find work because of their prison 
records, said Rice of the NAACP. (In 1992, African Americans and Latinos made 
up 75% of the 8,367 inmates in the state's Youth Authority system.) 
</P>
<P>
 Without a father, Fudge's role models were the older gangbangers who gambled, 
sold drugs and boasted of drive-by shootings. By the time he was 14, Fudge was 
dealing crack cocaine and carrying a gun. He was respected and feared by his 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after his 15th birthday, Fudge committed his first shooting, a warning 
shot at a neighbor who he says cheated a friend in a dice game. "I didn't 
really want to hit him," Fudge said. "I just had to live up to my reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 His reputation finally caught up to him on the evening of July 4, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 After a neighbor was wounded by gunfire earlier that day, Fudge and six 
friends went looking for the attackers, who were from another gang. They found 
them near a riverbed in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fudge pointed the gun, one his friends asked for the weapon so he could do 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember saying, 'I got it,' " Fudge said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sentenced to the maximum term in the Youth Authority, which must 
release him when he turns 25 in two years. His friends testified against him 
and were not convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Fudge has no education and few skills other than barber training, but he still 
hopes to rebuild his life and avoid the gangs and drugs that led to his 
downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always think about what I did. It always hits you. You can never forget 
about it," Fudge says. "I don't believe I had the right to take that young 
boy's life, and I'm sorry for what I did." Inmates 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of inmates in the California Youth Authority dropped about 
3% to 8,367 between 1987 and 1992, the ethnic breakdown has significantly 
changed. The percentage of Native Americans, Filipinos, Pacific Islanders and 
others has remained about 2%. Doing Time 
</P>
<P>
 The length of incarceration for inmates under the California Youth Authority 
(CYA) is much less for first-degree murder than inmates in the California 
Department of Corrections (CDC), but longer for assault and rape, according to 
first-time parole releases.

BLACK COACHES ASSN. BOYCOTT BACKED AT CRENSHAW, FREMONT; BASKETBALL: LOCAL 
COACHES SUPPORT PROTEST OVER NCAA REDUCTION IN SCHOLARSHIPS. BUT KAREEM 
ABDUL-JABBAR QUESTIONS THE GROUP'S MOTIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crenshaw High Coach Willie West called college entrance exams "a big giant who 
has grown out of control," while Fremont High Coach Sam Sullivan believes the 
loss of another scholarship may be the final straw for black coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 West and Sullivan -- two of the area's most successful high school basketball 
coaches -- support the protests of the black college coaches association over 
decisions made at the NCAA Convention in San Antonio to limit men's basketball 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA Division I college chief executive officers voted Jan. 10 not to restore 
men's basketball scholarship limits to 14 from 13. The delegates also approved 
a "thorough review" of tougher freshman eligibility requirements, effective 
August, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 As colleges cut costs for all sports, the limit on men's basketball 
scholarships has dropped from 15 in 1991 to 14 last year to 13 this year. The 
reduction means that 301 fewer scholarships will be offered this year than 
last. Women's basketball scholarships remain at 15 per school. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 65% of Division I mens' basketball players are black. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the NCAA delegates' decision not to restore the additional 
scholarship, the Black Coaches Assn. threatened a nationwide boycott. Rudy 
Washington, Drake University coach and executive director of the black coaches 
group, met with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who got the U. S. 
Justice Department to intervene. The boycott was to begin Jan. 15, but 
Washington postponed the action when the U. S. Justice Department agreed to 
help mediate. Washington is a graduate and former coach at Locke High. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I think the (black coaches are) taking a courageous stand," 
Sullivan said. "You take away one scholarship and one less kid gets a chance to 
receive an education." 
</P>
<P>
 However, former National Basketball Assn. and UCLA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
believes the black coaches group is acting more in its own interest than in the 
interests of the black student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's crucial that student-athletes are given an opportunity to get an 
education, not just an opportunity to enhance the athletic programs at a 
university because that's exploitation," Abdul-Jabbar said, pointing out that 
the average college basketball program graduates fewer than half of its 
athletes. "There has been a lot of abuse in college athletics where athletes 
who are not academically qualified are admitted because of their athletic 
ability and then cast off when they become failures. I think some coaches are 
not living up to their obligation as educators." 
</P>
<P>
 Said West: "The (black coaches group) is fighting for numbers, not a racial 
thing. When the NCAA cuts out a scholarship, they're taking away a scholarship 
from everyone whether they're white or black." 
</P>
<P>
 In 24 years, more than 100 of West's players have receive Division I 
scholarships, including four off his first team. In 1988, eight Cougars 
received scholarships, including Steve Thompson who signed with Syracuse. Three 
Crenshaw players -- Kris Johnson (UCLA), Tremaine Fowlkes (Cal) and Tommie 
Davis (Houston) -- have made early commitments from the 1993-94 team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has become more difficult for Central City players to receive scholarships 
since the NCAA passed tougher freshman college entrance requirements in 1983, 
West said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with the entering class of 1986, college athletes were required to 
have a minimum 2.0 grade-point average in college curriculum courses and score 
at least 660 out of a possible 1,600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 15 out 
of a possible 36 on the American College Test. Those scores have been 
progressively raised until an athlete needed at least a 700 on the SAT or a 17 
on the ACT. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 1993 NCAA study, only 33% of the freshman basketball players 
who entered USC between 1983 and 1986 graduated while only 31% of those at UCLA 
did. During the same period Indiana Coach Bob Knight graduated half of his 
players, one of the highest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about the poor graduation rate of student-athletes, NCAA presidents 
raised the standards by creating an eligibility index. An athlete with a 2.0 
grade-point average would need a 900 on the SAT or a 21 on the ACT to qualify, 
while an athlete with a 2.5 grade-point average would need 700 on the SAT or 17 
on the ACT. 
</P>
<P>
 Test scores have proved to be a stumbling block for several Central City 
players, including 6-5 guard Reggie McFerren and 6-7 center Leon Watson, 
Crenshaw starters who have not met the required test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Said West: "I have players struggling to get a 700. How are they going to get 
a 900? 
</P>
<P>
 "The SAT has become a big giant who has grown out of control. It's not as 
tough as it is made out to be. But because the NCAA has placed such great 
importance on it, some of my players are psyched out before they even take the 
test." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, who has about 25 players who receive scholarships, agreed that 
raising test scores is the bigger issue: "I have seen a lot of young men who 
were getting Ds and Fs, raise their grades to Cs and Bs. Now they are told to 
raise their test scores by 200 points. That's really unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, our kids have not had the proper chance to develop the vocabulary 
and basic skills to pass the test. They don't have the verbal skills because 
they don't read enough or don't have time to read enough."  
</P>
<P>
 Fremont's Calvin Patterson recently scored 660 on the SAT. He would have 
qualified for a scholarship in 1986, but not in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar, whose son Kareem attends Brentwood School, said that black 
student-athletes should not use their economic backgrounds as an excuse for 
poor classroom performance. If they are capable of playing basketball at a 
Division I level, they are also capable of applying the same work ethic to 
succeed in the classroom, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say black athletes should be excused for poor grades because of their 
socioeconomic backgrounds is a load of crap," he said. "I'm sorry I can't agree 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an indictment of the school system and the fact that at home, they're 
not getting encouragement at home to do well academically." 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA council agreed to study the implications of the new entrance 
examinations.

BURNING UP THE TRACK IN NORWAY; SOUTH GATE'S SANCHEZ WILL RUN A LEG OF OLYMPIC 
TORCH RELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If a classmate hadn't urged Humberto Sanchez to try out for the South Gate 
High School cross-country team last fall, the 18-year-old senior might be 
watching next month's Winter Olympics on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he's going to be part of the Olympic Torch Relay in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez ran his first cross-country race in September. In November, he 
finished second in the City Section finals. And Feb. 5 he will run a 500-meter 
leg of the relay in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am excited, but I am a little nervous because I have never been on a 
plane," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez is one of five U.S. participants chosen by the International Torch 
Bearers program, which, for the first time in the Winter Games, will include 
runners from outside the host country. 
</P>
<P>
 City girls' cross-country champion Genevieve DeBose of Hamilton High, Jason 
Murphy and Linda Lisska of Atlanta, and Tim Willis, a blind runner, were the 
other U.S. selections. (Sanchez and DeBose were chosen after their performances 
at the City Section finals; the boys champion was unable to make the trip.) In 
all, 30 participants from 13 countries were chosen by the Coca-Cola sponsored 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 The 7,000-person relay started Nov. 27 in Morgedal, the site where the flame 
for the 1952 Oslo Winter Olympics was kindled, and will end 5,000 miles later 
in Lillehammer with the Feb. 12 opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion will mark Sanchez's first exposure to sub-freezing weather. "The 
State meet in Fresno was the coldest place I've been and its supposed to be 
minus 7 degrees in Norway, so I don't know what to expect," he said. "I am just 
grateful for the opportunity to go." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Maria, will accompany him on the four-day trip with a 
newly-purchased video camera. But tracking Sanchez's meteoric rise in 
cross-country was so quick, it would be difficult for anyone to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, Sanchez's goal was to just make the varsity squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I'd be fourth or fifth man on my team," he said. "I was the first 
man in my first race and I kept getting faster and faster and picking up the 
pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez won the Southeastern Conference title to help South Gate to the team 
title and also went on to place 11th in the State Division I final in Fresno -- 
the highest finish by a South Gate runner. 
</P>
<P>
 His performance in Fresno triggered scholarship interest from several 
colleges, including Cal State L.A. and UC Davis. This spring he plans to 
compete in his first season of high school track, concentrating on the 1,600 
and 3,200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept getting better and better," said Coach Daniel Zepeda. "He is an 
extraordinary talent and he'll continue to improve in college. It's a shame he 
didn't run for four years in high school because he could still be a lot 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 As an eighth-grader, Sanchez set the mile record of 4 minutes 58 seconds at 
South Gate High Junior High but dropped out of running to play basketball the 
next year. "One of my dreams was to play high school basketball," he said. "I 
guess I fell in love with the camaraderie instead of running and the 
me-against-you." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Sanchez, a guard, was elevated to the Rams' varsity basketball 
team. He'll miss two games to make the trip to Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a lot better at running, but I've been playing basketball for so long 
that I wanted to continue," Sanchez said. "I still want to go back to running 
in college and accomplish something."

MONEY TALK CARLA LAZZARESCHI: PLAN JOINT TENANCY FOR IDEAL ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: When my husband died, I had our jointly held stock put in my name and my 
sister's. Then, when she died, I had the stock that she willed me, plus the 
other shares that we jointly held, put in my name and that of my niece. My 
niece and I hold these shares as joint tenants to avoid probate. Upon my death, 
how will those shares be valued? -- L.N.K . 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because your niece apparently contributed nothing toward the purchase of 
the stock, all the shares will be valued as of your date of death and included 
in your estate for the purpose of determining what, if any, estate taxes are 
due. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, this subject -- which is among the most popular in this column -- 
deserves additional amplification.  
</P>
<P>
 The goal of most estate planning efforts is to minimize both estate taxes and 
income taxes due upon the sale of the estate by its heirs. Avoiding probate is 
often another major objective. For many, the perfect estate planning 
arrangement would accomplish all three. When an estate has a value of less than 
$600,000, joint tenancy vesting of assets with an heir or heirs can achieve 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the principal virtues of putting assets in joint tenancy is that it 
allows heirs to bypass the probating of a deceased's will. Property simply 
passes to the other joint tenant or tenants without the hassle and expense of 
the probate process. Further, when an estate is worth less than $600,000 and no 
estate taxes are due, joint tenancy allows heirs to escape income taxes on 
potentially all of the profits they realize upon the sale of the assets. In 
essence, you can have your cake and eat it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Federal tax code requires the entire joint tenancy property to be 
included in a deceased's estate if one or more of the parties to the vesting 
acquired his or her interest for less than its full value. This means that if 
you make your niece a joint tenant on your stock certificates, the shares are 
included in your estate for the purpose of computing possible estate taxes. 
This is also true if mom or dad puts the kids on the deed to their home as 
joint tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 But now what happens? For estates of less than $600,000 in value, there is no 
estate tax. Still, any property included in an estate tax computation -- 
whether or not taxes are eventually paid -- is treated to a full step-up in its 
value to that of the deceased's date of death. 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially welcome news for the heirs. When they sell the property, 
its tax basis is the asset's value as of the donor's death, greatly minimizing 
their potential income tax responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, it would appear that joint tenancy between a donor and his or 
her heirs is a terrific estate planning tool, especially for taxpayers with 
estates of less than $600,000 in value. However, our experts caution against 
rushing to that conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 One significant problem with joint tenancies is that they are irrevocable. 
</P>
<P>
 If the parties have a falling out, the heirs are still joint tenants with the 
donor. Further, joint tenancy exposes all parties to the debts and obligations 
of the others. If your child, whom you made the joint tenant on your home, is 
sued, you could lose your home. The same would apply to the stock you now 
jointly own with your niece. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the major reasons that attorneys and accountants often advise 
clients to consider living trusts as a means of both bypassing probate and 
ensuring a full step up in the property's value. But, unlike filing a joint 
tenancy record with the county, which essentially costs nothing, having a 
living trust drafted by an attorney will cost at least $2,000. Qualifying for 
Widow's Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I began drawing social security benefits at age 65. My wife began taking 
her own benefits at age 62. This is the second marriage for both of us. 
</P>
<P>
 When I die, will my wife be entitled to full widow's benefits? For her to 
qualify, how long must we have been married? -- M.J.N . 
</P>
<P>
 A: If your wife is at least age 65 when you die, she will be entitled to 
receive full widow's benefits if at that time you have been married a minimum 
of nine months. However, that minimum period is waived if the spouse's death is 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 The requirement is also waived if the surviving spouse and the deceased were 
the parents of a minor child. The fact that you and your wife have been married 
previously changes nothing. Tax Benefits of Home Sale Exclusion 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the approximate tax saving from using all of the $125,000 exclusion 
of home sale profits available to home sellers over age 55? 
</P>
<P>
 Are you allowed use the exclusion if the home you sell has been a rental for 
two years before the sale? -- G.D. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The benefits of using the $125,000 exclusion will depend on your tax 
bracket. However, assuming a 28% capital gains tax levy, excluding $125,000 
from taxation yields a $35,000 federal tax saving. When the maximum California 
tax rate of 11% is added, bringing the total tax rate to 39%, the saving 
generated by the exclusion jumps to $48,750.  
</P>
<P>
 In order to qualify for the exclusion, a taxpayer must be at least age 55 and 
have owned and made the house his principal residence for three of the last 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 So, you may rent the home for two years before the sale and still qualify for 
the exclusion -- but be sure it's just for two years! Exceeding that limit will 
knock you out of strict compliance with the terms of the law.

ADVANTAGES AND DRAWBACKS OF SELLER FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIAN HYMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Distributed by Inman News Features 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is seller financing? 
</P>
<P>
 Seller financing occurs when sellers loan money to buyers as a part of a 
property sale. The property being sold is usually used as security for the 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit to a buyer is that sellers usually don't charge loan origination 
fees, called points. (One point is equal to 1% of the loan amount.) 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers with only a 10% down payment will find an additional benefit if they 
can find a seller who will provide a loan for 10% of the purchase price. This 
would permit the buyer to get an 80% loan, rather than a 90% loan, from a 
conventional lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty percent conventional financing is less expensive than 90% financing in 
terms of the points charged, the interest rate on the loan or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, most 90% loans require private mortgage insurance (PMI) to protect the 
lender if the buyer defaults. This is an additional charge that is bypassed if 
the buyer only needs to borrow 80% or less of the purchase price from a lender. 
</P>
<P>
 A buyer might find it easier to qualify for financing with a seller than with 
a conventional lender, but this won't always be the case. Most sellers will 
want to scrutinize a buyer's financial status, including a credit report, just 
as a lender would. 
</P>
<P>
 A purchase contract that provides for seller financing will usually give the 
seller the right to approve or disapprove the buyer for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 There are disadvantages to seller financing. In this market of extremely low 
interest rates, you'll probably find conventional financing available at 
interest rates lower than most sellers will be willing to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 Another disadvantage is that most seller carry-back loans have shorter due 
dates -- the deadline for repaying the entire loan -- than conventional loans. 
Few sellers will be willing or able to carry a loan for 15 or 30 years. But if 
the buyer is getting a new first loan from a conventional lender, the lender 
will require that the seller carry the second loan for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Most conventional loans are fully amortized, which means they are paid off in 
full over the term of the loan. Seller-carry loans, however, are rarely fully 
amortized (some have interest-only payments), which means that there could be a 
large (balloon) payment due at the end of the loan. The property may have to be 
sold or refinanced at that time to repay the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 First-Time Tip: The obvious candidates for owner financing are seniors who own 
their homes free and clear of any loans. If they're selling to trade down to a 
retirement home, there may even be a tax incentive for them to carry financing. 
Seller-carry loans can be treated as installment sales for tax purposes, which 
allows the seller to spread tax on gain over the term of the seller-carry loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying a loan at a reasonable interest rate might also provide attractive 
income to a seller who's income is fixed. In this case, the seller might not 
want to be paid off early and may request that the loan include a prepayment 
penalty. This could become an item of negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Closing: To make sure that you're not paying an overinflated price in 
exchange for seller financing, make your purchase offer contingent upon the 
house appraising for the purchase price. If you're applying for a new 
conventional first loan, and the seller's carrying a second, the lender or loan 
broker will order an appraisal. If the seller is carrying a first loan, you'll 
have to order an appraisal yourself.

RENT WATCH: CAN DEPOSIT BE KEPT FOR QUAKE DAMAGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times; This column is prepared by Project Sentinel, a rental 
housing mediation service in Sunnyvale, Calif. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Editor's Note: The following two questions are from an earlier "Rent W atch" 
column, but may be helpful to victims of last Monday's earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 QUESTION: The apartment in which I have lived for several years received heavy 
damage during the earthquake. Since it may be a long time before the building 
becomes habitable and because I rent on a monthly basis, the landlord and I 
have agreed to terminate my tenancy. I'm worried about my deposit. Can he use 
it for repairs, or am I entitled to get it back? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Yes, you are entitled to a refund of your deposit. A security deposit 
cannot be used to repair damage caused by a natural disaster. Unless you owe 
the landlord rent, you should receive your deposit in full, because cleaning 
costs have obviously become irrelevant, and any property owner who attempts to 
deduct cleaning costs will be hard pressed to justify them. Be sure that you 
notify your landlord in writing of your new address so that the check can reach 
you. California Civil Code, Section 1950.5, which regulates the return of 
rental deposits, remains valid in these circumstances and requires the landlord 
to refund your deposit within 14 days. Is Owner Responsible for Tenants' 
Property? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Several units in an apartment building I own suffered damage in the 
earthquake. I have managed to make arrangements for repairs and to control the 
major problems, but two of my tenants feel that I should reimburse them for 
broken dishes, damaged furniture and food spoiled during the power outage after 
the quake. My expenses are already very high. Am I also liable for damage to 
their personal property? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Probably not. You can only be held liable for damage to tenants' property 
if the tenants can prove that your negligent maintenance of the building caused 
the damage. Otherwise, the tenants must pay to repair or replace their own 
damaged possessions. If your tenants have renter's insurance policies, they 
should file claims to see what compensation they are eligible to receive. 
Manager Keeps Pet Deposit as Punishment 
</P>
<P>
 Q: According to my rental agreement, I was allowed to keep one cat inside my 
apartment, and I even paid an additional pet deposit. When I found an abandoned 
cat on a cold rainy day, I felt I had to take it in, but I did not tell my 
landlord of adopting this second pet. By pure happenstance, right before I 
moved out, the manager discovered that I had a second cat, and refused to 
refund my pet deposit. Although my pets did not create any damage, the manager 
decided to keep my $200 pet deposit because I was in violation of the rental 
agreement. Can I do anything to get back my money, or should I just write it 
off? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You were wrong in knowingly violating your rental agreement, and by doing 
so you jeopardized your tenancy. The manager could have asked you through a 
written notice to either move out or get rid of your second pet within three 
days, had he discovered sooner that you acquired a second cat. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if you left the apartment in good and clean condition, and your cats 
did not cause any damage, the manager cannot charge you a punitive fee. All 
deposits on rental property must be refundable, and they can be used only for 
due rent, necessary cleaning or damages beyond normal wear and tear caused by 
the tenant. Deposits cannot be used as fines for agreement violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Explain to your manager that according to California Civil Code Section 1950.5 
he cannot use the deposit to punish you for violating the agreement. If he 
continues to withhold your deposit, you may contact your local mediation group 
for assistance. You may have to file an action in Small Claims Court to obtain 
a refund of your deposit.

'CREDIT SCORING' MAY DETERMINE IF YOU GET LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Distributed by the Washington Post 
Writers Group.

<P>
 How you fare with your next home mortgage application could hinge on your 
performance on a complex mathematical test you've never heard of, never taken 
and probably will never see on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called "credit scoring," and it's one of the hottest -- if least 
publicized -- developments under way this year in the home mortgage market. 
Your credit score could convince a lender to give you a mortgage on excellent 
terms -- despite obvious blotches on your credit record that would have drawn 
an automatic rejection in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reverse could happen as well: You could find yourself turned down for 
a mortgage that your lender wouldn't have thought twice about before credit 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 What's this all about? What are its implications for you as an applicant? 
Here's a quick overview: 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage lenders are under increasing pressure from federal regulators to 
squeeze every bit of potential bias out of their application evaluations. 
They're also discovering they can increase business and profits by more 
accurately identifying the combinations of characteristics of their customers 
that produce the highest risk of default and foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve both objectives, lenders are quietly turning to statistical models 
of borrower behavior that predict who's likely to be a problem, and who's not. 
The models often are based on extensive computer analyses of samples of the 
lender's existing or prior customers. They highlight the combinations of risk 
factors that "matter" in a statistical sense -- which may be different from 
those that matter in traditional, face-to-face underwriting. Then they assign 
numerical values to the risk factors to create a test for measuring new 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Your credit score might run anywhere from zero to 1,000. It's what you get 
when your specific set of characteristics -- your income, marital status, 
length of employment, number of jobs held, installment debt payment history, 
length of time in your present house and other factors -- are run through the 
statistical model. It's the composite you: Sliced, diced and stacked up as a 
potential borrower against the lender's real-life experiences with everybody 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if your monthly debt-to-income ratios are higher than the 28% or 33% 
allowed by traditional cookie-cutter underwriting standards? So what if you're 
only able to put up a small down payment? Those factors may not be crucial. The 
credit-scoring model may reveal instead that you're a solid risk overall. You 
can handle the load -- at least statistically. The mortgage company would be 
turning down good business if it sent you out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's potentially a very powerful tool for evaluating individuals in an 
objective way," said Thomas M. Holloway, director of risk analysis for the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac). Holloway and two colleagues 
recently studied a cross-section of 10,000 loans from Freddie Mac's vast 
portfolio. They examined what each borrower looked like as an applicant across 
the table, and applied a credit scoring analysis to each. Then they checked how 
the borrower performed on payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Their conclusion: Credit scoring works. Had Freddie Mac used such a test when 
the loans were made, it would have avoided lots of subsequent headaches with 
default-prone applicants. The company now plans to begin a series of pilot 
programs with mortgage bankers and other lenders around the country later in 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Credit-scoring technology will allow far quicker decisions on applicants. 
Local lenders will be able to transmit basic financial data by computer to 
Freddie Mac, and get yes or no decisions within minutes by computer. A yes will 
mean that the applicant passes muster as a credit risk, and that Freddie Mac 
will likely buy the loan from the originating lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit scoring has been available for years, but traditionally has been used 
by retail and consumer credit providers -- department stores, sellers of major 
appliances and banks offering credit cards. Using scores supplied by credit 
bureaus like TRW or Equifax, they've been able to make quick, relatively 
accurate decisions on whether to extend credit to an applicant or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage lenders, by contrast, have relied almost exclusively on underwriting 
standards that combine objective tests -- like debt-to-income ratios -- with 
more subjective, person-to-person evaluations. The latter, however, have 
stirred charges of racial, ethnic, gender and age discrimination recently. 
Commercial banks and mortgage bankers are now being investigated and sued by 
regulators if they reject disproportionate numbers of minorities at the 
mortgage application stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit scoring for the mortgage field is growing fast because "it's objective, 
it's colorblind and it's based on factors you can demonstrate to anybody are 
statistically linked to borrower performance," said Joy G. Witherspoon, an 
executive with Atlanta, Ga.-based MDS, a consulting firm that creates 
credit-scoring models. 
</P>
<P>
 Where's the potential downside to widespread, automated credit scoring in 
mortgage underwriting? To the extent that it draws heavily on data supplied by 
credit bureaus, there's the possibility that outdated or uncorrected 
information in your computer file could foul up your overall score. If the 
lender didn't incorporate some form of direct, person-to-person follow-up -- 
and Freddie Mac says it plans to -- you might be shot down electronically 
before your application even gets off the ground.

HOT PROPERTY: STAR DROPS HILLS FROM HIS LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LIAM NEESON, star of Steven Spielberg's film "Schindler's List," has sold his 
Hollywood Hills home of about five years to return to his Manhattan loft, 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Neeson, a 41-year-old bachelor, has said that he has no specific plans after 
"Schindler" beyond spending "more time in New York." In "Schindler's List," 
Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, the hero of Thomas Keneally's novel about the 
German responsible for saving 1,300 Jews during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 A former amateur boxer from Northern Ireland, the 6-foot-4 actor made his 
stage debut in Belfast in 1976 and his Broadway debut last January, shortly 
after buying his loft in SoHo. His Broadway portrayal of coal stoker Mat Burke 
in Eugene O'Neill's "Anna Christie" won him the Schindler role. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Los Angeles in the late 1980s to do films. Among the ones in which 
he has appeared are "Suspect" (1987), "Darkman" (1990) and "Husband and Wives" 
(1992). 
</P>
<P>
 Neeson was quoted last March in The Times as saying, "I still get a kick out 
of waking up in Los Angeles -- the sunshine, you know -- but I don't think I'll 
stay there too much longer." 
</P>
<P>
 He sold his three-bedroom bungalow, built in the 1950s, for close to its 
asking price of $439,000 to novelists Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, who 
are also executive story editors for the new animated sci-fi series "Phantom 
2040," sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,400-square-foot house, designed in an L shape around a swimming pool, 
was once owned by the late actor Scott Brady, the brother of tough-guy actor 
Lawrence Tierney. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyers, who moved to Los Angeles about three years ago from Canada, were 
represented by Cindy Berman Schaffel of the Beverly Hills office of Prudential 
Rodeo Realty. Neeson was represented by Bill Lustig of Jon Douglas Co.'s Sunset 
Strip office. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress/singer SHIRLEY JONES and her husband, comedian/business executive 
MARTY INGELS, have put their longtime home in Beverly Hills on the market. "She 
said she wouldn't sell for less than $3 million," said a spokesman for the 
couple, referring to Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones bought the home 30 years ago with then-husband, late actor Jack Cassidy. 
She lived in it while raising her three children and marrying Ingels 16 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones and Ingels plan to expand the Brentwood townhouse they bought last 
fall from singer Janet Jackson, turning it into their residence when they're 
not at their Big Bear home. 
</P>
<P>
 They listed the three-bedroom, 5,200-square-foot Beverly Hills home, built in 
1950 with a park-like back yard and a pool, with Mike Silverman Estates, a Jon 
Douglas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold medal-winning ice dancing figure-skaters SERGEI PONOMARENKO and MARINA 
KLIMOVA have purchased a home at Lake Arrowhead for about $500,000, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The husband-wife skating team from Russia, who won the gold at the 1992 Winter 
Olympics, will maintain their residence just outside of Moscow but wanted a 
home in the United States because of their professional performances here. 
Since the Olympics, they've appeared in more than 250 shows and recently 
performed in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 They bought at Lake Arrowhead because of their acquaintances at the Ice Castle 
figure-skating training center there, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple purchased a 2,600-square-foot, 6-year-old home with views of the 
lake through Lake Arrowhead real estate broker Jim Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Arrowhead, a popular get-away place for early Hollywood stars, is still 
said to be a weekend and vacation retreat for such celebrities as Patrick 
Swayze, Dick Clark, Mark Harmon and Pam Dawber. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Olympic volleyball star PAUL SUNDERLAND, who worked as a reporter for 
NBC at the Fiesta Bowl on New Year's Day and is a basketball commentator for 
ESPN and Prime Ticket, has purchased a Malibu home for close to its asking 
price of $399,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-time home buyer, Sunderland was a member of the U.S. Olympic team that 
won a gold medal in 1984. He and his wife, Maud-Ann, and their two young 
children are moving from rented quarters in Malibu to their new home, a 
four-bedroom, 3,000-square-footer built in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which is next to Broad Beach, had been owned by a bank. Jay 
Rubenstein of Jim Rapf & Associates represented the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 TULLIE DEUTCH, who developed some office building and hotel properties in Los 
Angeles before his partnership -- CD Investments -- declared bankruptcy, built 
a 14-bedroom, 25,000-square-foot house in Beverly hills that has sold for $8 
million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The house was sold through a sealed-bid process to Beverly Hills residents. 
</P>
<P>
 CLARIFICATION: The Montecito estate formerly owned by actress Jane Seymour and 
business manager David Flynn, Seymour's ex-husband, was sold to Sandra Lynne, 
the wife of singer/songwriter Jeff Lynne, according to her attorney. The home 
was not sold to Jeff Lynne or to "a divorced woman with two teen-agers," as the 
Hot Property column of Jan. 9 reported.

WESTSIDE WATCH: POST-QUAKE SIDEWALK SALE SOOTHES RATTLED NERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Santa Monica Homeopathic Co. on 4th Street, not even yellow police tape 
surrounding the store could keep rattled customers from queuing up curbside for 
their vitamins and herbs -- strong aftershocks notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Litvak family, which has run the business for 50 years, kept operating 
despite the tape, which is a warning to enter at one's risk. So it was business 
as, um, unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sleeping," said customer Sandra Tootalian. "I need my calming herbs 
because my house has been rocking and rolling." 
</P>
<P>
 Curbside shoppers took turns sitting in a big wooden chair as their requests 
for "double and triple" vitamin orders were taken by Litvak family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Litvak said people seemed to be stocking up on cosmetics, vitamins and 
herbs, saying they were worried the building in which the naturopathic pharmacy 
is housed would tumble in an aftershock or be condemned. 
</P>

 QUAKE LABOR: To say the quake was a moving experience for Karen Blechman would 
be an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 After giving a reporter a sobering account of how the temblor destroyed her 
Santa Monica apartment building and left her homeless, Blechman recalled a 
bizarre experience that occurred moments before the ground started shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she felt an odd pushing sensation that was at once strange, 
disconcerting and yet somehow empowering. "It was as if I were re-experiencing 
my own birth," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Blechman was, in fact, reborn Monday morning is impossible to know, 
but she insisted that the sensation soothed her enough to help her escape her 
building.  
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds so California," she said apologetically. "I can't believe it. I'm 
British." 
</P>

<P>
 SOME MOMENTO: The normally vibrant Third Street Promenade bore a decidedly 
down-in-the-mouth look with few customers and lots of plywood this past week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bricks tumbled from several facades along the pedestrian mall and many 
plate-glass windows shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 But people came anyway, although aftershock-talk like "I was driving a little 
while ago and I felt that one" or "There was one last night that everyone woke 
up to" was in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Looky-loos were just as common. One wisecracker taunted a pair of visitors 
videotaping peeling brickwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he shouted, "We went to California and all we got was this 
earthquake!"  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 TEMBLORS BANNED: When asked how Beverly Hills escaped severe damage in 
Monday's earthquake, one City Hall wag replied, "We don't allow it." 
</P>
<P>
 True, the city has had an aggressive, retrofitting program since September, 
1992, when it passed an ordinance requiring that older buildings be brought up 
to earthquake codes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the snide remark may have a grain of truth to it.  
</P>
<P>
 This is a city known for passing ordinances regulating or banning everything 
from leaf blowers to putting advertising fliers on vehicles.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE REACHES $7 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquake last week severely damaged 33 buildings, with repair costs 
estimated at $7 million, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Hall-Esser, the city's chief administrative officer, said further 
inspections will determine if any buildings need to be demolished. Most of the 
damage was to commercial and industrial properties. Only six residents called 
the city to report severe damage to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries or deaths reported in the city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall-Esser also said she will ask the Federal Emergency Management Agency if 
federal loan papers can be distributed from City Hall for the convenience of 
residents. A federal assistance office has been set up in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has cost the city at least $500,000 due to damage at the interim 
city hall (a new city hall has been under construction since last year) and 
overtime, finance director Bob Norquist said. Federal and state assistance will 
help offset that cost, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 360 buildings had some structural damage. Of the 33 that received the 
greatest damage, four were landmarks, including the Metropolitan Community 
Church, which is in a 70-year-old building, and Belepasta restaurant, a 
69-year-old building that was the site of the city's first hospital, Hall-Esser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on Washington Boulevard near La Cienega Boulevard, less than a mile 
from a collapsed Santa Monica Freeway overpass, has been at a crawl during rush 
hours because of commuters using surface streets as alternate routes. City 
traffic engineer Ken Johnson said a second left-turn lane on La Cienega was 
added Thursday so more cars could turn east on Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Next week, the city will add a northbound left turn lane on La Cienega at 
Washington and a third eastbound lane on Washington between La Cienega and the 
Santa Monica Freeway, to help commuters get to the eastbound Santa Monica 
Freeway.

CAMP SANTA MONICA; POLICIES THAT WERE INTENDED TO RELIEVE HOMELESSNESS ARE 
BEING CRITICIZED FOR MAKING MATTERS WORSE -- AND THOSE ON THE STREETS AREN'T 
VERY HAPPY EITHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Hill-Holtzman, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, Santa Monica adopted what is believed to be the nation's first 
sweeping program to alleviate homelessness. But today, the city's homelessness 
problem is as bad as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica residents, along with millions who visit the city each year, 
still encounter homeless-related problems rivaling those of major metropolitan 
downtown areas across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 People are accosted at bank money machines by beggars offering to wash car 
windows. Panhandling is rampant in commercial areas, with some brazen enough to 
snatch food from the plates of restaurant patrons eating outdoors. Residents 
shy away from city parks because large enclaves of transients have turned these 
public spaces into campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as bad or worse than ever," said Herb Katz, who voted for the plan two 
years ago when he was a member of the City Council. "The public is furious." 
</P>
<P>
 And scared. "People feel threatened," said Santa Monica Police Chief James T. 
Butts. "The public won't put up with it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the continuing frustration at what the homeless themselves must 
endure--the filth, the hunger, the lack of medical and psychiatric 
attention--all amid relative affluence. Such conditions prompt some to 
recommend more help, rather than a crackdown. Indeed, many city residents got a 
firsthand look at homelessness after Monday's earthquake, which drove hundreds 
of apartment- and home-dwellers to emergency shelters and makeshift 
encampments. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Elizabeth Noble Lee, who was staying in a Red Cross shelter after the 
quake left her Topanga Canyon home without electricity, water or gas. "Being 
here, I realize how close I could have come. It's a rude awakening." 
</P>
<P>
 Evaluating Santa Monica's homeless policies is important these days: Other 
cities from New York to Seattle are launching major homeless programs of their 
own. Santa Monica's plan, developed by a citizens Task Force on Homelessness 
after months of toil, is viewed by many officials elsewhere as a test case for 
their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, approved in December, 1991, is part carrot and part stick. Under 
the program, approved in December, 1991, is part carrot and part stick. Under 
the program, the city has moved 1953439859 At the time, the plan was hailed by 
City Council members as a way to forge an alliance between those who wanted to 
crack down on the homeless and those who wanted the city to embrace them. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sharp departure from the city's previous philosophy, which frowned on 
restrictions that might make homeless people feel unwelcome. The change 
precipitated the firing of one of that philosophy's prime proponents--then-City 
Atty. Robert M. Myers. Myers, who was removed from office in September, 1992, 
was replaced last month by Marsh Moutrie, who has vowed not to take political 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Santa Monica has not made much headway. Signs of the large homeless 
population abound. 
</P>
<P>
 At Memorial Park, carts and boxes of belongings line the fence. People bed 
down on the tennis courts, in adjacent alleys and on the grass. The fences on 
the tennis courts at Lincoln Park serve as laundry lines and makeshift 
headboards for folks who lean their gear or themselves up against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of construction, Palisades Park has had a recent reprieve from its 
former notoriety as a homeless encampment with an ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
 "They finally found a way to clean up Palisades Park," quipped one Westsider. 
"They fenced it off." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of visible progress after two years of work is partly a result of the 
city's philosophy of homeless services. That philosophy favors focusing social 
services resources on long-term solutions for a few people rather than shelter 
for many. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, enough emergency help--clothes, meals and assistance 
getting general relief money--to maintain people, albeit barely, on the 
streets. It's also enough, however, to keep the homeless coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager John Jalili says Santa Monica's uphill struggle with homelessness 
shows that a small city, no matter how dedicated, can't solve a regional 
problem, especially when other locales aren't doing their fair share. That 
regional problem has clearly worsened in the past year because of the lingering 
recession and cuts in welfare.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the homeless task force never pretended that its recommendations 
would cause the homeless to go away, says Vivian Rothstein, a task force 
member. The goal, rather, was to gain community consensus on some approaches to 
the homeless problem, ending a political battle royal over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But others contend the liberal forces that control the City Council may lack 
the political will to make life more difficult for homeless people who refuse 
to adhere to tougher standards of behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the evidence cited by such critics: 
</P>
<P>
 * To protest the passage of a law to close down the parks after midnight, 
about 40 homeless people last summer lived on the City Hall lawn for months, 
blocking the entrance and urinating under the office windows of city workers. 
The city allowed them to remain on the lawn so as not to violate their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 * At a televised public hearing on the parks measure, Mayor Judy Abdo lashed 
out at Butts, demanding to know why a uniformed police officer had appeared in 
the doorway at the back of the council chambers. She said she was afraid his 
presence would upset the homeless people in the audience "while we were doing 
something difficult for (them) to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 "People talk about tough love," City Councilwoman Asha Greenberg said. "We've 
had all the love part, but none of the tough part." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless people are no happier. They agree that the situation is worse than 
ever, but not because the city is being too kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting worse because we're getting more police harassment," said 
Michael Flenoy, who lives in Memorial Park, where he played Little League 
baseball several decades ago. "Where you want us to go? They run us out of 
everywhere we go." 
</P>
<P>
 No one is accusing the city of not trying to address homelessness. Under the 
new zoning rules allowing speedier construction of homeless shelters, plans are 
in the works for three separate projects--mostly for individuals and families 
in transition from homelessness to permanent housing. SHWASHLOCK, a program to 
provide showers, lockers and coin-operated laundry vouchers for the homeless, 
got underway last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Third Street Promenade, a campaign was recently launched to discourage 
panhandling by getting visitors to give their spare change to agencies that 
assist the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who say the homeless problem is worse than ever point to one 
welcome change under the city's homeless program--removing the trademark 
homeless feeding service from the City Hall lawn. It was moved to three indoor 
locations and linked with other homeless services. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks are posing the toughest challenge to the city's homeless policy. 
</P>
<P>
 City staffer Julie Rusk acknowledged that the situation in the parks has 
gotten so out of kilter that maintenance workers are afraid to pick up the 
trash near homeless people for fear they would accused with violating their 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is about to change, Rusk said. Two years into the plan, she said, 
"We're just starting to work on the parks." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already passed three laws affecting the use of parks by homeless 
people. But enforcement has proved difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the measures--one that prohibits encampments in public places and 
anther that requires permits for large groups that want to use the parks--have 
been challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge said the restriction on large groups violated the First 
Amendment. That law will be repealed and redrafted in the next few weeks. 
Another lawsuit challenging the encampment law has not moved forward, but the 
city attorney's office has decided not to enforce it until the matter is 
resolved in court.  
</P>
<P>
 The only parks measure being enforced is a law that closes the parks at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the city has been slow to enforce laws affecting the homeless 
because it has been without a permanent city attorney for so long. "It 
definitely interfered with the development of clear policies," Councilman Paul 
Rosenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein said it is time for a serious new approach. "We need to distinguish 
between these people who want to get off the streets and those who don't," 
Rosenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein said it is time for a serious new approach. "We need to distinguish 
between those people who want to get off the streets and those who don't," 
Rosenstein said. "Those who want to get off the streets should be helped. Those 
who don't should not be made welcome in Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Abdo disagree, saying what's needed is more compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am hoping that (the public) will look at the homeless through their own 
experiences of being displaced by the earthquake."
