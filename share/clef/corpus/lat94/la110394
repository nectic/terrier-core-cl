 CHARTER LEARNING: The Ojai Valley already boasts more private schools than 
just about anywhere else in California. Now it may become home to Ventura 
County's first charter school (B1). . . . Former Ojai private school teacher 
Deanna Nakosteen suggested the idea.Starting a local charter school has already 
met with some resistance, but a small cadre of supporters has embraced the 
concept. "Many parents have supported me all along," Nakosteen said. 
</P>
<P>
 TOUGH TOWN: Angst , endless public hearings and decisions reached in the wee 
hours have been standard fare when some developers come before Thousand Oaks 
officials seeking to build (B6). . . . Ellen Michiel, of Raznick & Sons, wept 
after a 2 a.m. council vote to approve her company's proposal. . . . Another 
developer who collapsed several years ago when his plan was rejected is 
bringing back a revised version -- but not until next month, only after newly 
elected city council members are seated. 
</P>
<P>
 ROLL TO GLORY: Its highfalutin cousin, ice skating, seems more genteel. . . . 
But don't turn up your nose at free-style roller-skating -- it may become an 
Olympic event. If that happens, Dezera Salas, 22, of Port Hueneme will be ready 
(Ventura County Life, Page 8). Salas won a gold medal for freestyle skating in 
the world championships. But it could be years before the sport reaches the 
Olympics -- if it ever does. . . . Meanwhile, Salas tutors skaters in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 FUTURE TEACHERS: Proposition 187 would deny public education to children of 
illegal immigrants -- but that hasn't stopped some Ventura County students from 
envisioning bright futures as bilingual teachers. . . . About 450 high school 
and college students will meet at Ventura College this weekend to talk about 
careers in bilingual education. . . . Besides college and financial aid, the 
conference will focus on "encouraging (students) to become teachers," said Mary 
Cathcart, an assistant with Ventura's bilingual program. Adrianne Goodman

 ARCADIA: The City Council unanimously approved an architectural design for a 
112,000-square-foot, five-story patient tower at Methodist Hospital of Southern 
California on Huntington Drive. In addition, the council approved a city code 
change allowing sidewalk dining for cafes and restaurants that obtain a special 
permit from the city.  
</P>
<P>
 IRWINDALE: United Rock has said it will file suit against the city over its 
rejection of the company's proposal to deepen its quarry pits by 125 feet. The 
company contends that the City Council inappropriately refused its request 
although the Planning Commission approved the proposal and an environmental 
impact report cleared health and safety concerns. Without deeper quarry pits, 
United Rock says it will exhaust its resources within two to three years, but 
could continue to operate for 12 to 15 years if the depths are extended. 
</P>
<P>
 MONROVIA: The City Council has voted to use a mediator to resolve its dispute 
with Newco Waste Systems, which provides trash collection to residents and 
businesses in the city. After a hearing to consider terminating Newco for 
"non-performance," the council voted to enter into non-binding mediation with 
Newco, which has threaten litigation and filed a claim against the city and its 
officials for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN GABRIEL: Council members voted 4 to 1 Tuesday night to impose a contract 
on the San Gabriel Police Managers Assn. despite the objections of union 
members. The contract would provide a 2.5% salary increase retroactive to 
September, another 2.5% next July, an increase in the uniform allowance and 
bilingual pay. The association had demanded a high increase and wanted 
non-binding arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH EL MONTE: Former Mayor Raul Pardo, facing a criminal trial next month 
for alleged battery of a local newspaper photographer, has been removed from 
the Planning Commission because he missed three commission meetings. Under city 
ordinance, any commissioner who misses three meetings is automatically removed.

CITY HALL NEWS: PASADENA; CANDIDATE WINS $25,000 SETTLEMENT FROM FORMER 
ASSOCIATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An unsuccessful candidate for City Council has won a $25,000 settlement from a 
former business associate and city planning commissioner who had filed a highly 
publicized lawsuit against him shortly before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas T. Conway, a financial consultant and onetime candidate, and Edie 
Lopez-Lusk, a former chair of the city's Planning Commission, agreed to the 
settlement last June in Superior Court, averting a pending trial.  
</P>
<P>
 But the records of the settlement, which requires Lopez-Lusk to pay Conway 
$25,000 over several years, were unsealed by Superior Court Judge Coleman A. 
Swart just last week, Conway said. Lopez-Lusk, who could not be reached for 
comment, agreed to the settlement without admitting responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway said in an interview this week that the settlement proved that the 
allegations made shortly before the election were untrue. He also said it was a 
blow against scurrilous mudslinging that is prevalent in many campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked 3 1/2 years to clear my name," said Conway, who added that he will 
not run for public office again. "If candidates are going to be subject to 
these kinds of wanton allegations and character assassination, no wonder people 
won't run." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute started several days before the City Council primary in March, 
1991. Lopez-Lusk, who backed another unsuccessful candidate, Nina Chomsky, 
filed a lawsuit alleging that Conway, her former business partner, had used her 
standing as a Latina to get Los Angeles city and county government consulting 
contracts available for minority and women-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Conway said the lawsuit was a smear tactic. And city and county 
officials familiar with the contracts said minority representation was not a 
factor in the selection of Conway's firm, Arroyo Seco Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations contained in the lawsuit became a key issue in the runoff, in 
which Conway finished second to Councilman Isaac Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway filed a countersuit between the primary and the runoff alleging that he 
had been libeled by Lopez-Lusk.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: WHEN THE BIG PAYOFF IS SIMPLY LOVE OF A SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Respect is one of those qualities, it seems, that people should have to earn, 
though it's often much easier to acquire. Sometimes it's just a matter of whim 
or fashion. Take brain surgeons, rocket scientists and peace negotiators: They 
really have to work hard to get respect. Then compare them to actors -- many of 
whom have no particular training -- who just show up someplace, and out of 
nowhere come hoards of people begging for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes are a bit harder to figure out. They obviously work hard at what they 
do, and they go through years of training and sacrifice to acquire those 
special skills that earn them the millions for which we ultimately resent them. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also another breed of athlete, that rare individual who goes the 
extra mile, trains a little harder and makes it to the top, purely for the love 
of the sport. How, you might ask, can we tell the difference between those who 
do it for love and those who do it for glory and/or money? Actually, it's easy. 
Have you ever heard of Joe Montana, Wayne Gretzky, Barry Bonds or Nancy 
Kerrigan? Now, how many lacrosse or rugby players can you name? How about 
badminton players? No? Then try naming the World Champion Freestyle Roller 
Skater. Do you know who she is? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, she is Dezera Salas and she lives in Port Hueneme. And it was just a 
couple of weeks ago that she won a gold medal at the 39th freestyle roller 
skating championships in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately -- as staff writer Pancho Doll points out in his Centerpiece 
profile -- Salas has achieved her personal best in a sport that is not as 
widely recognized as the skating that involves blades. In fact, roller skating 
is to ice skating what Roller Derby is to the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to the roller rink to talk to her, she was waiting for a camera 
crew from a local television station to come interview her," said Doll. "They 
didn't show up. Kind of emblematic of a sport that couldn't draw a crowd if the 
rink was on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 No endorsements, no other monetary incentives, no squads of fans? 
</P>
<P>
 "The USA Network used to broadcast videotape of the world championships, but 
this year they passed on the event," said Doll. 
</P>
<P>
 It must be hard to keep skates oiled and morale high. How did this happen to 
roller skaters? "Boosters say part of the sport's PR problem is that it's not 
an Olympic event," Doll said. "Without the hype every four years to push a 
sport into the public eye, there's not going to be much interest." Which hasn't 
discouraged Salas enough to make her consider giving it up. "She has skated 
three hours a day for much of the last 14 years, and all she has to show for it 
are a handful of medals, probably none of them worth more than about $50," Doll 
said. "But, hey, she's got a skill. She can teach roller skating until her 
bearings grow rusty."

MOST INCUMBENTS FACE WEAK COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A "throw out the bums" attitude may be gripping voters nationwide, but most of 
the congressional and legislative officeholders in districts covering the San 
Gabriel Valley face only marginal challenges. Fund raising and voter 
registration strongly favor most incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's hottest race pits Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) against former 
Pasadena Police Chief Bruce Philpott in a no-holds-barred mudfest. 
</P>
<P>
 The other relatively close race has Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), 
first elected in 1972, facing a well-funded Altadena businessman who made a 
strong showing against the congressman two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar) is still the target of a federal investigation 
into possible violations of election, tax and labor laws, but he is expected to 
retain the seat he won two years ago. ASSEMBLY / 44th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: La Canada Flintridge, Pasadena, South Pasadena, Sunland, Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 45% Democrat; 43% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Bill Hoge (R), assemblyman; Bruce Philpott (D), retired police 
chief; Ken Saurenman (Lib.), contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Hoge, who won a close election two years ago against an 
underfunded challenger, is being taken to the wire this time by a strong 
Democratic challenger, former Pasadena Police Chief Philpott. Hoge, a 
conservative who has advocated putting the National Guard on the border to stop 
illegal immigration and requiring the death penalty for anyone committing three 
violent crimes, has considerably more money than Philpott. But Philpott has a 
lot of political currency in his standing as a former police chief. And he has 
been hitting hard at Hoge for accepting more than $100,000 in campaign 
donations from gambling interests and carrying gambling-related legislation. 
Philpott pledges to work for campaign reform to limit the influence of special 
interests in the state Capitol. ASSEMBLY / 49th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Alhambra, Monterey Park, San Gabriel, Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 61% Democrat; 25% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Kim Goldsworthy (Lib.), salesman; Diane Martinez (D), 
assemblywoman; George H. Nirschl III (R). 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Like many of the other candidates, Martinez faced her toughest 
opponent in the June primary in her quest for a second term representing the 
heavily Democratic district. Martinez scored a legislative victory recently 
when the governor signed into law her bill allowing the state to extend the 
Long Beach (710) Freeway through South Pasadena without the city's approval. 
Martinez is expected to score an easy win over her two opponents. ASSEMBLY / 
57th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Azusa, Baldwin Park, El Monte, La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 57% Democrat; 30% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: David Argall, (Lib.), newspaper deliverer; Martin Gallegos (D), 
chiropractor; Frank Yik (R), programmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: This seat opened up when Assemblywoman Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte) 
decided to run for state Senate. Democrat Gallegos, a chiropractor who runs his 
own clinic, emphasized his experience running a small business to win his 
party's nomination in a tough primary battle. Gallegos is expected to easily 
defeat Republican Frank Yik and Libertarian David C. Argall in the heavily 
Democratic district. ASSEMBLY / 59th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Claremont, Covina, Monrovia, Pomona, San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 48% Republican; 40% Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Margalo Ashley-Farrand (D), lawyer; Richard Mountjoy (R), 
assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Mountjoy is running in this Republican district at the same time 
he is campaigning for the final two years of the Senate seat recently resigned 
by former Sen. Frank Hill. The conservative Mountjoy is expected to win both 
seats. If so, he would resign the Assembly seat he has held since 1978. 
Ashley-Farrand has attacked Mountjoy for failing to drop out of the Assembly 
race to spare voters the cost of a special election. ASSEMBLY / 60th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Diamond Bar, La Mirada, West Covina, Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 43% Democrat; 43% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Paul V. Horcher (R), assemblyman; Andrew M. (Andy) Ramirez (D), 
political consultant; Michael L. Welte (Lib.), engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Horcher is expected to win his third term in the Assembly after 
losing a special election in September when he tried to move up to the state 
Senate. Horcher, who calls a mainstream candidate, thinks his appeal to 
moderates and conservatives alike will make the difference in this race. Voter 
registration favors Horcher because Republicans generally turn out in higher 
numbers than do Democrats. ASSEMBLY / 61st District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Pomona, Ontario, San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 45% Democrat; 44% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Fred Aguiar (R), assemblyman; Larry Silva (D), counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Aguiar ran unopposed in the June primary and comes up against an 
underfunded challenger, Silva, in the general election. Republican voter 
turnout favors Aguiar winning a second term. And Silva, who at 26 has never 
held public office, has been unable to raise the money to mount a serious 
challenge. SENATE / 24th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Alhambra, Azusa, Baldwin Park, East Los Angeles, El Monte, La Puente, 
Monterey Park, Rosemead, San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 59% Democratic; 28% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Dave Boyer (R), lawyer; George Feger (Lib.), businessman; Hilda 
Solis (D), assemblywoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: After one term in the lower house, Solis decided to move up to the 
Senate. She defeated former Azusa Mayor Eugene F. Moses in the Democratic 
primary, which was seen as her toughest test in the heavily Democratic 
district. Solis is a strong opponent of Proposition 187, which would bar 
illegal immigrants from most public services. She is expected to have little 
trouble against Boyer, who supports Proposition 187, and Feger. SENATE / 29th 
District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Arcadia, Bradbury, Claremont, Covina, Diamond Bar, Duarte, Glendora, La 
Canada Flintridge, Monrovia, Pomona, San Dimas, Sierra Madre, Temple City, 
Walnut, West Covina and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 46% Republican; 41% Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Sandra K. Hester (D), former congressional aide; Richard Mountjoy 
(R), assemblyman; Matthew J. Piazza (Lib.), former journalist; Walter R. 
Sheasby III (Green), labor economist. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Mountjoy easily won a special election in September but failed to 
get the majority of votes to avoid a runoff to fill the last two years of 
former Sen. Frank Hill's term. Hill, a Whittier Republican, resigned after 
being convicted of extortion, money laundering and conspiracy. The 
archconservative Mountjoy, a strong backer of Proposition 187, is expected to 
ride to victory on the back of the district's strong Republican registration. 
Hester opposes Proposition 187 and proposes to boost the state's economy by 
providing incentives to attract recyclers and other environmental industries. 
SENATE / 30th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Bell, Bell Gardens, Commerce, Cudahy, Huntington Park, Maywood, 
Montebello, Norwalk, Pico Rivera, Santa Fe Springs, most of South El Monte, 
South Gate, Vernon, Walnut Park and parts of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 65% Democrat; 24% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Charles M. Calderon (D), state senator; Ken Gow (R), retired 
aerospace engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Calderon appears virtually invincible in this heavily Democratic 
district. The only person standing between Calderon and reelection is Gow, a 
perennial losing candidate. SENATE / 32nd District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Pomona, San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 52% Democrat; 37% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Ruben S. Ayala (D), state senator; Earl De Vries (R), technician. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: First elected in 1974, Ayala is expected to win reelection in a 
district in which Democrats outnumber Republicans. Ayala, the author of 
legislation creating the California Conservation Corps for at-risk youths, is 
running a low-key campaign emphasizing his experience. De Vries, campaigning as 
a tax fighter, has been unable to raise much money. CONGRESS / 27th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Burbank, Glendale, La Canada Flintridge, Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 44% Democrat; 43% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Dennis Decherd (Lib.), computer analyst; Bill Gibbs (AI), 
businessman; Doug Kahn (D), businessman; Carlos J. Moorhead (R), congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: The pundits expect this to be one of the closer races, but 
Moorhead is favored to win his 12th term. Voter registration favors the dean of 
the state's GOP congressional delegation because Republicans tend to turn out 
to vote in higher numbers than do Democrats. Moorhead is campaigning as a 
fiscal conservative and strong opponent of illegal immigration. Kahn, a capable 
fund-raiser, has put out mailers in recent weeks portraying Moorhead as a 
member of a good-old-boys network that favors taxpayer-funded junkets. CONGRESS 
/ 28th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Arcadia, Claremont, Covina, Monrovia, Pomona, San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 46% Republican; 41% Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Jorj Baker (Lib.), businessman; David Dreier (R), congressman; 
Tommy Randle (D), businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Dreier, who was first elected to Congress in 1981, is expected to 
score an easy victory in this Republican district. Dreier, a prodigious 
fund-raiser, has one of the House's largest campaign funds with more than $2 
million. Named a "taxpayers best friend" by the National Taxpayers Union, 
Dreier supports a zero capital-gains tax rate and opposes requiring employers 
to pick up the tab for a national health care plan. Randle, who also ran for 
the seat in 1992 but lost in the primary, supports employer mandates to help 
pay for national health care. He also is a proponent of campaign finance reform 
to reduce the influence of special interests. CONGRESS / 31st District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Alhambra, Azusa, Baldwin Park, El Monte, Irwindale, Monterey Park, 
Rosemead, San Gabriel, South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 59% Democrat; 27% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: John V. Flores (R), transportation superintendent; Matthew G. 
Martinez (D), congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Martinez, long criticized as one of the state's least-effective 
congressmen, breezed through a primary challenge that was considered his 
toughest test in the heavily Democratic district. Martinez is a strong opponent 
of Proposition 187. He is expected to easily defeat Flores on Nov. 8. Flores, a 
proponent of Proposition 187, received a boost last week when former Vice 
President Dan Quayle appeared at one of his fund-raisers. CONGRESS / 34th 
District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: La Puente, Montebello, Norwalk, Pico Rivera, Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 62% Democrat; 28% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Albert J. Nunez (R), businessman; Carl M. Swinney (Lib.), 
radiologic technologist; Esteban E. Torres (D), congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: The 34th District is heavily Democratic and Rep. Esteban E. Torres 
should have no trouble keeping the seat he has held since 1983. He faces a 
nominal challenge from Republican Albert J. Nunez and Libertarian Carl M. 
Swinney. CONGRESS / 41st District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Diamond Bar, Fullerton, Pomona, Yorba Linda, San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 48% Republican; 39% Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates: Jay C. Kim (R), congressman; Ed Tessier (D), businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Kim, still under federal investigation for possible violations of 
election, tax and labor laws stemming from his 1992 campaign, is expected to 
have little trouble defeating Tessier, a little-known and poorly funded 
candidate. Kim is weathering the federal probe, which has produced no charges 
so far, with minimal damage. Political analysts say the district just has too 
many Republicans for Tessier to pull out an upset. In addition to attacking Kim 
for his legal problems, Tessier has criticized the congressman for opposing 
recently passed anti-crime legislation, which banned various types of assault 
weapons. Kim maintained that the new law is not tough enough on crime. The 
congressman cites $11.3 million in federal grants for improvement to Chino and 
Ontario airports as some of the benefits he has helped bring to the district.

 Sir Thomas More faced a major crisis of conscience and found his life at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 King Henry VIII wanted a divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and the church 
wouldn't grant him one. Most other English noblemen had already conceded to the 
Act of Supremacy, declaring the king's authority over that of the Pope. The 
king wanted the endorsement of More, a well-respected scholar and devout Roman 
Catholic. More's beliefs wouldn't allow him to sanction the act, even when his 
life was threatened under charges of treason.

 More's dilemma was dramatized by Robert Bolt in "A Man for All Seasons," which 
can be seen currently in a fine production by the Santa Paula Theater Center 
under the direction of Gerald Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom in modern times has English history been portrayed more vividly than it 
is in Bolt's play, which in many ways resembles a modern courtroom drama. 
Opening in London in 1960, the play was subsequently adapted by its author into 
his first Academy Award-winning screenplay. (He also won a year later for 
"Doctor Zhivago," having missed with his earlier "Lawrence of Arabia.") 
</P>
<P>
 Bolt's language is clear, elegant and timeless, making the play and its issues 
particularly easy to understand; those who listen carefully will find some of 
the courtroom material particularly prescient of current-day political and 
legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo -- whose local work includes Arthur Miller's "The Price" in Santa 
Paula and the Plaza Players' recent "Hot L Baltimore" -- has assembled a cast 
of local all-stars, some of the dependably best and best-known actors around. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading the list as More is David Ralphe, the center's artistic director and 
co-star of "The Price." His chief antagonist, the cunning Sir Thomas Cromwell, 
is played by Ron Rezac, with Jeff G. Rack (most recently of the the center's 
"Calamity Jane") as the sniveling Richard Rich, and Braden McKinley as the 
sympathetic Duke of Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining them are several other fine performers, less well-known on the local 
scene: Linda Livingston (another alumna of "The Price") plays More's wife, and 
Stephanie Lowe his daughter; Larry C. Wright is the daughter's fiance, and Arne 
Markussen is the Spanish ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish court was especially interested in this case for two reasons: 
Catherine herself was Spanish, and of course the country was strongly Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Maraffi makes a strong impression as young Henry VIII, and Richard 
Welch Monnie, Jared Willis, Donna Allen-Terrell and John A. Masterson appear in 
smaller, though significant, roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding everything together is Frederic R. Helsel as the Common Man, who 
portrays several minor characters and serves as the play's narrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The backstage technical work is particularly strong in this show and includes 
the aforementioned Rack's elegant, minimalist set design, Sabrina Jean Garcia's 
costumes and Dana Kilgore's dramatic lighting. Details

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: LAKE CASITAS BLUEGRASS FESTIVAL STRIKES CHORD FOR LIBRARY 
FUND; CONCERTS, MUSIC WORKSHOPS, CONTESTS, CHILDREN'S EVENTS, FOOD AND CAMPING 
ARE ON THE THREE-DAY BILL.

 There will be plenty of foot stompin' and fiddlin' around this weekend at the 
firstLake Casitas Bluegrass Festival and Contest to be held Friday through 
Sunday in Ojai. The festival, which organizers hope to make an annual event, 
will raise money for the Ventura County Library book fund, which has been cut 
by 80% since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day extravaganza is sponsored by Oxnard's Music Box Trading Co., the 
same folks who, for the last three years, have brought you those great 
bluegrass festivals at Kenney Grove Park near Fillmore. So you can bet there'll 
be something for every member of the family, including concerts, music 
workshops and contests, food, children's events, camping and more. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday and Saturday from 6 to 10 p.m., four of Southern California's 
premier bluegrass groups will take the stage. The five-piece Witcher Brothers 
band from Granada Hills features the duo of mandolin player Dennis Witcher and 
his 16-year-old award-winning fiddler son, Gabe. David Dickey and the Slover 
Mountain Boys are known for their tight, traditional harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The third group, Copperline, also leans toward traditional bluegrass, but 
draws from gospel and old-time country music as well. And the Grateful Dudes is 
a Los Angeles-based trio featuring Bill Bryson on bass, flat-picking wizard 
Scott Micale and fiddler Dennis Fetchet. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be banjo, fiddle, guitar and mandolin contests on Saturday for all 
age levels. And on Sunday, amateurs can participate in open microphone 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For more toe-tapping rhythms, check out Ventura Harbor Village's free Country 
Music Fest and Western Stage Show from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Buck Page and the Original Riders of the Purple Sage will treat 
you to lovely harmonies and humor from 12:30 to 3:30 p.m. Since 1936 this 
popular country-Western band has been cutting a trail with cowboy hits 
including "Don't Fence Me In," "Ghost Riders in the Sky" and "Tumbling 
Tumbleweeds." The fun continues Sunday when two favorite local performers join 
Page: Frank Umbro, a retired member of the Original Riders of the Purple Sage, 
and the state and national fiddle champion, Marvin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a stunt show and a caricature of a Western movie set and 
jail. The event benefits the Corriganville Preservation Committee, a nonprofit 
organization dedicated to preserving and promoting a unique part of Western 
film history. (Ventura Harbor Village, 1559 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura, 
644-0169). 
</P>
<P>
 CLUB UPDATES: Starting tonight at 7:30, Lori McGee will kick off a new format 
for the Ban-Dar's Thunder Thursday dance lessons for November and December. 
McGee will teach the hottest new line dances, beginning with Barroom Romeo.

BRIEFLY; BUSINESS: FIRM WINS PACT TO MERGE NAVY BASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Navy has awarded a $21.8-million contract to FSEC Inc. of Pasadena to 
close the Naval Air Warfare Center in Pennsylvania and merge it with the Naval 
Air Warfare Center in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena firm will supervise the consolidation of the two bases according 
to the cost-reduction requirements of the Base Realignment and Closure Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will move a small staff of managers to the East Coast to supervise 
the transition, and will hire employees there to perform the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the firm's Pasadena staff will participate in the work, engineer Jim 
Hannon said, FSEC does not expect to hire any new employees locally as a result 
of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pennsylvania base will close in phases, and FSEC will be paid in phases as 
well. The final award could be more or less than $21.8 million, Hannon said. 
The project is expected to be completed in March, 1997.

EXHIBITS; LINCOLN'S STRUGGLES STILL HIT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some scrawled just a few heartfelt words, others penned poems, still others 
wrote their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 All the notes are love letters of sorts, inspired by the Huntington Library 
exhibit "The Last Best Hope of Earth: Abraham Lincoln and the Promise of 
America," one of the largest and most comprehensive displays ever on the 16th 
President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Last Best Hope" -- taken from a Lincoln quote -- is the most popular 
exhibit in the San Marino museum's history. Nearly 300,000 people have viewed 
the exhibit since it opened in October, 1993. The exhibit, which had been 
scheduled to close Aug. 30, was held over to Nov. 13. Information: (818) 
405-2141. 
</P>
<P>
 At the exhibit's end, museum officials erected a bulletin board and asked: 
"What is Lincoln's legacy?" In response, hundreds of people posted missives -- 
in English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, German and Vietnamese. Many noted that 
the issues that Lincoln grappled with 125 years ago -- racial justice, equal 
opportunity and democracy -- are still relevant today. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials have saved all the comments but have not decided what to do 
with them. Here are some of the responses, edited for space. Names are listed 
when available. On his sacrifice: 
</P>
<P>
 (Written in Spanish:) "The greatest man who gave his life for all of us to be 
free. Viva Lincoln!" 
</P>
<P>
 "This exhibition is a vivid example of the sacrifices that men and women of 
principle are willing to make to better the lot of their fellow man. Social 
change is risky." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lincoln preserved the union, saved America, at the cost of his happiness, his 
soul and eventually his life. Can we let this freedom he gave us be wasted 
through racial disagreements, censorship and the destruction of our fellow 
man?" On his vision: 
</P>
<P>
 (Written in Spanish:) "Lincoln's ideas must be appreciated by all humanity as 
a great example of racial unity and complete abolishment of discrimination, not 
only racial but religious." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lincoln crystallized, perhaps for the first time in the history of humanity, 
that America was the womb of justice and equality. He markedly elevated the 
human race to a new and distant plateau." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arnold Newman 
</P>
<P>
 "One man articulated a moral necessity! With just one year of education and a 
background of earning a living by hard labor, he somehow managed to develop 
such a respect for a man's labor and worth that when he became articulate 
through reading and law, in him grew the simple overriding ethical principle 
that all men must be respected and given the same rights." On his inspiration: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lincoln was not born great but he achieved greatness. Reading the Gettysburg 
Address brings tears to my eyes. He is one of the most eloquent men to ever 
live on this earth. His legacy is truth and freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 "In Lincoln's words lie the spirit of true democracy and true humanity. Men 
like Lincoln offer the 'last best hope' for a better world." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pamela Hansen Ruzzo 
</P>
<P>
 "Lincoln's legacy has had me rethink my own thoughts on what it means to live 
in a country where we have freedom of choice, and have the freedom to ACT on 
those choices without having government be a barrier. Lincoln has given me the 
drive to speak freely, think and act as I choose, and has had me be aware of MY 
OWN legacy that I will be leaving for my children, and my children's children." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dede Whiteside Lessons learned: 
</P>
<P>
 "Abraham Lincoln -- A shining example of home-schooled excellence: unshakable 
integrity, morals, wisdom and the ability to influence and communicate. Quite a 
challenge to us parents today." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Davis family, Escondido 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how 'true' or 'great' your ideas, there will always be those who 
will hate you for holding them." 
</P>
<P>
 -- B. Wilson 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter who you are, you have chance in life. Take it and do good." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can sum up what we should be doing today like this: Instead of THIS race, 
or MY race, or MY culture, or MY feelings, how about the HUMAN race, HUMAN 
feelings, etc." Food for thought: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lincoln believed that anyone could and should be able to share in the 
American dream. We need this optimism in L.A. today." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lincoln set the stage for a society based on equality and must wonder what on 
earth is taking us so long to achieve it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I never would believe a little poor boy from Illinois could change the 
country so much." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Renee Rice, age 14 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the mysterious affinity we all seem to feel for Lincoln? Can it be 
our own best selves responding to his truth?"

POLICE; FIRED OFFICER REINSTATED, BUT DEMOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN UHRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overruling Alhambra Police Chief Russ Siverling, a city commission has voted 
to reinstate Steve Perry, a school board member who was fired from his job as a 
police officer in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting 5 to 0 in closed session, the Alhambra Civil Service Commission 
overturned the firing of Perry but ruled that he should be demoted and 
suspended for 30 days for reasons that both Perry and city officials have 
refused to disclose. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, 32, has been an Alhambra police officer for 12 years and a school board 
member since 1988. He was fired from the Police Department on Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's dismissal came one week after state Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control investigators had complained that an Alhambra police officer tipped off 
managers of a local restaurant to a state probe. The business was under 
investigation for allegedly selling alcohol to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil service Commissioner Thomas Simmons said Perry was charged with 
compromising another police agency's investigation in connection with the ABC 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simmons said Perry's otherwise good record as a police officer saved him 
from being fired. "If it wasn't for his record, I would have seen to it that he 
was kicked out of there," Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry has refused to comment about the case. Siverling, who along with several 
other police officials testified at closed hearings on Oct. 27 and 28, also 
declined to discuss his testimony or his reason for firing Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings were closed to the public at Perry's request. 
</P>
<P>
 The demotion could mean a cut in pay of as much as $8,400 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Simmons, Perry admitted he had warned a bartender at a local bar 
that state investigators were in town but claimed he never specifically stated 
that the business was under investigation. Perry's story was corroborated at 
the hearing by his partner that night, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Kelly, district administrator for the ABC in El Monte, said the three 
investigators from his office who were involved in the Alhambra investigation 
in late July were subpoenaed to testify at Perry's hearing but were never 
called. The City Council also met in closed session Monday to review Perry's 
hearing. The council could have appealed the commission's ruling but took no 
action, said Mayor Boyd Condie. Condie said he believes no appeal will be 
filed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it's over and we can go on from here," Condie said.

BURGLARY PUTS A 'KINK' IN SCHOOL GROUP'S FUNCTIONS

 When thieves stole four computers, a fax machine and stacks of backup disks 
from a South Pasadena nonprofit organization, they also stole important data 
used to supply money to more than 70 schools in Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange 
and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Project KidsCan, an organization that helps schools develop recycling programs 
and raise money for equipment, was burglarized on Oct. 2, leaving employees 
without vital information on participating elementary, middle and high schools. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The burglary "really put a kink in our operations," said Dana Richdale, 
executive director of Project KidsCan. "What really made it hard on us was the 
fact that the backup disks were also taken." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell donated one computer after the burglary but Project KidsCan is 
still short three IBM-compatible computers and a fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, sheriff's deputies arrested a 21-year-old Glendale man on 
suspicion of possession of stolen property. George David Freie had a computer 
and several fax machines in his possession, Sheriff's Deputy Robert Pryor said. 
The computer might belong to Project KidsCan, Pryor said, but the investigation 
is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees of the year-old organization pick up aluminum cans and plastic 
bottles collected by students and keep track of the money earned from recycling 
them. At the end of the year, the money is given to the schools and used to 
purchase equipment. La Verne Heights Elementary School teacher Wendy Frankel 
said students at the school raised $1,300 last year through Project KidsCan. 
The money was used to buy new printers for the school's computer lab, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students bring in their bottles and cans on the second and fourth Wednesdays 
of each month and Project KidsCan picks up the recyclables the same day. 
Although La Verne Heights has only had two pickups this year, it has already 
made $300, Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Project KidsCan can be reached at (800) 648-5437.

CENTERPIECE: ROLLING ALONG IN OBSCURITY; DEZERA SALAS WON A GOLD MEDAL IN 
FREESTYLE ROLLER SKATING, BUT FEW WOULD RECOGNIZE THE WORLD CHAMPION OF A 
MUCH-IGNORED SPORT. 
</P>

<P>
 Dezera Salas of Port Hueneme just became a world champion athlete, but don't 
expect to see her face on a box of Wheaties anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Her gold medal at the 39th freestyle roller-skating championships late last 
month in Salsomaggiore, Italy, won't translate into any big checks for product 
endorsements. No fat appearance fees. No autograph hounds. 
</P>
<P>
 For Salas, obscurity knocks. She is virtually unknown even in Ventura County, 
a sort of roller-skating Mecca that has produced half a dozen national 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They televised the finals every night in Italy, so I did lots of autograph 
signing there," she said. Then, in a tone of long-suffering acceptance, she 
added, "The sport is much bigger in Europe than here." 
</P>
<P>
 Skate Palace in Oxnard, where Salas teaches, has contributed several skaters 
to the U.S. and world championship teams. But the only camera crews to appear 
outside its doors in the sketchy south Oxnard neighborhood came to film 
segments for "Emergency 911" and "Cops" at the police substation next door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so unfair," lamented one roller-skating proponent. "We do the same thing 
figure skaters do -- salchows, camels, lutzes -- you name it. Only we do it 
with skates that weigh three times as much." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet the clunky cousin of figure skating slouches from one international 
competition to another, searching for respect. While the media crown an 
American ice-skating sweetheart every four years, roller skaters can't get 
their picture in a mug book. 
</P>
<P>
 As in figure skating, roller skaters are graded on appearance and degree of 
difficulty as they perform routines to music. Freestyle roller skates are the 
traditional four-wheel variety. In-line skates are fine for speed skaters and 
the ruffians who play roller hockey, but you can't spin on an in-line skate. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the relative obscurity in which freestyle skaters train and compete, 
at least someone is watching. Ice skaters regularly borrow moves from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Button didn't do the first triple," said Ken Doyle, a former U.S. 
champion who works at Skate Palace. "It was done on roller skates six years 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivalry between the two sports isn't always collegial. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're kind of snobby," Salas said of ice skaters. "But I guess they have 
the right to be. They're making money." 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. Although there's hardly a dime's worth of difference between the 
routines that roller skaters and ice skaters perform in competition, millions 
of dollars separate what they can expect to fetch in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Kerrigan lined up endorsements worth nearly $10 million from Disney, 
Reebok, Revlon and Campbell Soup. Kristi Yamaguchi pulled down an estimated $2 
million in similar deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Salas' title win will net her a $2,500 grant from an amateur athletic 
association. She could apply for more grants through other associations, but 
she says the most she can reasonably expect to gain is $10,000, about enough to 
cover one year's training expenses for a title it took her 15 years to win. 
LITTLE GLAMOUR 
</P>
<P>
 Dezera (pronounced Desiree) started taking lessons at age 7. When she turned 
14, she started training with Tom Davis, another former U.S. champion who works 
at Skate Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Expenses for lessons, travel and equipment totaled $700 to $800 a month, and 
when the baseball card store the family owns in Goleta didn't generate enough 
money, Dezera's father worked two more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did without a lot of things," said Dezera's mother, Diana Salas. "Her 
lessons got paid before our mortgage, and the lessons usually cost more." 
</P>
<P>
 Any regrets that their daughter didn't choose ice-skating? 
</P>
<P>
 "She tried ice-skating, but it never occurred to us or her to change over." 
</P>
<P>
 So Kerrigan gets about a million bucks to sit under klieg lights and slurp 
Campbell Soup while Dezera Salas pays retail for the Wendy's chicken nuggets 
she eats from a dimly lit picnic table at the rink. 
</P>
<P>
 Salas does earn $30 a hour for coaching other skaters and she has had success 
there, too. She is the youngest coach to have produced a national champion -- 
one of her students won the elementary division (for girls 10 to 12 years old) 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On a good week she earns about $600 -- pretty fair coin, she admits. But as a 
world champion ice skater she could charge at least twice that for private 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other differences apart from the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the Skate Palace are immediately met with the smell of urethane, a 
chemical coating periodically applied to the maple wood floor. It's an odor 
unmistakably associated with bowling alleys and the connection hardly seems 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Like bowling, roller-skating is a volksport : inexpensive and accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Ping-Pong rather than lawn tennis. Over cocktails and a cigarette at a 
popular Oxnard bar, Salas further explained what distinguishes her sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Figure skaters have to do major training both on and off the floor. They run, 
swim, work out. We really don't." She said she trains by skating her routine 
and little else. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding should have been a roller skater. She loved to nip out after 
practice for a beer and a smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, roller-skating is just a heck of a lot noisier than figure 
skating, which possesses that delicate "schoosh . . . schoosh . . . schoosh" of 
metal against ice. It's such a clean, attractive sound that audio engineers aim 
microphones at the rink to capture the effect for broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Roller skates, on the other hand, rumble slightly and when a skater jumps, the 
landing is punctuated with a graceless "THUNK." 
</P>
<P>
 Far worse is the unattractive noise wheels make when they are dragged 
sideways. It's a loud, low-frequency vibration that sounds like the fallout 
from a chili cook-off. RESURGENT POPULARITY 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those telegenic liabilities, Andy Seeley, spokesman for the U.S. 
Amateur Confederation of Roller Skating in Lincoln, Neb., said the 
confederation is trying to make freestyle roller-skating an Olympic event. 
</P>
<P>
 It has already made it into both the Pan American and World Games, but Seeley 
said it's unlikely to be included in the Olympics before the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in-line skaters are higher in the Olympic pecking order. Roller hockey 
was added as a demonstration sport at the 1992 summer games in Barcelona, and 
speed skaters are likely to be added next. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are signs that roller-skating is regaining some of the popularity it 
lost 15 years ago when roller disco, the bastard child of freestyle skating, 
fell out of vogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "When disco hit in the '70s, roller-skating got really popular," said former 
U.S. champ Davis. "I used to work at the rink in Reseda where all the stars 
like Cher came. After disco died there was a big decline." 
</P>
<P>
 In the intervening years, roller-skating has made something of a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of roller skaters in the United States now totals 32.6 million -- 
up from 30 million in 1990, according to estimates by the Roller Skating 
Assns., a promotional group made up of more than 1,100 skating-center operators 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which should translate into more students for Salas, who had planned to 
retire after the championship and concentrate on teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pan Am games are in March, so I might as well compete in those," she 
said. "I'm 22, so the Olympics are out of the question for me, but I'm already 
planning for my students." Lacing 'Em Up in the County 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you want to skate like a pro or go around in circles until you're 
dizzy, there are three places in the county to lace 'em up: 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a freestyle skater, you might have a tough time finding a floor to 
skate on in the evening; the explosion of roller hockey takes up lots of floor 
time around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hockey players get priority," said world champion Dezera Salas. "There's more 
of them and they're bigger than us." 
</P>

WALKOUT SPURS DISTRICT TO REDUCE CLASS SIZES AT MUIR HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at Pasadena's John Muir High School have learned that the squeaky 
wheel really does get the grease. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of overcrowded classes that left them scrambling for seats, nearly all 
of the school's 1,500 students took to the streets last month to protest their 
classroom conditions during a peaceful two-hour demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Unified School District officials moved quickly to adjust class sizes 
at the school, conceding that the students had some valid claims about 
overcrowding. Now those adjustments are complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had real problems. . . . The previous two to three weeks they hadn't 
moved fast enough to balance the classes," said Vera Vignes, superintendent of 
the 21,756-student district. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools usually have four weeks after the beginning of the academic year to 
make adjustments, which can include canceling classes with few students 
enrolled, adding new teachers or moving students from one class to another to 
balance class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 That should have been done by Oct. 7, Vignes said, but the process was still 
dragging on at Muir a week later, which prompted a walkout by students who said 
they couldn't find a seat or enough textbooks in some classes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vignes said that some of the students' claims of class sizes were 
exaggerated. One chemistry class that students claimed had 52 students actually 
had 43 students when administrators investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 That was still too many students, however, so school officials adjusted the 
size to 36 students, which is the average number of students permitted per 
class, according to the Pasadena teachers' union contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract states that for each 29.75 students, there should be one teacher. 
But because teachers only teach five classes a day, with a free conference 
period as their sixth class, the actual class size becomes an average of 36 
students when spread over six periods, said Dave Banis, director of secondary 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie Mason, a Muir English teacher, said school administrators visited her 
classroom to reassure students that they were lowering class size. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're making a good-faith effort," Mason said.

MAN IN 'BUNNY' COSTUME ARRESTED IN ASSAULT, THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 225-pound man dressed as a "Samurai Bunny" for Halloween was arrested after 
he allegedly wielded his wooden sword and nearly severed the earlobe of a 
Diamond Bar man who asked him if he was too old to be trick-or-treating, police 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Bautista, an unemployed La Verne resident, was arrested at 7:45 p.m. 
Monday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and grand theft after twice 
striking a 35-year-old man with his sword and stealing candy from a youngster, 
La Verne Police Lt. Carl Brubaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bautista, who according to Brubaker admitted to both incidents, is being held 
on $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged assault occurred about 7:10 p.m. in the 3200 block of Thrush 
Street where Bautista, 21, carrying a wooden sword, had been trick-or-treating 
dressed in loose clothes and a stuffed bunny on his head, Brubaker said. The 
victim had been visiting his sister and was standing outside her house on 
Thrush Street. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bautista walked past the house, the man asked if the trick-or-treater 
wasn't too old to be out asking for candy. At that point, the victim later told 
police, Bautista said, "So, what are you going to do about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bautista then allegedly struck the man twice across the head with his wooden 
sword. One blow tore a gash in the man's earlobe so deep that it was nearly 
severed, police said. A few minutes later, Bautista allegedly ran up to a 
youngster and fought to get his candy. The youngster ran away.

MONTEREY PARK: RESOLVING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OFFICIALS, RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irv Gilman claims that the confrontation involving Monterey Park Library Board 
President Kathleen Brzozowski was much ado about nothing (Oct. 13). 
</P>
<P>
 When the board president intentionally hurls an object at individuals with 
whom she disagrees and then threatens to strike them with her walking stick, 
it's safe to assume that most members of society would take offense at this 
kind of behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Mr. Gilman approves of this method for resolving one's differences. I 
believe he would be in the minority. Individuals should be free to disagree 
with others in the community without the fear of physical violence. Those who 
gathered at the library board meeting only wished to make public opinions about 
some remarks made by Ms. Brzozowski that they found offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seen Mr. Gilman publicly disagree with members of the City Council 
during meetings. Would he approve if those members physically threatened him? I 
would think not. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Mayor Judy Chu's celebration of Harmony Month in Monterey Park, it 
seeks to accomplish just that: Celebrate the city's cultural diversity while 
promoting greater dialogue among all groups and citizen participation in 
community affairs. Learning to resolve our differences peacefully is a key 
element. This is what separates civilization from anarchy, Mr. Gilman.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; YOUTHS MAKE A SPLASH ON MOVIE SET IN FILLMORE; 
MEMBERS OF THE CONEJO SIMI AQUATICS DIVING TEAM DON '40S-STYLE SWIMSUITS FOR 
SCENES IN 'HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT.' BUT THEY HIT THE BOOKS WHEN THEY'RE 
NOT IN THE POOL.

<P>
 A group of 42 youngsters from eastern Ventura County learned this week that 
you can never escape algebra. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, all members of the Conejo Simi Aquatics diving team, got out of 
regular classes Monday to work as extras in the film "How to Make an American 
Quilt," which was on location at Fillmore High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture by Amblin Entertainment, Steven Spielberg's company, is a 
multi-generational story about a quilting circle. The film stars Winona Ryder, 
Maya Angelou, Anne Bancroft and Alfre Woodard. The crew was shooting scenes 
circa 1940 at the school's outdoor diving tank. Kids were dressed up in period 
costumes, in this case baggy cotton swimsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Dives completed, they were marched into the school's gymnasium, where tables 
of youths swaddled in towels hunched over school books. The 4-to-1 
teacher-to-student ratio permitted considerably less goofing off than in 
regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Micah Bedrosian, 13, of Thousand Oaks is one diver used to the 
splash-and-study routine. One of his recent acting jobs was on a 10-meter 
platform for an episode of "Melrose Place." 
</P>
<P>
 "That was before I was on the dive team. I was supposed to get up to the top 
of the platform and look scared. It wasn't hard," Bedrosian said. "I was 
scared." 
</P>
<P>
 But he was intrigued enough to join the diving team shortly afterward. If 
Bedrosian's scene survives the editing process, you can see him performing a 
"forward dive, straight" when the picture is released about this time in 1995.

 Ventura County Cablevision will test an interactive service to allow residents 
in as many as 1,000 east county households to talk back to their televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The interactive programming, called the L. A. Project, gives viewers different 
camera angles at a sporting event, interactive games, educational programs that 
let viewers take a quiz -- lots of choices. But don't people watch television 
because they're tired of thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 That could be the reason the much-hyped interactive QUBE system in Columbus, 
Ohio, failed, as did the GTE experiment in Cerritos. Who wants to make 
decisions when you're relaxing? 
</P>
<P>
 Dave LaRue, president of Ventura County Cablevision, is undaunted. He said the 
service his company plans to provide has already proven a hit with viewers in 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic banking and ordering flowers through the tube, both features of the 
failed Cerritos experiment, are not the big prizes. Rather, interactive 
television is vying for a portion of the $15-billion annual video rental 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Video on demand could deliver a substantial portion of that pie to cable 
providers, but interactive TV hasn't even gotten the flower delivery down. 
</P>
<P>
 In the GTE Cerritos experiment, a customer ordered flowers by pushing a button 
on the TV's remote control. That sent a signal to the television company 
office, where someone wrote an order, then sent it to the flower shop -- by 
fax. 
</P>

 Wending its way up and down the movie distribution chain, "Red Rock West" 
returns to Santa Barbara tonight at the UCSB Arts and Lectures film series. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 "cowboy noir," starring Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn 
Boyle, went from European movie houses to film festivals to HBO, to film 
festivals again, to video, then to limited theatrical release and finally to 
the college film series circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cage is passing through the tiny Western town of Red Rock when he's mistaken 
by a bar owner for the hit man he's hired to rub out his wife. Escalating plot 
twists keep the tension mounting and the audience guessing right to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Its tone and style are often compared to the Coen brothers' "Blood Simple." Go 
see it at 7 p.m. in Campbell Hall.

DANCE TROUPE LEAVES PASADENA FOR SAN GABRIEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pasadena Dance Theatre has found a new home in the city of San Gabriel, 
which has gladly signed a three-year contract with the group, establishing its 
official residency at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the dance company has performed "The Nutcracker" ballet annually at 
the 1,500-seat auditorium for the past 14 years, the city's decision to 
formally recognize the group as an in-house resident was based on the 
successful long-term relationship between San Gabriel and the dance group, as 
well as the projected economic and cultural benefits to San Gabriel, said Bill 
Shaw, general manager of the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very happy to have them here," Shaw said. "This is a tremendous step 
forward for the cultural growth of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The dance company, founded in 1963 and based in Pasadena, has rarely performed 
in that city because of the lack of affordable venues, said Charles Fuller, 
artistic director of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pasadena Civic Auditorium sits there vacant half the time because it's 
too expensive to rent," Fuller said. "The city gives us no concessions, and the 
San Gabriel (theater) is very affordable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena Civic Auditorium, which seats 2,500, has nightly rental fees of 
at least $1,000 plus labor expenses, according to dance company officials, 
making it hard for lesser-known groups to rent and fill it. The auditorium 
declined to confirm those prices, but Denise Nelson Nash, executive director of 
the city of Pasadena arts division, conceded there is a lack of medium-size, 
affordable performance spaces in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Music Theatre of Southern California, which has been performing at the San 
Gabriel Civic Auditorium for 11 years, officially accepted residency there this 
month.

ON THE ROAD: SCULPTOR FORGES SUCCESS FROM VISIONS IN STEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ted Gall never figured on being a noted sculptor who could live quite 
comfortably off money from his art. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in a working downtown Chicago neighborhood, Gall never heard anyone 
talk about showings at uptown Miami galleries or corporate art commissions or 
European clients who'd seek to have their fantasies forged in bronze or cut in 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
 No, growing up, Ted Gall made it through high school and went straight to work 
in a telephone factory. His job there was to tune phone bells by grinding edges 
off the cast gongs that struck them. He knows now in this beep-beep age that 
he'd be out of work and broke and stuck if he'd remained a $140-a-week tuner. 
</P>
<P>
 So he followed up on a strength that had evidenced itself in childhood: 
drawing. His parents, though not formally educated, had noticed Gall's ability 
early on and sent him, at age 12, to summer classes at the Art Institute of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Gall took a pay cut in his early 20s to move from gong-grinding to drafting, 
and, after that, another cut to work as an apprentice in an animation studio. 
In animation, he learned to work "flat," in the two dimensions of drawn 
characters; and "deep," in the 3-D of actual models made to change in sequence. 
Without particularly knowing it, Gall found himself working as a commercial 
sculptor. 
</P>
<P>
 He rented a garage in which he could explore sculptural notions of his own. 
He'd work in the studio by day, sculpt at night, and some of his own pieces -- 
broad-shouldered heroic figures, mostly -- worked. Without a college degree, 
Gall started teaching night classes at Chicago colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Things could have gone on like this forever. Few artists ever have the 
resources and vision to produce enough original work to subsidize a life and, 
as Gall was discovering, a family. But then the phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a gasket factory in Skokie, Ill., just outside Chicago. The owner of 
the place liked art, believed in art. He wanted Gall to come on board full time 
as the Felpro gasket company's artist-in-residence, employing industrial scrap 
from punch presses and giant sheet cutting machines in the fabrication of, 
well, fine art. 
</P>
<P>
 Gall did it. He reported to Skokie and produced sculptures that Felpro gave to 
clients, placed within the factory, set permanently into the grounds 
surrounding the plant. His largest and perhaps most successful Felpro piece -- 
a 28-by-8-by-3-foot steel engine gasket -- was presented to the city of Skokie, 
which placed it in a playground. It juts up from the ground, on a tilt, as if a 
relic on a dig. Its mass and weight are defied by the appearance that it was 
lightly tossed off in some former age of hot-rodding giants. Happily, it swarms 
with tiny children who hide in its holes, slide on its curves, hang from its 
edges. It is rakishly modern, industrially indigenous, endlessly involving. 
</P>
<P>
 Gall started getting noticed. While his Felpro work tended to be wrought with 
abstraction, other pieces were figurative, if slightly surreal. They would 
foreshadow his super-muscular man, heroic in dimension, sprouting wings; or his 
godlike figure pedaling into space on a flywheel, yet so insecure as to be 
holding a mask with which to change identities. 
</P>
<P>
 Gall's work started to show up at galleries in Florida and the Midwest and 
California and in private collections nationwide. His work appeared at 
universities and in corporate lobbies and in city parks. He weaned himself 
somewhat from Felpro, arguably among the last of a breed of 19th Century-style 
patrons, and did more and more on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when he moved to Ojai, six years ago. His wife's family had moved here. 
"I never thought of being in Ojai to have Ojai support my art," says Gall. 
"That would be impossible. It's just a really nice place. I sell mostly in 
Florida and the Midwest, with some in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Six or seven days a week Gall walks from his hilltop house down an embankment 
of cactus and fruit trees to a mammoth studio. There, he welds, cuts, hammers 
out originals that get molded in rubber, cast in wax, refined further, and then 
driven to an Oxnard foundry for casting in bronze or stainless steel. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller of his pieces -- a three-inch-high bust with a metaphor of life's 
treadmill mounted atop its head -- sell for under $2,000. The larger of the 
pieces -- a 6-foot "Puppet Man" atop a pedestal holding an imprisoned figure by 
cable below -- go for around $35,000. Many of the pieces feature figures 
wearing or holding masks. If they all beg one theme it would be the mystery of 
human identity. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculptures, like Gall, are everywhere: displayed in and outside the 
studio, being readied for shipment to moneyed markets ripe for his art. 
</P>
<P>
 To Gall, it all kind of makes sense, if a humbling version of it to a Chicago 
street kid who once worked the gong line, who at 53 feels his lack of formal 
education renders him at times inarticulate. Yet from here, in the silent hills 
above Ojai, Gall has no trouble making it plain that he has no delusions about 
art or life, that his own identity is bell-clear: "I work very hard; it's part 
of my ethic. But I know that so many people have to work harder than I do and 
yet get a lot less from life." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses a moment. He scans the studio, sees a nearly completed triptych for 
a Swiss baron, notes the design faxes he sends to Skokie in his week-a-month 
arrangement with Felpro. Soon, he'll have to return to posh Coconut Grove, 
Fla., to a gallery where patrons will seek to commission him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ever meet people where things have just happened?" asks Ted Gall. "That's 
been my life. I'm grateful."

EARTHWATCH: LINKING THE ECONOMY WITH THE ENVIRONMENT; THE GROWTH OF BUSINESS 
AND INDUSTRY INCREASINGLY IS SEEN AS CONNECTED TO THE QUALITY OF LIFE.

 There's an election next week. The environment isn't a big concern this time 
around. It barely reached eighth place on the worry list this fall when 
pollster Peter Hart surveyed folks nationally. I think the environment's status 
as a non-issue is environmental news in itself. And I think I've got the story. 
</P>
<P>
 The environment has been discovered by economists. 
</P>
<P>
 While my fellow environmental journalists gathered in Utah for their annual 
meeting last month for the announced purpose of discussing "Why Isn't the 
Environment a Bigger Story?", I followed a personal hunch and chose instead to 
drive up to UC Santa Barbara. Why? To attend The Second Occasional California 
Workshop on Environmental Resource Economics and Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspected that The Invisible Hand, which is what some economists say governs 
the marketplace, was somehow closing in on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 There are clues everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Close to home, the latest reports out of Oregon are that the shift from 
cut-and-run timber operations occasioned by the rescue of the spotted owl has 
turned into some sort of economic bonanza. They've lost 15,000 jobs in the 
lumber industry and gained 100,000 in various environmentally regulated 
industries. No news in pictures of teeming owls and teeming Intel factories. 
</P>
<P>
 I did a little homework before driving to UC Santa Barbara. I called economist 
Frederick Cannon, author of the Bank of America's report "Economic & Business 
Outlook: Growth and the Environment." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last year or so the conventional wisdom has shifted," he said. 
"Economic growth and improvement has to have a key element -- quality of life. 
You have to have a quality environment." 
</P>
<P>
 But then comes the question, how do we mandate quality of life and who should 
be in charge of the environment? 
</P>
<P>
 This is a question one of the two dozen speakers at UCSB has been working on 
for a long time. Perry Shapiro, a Ventura resident and economics professor at 
UCSB, has been doing research on "Which Level of Government Should Be 
Responsible for Environmental Regulations?" 
</P>
<P>
 It is his assertion that "there's no theoretical reason why the federal 
government should be involved." He's talking about a pattern -- largely 
unreported -- of states being more efficient at environmental matters than the 
feds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Green and Gold," a study by economist Bob Hall for the Institute for Southern 
Studies, found that states that opted for weak environmental controls -- such 
as West Virginia and Louisiana -- are "becoming poorer, more polluted, less 
diversified." And states with the best environmental records -- mostly not in 
the South -- offer the best job opportunities and climate for long-term 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bank of America study I mentioned, Fred Cannon wrote that "states with 
strong environmental standards have grown nearly one-half percent faster per 
year during the past 14 years than states with weak environmental standards." 
California, of course, is in the happier group. 
</P>
<P>
 Another study was released this summer by UCSB's Community and Organization 
Research Institute. Its principal author, Harvey Molotch, surveyed the effects 
of the recession on Santa Barbara County, weaving in figures for Ventura and 
other neighboring areas. He said of his general findings, "environmental 
controls don't hold down growth but give it a different trajectory, attracting 
cutting-edge companies and preserving a pleasant lifestyle."

 It's once again that time of year to give the universal gift of appreciation, 
love, friendship. We're talking the gift of chocolate. It's a staple of the 
holidays, perfect for that special someone with a sweet tooth, or for when you 
don't want to come to the party empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, with stricter government regulations concerning nutritional 
labeling on the packaging of food items, this gift of love can also be 
construed as the gift of fat and calories. 
</P>
<P>
 It came as bit of a shock to us when we flipped over a box of the ever-popular 
Whitman's Samplers and saw that three pieces of chocolate were 200 calories and 
11 grams of fat. Kind of takes the joy out of the whole giving/receiving thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But chocolate is here to stay, so let's take a look at what's out there in the 
way of chocolate gift boxes sold at general convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
 There are boxes of caramels, boxes of nuts and chews, boxes of creme-filled 
candies. But for the most part, we stuck with the general "assorted 
chocolates." What we found was that two companies -- Whitman's and Russell 
Stover -- dominate the chocolate gift box world. We also looked into some 
chocolate-covered macadamia nuts, but we'll get into those later. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's start with Whitman's Samplers. They've been around since 1842, and one 
of those easily identifiable yellow boxes shows a heartfelt intent. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1 3/4-ounce, four-piece box was 79 cents at Thrifty (a store, by the way, 
that has quite a chocolate aisle -- very impressive; we and our sweet tooth 
visit every chance we get). That same-size box was 75 cents at Longs. At 
Thrifty and at Longs, the one-pound box of Whitman's was $6.95. Thrifty also 
had a 3.6-ounce box ($1.55) and a two-pound box ($13.50). Note: If we happen to 
be on your gift list, you might consider the two-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Russell Stover, the most commonly found sizes were eight ounces and one 
pound. The eight-ounce box was priced at $2.95 at Rexall and Kmart, and $2.85 
at Longs. The one-pounder was going for $5.75 at Thrifty and Kmart and $7.50 
(in special autumn color wrapping) at Rexall. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Stover has a series of specialty-wrapped packages. There's the "The 
Gift Box" (shimmering white with raised lettering and a stem rose) going for 
$8.09 for 1 1/2 pounds at Longs. The same item was marked down from $8.50 to 
$7.67 at Kmart. There's also the eight-ounce Little Ambassadors Miniature 
Chocolates in an attractive gold box for $4.45 at Longs and $3.97 (marked down 
from $4.55) at Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough chocolate, yet? No way. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hallmark they were selling various assortments of Hallmark Crown 
Chocolatier boxes. The general assorted chocolates was selling for $1.19 (1 1/2 
ounces, or three pieces), $1.89 (2 1/2 ounces, or five pieces), $6.25 (11 
ounces) and $6.75 (13 ounces). A special six-ounce "Autumn Selection" in a cute 
maple leaf box was going for $5.99. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, that's it for straight chocolate. Now we'd just like to say a word or two 
about chocolate-covered macadamia nuts, a special treat for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrifty had the Mauna Loa brand of chocolate-covered halves and wholes at 
$3.99 for six ounces. The store also had a MacFarms of Hawaii brand of 
macadamias covered in caramel and chocolate for the same price. Both boxes 
proclaimed they consisted of "100%" Hawaiian nuts. And at Longs, the Brown & 
Haley folks of Almond Roca fame (another nice holiday item, by the way) were 
getting into the macadamia act with a 7.05-ounce box of chocolate-covered nuts 
for $5.29. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, just remember, the best thing about buying chocolates as holiday gifts is 
that if you forget to give them to the intended recipient (or if you get into a 
fight with the intended recipient and don't want to give the gift anymore), you 
can always eat the candy yourself.

FASHION; GOING BACK TO TURN OF THE CENTURY BRINGS LACE, CAMEOS, CALM; SHOPPERS 
ARE SNAPPING UP VICTORIAN-ERA ITEMS, AND THE SERENITY THAT COMES WITH THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nostalgia has struck again. Only this time, it reaches all the way back to the 
last century. Victoriana -- with its antimacassars and alabaster cherubs -- has 
a grip on the country. 
</P>
<P>
 You probably noticed the signs. Potpourri jars started spreading faster than 
lawyer jokes. T-shirts bloomed with satin roses. Cameo jewelry reappeared from 
a black hole. Heart-shaped things began multiplying like zucchini. 
</P>
<P>
 Lace, tatting and needlepoint exploded into living rooms like a snowstorm. 
Froufrou things the last generation tossed out so they wouldn't have to dust, 
iron or polish came back with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victorian is very soothing for people," said Judith Buck, co-owner of 
Willows, an accessory and design store in Westlake. "And people can't afford to 
move now, so they are going to redo themselves. They just want to bring a 
little serenity back." 
</P>
<P>
 People are so into the retro look, they are embracing a bit of the 
inconvenience it included. Buck pointed out that tablecloths are making a 
comeback, and people want linen and damask -- which means ironing, a 
once-quaint notion. 
</P>
<P>
 But inconvenience is one thing, discomfort another. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people want a picture-book Victorian room, said Susan White, owner of 
Arabella, a Westlake boutique with an authentic turn-of-the-century look. 
Handworked doilies and pillows are likely to rest on an overstuffed sofa, not a 
Victorian settee. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The furniture) was a little stiff for the '90s," she said. "People are going 
for an eclectic look." 
</P>
<P>
 White's shop is one place to find it. It has brass figurines, velvet hats and 
purses, whimsical stuffed animals in lace and ruffs, reproduction lamps and 
more. Mainly, she said, it's the artwork -- sculpture, paintings, brocade and 
needlepoint -- that appeal to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 She sees the move as a return to the classics rather than a simple trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more of an emotional event than a shopping event," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Victorian theme has flourished, reproductions, rather than antiques, 
are making it easier to create a 19th-Century look. Lamps particularly are cast 
in antique styles, and traditional figurines are showing up in large numbers, 
especially angels and cherubs. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tottenham Court Ltd. in Ojai, owner Andrea Bloom said it's much easier to 
stock her stores than in the 1970s, when she began decorating with a Victorian 
theme, far ahead of her time. Until recently, she imported traditional 
tableware, boudoir accents and artwork from England, but American artists are 
now featured along with British. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of the look is a mixed blessing for Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to be so unique," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop has crystal, porcelain and silver wares, and many personal items, 
from reproduction jewelry to brocade credit-card cases. Also it has a plethora 
of fanciful pillows, many with handwrought verses the Victorians never saw. 
"You can't be too rich or too thin" and "Eat, drink and remarry" are among 
waggish inscriptions offered. 
</P>
<P>
 People are indeed willing to polish silver and wash and iron lace 
handkerchiefs these days, Bloom said. They are even observing formal tea time 
in the shop's renowned tea room. 
</P>
<P>
 Scones, quiche and tea sandwiches used to be mainly lunch fare here, but now 
the biggest seller is afternoon tea, the owner said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, people seem to be capturing the grace of times gone by and avoiding 
the excess. Not often seen are stuffed birds in glass domes or piano drapes or 
spittoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Throwback clothing seems to stick with lace-up boots and plumed hats, perhaps 
pierced with jeweled hatpins. No muffs and bustles. No fans flutter in feminine 
artifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not a little fringe on lampshades, a few hearts and flowers in our lives? 
</P>
<P>
 Our grandmothers knew how to put the finish on life. We can all learn 
something from those kinder, gentler times.

JAUNTS; CONEJO PARK DISTRICT FOLLOWS A 'RING OF GREEN' TO FUNDING; THE NEARLY 
10-MILE HIKE TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE OUTDOOR PROGRAM OFFERS OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW 
ALL THE LOS ROBLES TRAIL. IT WILL BE GUIDED BY NATURALISTS. 
</P>

<P>
 If you've hiked only chunks of the long, meandering Los Robles Trail in 
Thousand Oaks, here's a chance to trek it from one end to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The Outdoor Advisory Council to the Conejo Recreation and Park District is 
organizing an 9.8-mile mega-hike on the trail Saturday beginning at 9 a.m. at 
Triunfo Canyon Community Park in the east end of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're the solitary type, take note: The group is prepared for a crowd of 
up to 200 people signing on for the special hike. It's a fund-raiser for the 
district's outdoor program, so it isn't free. The cost is $15. 
</P>
<P>
 For that, hikers get seven district naturalists to point out sights along the 
way, lunch at the end, and a bus ride back to the start. The whole affair will 
wrap up by 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, they'll get some striking views as the trail winds its way 
through Thousands Oaks along the western slope of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
The hike is called the "Ring of Green," a reference to the city's hope of one 
day ringing Thousand Oaks with a system of linking trails. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will assemble at the west end of Triunfo Canyon Community Park where 
the Los Robles trail head is located, near the mouth of the canyon. But it 
won't be a mob scene on the trail. Hikers will divide into groups, each 
assigned to a naturalist. Some will move along faster than others, but everyone 
should be finished by 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagging along with a naturalist will open your eyes. They point out sights 
that most people would overlook, like the yerba mansa plant the Chumash Indians 
used for medicinal needs or the tufts of the brown amole plant they used to 
make soap. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Myers, with the district's outdoor unit, calls the route moderate to 
difficult. The trail is wide and well-groomed, but there are switchbacks. 
Participants will be supplied with trail maps. 
</P>
<P>
 As the trail starts out, it takes you near some oak groves and one 
magnificently sprawling Valley Oak. As it climbs, you'll find yourself in 
dusty, brown, chaparral country. But if you look for them, there are fall 
bloomers along the trail: the tiny purple daisy-like fleabane and the red 
California fuchsia. 
</P>
<P>
 As you climb, you can look eastward and see the silvery waters of Westlake, 
and later Lake Sherwood and Hidden Valley. Farther along, you'll see the city 
of Thousand Oaks sprawled below. The halfway marker is approximately at the 
Moorpark Road trail head, near the Arts Council Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The route will take you across ground ravaged by the wildfires nearly a year 
ago. But the area has re-vegetated quickly and evidence of the fires is fast 
disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The steepest part of the trail is a series of switchbacks up Rasnow Peak that 
tops out at an elevation of about 1,500 feet. From there you can see the ocean, 
and on a good day, Anacapa Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike winds up on West Potrero Road, a half-mile east of Wendy Drive, at 
the Deer Ridge trail head. There, hikers will take a bus ride back to Triunfo 
Canyon Community Park and be treated to a tri-tip lunch (vegetarian fare also 
available). Details

THEATER REVIEW; 'HEIRESS' A DRAMA RICH IN FAMILY CONFLICT; ADAPTED FROM HENRY 
JAMES' 'WASHINGTON SQUARE,' THE STORY DESCRIBES THE TENSION BETWEEN A DOCTOR, 
HIS ADORING DAUGHTER AND HER FORTUNE-HUNTING SUITOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You might not associate the leisurely, carefully shaded 19th-Century prose of 
Henry James with electrifying drama -- unless you happen to catch Ensemble 
Theatre's masterful revival of "The Heiress," that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted in 1947 by Ruth and Augustus Goetz from James' novel "Washington 
Square," the play proves eloquent and riveting in its depiction of a young 
woman's evolving independence as painful self-knowledge is foisted on her by a 
cold-hearted father and a self-centered suitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Insight doesn't come easily to Catherine Sloper (Karyl Lynn Burns), the naive 
daughter of a wealthy doctor in the rigidly paternalistic New York society of 
the 1850s. Possessed of neither glamorous beauty nor a sparkling personality, 
Catherine's prospects rest entirely on the large fortune she stands to inherit. 
</P>
<P>
 This fact has not escaped the protective eye of her father (William Lucking) 
or the admiring gaze of the penniless, good-looking charmer (Ben Bottoms) who 
begins courting her. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipe for tragedy is inexorable as these three accomplished performances 
hone the triangle's razor points of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns succeeds admirably at the formidable task of making Catherine a 
sympathetic heroine without violating James' concept of a hopeless maladroit. 
Not an inherently dim bulb, Catherine's latent capabilities and wit are evident 
in private, but they're overwhelmed by her awe of her father's stature and 
emotional detachment. Constantly tongue-tied and tripping over herself in her 
efforts to please him, she's quite endearing in her awkwardness. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine's transformation after her father's brutally honest assessment of 
her fiancee's motives is astonishing: If ever a human heart folded shut before 
our eyes, it's here in this portrayal. The emergence of a clear-sighted realist 
comes with the terrible price she pays to obtain that vision. 
</P>
<P>
 As Catherine's father, Lucking uses the slightest inflections and gestures to 
throw open windows to a repressed but anguished soul. A widower slavishly 
devoted to the idealized memory of his dead wife, Doctor Sloper can barely 
contain his contempt for the daughter who failed to live up to his standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in his own way he tries to do right by Catherine. His power to love may 
have withered away, but his judgment has not, and he sees all too clearly that 
young Morris Townsend is a fortune hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottoms reveals the dazzling, enigmatic Morris in carefully doled-out stages. 
By turns worldly, passionate and cruelly acquisitive, we marvel at how easily 
he's able to seduce Catherine and taunt the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the brief interval before the final scene, he seems literally to age the 
requisite years, and his mounting desperation is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 Impeccable period staging (including the elegant set by director Robert 
Grande-Weiss and original costumes by Barbara Lackner) doesn't obscure the 
timeless struggle in this story of a woman who must learn to survive without 
illusions. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "The Heiress." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Through Nov. 20, Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 2 
p.m.

MUSIC; ONE REASON TO REACH FOR THE SKA; SKANKIN' PICKLE IS A BUSY PRACTITIONER 
OF A DANCE-HAPPY GENRE THAT HAS TAKEN ROOT IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT SEEMS TO BE

 Skankin' Pickle, six road dogs out of the Bay Area in a van, will be stopping 
by the Underground in Santa Barbara to headline tonight's ska fest. Expect a 
whole lotta skankin' -- that's kinder, gentler dancing that attracts 
considerably more females and fewer elbows. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's first album, "Skafunkrastapunk," should provide more than enough 
clues as to what they're all about. That 1991 release has sold 15,000 copies so 
far, while the second album has sold 13,000. But the new one, "Sing Along With 
Skankin' Pickle" has already sold more than 10,000 copies since its release in 
September and can be heard on over 200 radio stations. All are available on 
their own Dill Records label. 
</P>

 Ever since the British introduced ska music to the world about 15 years ago 
with bands such as the Specials, the Selector, the English Beat and Madness, 
the genre has especially taken root in the Golden State. The Untouchables and 
Fishbone were pioneering California ska bands. Locally, the Ska Daddyz and the 
Upbeat have kept alive that dance-crazy beat with that happening horn section. 
Judging by the success of the Pickle people, ska seems to be getting bigger and 
sweatier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pickle party includes Mike Park (vocals and sax), Chuck Phelps (drums), 
Lars Nylander (trombone and vocals), Lynette Knackstedt (guitar and vocals), 
Gerry Lundquist (trombone) and Ian Miller (bass). The guitarist discussed the 
Pickle's progress during a recent phoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the band really play 267 gigs last year? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, 267 dates seems pretty accurate, but that's the only way to get our 
music out there. We try and be consistent -- we're on the road all year around. 
We're doing something we really want to do. So far, we've had pretty good 
response with the new one -- it's in the 50s on the CMJ Radio Top 150 chart, 
plus it's getting lots of radio play. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the critics right once, are you guys just like Fishbone? 
</P>
<P>
 I would say it's like ska music, ska punk, or something like that with some 
zany stage antics. There's some funk, too, but not old-school funk, but with a 
harder edge. We usually get compared a lot to Fishbone because we pretty much 
just go crazy with a lot of crazy antics on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you get for joining the Skankin' Pickle fan club? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not too sure, Mike gets all the mail. But we put out newsletters, and we 
keep our prices low for our merchandise. We've made three tours so far all the 
way to the East Coast. We have fans everywhere. We drew 800 in Denver recently, 
and we usually get two or three hundred people anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's to blame for all this? 
</P>
<P>
 We started the band about five years ago when we were all students at DeAnza 
Junior College. Basically, we got together because we all knew Mike. Two days 
later we played a gig in San Jose and actually got paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's to blame for the funny name? 
</P>
<P>
 Mike was just sitting in class one day, doodling, putting legs on all sorts of 
odd things. Then he drew legs on a pickle, and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
 The band prefers all-ages shows? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yeah, always. For the most part, it seems stupid to put an age limit on 
live music. Underage kids are more responsive to the music, and they're never 
shy when it comes to dancing. Music should be for all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the people skank or slam? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a little bit of both sometimes, but it can be a problem. If the kids get 
too rambunctious, sometimes we'll make the next song a little mellower. Punk is 
always angry, and everybody seems pissed off. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the plan? 
</P>
<P>
 If a good offer comes along, I'm sure we'd talk about it. Right now, we're 
into building up our label. We just signed a band from Hawaii, the Tantra 
Monsters. We were brought over to Hawaii a few times, played with them a few 
times, and just became friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Why go see your band? 
</P>
<P>
 You should come and see us if you want to have a good time and not worry about 
stuff. We have songs about serious stuff, but with a humorous edge. We're not 
depressing, and you can skank around and lose some weight. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; A GENUINE, DOWN-TO-EARTH DINER; SANTA PAULA'S CHILI HUT HAS 
FOOD, SERVICE AND RED NAUGAHYDE BOOTHS THAT PROBABLY HAVEN'T CHANGED MUCH OVER 
THE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GOLDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've ever read the Ernest Hemingway short story called "The Killers," 
you'll recall that it's about a couple of hoods who walk into a lunchroom in a 
small Midwestern town, tie up the cook, counterman and the one customer, put 
them in the kitchen, then sit around drinking coffee and waiting for their 
victim, who is a regular at the joint. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemingway describes a real place, not like one of those recent vintage 
bring-back-the-'50s diners where the walls are sparkling white, the Naugahyde 
new, mini jukeboxes mark each table and everybody is smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 There aren't, at least in Southern California, many of the real thing left 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them -- the last of a dying breed -- is on Santa Paula's shaded main 
street. But even the Chili Hut isn't open during those late-night hours, so it 
falls short of setting the scene established in so much good fiction over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the sort of spot where most of the clientele seem to be regulars, where 
first names are tossed back and forth through the 50-seat room, and where the 
red Naugahyde on the booths is weathering and the counter is starting to show 
its age. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's not get into the sort of nostalgia for diners past where we suddenly 
remember the food being wonderful. Plentiful, yes. A good value, yes. 
Frequently pretty good, yes. But there were never words such as cuisine, 
gourmet, presentation and eclectic attached to the sort of food served at the 
Chili Hut, or at its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 You can almost forget, in spite of the restaurant's name, the word chili 
because only a couple of dishes even use the stuff, the chili size ($4.95) 
being one of them. The chili size is a pretty good one, even if the chili 
itself, loaded with beans, could use a little more zing. But the buns are 
fresh, the hamburger patty generous -- and the service always affable (and none 
of this, "Hi, I'm your waitress, Suzie" stuff here). 
</P>
<P>
 The Chili Hut has been around since World War II days, and Jim Hanks has run 
it for the last 10 years. I doubt that much has changed on its menu over the 
years -- except the prices. Excellent iced tea comes in large mugs, frequently 
refilled, and sandwiches such as the deluxe club ($5.45) seem so big they're 
hard to eat. One of the most popular items on the menu, the club is jammed with 
bacon, turkey, lettuce and tomato and a mayonnaise dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally popular is the French beef dip ($5.45), its beef tender and not 
overcooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost by definition, a diner makes a big deal of breakfast, and the Chili Hut 
is no exception. Lots of good, firm, crisp, chunky country fried potatoes, 
homemade biscuits and dishes like chorizo and eggs ($4.50) and that good ol' 
American standby, grilled ham and eggs ($4.95). 
</P>
<P>
 As the years go by and the real diners fade into the past, it gets harder to 
remember if the food was actually any good or if we just loved the price, 
quantity and nostalgia. They almost all boasted of homemade pies and pastries, 
and the Chili Hut does too. To this reviewer, everything out of the oven is 
just a little sweet, like the boysenberry pie ($2.25) and the cinnamon roll 
($1.45, big on size and even bigger on sugar). 
</P>
<P>
 The locals -- who sometimes have to wait at the door with the rest of us and 
wait for a table or a seat at the counter -- obviously love the place, and it 
really is a fun spot to eat hearty portions, get a good value and just plain 
enjoy a "real" diner. Details

 Chef Gael Lecolley of Ojai's Wheeler Hot Springs will host the second Chef 
A'Table Dinner, presented by the newly formed Central Coast Culinaire Chefs 
Assn., Wednesday beginning at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Lecolley will prepare a four-course meal featuring an appetizer of salmon 
tartar in a smoked salmon purse with cucumber salad and fresh dill sauce. That 
will be followed by sea bass baked in a fresh herb crust and served with 
grilled endive, tomato salsa, and beurre de champagne rose . 
</P>
<P>
 After a palate-cleansing cactus pear sorbet, Lecolley will serve the main 
course: medallions of beef tenderloin with a puree of celery root and sun-dried 
cherry brandy sauce. And for dessert, it will be an almond tuile with Kahlua 
sabayon and Tres Amigos de Chocolate (three chocolate truffles). 
</P>
<P>
 While Lecolley spends the evening in the kitchen, the other chefs in 
attendance will circulate from table to table to talk food and mingle with 
guests. Cost is $65 per person. Call 646-8131 or (800) 9-WHEELER. Wheeler is 
located at 16825 Maricopa Highway.

 Kmart in Moorpark has gotten into the holiday spirit by committing to donate 
20 food baskets to needy families in the area. Each basket will contain a 
turkey, potatoes, canned vegetables, bread, stuffing mix and a pumpkin pie. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks heading up the drive are looking for assistance to get more baskets 
out to the community. Those interested in helping can call Kathy Colton-Reed or 
the Good News Committee at 529-3555.

 For do-it-yourselfers, Mabel Chase, owner and head baker of Ventura's City 
Bakery, will show how to make sourdough bread without using commercial yeast 
during her cooking class Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be showing them how to make the starter (the ingredient that makes the 
bread rise) using the skin of organic grapes," Chase said. "You capture the 
yeast from the skins and blend it with flour and water." Then, Chase will teach 
the budding bakers to let the bread rise in a linen basket before baking. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase also plans to show how to make a loaf of five-grain bread by mixing in a 
piece of dough saved from the last batch baked. "It gives the bread a more 
interesting flavor," she said, "like an aged wine." 
</P>
<P>
 Class time is 3 p.m. Cost is $35, and class size is limited. Call 643-0861. 
City Bakery is located at 2358-C E. Main St.

PANEL RIPS MTA FOR NOT FIRING BUILDERS; SUBWAY: AGENCY CHIEF TELLS LEGISLATORS 
AT HEARING THAT DROPPING TUNNEL CONTRACTORS WOULD HAVE COST TOO MUCH MONEY AND 
TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 State legislators sharply criticized local transit officials Wednesday for 
their decision to stick with the firms building and supervising the troubled 
Los Angeles subway project, as new measurements show that surface sinkages in 
Hollywood have grown to 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 During a lively joint hearing of the Assembly and Senate transportation 
committees, Sen. Tom Hayden chided Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chief 
Executive Officer Franklin E. White for his treatment of the contractors.  
</P>
<P>
 White decided late last month not to terminate the contracts of either the 
tunneling contractor, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, or the MTA's construction management 
firm, Parsons-Dillingham. Instead, White plans to gradually phase out 
Parsons-Dillingham from its role on the next segment of subway construction and 
to more closely supervise the work of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to thank Mr. White for giving the greatest defense of 
rehabilitation as an approach to crime that I have heard this year," said 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica), referring to construction shortcomings and alleged 
violations of safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mess up," he said. "You get more money. You get better supervision. And 
you get back on the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin L. Kopp also questioned the 
MTA's decision to retain the two contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "When are we ever going to hold people accountable and say if mistakes are 
made, that's it?" asked Kopp (I-San Francisco), who took the unusual step of 
swearing in witnesses. "Why don't you yank them? Get rid of them. . . . I 
disagree with keeping on the job firms that haven't cut it." 
</P>
<P>
 White defended his decision to retain the firms, saying it would prevent any 
increased costs and delays for the subway project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it would make us feel better if the contractor and construction 
manager were replaced," White said, ". . . our highest priority must be to 
complete these tunnels in a professional manner as expeditiously as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Adams, the MTA's acting chief of construction, has advised White that 
it would be too expensive to terminate the contractors and hire new firms to 
complete the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made great changes in the way we're going to do business," Adams 
testified. "For us to take a vengeful attitude, I think is a disservice to the 
taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp mocked Adams' statement. " Vengeful ?" Kopp said, noting the millions of 
dollars of extra costs at stake for taxpayers. "It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz said the decision to 
retain one or both firms was "short-term wise, long-term foolish." 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody has got to be taught a lesson," said Katz (D-Sylmar). "It's worth it 
for the long-term gain in restoring public confidence."  
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was prompted by the Federal Transit Administration's announcement 
Oct. 5 that it was withholding $1.6 billion for future subway construction 
until the MTA proves it can competently manage the project. The hearing was 
held in Hollywood, just a few blocks from where tunneling has been stopped 
since Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams confirmed in an interview that the worst sinkage, at the intersection of 
Hollywood Boulevard and Hudson Avenue, has increased to 10 inches, compared to 
nine inches two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 White last week submitted to the federal government a plan designed to prevent 
the kinds of problems that have plagued the construction. The MTA proposes, 
among other things, to take greater direct responsibility for quality control 
and safety inspections and to implement new construction procedures, such as 
using metal struts -- not wooden wedges -- for the tunnel bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent engineering firm retained by the MTA reported Oct. 18 that the 
substitution of the wooden wedges for the metal struts was "inappropriate." 
Earlier studies concluded that failure of the wooden wedges contributed to the 
sinkages in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the firm building the tunnels along Hollywood Boulevard and 
Vermont Avenue defended the work and blamed the problems on the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking publicly for the first time, John F. Shea, head of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, 
said the partnership was concerned as of late July when project officials 
became aware that sinkages of four inches had occurred. Shea and his cousin, 
Peter Shea, said they recommended that soil-stabilizing grouting be performed 
to prevent worse sinking. Peter Shea said project officials, whom he did not 
identify, rejected the suggestions to perform the grouting, saying they would 
be too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I became aware of the four-inch subsidence . . . I brought up the 
subject of chemical grouting and compaction grouting," Peter Shea said. 
"However, the attitude of the construction manager (Parsons-Dillingham) was 
such that they . . . considered compaction grouting and chemical grouting as 
too costly." 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by committee members, the Sheas said they had been unable to 
locate any memo or document verifying their earlier suggestion.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked later during the hearing about the matter, Chris Dixon, an executive 
with Parsons-Dillingham who has helped oversee the work, said he could not 
remember whether the Sheas had suggested performing chemical or compaction 
grouting. 
</P>
<P>
 "What major project of this size has not had problems?" John Shea told the 
committee. He said he believes that the ground sinkages in Hollywood were 
caused by the "highly unusual loose soil conditions," not because of the wood 
wedges. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapered, 32-inch-long wedges -- one of which was on display at the hearing 
-- have become for some a focal point of the problems. Substitution of the 
wedges was approved in 1992 by Parsons-Dillingham and the project's chief 
design engineer, employed by the firm of Parsons Brinckerhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing also focused on whether the MTA, created by the state Legislature, 
has the financial capacity to build the rail projects without siphoning money 
from a bus system that largely serves the poorest residents of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come to question whether the problems that MTA is having reflect 
merely growth pains of a fledgling agency or whether we have given birth to 
some kind of fiscal Frankenstein," Hayden said.

 Bridge of sizes: Several months ago, a conceptual artist named Nicolino 
visited L.A. on a whistle-stop train tour to pick up undergarments for a 
project called "Bras Across Grand Canyon." He viewed the 10,000-brassiere span 
as a statement on "breast obsession in our culture," and we were gratified that 
he gave L.A. a chance to contribute some of the bridge materials. 
</P>
<P>
 We know you're dying to find out where the project is now. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not at the Grand Canyon, which has banned the bras. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent Boyd Evison wrote Nicolino that he had received numerous 
letters from the general public, "which all have opposed the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, Nicolino wrote back to Evison to clear up some misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the artist said it was not true that he had talked of stretching the 
bras over 10 miles of canyon, as an article in an Arizona magazine said. "My 
engineering sketch limits the span to one mile or less," Nicolino declared. 
And, second, the rumor that he proposed "to use hot-air balloons to install" 
the chain of bras was "pure fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Grand Canyon, however, is showing no sign of budging from its position. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, how about "Bras Across the L.A. River?" 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about negative campaigning: It seemed inevitable that one of the 
mysterious "We Suck Less" billboards around town would be injected into a 
political race. And it happened in the City of Industry. In case you're 
wondering, a spokesman for Assembly incumbent Paul Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) 
said: "We didn't buy that billboard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Careful, yuppies: Russell Stone of L.A. writes that he noticed a pickup truck 
with two bumper stickers: "Die yuppie scum" and "Licensed hot tub installer." 
</P>
<P>
 Comments Stone: "Looks like he is trying to kill off his business." 
</P>
<P>
 Not literally, we hope. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Professional pride: The rumors that alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss has 
the names of some rich and powerful folks in a little black book reminds us of 
an early-century incident mentioned in "Lawyers of Los Angeles," by W. W. 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, when Superior Court Judge Charles Monroe and Mrs. Monroe "were 
walking down the street," Robinson wrote, "they passed a highly painted woman 
who spoke to the judge. Mrs. Monroe, with her Quaker upbringing, asked, 'A 
friend of thine?' 'Professionally,' her husband answered, to which she replied: 
'Hers or thine?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trick or treat, indeed: By the way, let the record show that the Fleiss trial 
began on Halloween. miscelLAny A plaque honoring Laurel & Hardy's 1932 movie, 
"The Music Box," will be unveiled Saturday at 11 a.m. at the base of the famous 
stairway in the film -- between 923 and 935 Vendome St. in Silver Lake. A 
plaque is fine, but we'd like to see an annual event there commemorating the 
key scene in the movie -- a "Laurel & Hardy Piano-Lugging Race Up the Stairs."

AL MARTINEZ: NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since I became a journalist I have been held responsible for the actions 
of the newspaper that employed me. 
</P>
<P>
 This was never truer than in 1958 when Bill Knowland, then publisher of the 
Oakland Tribune, was running for governor against Pat Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tribune, predictably, endorsed Knowland for the office, a decision that 
outraged just about everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know who they expected the paper to endorse, but all of my liberal 
friends were suddenly not speaking to me because I worked for an institution 
whose owner, an archconservative, had endorsed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 I argued that the man had simply validated his own ego. Why would he put his 
money in Pat Brown's bank account? And, anyhow, I didn't have a thing to do 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the endorsement meant little more than a guy jumping up and 
down shouting "Choose me!" prior to a kids' baseball game. Brown proved the 
point by dumping Knowland into political oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
 I came to realize that, whether I had anything to do with it or not, anyone 
who worked for a newspaper would be blamed for the newspaper's judgments, 
however questionable they might seem. 
</P>
<P>
 That was applied on a broader scale as television emerged on the scene and we 
became lumped together as the mass media. There were more of us, but it still 
didn't let us individually off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Goldwater railed against us as sensation-seekers and Spiro Agnew jeered 
us as nattering nabobs of negativism, both of which caused the silent majority 
to rise as one and stone us with invective. Better they should have stayed 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once that passed, however, things got pretty good. There have been occasional 
bursts of criticism toward the media, during which I've taken heat as part of 
the seething mass, but nothing on an individual scale. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 It began early Sunday morning. I was still in bed when the telephone rang and 
a voice edged with anguish said, "What in God's name have you done?" 
</P>
<P>
 I turned to my wife Cinelli and said, "We do anything last night I ought to be 
ashamed of?" 
</P>
<P>
 Without rolling over, she muttered, "Unfortunately, no." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is this," I said into the phone, "and what are you talking about?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Jenkins," he said, "and I'm talking about your stupid endorsement." 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to read passages from our editorial endorsing Pete Wilson for 
governor. It went kind of like, "You're a sweetheart, Kathy Brown, but, well, 
Pete's Pete and we gotta go with him." Only it took several hundred words to 
say it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not responsible for newspaper endorsements," I said. "I don't even know 
who makes them. It's somebody on another floor, and I am never asked to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you one thing," Jenkins said, "if I were one of you brown-skinned 
people, I'd be pretty p.o.'d." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early for us brown-skinned people to be p.o.'d," I said. "I'll call 
you after lunch in a rage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins couldn't understand how a newspaper that hated Proposition 187, the 
anti-immigrant measure, could endorse a man who, as patron saint of white-bread 
California, had come out in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
 I told him it was just one of those Great Mysteries of Life, like unexplained 
lights in the sky, but that wasn't good enough for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 My phone rang constantly. Liberal friends condemned me, moderates were stunned 
and conservatives cheered. I hate happy conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsement was on radio and television all day, prompting my sister Emily 
to telephone from Oakland, demanding to know how I could commit such an act 
against God. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do it," I said, "and it wasn't against God, it was against, well, 
his friends." 
</P>
<P>
 At a party Sunday night I was about as popular as a pimple on the nose. Even 
the hostess, who is usually unfailingly gracious, kissed my wife on the cheek 
at the door and greeted me by saying, "Damn you." 
</P>
<P>
 My life has been hell ever since, and while I know it will do little good, I 
will explain again that no one on The Other Floor calls and says, "Whadda ya 
think, Al?" before deciding on an endorsement . . . or much of anything else.

UNDERLINING A MONUMENTAL CIA SNAFU; SENATE REPORT ON AMES CASE REINFORCES THE 
DEMANDS FOR REFORM IN THE AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate Intelligence Committee report on the CIA's mishandling of the 
Aldrich H. Ames spy case -- beginning with its long, chummy tolerance of an 
employee of supreme mediocrity and extending through its bumbling efforts to 
identify the spy in its ranks -- doesn't add a lot to what's known about this 
scandal. However, it does compellingly sharpen the focus on the many blunders 
within the agency that allowed Ames to freely spy for Moscow for nearly nine 
years. Ames' betrayals led to the deaths of at least 10 intelligence sources, 
compromised more than 100 intelligence operations and gave the Russians access 
to thousands of pages of classified U.S. documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous report speaks of an internal culture that all but ignored the 
"serious personal and professional misconduct" of its employees. It was an 
agency in which security was "lax and ineffective." And it was an agency 
unwilling to candidly face the extent of the "catastrophic blow" Ames had dealt 
it.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee found "seriously inadequate" the response of R. James Woolsey, 
the director of Central Intelligence, to the Ames case. Woolsey, of course, 
inherited the worst espionage case in the CIA's history and so can't be blamed 
for what went before. Where he is severely faulted is in not moving more 
severely against some of the 23 current and former officials the CIA's own 
inspector general held accountable for failing to detect what Ames was doing. 
Probably never in the modern history of spying has a betrayer done more that 
should have called attention to himself than Ames. Besides being a falling-down 
drunk and a philanderer, Ames ostentatiously spent much of the more than $2 
million his Moscow masters paid for his services. Yet for a long time no one at 
the CIA seemed to care enough to act on these warning signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's report calls for tightening the agency's internal security 
procedures. Among other things it says poor performers should be dismissed. 
That might seem to be basic management. One of the startling revelations of 
this case was the ease with which a clearly identifiable mediocrity not only 
stayed on the payroll but kept getting promoted. Ames was too inept to do a 
decent job in any of the positions he held. He was skilled enough, however, to 
make fools of his superiors for years on end. Can the CIA now be trusted to 
clean up its own internal mess? It has very little time left to try to show it 
can. If it fails, look for Congress to begin swinging its own mop, with a 
vengeance and rightly so.

TOBACCO INDUSTRY AD FOR PROP. 188 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hurray for school Vice Principal Nancy Frick for spotlighting the fraud of 
Prop. 188, which is probably the most deceptive measure ever on the California 
ballot ("Educator Recants Her Ads Backing Measure," Oct. 28). Frick's turnabout 
shows the trickery of Prop. 188, which pretends to be a tough tobacco control 
measure. She was misled to do a pro-Prop. 188 TV ad but quickly recanted after 
realizing it was a sham. We hope California voters will also see through Prop. 
188, which tobacco giant Philip Morris has bankrolled with $5 million. Would we 
expect these nicotine dealers to want reasonable curbs on smoking and cigarette 
vending machines? Not any more than we would trust a fox to design our 
henhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Please vote no on Prop. 188.

 * The tobacco industry never ceases to amaze us ("Tobacco Industry Drops Low 
Profile and Airs TV Ad," Oct. 26). The industry's pro-Prop. 188 television ad 
describes the initiative as the "best way to keep cigarettes away from kids." 
This comes just two weeks after the same tobacco industry threatened to sue 
television stations in the state for running a state Department of Health 
Services ad aimed at keeping cigarettes out of the hands of children and 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry supports Prop. 188 for one simple reason -- it 
eviscerates AB 13 (Terry B. Friedman, D-Brentwood), which will ban smoking in 
most indoor workplaces as of Jan. 1. Worse yet, Prop. 188 will wipe out some 
300 local smoking ordinances and forever prevent cities from passing tough new 
smoking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry spent over $2.5 million lobbying to defeat AB 13 and 
other smoking-related measures and lost. Now, it's spending over $18 million to 
erase AB 13 and every local smoking ban from the books. The real question Prop. 
188 puts before the voters is this: "Who do you want to write your laws -- you 
and your local city council or the tobacco industry?"

 * I heartily concur with A. David Rossin (letter, Oct. 26). I would gladly 
vote "to get rid of the law that allows (and invites) making law by 
referendum." As a voter I'm tired of doing the job that elected officials of 
California are supposed to do. I haven't got the time to research these 
initiatives to make an informed decision. I'm beginning to think that these 
prospective laws are not populist, grass-roots ideas, but rather the ideas of 
well-organized and well-endowed special-interest groups. I would much rather 
vote for the people who will make the laws, not for the laws themselves.

ART; DRAWING POWER; WHEN MENTAL ILLNESS SHORTENED NIJINSKY'S FABLED CAREER, HE 
TURNED TO ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Zan Dubin covers art for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When mental illness began to bring a premature end to Vaslav Nijinsky's career 
early this century, the renowned ballet dancer turned to visual art for 
self-expression. Unfortunately, until recently his works were dismissed as the 
idle, worthless doodlings of a madman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drawings are psychopathic charts," wrote American painter Marsden Hartley 
in the early 1940s, "and that is all that can be said of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nijinsky, a dance legend known for unprecedented technical brilliance, had no 
visual art training. He was diagnosed as schizophrenic some 20 years before 
Hartley's critique, and he spent three decades moving in and out of psychiatric 
hospitals before dying in 1950 at age 69. 
</P>
<P>
 None of which means the dancer's artwork is anything less than profoundly 
powerful, full of beauty and thematic, well-thought-out imagery -- not random 
scribblings. So assert organizers of "Vaslav Nijinsky: Art of the World's 
Greatest Dancer," opening Monday at Irvine's Severin Wunderman Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that Nijinsky's work will be appreciated today in a way that he 
could never have been appreciated in his lifetime," said William Emboden, the 
museum's research director. 
</P>
<P>
 "People often assume that if a person is judged to be mentally unstable or 
psychotic, you can't take their art too seriously. But I think that assumption 
is being progressively dispelled," said Emboden, citing major recent 
exhibitions of so-called outsider art, work by mentally ill or self-taught 
artists who operate outside of the professional art world. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine exhibition was organized by Emboden and the museum's executive 
director, Tony Clark, who believes it is the first comprehensive showing of 
Nijinsky's works on paper. It contains more than 75 pieces in media ranging 
from inks to colored chalks, plus several paintings, marquee posters and 
sculptures of Nijinsky by such contemporaries as artist and writer Jean 
Cocteau, to whose works the museum is dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also includes photographs of the dancer on and off stage, purple 
petals from his famous "Le Spectre de la Rose" costume and other costumes, 
ballet slippers, elaborate costume designs by Leon Bakst, and such personal 
effects as his birth and death certificates, letters, hairbrushes and a 
dressing-room tablecloth. 
</P>
<P>
 These items are part of the 200-piece Vaslav and Romola Nijinsky Foundation 
collection, now on permanent loan to the museum (Romola was the dancer's late 
wife). The Irvine museum will make the collection available to scholars and 
hopes to tour the exhibit.  
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Nijinsky, the couple's youngest daughter, established the foundation in 
1991 and made the loan recently, convinced that a museum focusing on Cocteau 
would make a worthy home. Cocteau was a close friend of Nijinsky's and wrote 
the scenario for "Le Train Bleu," a ballet Nijinsky danced.  
</P>
<P>
 "I must confess (that) originally I wanted to keep it in Phoenix," said Tamara 
Nijinsky, 74, in a recent phone interview from her home there. "But I visited 
the museum and met Tony Clark, and realized that they will care for the 
collection as if it contained their own belongings. They have their hearts in 
what they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Nijinsky, born in Russia of Polish lineage, achieved widespread celebrity with 
Ballets Russes. The touring troupe was directed by famed impresario Sergei 
Diaghilev, who brought Russian art, music and dance to Western Europe and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 While Nijinsky's ballets are now considered to have foreshadowed pivotal 
developments of avant garde choreography, they were rejected during his time. 
The 1913 Paris premiere of "Le Sacre du Printemps," set to Igor Stravinsky's 
equally anti-classical yet seminal score, still stands as ballet's grandest 
fracas, replete with hissing, catcalls, fistfights and tiaras atilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the elements of a scandal were present," Cocteau wrote. "The smart 
audience in tails and tulle, diamonds and ospreys, was interspersed with the 
suits and bandeaux of the aesthetic crowd. The latter would applaud novelty 
simply to show their contempt for the people in the boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after this, Nijinsky's inner and outer life began to deteriorate. When he 
married fellow Ballets Russes dancer Romola de Pulszky, Diaghilev, who had been 
his lover as well as his mentor, fired him. Later, forced internment in Hungary 
during World War I was followed by years moving in and out of sanitariums. 
</P>
<P>
 Most works in the Severin Wunderman show date between 1916 and 1919, the year 
schizophrenia was diagnosed but long after symptoms of mental instability 
appeared, Emboden said during a recent phone interview. (Despite the diagnosis, 
some still dispute the exact nature of Nijinsky's problem.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nijinsky was 29 when he gave his last public performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mental illness ran through his family, and when Vaslav was a young boy, he 
had some neurological disorders," Emboden said. "I think as early as his first 
ballet creation he was evidencing things that set him apart from another 
person. But I don't know when it becomes a malady and disadvantageous. If he 
had not had the madness, we would not have had the genius of Nijinsky." 
</P>
<P>
 The dancer's visual art and his choreography share certain aesthetic 
principals, Emboden continued, one of which was "total simplicity." 
</P>
<P>
 For his 1913 ballet "Jeux" ("Games"), Nijinsky rejected the then-popular 
exotic Orientalism, telling his sister Bronislava Nijinska, also a Ballets 
Russes dancer, "that he wanted nothing but a barren stage that would represent 
a tennis court." 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'You can't do this, you have to have decor,' " Emboden explained. 
But Nijinsky insisted, "No, let's give the people utter simplicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Several drawings on view reflect this inclination, Emboden said. "There's a 
simplification of the palette -- reds, blacks, occasionally a bit of orange or 
blue -- and bold, powerful strokes juxtaposed with a few other, equally bold 
strokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the "massive moving spirals" and circular group patterns of 
Nijinsky's "Sacre du Printemps" choreography would later reappear over and over 
in two-dimensional form. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1917, Nijinsky "was drawing constantly with almost every motif based upon 
the circle," and each facial feature in the portraits on view is composed of 
amalgamations of circles, according to Emboden. He explained that Nijinsky, an 
avid reader of Tolstoy, adopted the author's belief that "life was a spiral." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the book "Nijinsky" (Simon & Shuster Inc.) written in 1934 by 
Romola Nijinsky, the dancer told his wife in 1917 that "the circle is the 
complete, the perfect movement. Everything is based on it -- life, art." 
</P>
<P>
 Related serial images on view offer evidence that Nijinsky used a calculated 
rather than haphazard approach to his art, Emboden said. One series is based on 
the human eye, another contains black and red ink washes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nijinsky was never trying to represent anything other than his soul," Emboden 
said.

POP/COUNTRY; PAYING DIVIDENDS; A 'SEMINOLE' MOMENT PUTS JOHN ANDERSON'S 
CYCLICAL CAREER ON AN UPWARD SWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a blue chip stock, John Anderson has managed to ride out cyclical changes 
in the country music business -- sometimes up, sometimes down -- over the past 
15 years, but always on the board and paying dividends to fans who have 
invested in his records and shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in the central Florida town of Apopka, he took his first musical steps 
playing rock 'n' roll inspired by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. But by 
age 17 he had headed to Nashville, Tenn., his ear captured by the music of Hank 
Williams and Jimmie Rodgers, the Delmore Brothers, Merle Haggard and George 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 He broke through in the early '80s with hits both traditional-sounding ("Wild 
and Blue") and aggressively rocking ("Swingin'," "Black Sheep") -- early highs 
that were followed by a long plateau. While the hits subsided, he continued to 
make albums that reflected his wide-ranging tastes. His recorded repertoire has 
included songs by Chicago blues legend Willie Dixon and Bob Dylan as well as by 
Haggard; in turn, he is that rare mainstream contemporary country artist who 
has captured the ears of a hip alternative-rock band, England's Mekons having 
waltzed through a cover of "Wild and Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson soldiered on with the most distinctive voice of any country male 
singer under 40 (a claim he can continue to make until he hits 40 on Dec. 13) 
with its rich, cottony textures and natural, unaffected and idiosyncratic 
colorations. 
</P>
<P>
 Persistence paid off in 1992 when the album "Seminole Wind" returned him to 
commercial prominence. In an era of cowboy-hatted Adonises, the huskily built, 
blond-maned, low-key Anderson relied on musical strengths rather than 
image-retailing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the title track of "Seminole Wind," a song he wrote about the environmental 
devastation of his home state's rivers and Everglades swampland, he came up 
with one of the finest mainstream country songs of the '90s, a stirring, tragic 
anthem haunted by historical consciousness and powered by driving, inexorable 
rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 His new album, "Country 'Til I Die," may not have anything to match that peak 
(although the love-miseries account "Bend It Until It Breaks" harks back to the 
anthemic cast of "Seminole Wind"), but it's a fairly solid representation of 
Anderson's talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Lighthearted rockin'-country songs dominate, including a cover of the Georgia 
Satellites' hit "Keep Your Hands to Yourself" and a superfluous remake of his 
own "Swingin.' " Anderson's abundant warmth and intimacy allow him to sing 
sentimental ballads like "The Good" and "Mississippi Moon" without sounding 
calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best example of what separates him from the rest of country's 
younger generation comes on "Hillbilly With a Heartache," a duet with Tracy 
Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 The song is a foolishly jocular account of a hotheaded good ol' boy who rides 
around with a shotgun in his pickup and booze in his belly, nursing thoughts of 
getting even with the flame who dumped him for a city feller. A regular riot, 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Lawrence strains with so much earnest effort as he tries to strike a 
note of twangy insouciance, that one fears he'll turn himself into a hillbilly 
with a hernia. Anderson slips into that cottony, natural flow, the sound of a 
singer who should be able to ride out country's business cycles comfortably 
into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: John Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Monday, Nov. 7, at 7 and 10 p.m. Both shows are sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Crazy Horse Steak House, 1580 Brookhollow Drive, Santa Ana.

the north, go right on Grand Avenue, then take the first right, Brookhollow 
Drive; from the south, go left under the overpass, right on Grand and right on 
Brookhollow.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil Ochs 
</P>
<P>
 "I Ain't Marching Anymore" (1965) 
</P>
<P>
 Hannibal  
</P>
<P>
 "I Ain't Marching Anymore" is more than just a folk album. It's a vivid and 
moving sociopolitical document of America during the turbulent '60s. From the 
anthemic anti-war title track to the pro-civil rights "Talking Birmingham Jam," 
Phil Ochs' second album captures in stirring detail the emotions and issues 
that helped galvanize the American counterculture three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it helps to be on the same political page as the leftist Ochs. The 
writings of this military-school-student-turned-journalism-student-turned-Dylan 
disciple don't allow much room for fence-sitting. Ochs wasn't one to pull 
punches or mince words. In the biting "Draft Dodger Rag," he puts on the shoes 
of an 18-year-old trying to avoid conscription during the Vietnam War. This 
rabble-rousing song is the album's wittiest: 
</P>
<P>
 . . . got a ruptured spleen and I always carry a purse,  
</P>
<P>
 I got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat. My asthma's getting worse.  
</P>
<P>
 . . . Besides I ain't no fool I'm going to school and I'm working at a defense 
plant.  
</P>
<P>
 But the nearly six-minute "Here's to the State of Mississippi" is the album's 
shining moment. Catchy and topical, this angry response to the murder of three 
civil rights workers is a cutting indictment of the racist policies and 
attitudes found in the deep South at the time. "Mississippi," Ochs implores, 
"find yourself another country to be part of." 
</P>
<P>
 A simply tailored album featuring nothing more than Ochs' vocals and acoustic 
guitar, it reveals the 24-year-old idealist's remarkable gift for enlivening 
issue-oriented songs with a strong sense of drama and heartfelt conviction. But 
Ochs, though an integral part of the celebrated Greenwich Village folk scene of 
the early '60s, never did attain Dylan's level of notoriety. Traveling in 
Africa in 1973, he suffered severe vocal cord damage during a mysterious 
assault. Three years later his life came to a tragic end when he hanged himself 
at his sister's house. JON MATSUMOTO

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK

 Various Artists 
</P>
<P>
 "Out on the Rolling Sea: A Tribute to the Music of Joseph Spence & the Pinder 
Family" 
</P>
<P>
 Green Linnet  
</P>
<P>
 If you're unfamiliar with the music of Joseph Spence, a folk guitarist from 
the Bahamas who died 10 years ago, this tribute won't do much to advance your 
knowledge. Other than a discography, the compilers have decided to give little 
more information about this obscure figure than might fit on his tombstone. The 
tribute-payers involved don't get a say on what Spence meant to them, either. 
</P>
<P>
 A shame. Any musician who was a motivating force for sublime performances such 
as the peak ones here deserves a decent commentary, annotation and historical 
summary. About a third of the 19-track "Out on the Rolling Sea" (mainly the 
last third) is dross or routine. But the dozen best songs form an affecting 
body of work based on gospel and folk-blues styles and infused with a glowing 
spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD is indispensable for fans of Taj Mahal, the folk-blues traditionalist 
whose song "Blow Wind Blow" weaves the simplest materials into a moving amalgam 
of deep sorrow, noble aspiration and piercing beauty. It's a career highlight 
for an always-classy musician. Victoria Williams, aided by an accomplished 
backup band, offers a modern, original hymn, "Although the Lord Be High Above" 
that is both idiosyncratic and affecting as it embodies the progress of a 
troubled soul finding comfort in belief. Idiosyncratic isn't quite an adequate 
word for Van Dyke Parks' lurching orchestration of another hymn, "On the 
Rolling Sea When Jesus Speak to Me." It's equal parts pomp and humor, 
high-church swell and down-home gusto. Pianist Jim Dickinson (best known as the 
session player on the Rolling Stones' "Wild Horses') takes a street-level view 
of the same hymn, leading a loose, rollicking band through a celebratory New 
Orleans parade version. 
</P>
<P>
 David Lindley, known for his impish musical personality, gets serious on the 
bouzouki for a lustrous, stately yet light-footed reading of the instrumental 
air, "Afindrafindrao." Other prime picking performances come from David Grisman 
& Marc Silber, electric guitarist Michael Chapman and the duo of Henry Kaiser 
and Steve Kimock, who support a surprisingly credible blues vocal on "The Crow" 
by that hippie relic, Wavy Gravy.

DIANA JORDAN AND MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For comedy fans who like their humor with a woman's perspective, Diana Jordan 
returns her "Female, Fertile and Frustrated" to the Irvine Improv for two 
Mondays (Nov. 7 and 14). 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing and engaging comic takes male/female issues and filters them 
through her own female-friendly lenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my act is based in truth and reality," she recently told The Times. "I 
just twist it a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Such twists include: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The difference between a baby and a boyfriend is that you can leave a baby 
alone with the baby-sitter." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Men are different from women. Women put on just a dab of cologne to send a 
subtle message to a man. Men wear cologne like a sexual foghorn." 
</P>
<P>
 Other headliners in town include Brian Regan at the Irvine Improv through 
Sunday. Coming up are Jeff Jena, who opens a three-night run Tuesday at the 
same place, while Mack & Jamie start a two-week stint Wednesday at the Brea 
Improv.

COMEDY; TOMMY DAVIDSON: IN PERPETUAL MOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian Tommy Davidson describes himself as a lucky guy. Busy would be more 
accurate. The former "In Living Color" cast member has had no trouble filling 
his time since the show was canceled in May. 
</P>
<P>
 His current projects include developing a movie with Martin Lawrence called 
"Meter Maids," creating and starring in a pilot for Fox, working with an 
animation company on two ideas he has for the Fox Children's Network and 
preparing for his third Showtime special, a musical variety show he'll host and 
star in with Gregory Hines and the Ohio Players. 
</P>
<P>
 And amid it all, he's working more than ever on his stand-up act, which he 
brings to the Brea Improv on Friday through Sunday for his Orange County debut 
before embarking on a monthlong tour with fellow comic Chris Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is a far cry from his first taste of comedy in 1986, when he took the 
stage between acts at a topless bar in Washington, D.C., and two years later 
lost to a contestant dressed as a cucumber in a "Star Search" competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brea, fans should not expect to see his "In Living Color" characters. Rollo 
the washroom attendant, Sugar Ray Leonard and the bespectacled Spike Lee will 
stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Davidson offers a lively performance, which underscores the black 
perspective and includes stand-up, musical spoofs and audience participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evening is a whole lot of fun, with old stuff and new stuff," the L.A. 
resident said in a phone interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A fair portion of that fun comes from working off what the crowd gives him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's typical Tommy behavior," he explained. "I'm a creature of adaptation. 
I take advantage of the second and the moment. My comedy breathes; it's not 
really that predictable. I do have a linear style, but other than that, there's 
a lot of abstract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just go off on what I'm thinking. I'm not that topical. I like to talk 
about me and my experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson was born in Mississippi and raised in D.C., where he worked as a 
cook. His comedy career took off after he moved to L.A. in 1987, but he has 
long harbored other dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to want to be a singer and a musician for years, from 6 years old to 
today," said the entertainer, who can sing, play keyboards, bass and 
percussion. "I'm not really good, but in time I could be. I'm more of a singer 
than anything. But straight-ahead music is two or three years down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Even that might be pushing it. Besides his show biz activities, he also wants 
to travel more, to Africa, China ("beautiful, vast and ancient"), Tibet and 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's enough for now." 
</P>
<P>
 * Who: Tommy Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Friday, Nov. 4, at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; Saturday, Nov. 5, at 8 and 
10:30 p.m., and Sunday, Nov. 6, at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: The Brea Improv, 945 E. Birch St., Suite A, Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Take the Lambert Road exit from the Orange (57) Freeway and go 
west. Turn left onto State College Boulevard and right onto Birch Street. The 
Improv is on the right, in the Brea Marketplace, across from the Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $10 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 529-7878.

WANNA DANCE?: LINDA'S DOLL HUT: ROCKABILLY '50S STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND, Heidi Siegmund is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With '50s chic in vogue in the Southland, true samplings of Americana aren't 
that easy to find. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Linda's Doll Hut, a doll-sized rockabilly club on an unmodernized 
street corner in Anaheim, is such a find.Many of the patrons appear to have 
stepped out of a '50s car brochure. Clad in old-school Levi's that complement 
the venue's roadhouse feel, many of the women sport close-cropped bangs, while 
the men favor ducktails and work shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Jemison, the Doll Hut's 29-year-old owner, is the life of this 
75-capacity house, a former darts and billiards bar. A social worker turned 
club owner, Jemison books the bands, manages the door, runs the sound board, 
works the bar, plays pool (which is free at the Doll Hut) and even jumps on the 
dance floor when a song moves her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you can also catch Orange County punk bands performing at the Doll 
Hut, the current Thursday night house band, Russell Scott and the Red Hots, is 
one of the club's best attractions. Moving seamlessly between rockabilly and 
country, the three-piece band's haunting version of "Summertime" lingers long 
after you leave the club.  
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a Day-Glo Elvis poster pinned up behind the "stage," the decor 
primarily consists of band stickers slapped haphazardly on the club's 
wood-paneled walls. But two-thirds of the stickers are of local bands -- which 
also dominate the jukebox. Just further indications of the true heart of this 
venue. 
</P>
<P>

MEMORIES OF A TROUBLED FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tamara Nijinsky, 74, is Vaslav Nijinsky's youngest daughter and executive 
director of the Vaslav and Romola Nijinsky Foundation (named after her 
parents). The foundation's collection of his artwork will be exhibited at the 
Severin Wunderman Museum opening Sunday. (Kyra Nijinsky, 80, the dancer's other 
daughter, has been living in a convalescent hospital in Northern California for 
about four years, recovering from multiple strokes, according to Tony Clark, 
curator of the exhibit.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara never saw her father dance. She was born one year after his illness was 
diagnosed as schizophrenia in 1919 (although some dispute the exact nature of 
his mental illness). After that he danced little, and for the next 30 years was 
in and out of mental hospitals. Tamara Nijinsky lived with both parents in 
Paris for a while as a child, but, she says, financial hardship forced her 
mother to send her to live with her maternal grandmother in Budapest. She was 
30 when her father died in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent telephone interview from her Phoenix home, she recalled the few 
memories she has of him, and discussed related subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you remember from the years you lived with your father? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Basically, I remember that he was a very, very quiet person. I just 
remember him sitting in an armchair by the mantelpiece, although when we were 
together he seemed to be always smiling like a delighted little boy and he was 
happy to see me. There was an understanding smile, although we never talked 
with words. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: He literally never spoke to you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, no, he didn't talk when I was with him. In the later years, he might 
have said something to my mother, but I didn't understand because it was in 
Russian (Tamara, whose first language is Hungarian, spoke only a little 
Russian) or he was so quiet. During World War II (when she lived apart from her 
father) my fiance and I went to visit him, and he loved sweets. Unfortunately, 
I inherited that. And we took, I think, three or four pieces of pastry, and he 
opened up (the parcel) and he practically inhaled them, two or three, he ate 
them with so much delight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have a sense of how much dancing meant to him? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You and I, we come and go, and we take a breath and we do this and that, 
and we live this way. But for him, to express himself through dance was like 
breathing. It was as essential to his life and survival as breathing is to 
ours. When he got off the stage, he was like a vegetable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What motivated him to take up visual art? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think he felt he needed to express himself. You know, certain drawings 
were done at a time when he was not able to dance because of (his internment in 
Budapest as a Russian during World War I), so he had an extreme need to express 
himself somehow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your opinion of Peter Ostwald's 1991 book (Carol Publishing Group), 
"Vaslav Nijinsky: A Leap into Madness"? (Ostwald, a professor of psychiatry at 
UC San Francisco, was the first to study hospital records and medical archives 
to analyze Nijinsky's mental state.) 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's the best book ever written about my father, first because it is based 
on medical records, and because Ostwald went (to hospitals) in person and 
looked into the medical records. And, he wrote the book with so much empathy. I 
helped him a little bit too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did you discover from the book? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I am certain if my father was alive today (and had access to contemporary 
medical care), he could function with some medication and create choreography. 
Maybe he wouldn't have danced, but he would have choreographed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you cope with the sadness at your father's illness and mental 
decline? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I am convinced that, especially in the beginning of the sickness, he knew . 
. . that something was happening to him and he was struggling desperately not 
to become ill, so that's a sadness. But . . . I learned in life that there are 
things that happen that are beyond me and it doesn't do any good to cry about 
them. I can't change them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some believe that Romola Nijinsky didn't seek the best care possible for 
your father and believe that she sought to gain financially from his fame. 
Where do you stand on this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: She was a brilliant woman in her own right and you have to give her credit 
because she watched over Vaslav for 30 years after he became sick. She could 
have stuck him in a state asylum and said "forget it." People say she lived 
from the name of Nijinsky, but she supported him in the best circumstances 
possible. Maybe the means weren't always right, but the goal was. She was so 
dedicated sincerely to supporting him and after he died she survived 28 years 
and she traveled, she gave lectures, she made exhibitions (about him). To a 
certain extent, she kept his name alive. ZAN DUBIN

MUSEUM IS A COCTEAU SHRINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 10-year-old Severin Wunderman Museum in Irvine was founded by Severin 
Wunderman, creator and board chairman of the Severin Group, which manufactures 
and distributes Gucci timepieces worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgium-born Wunderman, 55, developed a fascination as a youth with 
seminal 20th-Century French artist, writer and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, to whom 
the museum is dedicated.Wunderman's Laguna Beach home (up for sale) is one of 
his five residences in the United States, Switzerland and France.  
</P>
<P>
 The museum, which shares the Severin Group's corporate headquarters, houses 
Wunderman's collection of hundreds of drawings, paintings, sculptures, 
tapestries and other pieces by or relating to Cocteau. Among those with whom 
Cocteau collaborated are such luminaries as Stravinsky, Picasso and Serge 
Diaghilev, whose Ballets Russes troupe starred Vaslav Nijinsky in the early 
part of the century.

DO IT!: NO BAIT NEEDED TO LURE PARTICIPANTS TO CAST THEIR LOT WITH FLY-FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a member of The Times Orange County 
Edition staff. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Selby has been fly-fishing since he was a "real tiny kid," growing up in 
the Midwest in the late '40s. He has moved around a bit since then, but, "All 
along, I never got away from fly-fishing." 
</P>
<P>
 He even practices it now, as an Orange County resident -- and what's more, 
he's been doing his best to spread an appreciation of the sport. Coastal 
Southern California would hardly seem a mecca for fly-fishing, which conjures 
images of Zen-like serenity along isolated mountain streams, but Selby says the 
style adapts well to salt water.

 "As a matter of fact, I was teased a lot when I first came here and started 
saltwater fishing with my fly rod," Selby said, adding that people would be 
surprised at what can be caught with a fly rod. 
</P>
<P>
 For about five years now, on the first Saturday of each month, Selby has been 
teaching the subtle arts of fly-fishing at Upper Newport Bay Ecological 
Reserve. The next workshop is Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In the workshops, Selby teaches two basic casting techniques -- straight-arm 
casting and the roll cast -- and also demonstrates several knots for tying 
flies to the line. Then, students practice their newfound skills in the Back 
Bay. They might even catch something, such as bay bass, halibut or stingray. 
(All catches are released back into the bay.) 
</P>
<P>
 Selby, who volunteers his time as teacher for the Saturday workshops, says the 
1992 release of the film "A River Runs Through It" helped boost fly-fishing, 
particularly among women. He says there are now more women than men taking his 
classes, and he believes many are attracted to this form of fishing because it 
doesn't involve the messiness of live (or once-live) bait. 
</P>
<P>
 All the techniques he teaches can be translated to fresh water, but he 
emphasizes that fly-fishing in salt water can be an end in itself, and some 
fishing enthusiasts now take to deep-sea fishing with a fly rod. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Selby opened a fly-fishing shop in Costa Mesa, through which he also 
offers private lessons and local excursions. Float trips through Upper Newport 
Bay have brought in 14 species of fish, he says, including mullet and croaker, 
in addition to the aforementioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced fly-fishing enthusiasts who like to make their own lures can gather 
at Selby's shop on the second Thursday of each month from 6 to 9 p.m. for some 
communal fly-tying. It's more than likely that a few fishing stories will be 
told as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Selby, who travels as far afield as Colorado and Canada to pursue his favorite 
sport, says that just being outside is what he likes best about his hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get out, you enjoy nature, you're more aware of what's going on around 
you." 
</P>
<P>

 Proceeds from the workshop help maintain the Upper Newport Bay reserve, which 
is operated by the state Department of Fish and Game.

KIDS ON FILM: 'SQUANTO' MAKES HISTORY BY PUTTING ADVENTURE AHEAD OF 
THANKSGIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Squanto: A Warrior's Tale," two Native Americans, trapped and displayed as 
savages in England by 17th-Century traders, manage to return to their villages. 
One seeks revenge on the colonists. The other, peace. (Rated PG)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Walt Disney production, "Squanto" harks back to the Disney of memory -- a 
little swashbuckling adventure, a little history, a dash of evil, a larger dash 
of good and some gentle humor involving jolly friars. In other words, it's a 
movie parents can watch with their kids and not zone out on completely -- or 
feel as if they have to cover their little ones' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 If parents or teachers want to use it as a Thanksgiving history lesson, the 
kids probably won't mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it," said Cliff Taylor, 7. "It was almost a true story. Or, probably 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, let's just say, at least true enough to make history come alive for kids 
who dozed through class.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was interesting. It seems like it came right out of the history book," 
Noah Vidal, 12, said, as if that were a good thing. He admitted studying that 
period in history a couple years ago, but back then, he said, "It didn't mean 
that much." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing he learned from the movie was that Native Americans "are smarter 
than you think." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Taylor, who put his age at 4 3/4, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Squanto really seemed smart," he said, remembering how the character freed 
himself from his English cell by luring mice to gnaw on bonds that he had 
dipped in mush. 
</P>
<P>
 Squanto also makes fire by friction and clothing from animal skins. He soothes 
an angry bear with a lullaby. He learns English with remarkable speed. While 
his fellow Native American Epenow remains enslaved in Plymouth by the traders, 
Squanto escapes and is harbored by a group of cloistered priests. From them, he 
learns about books, all written and illustrated by hand, and that not all 
whites are greedy and ignorant.  
</P>
<P>
 It was also a friar who helped him flee the traders and catch a ship home.  
</P>
<P>
 By movie's end, he has practically become the Gandhi of the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 It is as a result of his peacemaking efforts that the colonists and the Native 
Americans sit down and share the first Thanksgiving turkey. It's a scene that 
Noah said might change his view of the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a while for them to be friends and to see each other as equals," he 
said. Maybe the Native Americans were more grateful for the harvest than the 
colonists, he added. "These guys worked for it."  
</P>
<P>
 The story is told from Squanto's point of view, portraying the English largely 
as insensitive bearers of new diseases and often hypocritical about their 
beliefs on tolerance. Native Americans come across as gentle, cultured and 
dignified. 
</P>
<P>
 Noah said he also learned how Native Americans valued all animal life and the 
land. "They thought they had a great life," he said. "And they did." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids also found the film exciting and fun. Cliff's favorite scene was a 
horse chase through Plymouth that ended in a thrilling leap from dock to 
sailing ship.  
</P>
<P>
 Noah liked a fight between Squanto and the bear, staged for the English 
townsfolk like the Romans staged fights between lions and Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the history, Noah said, "There was adventure in there. It wasn't 
boring."

SPECIAL SCREENING: ELEGANT 'REBECCA' CAUGHT OSCAR'S EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A head-shaking irony of Hollywood is that Alfred Hitchcock picked up only one 
best-picture Oscar during his busy career. And when you consider which movie it 
was for, the irony just deepens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psycho," right? Nah, too disturbing for the academy crowd. How about "The 
Birds"? No chance, not with all that flapping and cawing. Then it had to be 
"Vertigo." Uh-uh, left everybody dizzy but not spellbound. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchcock won the top award in 1940, just after stud-producer David O. 
Selznick brought the British director to America. The picture was "Rebecca," a 
Gothic love story and murder mystery starring Laurence Olivier and Joan 
Fontaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Daphne du Maurier's popular novel, "Rebecca" (which screens Friday 
night as the latest feature in UC Irvine's "Cinema Potpourri" series) is a 
telling example of what movie-goers of the day took for classy entertainment. 
Expensively staged -- a Selznick trademark (he was the engine that drove the 
costly "Gone With the Wind" the year before) -- the movie looks super. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinematographer George Barnes picked up an Oscar himself, and his lens moves 
elegantly from the moody seaside cliffs (befogged and romantically dangerous, a 
la "Wuthering Heights") to the even moodier interiors of the immense Manderley 
estate, where the shenanigans occur. Barnes' camera becomes a character in its 
own right, creating tone and tension even when the stars stumble. 
</P>
<P>
 And that underscores the main problem with "Rebecca." Olivier and Fontaine, 
both remarkable actors, seem a little lost, at least when it comes to defining 
their relationship. Olivier is impeccable and distant, even abstract as the 
aristocratic Maxim. Fontaine, playing his young bride as something of a ninny, 
is more amusing, but she doesn't do much either to explain the how and why of 
their strange love. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's strengths can be found elsewhere, mostly in the way Hitchcock 
drapes a haunting and vaguely perverse aura over the whole affair. The 
questions surrounding the death of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, and how his new 
wife figures in provide the basic intrigue, but it's Hitchcock's skill in 
building layer upon layer of atmosphere that lifts the film above the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this is Hitchcock during a more restrained time in his career; he 
doesn't give in to the more dramatic and frightening impulses he revealed in 
later pictures such as "Psycho." Instead, "Rebecca" is very British, meaning 
stylish and lovely, but rather studio-bound. There are melodramatic passages 
(listen to the organ music, which punctuates scenes like the soundtrack in a 
silent move) and, worse, plodding ones. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Hitchcock gets it right, he brings foreboding to the exploits at 
Manderley. Fortunately, he has a few expert character actors to count on, 
including Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers, a weird, witchy housekeeper still 
loyal to the dead lady of the house. And then there's George Sanders as 
Rebecca's lover, trying to make a few bucks off her passing. His speech, 
manners and clothes are perfect, but he's as slimy as the stuff floating in the 
nearby bog.

NEWSBITES: HUNT NO FURTHER: THREE O.C. RESTAURANTS HAVE WILD GAME PLAN FOR FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Let the game begin. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fall, and traditionally that's the time game dishes start making their 
way onto menus. Game warms the soul as the months get cooler and continues to 
suggest wildness even after it's been tamed in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 North Pole musk ox, kangaroo, lion, peacock, rattlesnake, ostrich and 
pirarucu, a game fish from the Amazon, are among two dozen wild things 
available Friday through Sunday at Aurora's ninth annual Festival of the Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a large menu, as large as it can legally be," said owner Leo 
Holczer, referring to hunting laws and other limits on types of game available; 
dinner will be served from 5 p.m. Entrees range from $19.50 to $29.50, and 
combination plates -- such as caribou, musk ox and kangaroo, or duck, lion and 
antelope -- are $32. Saturday's dinner is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming winemaker dinners also incorporate game dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackbuck antelope with three-vegetable polenta and black currant sauce is one 
of five courses at a dinner Friday at Antoine featuring wines from Burgundy's 
Maison Louis Latour; the event is $100 per person plus tax and tip, and it 
begins at 7 p.m. Roast-stuffed wild boar will be served Nov. 15 at the first 
ever winemaker dinner at Ti Amo Ristorante, a four-course menu focusing on the 
wines of Northern California winery Clos Du Bois; it starts at 6:30 p.m., and 
the $55 cost is all-inclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Aurora will serve game dishes throughout November and December. Nightly during 
December, Antoine will offer a five-course prix fixe game dinner, including 
blackbuck Texas antelope with red beet puree and port wine sauce; $60 per 
person excludes tax and gratuity.

RESTAURANTS; PAPA'S IS RIGHT-ON 'CUE, SANTA MARIA-STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask 10 Americans to define barbecue and chances are you'll get 10 different 
answers. In South Carolina, barbecue means pale yellow pork shoulder marinated 
in mustard and honey. Texans get misty-eyed talking about beef brisket spiked 
with cumin. Even Hawaii has a smart answer, thanks to an exotically smoky wood 
called kiawe . 
</P>
<P>
 Around here barbecue can be anything -- chicken, ahi, vegetables, pizza -- as 
long as it's grilled over a desert shrub called mesquite. But up on the Central 
Coast, the natives prefer Santa Maria-style barbecue, eaten with a chunky, 
peppery tomato salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept is beautifully simple. To qualify for the pit in this style, meats 
have to be slowly marinated in salt, pepper and garlic before being roasted, 
without basting, over a bed of red oak embers. Try it at home, if you don't 
mind getting smoke on your apron. The flavors are terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 Or better yet, come to Long Beach, the local capital of Santa Maria barbecue, 
and drop in on Louis Leppo, alias Papa. Leppo has just relocated and expanded 
his restaurant, Papa's Western Barbecue. He prepares the best Santa Maria-style 
'cue I've ever tasted.  
</P>
<P>
 Leppo is a Santa Maria native and former truck driver who started a catering 
business during the '70s. Eventually he found himself cooking for the Rams, the 
Raiders and the Dodgers, and the athletes couldn't get enough of his prime rib, 
tri-tip sirloin and darkly stained chicken. Leppo's barbecue buddy Tom Lasorda 
helped convince him to move down here. (Lasorda, himself a restaurateur, is 
something of a fixture at Papa's, dropping by at least once a week.) 
</P>
<P>
 Papa's recently moved about one mile up PCH from its original location to the 
cavernous A-frame that once housed Jay's Deli. The rooms have been completely 
remodeled. The front, now a replica of a Western saloon, is the best vantage 
point for watching meats as they dry-smoke over an open fire. Peek in at the 
pit man through a tiny glass window, if you like. But don't stand there too 
long. You'll be tempted to order everything you see. 
</P>
<P>
 The main dining area is a huge room with comfy, Leatherette booths. Decor pays 
homage to the set of "Hee-Haw." Look up and you'll see bales of hay hooked to 
the ceiling and farm equipment such as sickles and yokes suspended from the 
walls. Look down and there's a shiny parquet floor, the kind you'd square dance 
on. Expect to hear the music of Merle Travis, Tanya Tucker and other country 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you order, you should know about poquito beans. These small, round 
beans -- a cross between pinto and red beans -- are essential to a real Santa 
Maria-style feast. Leppo has them trucked down from his native turf especially 
for his restaurant, where he stews them with chunked beef and spices. They are 
even better when eaten with the chunky house salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday and Saturday, Leppo cooks up smoky, tender prime rib. The meat is 
tender and surprisingly juicy, given the way oak tends to dry out meat. Papa's 
cut, a full 22 ounces, is big enough for a growing linebacker. I'm less taken 
with the menu's mainstay, the tri-tip sirloin, but only because I'm not fond of 
the way the kitchen serves it cut up into crusty little chunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken is really wonderful here. The meat is so soft it falls off the bone, 
the skin is the color of stained walnut and there's an almost herbal aftertaste 
from red oak coals. One more delicious item is linguica, a sweet, salty 
Portuguese sausage that's usually pretty greasy. Not here -- the dry cooking 
allows much of the fat to drip out. Wrapped in a flour tortilla with salsa, 
this sausage becomes a world-class snack. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, there are ribs -- pork ribs, beef ribs and the centerpiece, baby 
backs. You can try all three for $13.95 by ordering a dish called combo ribs, a 
trencherman's portion. The meats are tasty, but perhaps because this style of 
barbecue doesn't involve basting with a sauce, they are somewhat dry and chewy. 
Personally, I'd like these ribs more if they were more tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Salads -- served in big flat pie tins -- are also a kick here, thanks to the 
restaurant's fresh croutons and dressings. You get a Lazy Susan of the blue, 
Italian and Thousand Island dressings. I like to mix the blue cheese (secret 
ingredient: goat cheese) with the near-perfect Italian, made with just the 
right amount of vinegar; I'm told true aficionados of Santa Maria barbecue like 
to mix all three. The chicken salad is one of the few light items here, loaded 
with smoky chicken meat.  
</P>
<P>
 The new Papa's is open daily for breakfast, and that's a stroke of luck. These 
are hearty, country-style breakfasts, worth the drive from anywhere in Orange 
County. My choice is pork chops and eggs, served with salsa, a fluffy homemade 
biscuit and thick sausage gravy. But order any of the meats (bacon, thick ham 
steak, tri-tip or sausage) and you also get a wonderfully heavy side of country 
spuds, diced potatoes fried up with crisped bits of onion, red pepper and 
crumbled linguica) . 
</P>
<P>
 Add in the giveaway 25-cent cup of coffee and the good, homemade flapjacks, 
and you've got reasons to come here for breakfast, lunch or dinner. You don't 
have to smell like smoke when you leave, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Papa's Western Barbecue is moderately priced. Appetizers are $1.95 to $12.95. 
Lunches are $6.95 to $7.45. Dinners are $10.95 to $22.95.

PARKER'S PALCE: LOST AND FOUND, THAT WAS HIS CROSS TO BEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen years ago, my mother gave me a pen. A gold-plated Cross Ballpoint in a 
green box. Although the gift came at Christmastime, when I read the attached 
note it was obvious that this wasn't a Christmas present in the strict sense. 
The note said.: 
</P>
<P>
 Dear T --  
</P>
<P>
 Merry Christmas! Use this pen to autograph all the wonderful books you're 
going to write.  
</P>
<P>
 Love, Mumsey  
</P>
<P>
 Right, I thought. Use this pen to sign all the unpublished manuscripts I can 
palm off on loving family and friends because I'm a terrible writer and I'm 
more likely to grow another head than I am to ever have actual books to 
autograph. But thanks anyway, Mumsey -- nothing like a little blood-confidence 
to make a soul feel like he should at least keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
 So I did. I spent another year, then another, working on a book about a young 
police detective in Laguna Beach. It was fun work, but it was anguishing too, 
because I was almost certain the thing would never turn out right, never be 
read by anyone except for the Fictionaires -- my workshop cohorts -- who would 
smile wanly at my final reading, shift uncomfortably in their chairs and say, 
"It's well-written." 
</P>
<P>
 (In case you don't know, "It's well-written" means several things to 
professional writers. These are: The writing is OK, but the story is boring; 
the characters are poorly drawn; the manuscript won't be published; the 
structure of the piece is fully collapsible; the whole thing is improbable, if 
not ridiculous, or, too much ego, not enough skill.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, I had set the pen, in its box, on an upper bookshelf over the 
typewriter table. I was taking Mumsey literally -- the pen would be for 
autographing books and nothing else, not even the suicide note I composed (in 
pencil) during the fourth unfruitful rewriting of the manuscript. The little 
box sat unmolested above me for five years, a hope chest of dreams, a talisman 
against failure, a stern and patient Muse. 
</P>
<P>
 When my first book was published in 1985, I ran to the shelf to whip out the 
pen and inscribe a book for Mom, but the box was gone. I ransacked the room, 
then the whole apartment, then my car -- but no luck. The box had vanished 
along with the pen, Mumsey's note and whatever power it had lent me. Crushed, I 
signed my first editions of "Laguna Heat" with a black plastic Parker pen (a 
simple-minded attempt at oneness with my universe), but it had no totemic 
weight whatsoever -- it was just a pen. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, the gold Cross showed up some months later, in my closet -- though I 
had no idea how it had gotten there. I grabbed and opened the box and took out 
the golden shaft. It was slender and heavy and perfect. It would last forever. 
Just like my talent! I read the note again and called Mom with the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 I signed a lot of copies of "Laguna Heat" with that pen. Three years later, I 
signed a lot of copies of "Little Saigon" with it, in places as far away as 
Boston, Seattle, Houston and Chicago. It traveled with me and my wife to the 
Cayman Islands, Key West, Mexico and New Orleans. It became international, if 
not worldly. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the fall of 1991, while helping promote "Pacific Beat," the 
pen disappeared out of my pocket one evening for a reason no more fathomable 
than why it had moved from the bookshelf to the closet. I ransacked the house 
again, then the car. No dice. I called the store where I had signed, then the 
restaurant I had eaten at afterward, then the bar I had closed after dinner, 
only to find someone else's gold Cross pen in the manager's hand. I thanked and 
blessed him, Pope-like, but admitted that his pen was nothing more than an 
impostor. I became withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 My pen showed up a week later in the dryer. It was cleaner, and worked 
perfectly. I embraced and kissed it, and offered up a little admonition about 
"sticking around." I thought of Mom -- no longer with us on Earth -- jammed the 
Cross back in my pocket and felt good. 
</P>
<P>
 The pen finished my 1991 "tour," then vanished again in early 1992. It 
materialized at a friend's house. It disappeared later that year for a full 
month, only to resurface in the bottom pocket (where I never carry a pen) of an 
old jacket I was packing up to give to the thrift shop. Over the next two 
years, it traveled to Hawaii, the Fiji Islands and Costa Rica. By then it was 
dented and scuffed, and the elegant lengthwise striations were worn in the 
places where thumb, index and middle fingers rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago the pen left again. It happened after a festive night on the 
town, one of those occasional nights when you feel so expansive you just have 
to illustrate everything. I sketched on a napkin for my yawning date the basic 
tennis doubles' strategy as taught to me by the great Ray Thornton. Later, I 
drew for my companion (who was by then nodding off) the outlines of some rooms 
I hope to add to my house some day. I think I drew a picture of my dog. I 
certainly signed credit card slips with abandon, only to awaken the next 
morning with a penless shirt thrown over the chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, no. 
</P>
<P>
 I called every place we had been -- no pen. I searched the house, then 
searched it again, heaving items around the rooms, reducing my home to little 
more than a Colin Powelled Baghdad. I explored every nook and cranny of my car. 
I called all the places again. I checked the dryer, old coats, the closet, even 
the driveway where I had stopped the night before to try (stupidly) to run 
after a deer bouncing along the asphalt ahead of me. 
</P>
<P>
 The pen was gone as yesterday's sunshine, and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 So I went into my collection to find a replacement. I tried one of those big, 
fat, ostentatious pens appropriately named after a mountain. It was about the 
size of an XLNT tamale, and you had to hold it like a caveman holds a chisel, 
making your signature look defective. I hated it.  
</P>
<P>
 I tried one that had the standard push-button in-out control, but it looked 
nerdy in my pocket. There was simply no replacement for the balance, poise and 
utility of the Cross. I even considered buying a replacement, but as I stared 
down through the glass display cases, the new Cross pens seemed to lack 
spiritual heft. How do you replace a dream your mom had for you? 
</P>
<P>
 Last week at the carwash, the interior man approached me with a handful of 
items he was uncertain about discarding: three empty shotgun shells, an ancient 
deodorizer shaped like a miniature pine tree, a Counting Crows cassette with 
the tape looping out like fishing line and a rather battered Cross pen. 
</P>
<P>
 I lunged for the thing, confirmed its identity, fell on my knees and began 
speaking in tongues. I tipped the interior man extravagantly. I was given a 
personal escort off the premises, because everyone was so happy for me. The pen 
is in my pocket right now, and, after six months of wondering if life is just a 
long series of losses, I can state absolutely that it is not.

 Re "Huffington Admits Fault in Hiring Illegal Immigrant," Oct. 28: 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Huffington is asking for our understanding in the matter of his family's 
little five-year-long "mistake" in employing an illegal immigrant for child 
care. We understand all right, Mr. Huffington. You are eager to leap on the 
political bandwagon to deny illegals health care and education, but you have 
been quite willing to profit personally from paying their rock-bottom wages. 
The only reason illegal immigration has been allowed to continue unabated is 
because many businesses and well-off families reap considerable benefit from 
this arrangement. The ones who pay for it are the workers who are displaced and 
the taxpayers who foot the bill for increased unemployment and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope voters realize the full extent of Huffington's hypocrisy when he 
endorses Proposition 187 as a remedy to the problems associated with illegal 
immigration. The fact is that Proposition 187 would do little to stop the use 
and exploitation of illegals -- it would just squeeze further those at the 
bottom of the economic and social ladder.

 When Dianne Feinstein was asked about casting votes which greatly affected the

 When Huffington was asked about the employment of an undocumented alien, he 
not only confirmed that it was true, but apologized for his and his wife's 
error. 
</P>

 We appreciate the truth, Mr. Huffington, and I firmly believe that it will be 
strongly remembered by the voters on Nov. 8.

whose incompetence and inaction cost California hundreds of billions while 
effective, hard-working senators from far smaller states grabbed a 
disproportionate share of federal spending.  
</P>
<P>
 Huffington defends his congressional inaction as opposition to big government. 
But the way to make government smaller is to introduce bills to make government 
smaller, such as Clinton's deficit reduction act which has pared the federal 
work force to its smallest size since the Kennedy Administration. 
</P>

 With the feds controlling one-third of GNP, California's collective interests 
demand an effective legislator in the Senate, not hobbyist Huffington.

 * Huffington states that among his motives for wanting to become a senator is 
a desire to "give something back" (interview, Opinion, Oct. 30). May I suggest 
that the state of California would be better served were Huffington to do so on 
a graffiti cleanup team, or by volunteering in an elementary school populated 
by the children of working-poor immigrants, legal or otherwise. If only 
Huffington had taken the $27 million he's spent so far on his campaign and 
donated it for education, or medical care for the poor. That would be giving 
something back. If it turns out that this neophyte, know-nothing, rich boy is 
actually able to buy himself a Senate seat, I think I will need to take a bromo 
and lie down.

 * Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's endorsement of Dianne Feinstein in the 
Senate race (Oct. 31) is as sad as it is telling. Anyone that thinks this is a 
blow to the Huffington campaign needs only to realize that Riordan has made a 
very loud statement, in favor of Huffington. Huffington opposes bigger 
government, confiscatory taxation and handouts to illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's treasonous support for the opposition only makes himself less 
trustworthy. A man of true character would first change his party allegiance 
before he stood with his foe. 
</P>
<P>
 As Riordan laps at the incumbent Democrat for a handful of rice, it's not hard 
to see whose ship is actually sinking.

THE VALUE OF SECOND THOUGHTS; DON'T LET PROP. 184 BLOCK IMPROVEMENT OF 'THREE 
STRIKES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like all too many California ballot initiatives, Proposition 184, the 
"three-strikes" measure, asks the voters to lock themselves into a risky 
decision and throw away the key. "Three strikes" is already in the lawbooks. 
Thus Proposition 184 would accomplish one thing and one thing only: It would 
make the law virtually impossible to change. 
</P>
<P>
 We think that the law could be modified to provide the same protection from 
crime for far less money. And so we urge voters to think about taxes as well as 
safety and vote against 184. Californians should see how the 1994 law works out 
before we write it in stone. 
</P>
<P>
 As a law passed by the Legislature, "three strikes" is not irrevocably fixed. 
When state legislators make a mistake they can correct it; not so an initiative 
adopted directly by the electorate. The Legislature is typically powerless to 
make the slightest change in an adopted ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 184 needs only a simple majority to pass. Thereafter, to quote its 
closing words, "The provisions of this measure shall not be amended by the 
Legislature except by statute passed in each house by roll-call vote entered in 
the journal, two-thirds (italics ours) of the membership concurring," or by 
another voter initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-thirds roll-call vote of both houses for any revision of "three strikes" 
is unlikely when a yes vote, whatever its real meaning, can so easily be turned 
into a charge of "soft on crime." Direct revision by the voters is even more 
unlikely, for it takes about $1 million to qualify a ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes," as written, would undeniably improve public safety. As pure 
deterrence, the law has an intuitive logic that any American who understands 
baseball can grasp. Confirming that intuition to a point, a new RAND study 
estimates that "three strikes" would reduce serious crime by about 28%. That's 
a very significant improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is, this improvement is expected to increase the cost of 
corrections by a crushing 120%, adding about $5.5 billion to the state budget 
(for comparison, the current budget deficit is less than $3 billion). Those 
billions will have to come either from increased taxes or from a steep 
reduction in what the state spends on higher education. Higher education is the 
only major entry in the budget that is not now protected by law. All 
Californians want to reduce crime, but many also want to go to college or want 
that public benefit for a spouse or a child, and higher education pays huge 
dividends to the state economy. Can we have both public safety and public 
higher education? Only if we preserve for ourselves the right to consider 
intelligent, cheaper alternatives to "three strikes" as now written. 
</P>
<P>
 One such alternative eliminates all talk of "strikes" and simply sends all 
those convicted of a serious felony to jail for the full term of their sentence 
with no time off for good behavior. RAND estimates that this alternative would 
achieve 100% of the crime reduction bought by "three strikes" for only 75% of 
the budget hike. (Not that that's cheap.) If that option is so much less 
expensive, why not at least consider it? Doubling the penalty after the second 
strike, as the law does, but skipping the strike-three part would buy 85% of 
the increase in public safety for less than half the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, we're not arguing hard for either alternative -- only urging that the 
voters preserve their right to second thoughts. They can do that by voting "no" 
on Proposition 184.

THAT SHINY LITTLE KILLER IN THE CLOSET; EVEN IN FRIENDLY HANDS, THE HANDGUN IS 
AN UNSPEAKABLE MENACE TO AMERICAN FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's on the ballot in Milwaukee, not Los Angeles, but it concerns an issue 
that sadly has found a home in almost every U.S. city: the threat posed by the 
seemingly endless river of firearms that flows through American society. 
Residents of the Wisconsin city will vote next week on a proposal to ban the 
sale and possession of handguns within municipal limits. We urge them to 
approve it. 
</P>
<P>
 A ban there -- and in Los Angeles and perhaps every other major metropolitan 
area -- makes sense. Such a prohibition might have spared an Orange County 
family and a New Hampshire family tragedies this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In Aliso Viejo a 16-year-old boy said by friends to be distraught over 
breaking up with a girlfriend went home Monday, got a .45-caliber handgun from 
a chest that he unlocked, took it to school and shot himself before two dozen 
students, including the girl, in a classroom. Remarkably, hospital officials 
say the youth will recover, although he will need extensive reconstructive 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Hampshire, Herbert Kershaw, 59, a clergyman who had bought five guns 
since September because he thought Congress might pass more gun control laws, 
accidentally shot himself to death Sunday while showing one of the weapons to 
family members. Kershaw had attended a firearms safety course that day to learn 
how to use his new .45-caliber pistol. He was demonstrating the pistol's safety 
features when the weapon went off. 
</P>
<P>
 These incidents underscore the mortal danger posed by handguns even in 
friendly hands: A gun in the home is more likely to kill a family member than 
it is to stop a burglar. Every eight hours a child commits suicide using a 
handgun. Research published last year found that homes with guns are almost 
three times more likely to be the scene of a homicide than homes without guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee's proposed handgun ban could help slow the slaughter. It would 
permit gun dealers to sell only shotguns, rifles and the few pistols that have 
barrels longer than 10 inches. Handgun owners would be urged to turn their 
pistols over to city police for destruction (30% indicate they are willing to 
do so). Handguns would be confiscated when they turned up during arrests or 
traffic stops, and residents could face misdemeanor convictions for repeated 
violations of the law against possession. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad that a beneficial ban of this sort cannot be put before the 
voters of Los Angeles; the California Constitution forbids local gun control 
measures that are more restrictive than those passed by the Legislature. Ending 
this preemption should be a priority entry on the 1995 "to do" list of gun 
control advocates in the California Legislature.

GARCETTI ON '3 STRIKES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times' series, "Six Months of 'Three Strikes' " (Oct. 23, 24), highlights 
many of the issues the Office of the District Attorney is facing in prosecuting 
"three strikes" cases. I am concerned, however, that the series misstates the 
three-strikes enforcement policy of my office. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the enactment of three strikes, I have stated consistently that I will 
follow the letter and spirit of three strikes. My three-strikes policy dictates 
that it is the rare three-strikes case which should be resolved without 
three-strikes penalties. Our line prosecutors appear to be following this 
policy. There are cases which should be and are resolved differently, but these 
cases are not common.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the best efforts of this office, your series makes clear that some 
judges are working to evade three strikes. We are fighting this by appealing 
appropriate cases to see that three strikes, in fact, is enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, prosecutors in this office file criminal actions against three 
strikes defendants -- and all other defendants -- solely based on the merits of 
the particular cases; that is, whether the evidence warrants conviction by a 
reasonable trier of fact. We do not consider whether the defendants are on 
parole from state prison (and potentially facing proceedings for violating 
parole). If there is a case that should be filed, we file it. Period.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE GOVERNOR'S RACE; READ MY PLAN, NOT HIS LIPS; CALIFORNIA'S 
REBUILDING MUST START WITH A PLAN, AND I'VE GOT ONE. PETE WILSON HAS NOTHING 
BUT BROKEN PROMISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN BROWN, Kathleen Brown is Treasurer of California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Wilson will say anything, do anything and stop at nothing to win 
Californians' votes. That includes using political cronies trying to pass 
themselves off as impartial experts to belittle my written economic plan -- a 
plan that John Quigley, chair of the economics department at UC Berkeley, says 
"does not raise taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 My written plan, "Building a New California," has been endorsed by 55 leading 
economists, including two Nobel laureates, more than 200 business leaders, 
thousands of educators and mayors of cities up and down this state. 
</P>
<P>
 My plan cuts more than $5 billion in government waste. It saves money by 
eliminating more than 55 agencies and streamlining the burdensome permit 
process that has driven jobs away. And it invests in our future -- in 
education, in businesses and in our economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Wilson doesn't have a plan. Not once in four years has he laid out a 
vision or a strategy of how he would govern California for another term. And as 
a last-minute gimmick to win your votes, he proposed cutting taxes if elected 
again. But take a look at his record. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Pete Wilson who raised taxes as early as his first year in office by a 
record $7 billion, or $1,000 per family. That's more than any other governor in 
our nation's history and more than New York when it was on the brink of 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Pete Wilson who borrowed more than any other governor last year, all 
because he continued to paper over the state's financial troubles. That record 
$5-billion debt not only reduced our credit rating to among the lowest in the 
nation; it also cost taxpayers millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 And what Pete Wilson didn't tax or borrow he stole from local governments. All 
this from the career politician who said while campaigning in 1990 that he was 
the only candidate who could balance budgets without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 As Stanford economics professor and Nobel laureate William Sharpe said, "In 
times such as these, it takes a great deal of courage to plan to invest in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 My plan does exactly that. It's a clear, detailed and achievable blueprint for 
how I will rebuild California. 
</P>
<P>
 Focusing on growth and investment, it will clean up the fiscal mess in 
Sacramento, create 1 million private-sector jobs that Californians can raise 
their families on and put schools and colleges first again. My plan will reach 
its goals because, as another Stanford economic professor and Nobel laureate, 
Kenneth J. Arrow, says, it is "practical and based on the realities of 
California's economy" despite Wilson's political attempts to suggest otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 My economic plan does not contain any new general taxes. It is affordable and 
growth-oriented because it calls for slashing government waste by $5 billion. 
It calls for innovative ideas like those I have implemented in the Treasurer's 
office that leverage existing resources to create new jobs. And it calls for 
building new partnerships with teachers and businesses to improve education and 
build our economy. 
</P>
<P>
 As Berkeley economist Quigley says, my "thoughtful, balanced effort to 
re-direct existing revenues to more efficient programs of job creation and 
educational excellence is balanced by prudent financing." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the different between Kathleen Brown and Pete Wilson. I have a written 
plan -- something the voters can hold me to -- that lays out how I will lead 
California into the 21st Century. I don't expect people to agree with every 
proposal in it, but I think they will agree that it is a solid foundation upon 
which to begin rebuilding California. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Wilson has no plan for the state -- only a cynical plan for his 
reelection that relies on slick yet divisive 30-second TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Proposition 187, on which Wilson has hinged his reelection campaign. 
Proposition 187 will only make a bad problem worse, turning teachers and 
doctors into INS agents, throwing innocent children onto our streets and 
leading to more guns, gangs and graffiti -- and more costs to taxpayers. Even 
leading Republicans -- Jack Kemp, William Bennett and Ron Unz -- have opposed 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 But after years of silence on illegal immigration, Wilson jumped on what he 
thought was the 187 bandwagon, fanning the flames of intolerance and almost 
single-handedly giving legitimacy to this flawed initiative. What makes things 
even worse is Wilson's dirty little secret -- that as a U.S. senator, he 
authored the largest loophole in the federal immigration laws, letting in 1.3 
million "Wilson workers" as cheap labor for the agricultural special interests 
who contributed more than $600,000 to his campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, my longstanding opposition to Proposition 187 has helped 
Californians -- except for Pete Wilson -- wake up to what is right, what is 
decent and what makes good, common sense. We can stop illegal immigration, but 
only by strengthening our borders and preventing employers from hiring 
undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, Wilson's ill-advised crusade against illegal immigration does 
nothing to help balance our state's budgets, restore excellence to our schools 
or invest in our future. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Pete Wilson tells you he's going to cut taxes if reelected, think 
about all his broken promises of the past four years. And when he denounces my 
plan in an attempt to hold onto his 27-year political career, ask yourself why 
he hasn't bothered to tell you how he would govern another four years. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to be California's governor because I believe we have lost focus on 
qualities that help families and communities succeed where government all too 
often fails. I have a vision for California and I back it up with a written 
plan. Here's what California should be: People of all backgrounds, drawn 
together as partners, as neighbors and as friends by common values. 
Opportunity, fostered by education that provides skills, spurs ambition and 
kindles hope. Self-reliance, achieving success through hard work, bolstered by 
confidence that high taxes and government waste will not squander the reward. 
Freedom, from violence, from intolerance and from government intrusion. And 
pride, in our diverse heritage, in ourselves, our children and in what we share 
as Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't read his lips; read my plan. Then decide who can best lead California 
into the future.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JONATHAN CLARKE: TIME FOR A NEW SPIN ON AN OLD STORY; MANDELA 
SHOULD PROJECT A SOUTH AFRICA POISED TO BECOME A MAJOR WORLD PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN CLARKE, Jonathan Clarke, a member of the British diplomatic service 
for 20 years, is now at the Cato Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On one level, President Nelson Mandela's triumphal sweep through Washington 
and New York last month was a much-deserved tribute to a truly heroic figure. 
But in terms of lasting substance, Americans and South Africans missed an 
opportunity to put the continent of Africa's relationship with the West on a 
more productive, less obsequious basis. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Clinton Administration officials provided yet further evidence 
that, in foreign policy, they place absolutely no value on the true meaning of 
words. Their only concern is to please the audience of the moment, no matter if 
this means insulting its intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 On this occasion, Vice President Al Gore was the villain. At a gala dinner in 
front of the Congressional Black Caucus, he told Mandela that South Africa 
represented a more important American national interest than Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, Gore and Mandela are sophisticated people. They both know that 
this is totally untrue. So perhaps the remark was simply an innocent 
subterfuge. But unfortunately, Mandela's entire visit to the United States 
succumbed to this same virus of sincerely intended but essentially empty praise 
and promises. By adopting this approach, both sides slipped effortlessly into 
the sterile stereotypes that have characterized the West's relations with 
Africa throughout decolonization.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials praised Mandela as the savior of his people and promised aid, 
investment and joint bureaucratic commissions. Mandela stressed the economic 
depredations bequeathed by apartheid and sought aid for housing, sanitation 
projects and education. 
</P>
<P>
 This suits everyone. The United States, along with other Western nations, 
takes on the role of feel-good sugar daddy; South Africa assumes the familiar 
garb of African mendicant, doing the rounds of Western capitals, hand extended 
for charity. 
</P>
<P>
 In this way, the cycle of Western patron-client treatment of Africa has 
acquired a new lease on life. We seem to have learned nothing from the 
post-colonialism experience. Mandela is the last, not the first, African 
statesman to lead his country to independence -- that was Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah 
nearly 40 years ago. Since that time, events have taught some valuable and hard 
lessons about the West's relationship with Africa, both about the 
ineffectiveness of aid as a development catalyst and about the humiliation that 
aid dependency brings. 
</P>
<P>
 How much better it would have been if Americans and South Africans could have 
torn up this tired script and started on something fresh.  
</P>
<P>
 From the American side, the main requirement is for honesty about aid. In a 
year when lack of funds to satisfy fire-code violations delayed the opening of 
Washington public schools, the idea that significant sums of American taxpayer 
money will be available for South Africa is preposterous. Whatever the promises 
-- Mandela received assurances of $600 million over three years -- it is a sure 
bet that delivery will be late, heavily conditioned and subject to arbitrary 
reduction at congressional whim. In short, it cannot be depended on for 
budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The second piece of American advice for Mandela should be that, while tours of 
Western capitals may bring gratifying accolades, his time would be better spent 
in China, Taiwan or Chile. These are countries that not only went without aid 
but actually overcame international hurdles to win their place in the economic 
sun. The hard-won secrets of their success are more relevant to Mandela's 
dilemma than the West's cheap benedictions.  
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Mandela needs to change tack. Rather than emphasizing South 
Africa's need for social spending to support a vulnerable democracy, he should 
concentrate on the factors that endow South Africa with near First-World 
status: It is the richest country in sub-Saharan Africa; has an advanced 
educational, scientific and industrial base; possesses a modern financial and 
communications infrastructure, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he should project South Africa not as a country desperate for 
aid or where do-gooders can exorcise a guilty conscience -- an image that puts 
serious investors to flight -- but as a country ready to take its place as the 
African partner of Western and Asian capitals in the global marketplace. Not 
only will this approach transform South Africa's relationship with the West, 
but the resultant financial flows will generate more funds for social spending 
in an hour than weeks of debasing supplication in the anterooms of the World 
Bank and IMF. Ask any citizen of Taipei, Shanghai or Santiago.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: IN HONOR OF CHARLATANS AND RACISTS; 'THE BELL 
CURVE' PAYS TRIBUTE TO SOME OF HISTORY'S MOST NOTORIOUS PSEUDOSCIENTIFIC 
HATEMONGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and co-edits a 
newsletter, CounterPunch, whose latest issue addresses The Bell Curve and 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The authors of "The Bell Curve" and the immigrant-haters behind Proposition 
187 all drink from the same polluted stream that has watered race hygienists 
and ethnic cleansers back to the founder of the pseudoscience of eugenics, 
Darwin's half-cousin Francis Galton; and back to important begetters of the 
sister pseudoscience of IQ testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Open up Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's "The Bell Curve" and glance at 
the introduction, where the authors list their intellectual ancestry. There on 
the opening page is Galton, cited in blandly respectful terms. Galton was a 
charlatan whose scientific procedures are well exhibited in his 1873 essay 
"Hereditary Improvement." He wrote that, after the great famine of the 1840s, 
"The Irish type of face seemed to have become more prognathous, that is, more 
like the Negro in the protrusion of the lower jaw; the interpretation of which 
was that the men who had survived the starvation and other deadly accidents of 
that horrible time were more generally of a low or coarse organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Murray travels the talk shows arguing that the welfare state should be 
dismantled because expenditures designed to improve the condition of the poor 
are wasted, since the poor -- particularly poor blacks -- are congenitally 
impervious to such efforts. Murray wants children of welfare mothers to be 
placed in orphan-ages where, as he confidently predicted in testimony before 
Congress this summer, there would be takers not only for "flawless blue-eyed 
blond infants" but also for "babies of all colors and conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Given honorable mention in "The Bell Curve" is Henry Goddard, who first 
adapted the tests of intelligence developed in France by Alfred Binet (who 
himself had strong doubts about their premises and utility). Goddard used his 
IQ tests at Ellis Island in 1917 to "prove" what he, like Galton, already 
believed: that Jews, Catholics and southern Europeans belonged to inferior 
races.  
</P>
<P>
 Goddard strove to persuade Americans -- with considerable success -- that 83% 
of Jews were feebleminded, sharing this trait with 80% of all Hungarians, 79% 
of all Italians and 87% of all Russians. His work at Ellis Island helped pave 
the way for the 1924 Immigration Restriction Act.  
</P>
<P>
 Herrnstein and Murray try mightily in their book to protect Goddard and his 
associates from connection to this law, because it was precisely that the 
pseudoscience of eugenics and IQ began to cash out as genocide. Hitler took the 
1924 U.S. law and the pseudosciences behind it as models for Nazi efforts in 
applied eugenics. Indeed, many excluded from the United States by the law were 
later murdered by the Nazis on the ground that they were "dysgenic." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's nativists promoting Proposition 187 are nourished by an ideology and 
by "scientific" rationales kindred to the intellectual lineage of "The Bell 
Curve."  
</P>
<P>
 One organization with a keen interest in Proposition 187, though keeping a low 
profile for political reasons, is the rabidly anti-immigrant Federation of 
American Immigration Reform. One of FAIR's top lobbyists, former INS 
Commissioner Alan Nelson, helped draft Proposition 187 in 1993, the year he was 
paid $70,000 by FAIR, which he listed as his only client. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of IRS documents shows that between 1982 and 1992, FAIR received just 
under $1.1 million from the New York-based Pioneer Fund, making it the 
second-largest of Pioneer's 22 grant recipients.  
</P>
<P>
 The original aim of the Pioneer Fund, established in 1937 by textile magnate 
and Nazi admirer Wickliffe Draper, was to promote breeding of "white persons 
who settled in the original 13 colonies." Its first president was the 
eugenicist Harry Laughlin, who in the 1930s lobbied to prevent Jews fleeing 
Germany from entering the United States. He called Nazi sterilization laws "a 
most exciting experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Pioneer's leading grant recipients are cited amiably in "The Bell 
Curve." Among them is J. Phillipe Rushton ($656,672 from 1982 to 1992) of the 
University of Western Ontario, who believes that there is an inverse 
relationship between genital size and intelligence. Herrnstein and Murray, 
conceding that Rushton "paints with a broad brush," assert he is neither "a 
crackpot nor a bigot." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to theorists and practitioners of IQ- or gene-based theories of 
race inferiority, or nativist defenders of the gene pool from alien intrusion, 
there is no "respectable" sector. They're all down there in the gutter, 
paddling in the vilest tradition of Western thought and political history.

DON'T FORGET, IT'S STILL THE PEOPLE'S COURT; PROPOSITION 190: THE PANEL THAT 
OVERSEES JUDGES NEEDS REVISION, BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE BEHOLDEN TO THREE 
POLITICIANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. CLARK KELSO, J. Clark Kelso is a professor of law at McGeorge School of 
Law, University of the Pacific. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the important ballot propositions we will be considering Tuesday has 
received almost no publicity, either pro or con, yet it deserves our careful 
attention. Proposition 190 proposes an amendment to the California Constitution 
to radically restructure and reform the Commission on Judicial Performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is responsible for evaluating the conduct of all of 
California's judges, including the judges on our Supreme Court. If the 
commission determines that a judge has misbehaved in office, a determination 
made after an investigation and hearing, it can impose sanctions, ranging from 
a letter of reprimand to a recommendation of dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 There is widespread agreement that some of the commission's procedures need to 
be changed. Most serious, the commission has operated under a cloak of secrecy 
that is inconsistent with the public's right of access to important 
governmental processes. Unfortunately, while Proposition 190 addresses that 
issue by opening up many of the commission's proceedings, other provisions in 
the proposition are potentially so harmful to justice in California that a no 
vote is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious threat comes from the way the members of the revised 
commission would be selected. The panel would have 11 members, three of whom 
would be judges appointed by the state Supreme Court. Appointments of the 
remaining eight members would be split up among the governor (who would name 
four members), the Speaker of the Assembly (two members) and the Senate 
Committee on Rules (two members). 
</P>
<P>
 The appointments by the governor, Speaker and Rules Committee would not be 
subject to any review or confirmation process. Those eight members would thus 
be directly accountable to the three persons who gave them the job: the 
governor, the Speaker and the chairperson of the Senate Rules Committee, who is 
also the president pro tem of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving politicians the unrestricted power to make appointments may be 
appropriate when staffing local or statutory offices, but that is not the way 
to appoint constitutional officers. Appointments by a single person, such as 
the governor or the Speaker, carry with them a significant risk that the person 
appointed will ignore the public interest in favor of pleasing the person who 
appointed them. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why our Constitution generally limits the governor's power by making 
nonjudicial appointments subject to confirmation by the Senate. A person 
appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate is not directly 
accountable to any single appointing authority, but that person is accountable 
only to the public interest. That is how separation of powers and our system of 
checks and balances were intended to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, the revised commission would have power over all of California's 
judges, including the Supreme Court justices. Do we really want our appellate 
justices and our trial judges subject to disciplinary review by a commission 
that is beholden to three politicians in Sacramento? I don't. Nor does Judge 
Joseph Wapner of "People's Court," who has announced his opposition to 
Proposition 190. 
</P>
<P>
 A no vote on Proposition 190 is not a vote against reform of the commission. 
It is a vote against giving individual politicians the power to make 
unrestrained appointments to constitutionally important offices. The commission 
can be reformed without undermining the separation of powers and threatening 
the independence of our judiciary. Don't let the politicians take over the 
people's courts.

 Bond yields ended higher and stocks fell for a third consecutive day despite 
the Fed's support of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's surprising move forced traders who were betting on the dollar's 
demise to purchase the currency. Most market participants had expected that the 
central bank would intervene only in the event of a disorderly dollar selloff 
that threatened to undermine the U.S. stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 While the dollar briefly touched an all-time intraday low of 96.10 Japanese 
yen, according to Reuters, dealers said the market was far from chaotic when 
the Fed stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 It closed in New York at 97.60 yen, up from 96.65 Tuesday. The greenback also 
ended the day at 1.514 German marks, up from 1.495. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the earlier failed dollar-rescue efforts, the move Wednesday 
was accompanied by strong words of support from the Clinton Administration and 
hints of even more aggressive efforts in coming days if traders don't stop 
battering the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen released a statement calling the dollar's 
recent slide "inconsistent" with the strong U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A stronger dollar will reduce inflation pressures, improve American living 
standards and promote investments. We will continue to monitor developments 
closely in cooperation with our G-7 partners," Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the dollar's strong move Wednesday after weeks of persistent weakness, 
most market participants said the intervention was unlikely to have any lasting 
impact given the bearish backdrop for the dollar, including the huge U.S. trade 
deficit, inflation concerns and sluggish securities markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things that have pushed the dollar down are still with us," said David 
Durst, vice president at Bear, Stearns & Co. "No amount of central bank 
intervention will change a currency's course for an extended period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, where the dollar's weakness has raised concerns that the 
Fed will have to sharply increase rates, prices were temporarily lifted off 
early lows on morning news that the Fed was massively supporting the dollar 
</P>
<P>
 But the fixed-income market eventually turned down again, partly on 
disappointment that the dollar failed to rally further after the Fed action. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding negative bond sentiment, a Fed monthly report on regional economic 
activity showed further strength in the economy and reinforced inflationary 
worries among traders and investors. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose to a new 2 
1/2-year high of 8.09%, up from 8.06% late Tuesday. Its price, which moves in 
the opposite direction, dropped 11/32 point, or $3.44 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the stock market, where investors are concerned that the lofty 
bond yields will lure investors away from equities and into bonds, the Dow 
Jones average fell 26.24 points to 3,837.13, bringing the blue chip indicator's 
losses so far this week to nearly 94 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow lost as much as 20 points early in the session, rallied 14 points in 
mid-afternoon as the dollar's value improved. But later the Dow and broader 
market drifted lower as bond yields failed to retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers more than 4 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 333.24 million shares, up from 314.95 
million on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes outperformed blue chips, largely on the strength of 
rallying technology stocks. The NYSE's composite index fell 0.76 point to 
255.98. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.91 points to 466.51. 
The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller issues, slipped 0.37 to 771.82. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Semiconductor stocks rose after Goldman Sachs upgraded Cypress 
Semiconductor, citing good demand prospects for the static random access memory 
chip market. Cypress rose 1 3/4 to 22 1/2. Intel gained 1 1/8 to 62 1/2 and 
Cisco Systems was up 1 to 31 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Software Spectrum jumped 3 to 15 1/2. Dean Witter upgraded the stock to buy 
after the company posted strong quarterly earnings.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: BEAUTIFUL, NOT BEASTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: The renowned horror story of Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Kenneth 
Branagh, pictured, who also directs) and his Creature (Robert De Niro), set in 
late 19th-Century Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: James Acheson, who won Academy Awards for his work on 
"The Last Emperor" and "Dangerous Liaisons." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: With operatic flourish, Acheson masterfully devises Frankenstein's 
world of striking beauty and airy refinement: His persimmon-colored chateau 
contrasts with the sooty squalor of cholera-infested town folk, and, of course, 
the Creature. 
</P>
<P>
 The good doctor's dress code includes the most delicate creamy brocades 
imaginable, under which flutter extravagant ruffled lace shirts. His love, 
Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter, pictured), matches him thread for thread for 
jaw-dropping luxe. Against this backdrop comes the Big Grunge -- the Creature, 
sporting a sweeping double-breasted and caped overcoat with monklike resonance. 
By movie's end, the coat is so organically grimy that it sprouts hairs. Next to 
this version of the Creature, Boris Karloff's "Frankenstein" archetype, a 
monster in a neat business suit, albeit two sizes too small, looks virtually 
corporate. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "The shadow of (Karloff's) image, which is so universally well known, 
is very difficult to compete with, even though it was contemporized for the 
1930s," Acheson said. "I also envisioned the Creature would be very fast, not 
lumbering like Karloff, but like a spider who would crawl over rooftops. We 
knew there was always going to be a coat, but over a period of two months I did 
about 40 drawings for De Niro and made little models to decide on things like 
different heights of collar, different coat lengths, textures." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: The Creature's one and only costume -- a coat made of washed gray 
moleskin -- was actually six coats made to look not only increasingly weathered 
but also more and more like a second skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing Red?: Dr. Frankenstein, Elizabeth and Frankenstein's brother, William 
(Ryan Smith), all sport blood-red garments. In some instances, the color is 
meant to convey a positive life force. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Principals' costumes were custom-made in England, sometimes from 
antique fabrics. New fabrics are from India, France, Germany, Turkey and 
England. BETTY GOODWIN

<P>
 The Movie: "The Road to Wellville." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Satire set in turn-of-the-century health and fitness sanitarium 
founded by real-life Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) in Battle Creek, 
Mich., brother of corn-flake magnate W.K. Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Penny Rose, whose credits include "The Commitments," 
"Shadowlands," "Strapless" and "Local Hero." 
</P>
<P>
 Research: The real Dr. Kellogg left behind not only voluminous photographic 
records of his early spa scene, but also a book he penned on its dress code, 
which Rose followed up to a point: "There are pages and pages of description on 
things like how many meters to make a skirt with so that you could exercise," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Ever wonder how people functioned in pre-spandex times? Men 
performed calisthenics in their dress clothes -- stiff-collared shirts, 
neckties, waistcoats and trousers. Women worked out in bloomers and high-necked 
lace blouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Hits: The good doctor dressed as Santa Claus in a charming hooded red robe 
trimmed in shearling. Nurses in uniforms of striped mattress ticking beneath 
saintly, diaphanous white silk organza aprons and nunlike bonnets. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Whimsical, ridiculous hats in the "Hello Dolly!" mode -- particularly 
Virginia Cranehill's (Camryn Manheim) chapeau decorated with three stuffed 
birds -- have been seen before. Embellishments were added to headgear found 
among stock from Visconti's "Death in Venice" and Bertolucci's "1900" at the 
Tirelli costume house in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Other than Dr. Kellogg and Will Lightbody's (Matthew Broderick, 
pictured with Bridget Fonda) custom-made suits, most of the period costumes 
were rented -- from Tirelli and Cosprop in London -- and redressed with antique 
trims, lace and beading. BETTY GOODWIN

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; HISTORICAL WALKABOUT WITH TALLEYRAND; THE RUIN OF 
KASCH BY ROBERTO CALASSO . BELKNAP PRESS/HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $24.95, 356 
PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dante chose Virgil to lead him through Hell; possibly an arbitrary choice and 
rather hard on the pagan Roman, but it served to give gravitas to the 
Florentine's scandalous walkabout. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, it seems an oddity for Roberto Calasso to choose the chilly 
diplomatic maneuverer, Talleyrand, as tutelary spirit to his incandescent 
scrapbook of humanity's myths and endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Ruin of Kasch," Calasso, the epigrammatic Italian writer, makes as if 
to tie up the history of absolutely everything in an improbable net-bag secured 
with knots that often come undone and spill the contents, but sometimes bring 
up quite marvelous catches. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet making our way through what is not so much a book as a compendium of 
asides -- on everything from Vedic myth to Freud, Hegel, Marx and Walter 
Benjamin; to Goethe's necktie, to a French aristocrat who visited her lover 
dressed up as a bear, to the contents of the stalls in the Palais-Royale (a 
chaste monument today but in the 19th Century a bawdy, teeming caravansary) -- 
we realize that Calasso does not take his knots seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it matter which fish are caught and which escape? 
</P>
<P>
 Either way they glitter, although not so much as in Calasso's "The Marriage of 
Cadmus and Harmony," his dazzling reworking of Greek mythology. Here, in his 
first and more ambitious book, there is more churn to each glitter. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a thread of a theme, and it makes the choice of Talleyrand as 
master of Calasso's revels wittily appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Widely detested for cynicism and changeability (and widely usable for the same 
reasons), he dispensed his skills to the French Revolution, the Directory, 
Napoleon, the Bourbon Restoration and the citizen-king, Louis-Philippe. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a master of currents, surfaces and, above all, of limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, when leaders, thinkers and artists thought of themselves 
as shaping events -- they shaped them imperially and finally into World War I, 
where shaping was taken to its insane extreme -- Talleyrand confined his art to 
conferring "the little finishing touches." 
</P>
<P>
 He used indolence, Mme. de Stael wrote, "to thwart as naturally as possible 
the activity of others," and was master, Calasso writes, "of the art of hiding 
everything on the surface."  
</P>
<P>
 "The Ruin of Kasch," skipping aimlessly from one glittering and seductive bit 
of history and legend to another, makes aimlessness its purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Calasso does not establish a conclusion; rather, each of his anecdotes and 
reflections seems to come to its own dead end, until we realize that all the 
dead ends are roughly in the same place. 
</P>
<P>
 He distrusts purposefulness and progress; he suggests that each linear effort 
leads to disaster (as with Marx) or absurdity (as with Jeremy Bentham, who took 
the science of measurement to the point of declaring that the concept of 
goodness must be quantified in money terms). 
</P>
<P>
 He is interested in cultures that go by cycles and limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the allegory that gives the book its name, he tells of a prosperous African 
kingdom, Kasch, where the king was supreme but where the priests, consulting 
the stars, would periodically order his execution and replacement by a new 
king. 
</P>
<P>
 One king, however, discovered a magical storyteller whose tales lasted all 
night and so enchanted the priests that they forgot to look at the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The king lived out his life span and so did his successor, the storyteller. 
Happiness was unalloyed until the neighboring peoples, jealous of utopia, came 
in and destroyed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Calasso writes of Talleyrand's last negotiation -- with the Vatican -- 
concluded with bluff and artful timing on his deathbed. It produced a document 
that was a kind of minimal confession and gave him access to the Church's last 
sacraments. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no time for the Vatican to amend it, and even though it was 
unacceptable it would have been too awkward to declare it unacceptable. For 
Talleyrand, even salvation was found in surfaces and was to be obtained, to say 
the least, in a limited way. 
</P>
<P>
 After the notables -- including the citizen-king in a scruffy brown coat -- 
paid their respects, the dead Talleyrand lay alone. 
</P>
<P>
 His chef entered, according to one account. Followed by his assistants "with 
their snow-white costumes and long carving-knives, (he walked) with solemn step 
to the foot of the bed and, kneeling down with cotton cap in hand, breathed a 
short prayer. Each sprinkled the corpse with holy water and then the whole 
procession withdrew in the same silence with which they had entered."

R S V P / INTO THE NIGHT: THE PRINCE MEETS THE MONSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: The world premiere Tuesday of TriStar's "Mary Shelley's 
Frankenstein" at the Cineplex Odeon. Afterward came an elegant, candle-lit 
dinner in the Century Plaza's ballroom. What gave the evening its extra gleam 
was the attendance of the Prince of Wales. It was royalty well-matched for the 
occasion: TriStar might have had a difficult year, but it wasn't nearly as bad 
the one Prince Charles had. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: On hand to see the tale of pre-Victorian plastic surgery gone 
hog wild were the film's director and star, Kenneth Branagh, with his wife, 
Emma Thompson; co-stars Tom Hulce and Helena Bonham Carter; plus 800 guests, 
including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Tom Cruise and Nicole 
Kidman, Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Penny Marshall and studio execs Alan 
Levine, Stacey Snider, Marc Platt and Mark Canton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Review: This is an opportunity that should not be missed. At the top 
of the ads (right above where it says how many thumbs Siskel and Ebert have) in 
colossal type could be the words: "Marvelous!" -- Prince of Wales. Don't think 
someone isn't considering it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Definition of Schmoozing: At the beginning of his dinner remarks, 
Prince Charles said: "I know you want to get on and eat and have a drink and 
generally do the things that people have to do in this part of the world. Quite 
what is another matter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ambience: The Americans were all trying so hard to be extra good. They 
came early, they were seated as protocol dictates before His Royal Highness 
arrived. They sat quietly through every creeping inch of the credits. "It was 
the most sedate group I'd ever seen after a screening," said one woman. "It was 
a combination of all that death and all that prince." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I feel like a faux pas waiting to happen," comedian Margaret Cho 
said. "I know I did something wrong just by being here." 
</P>
<P>
 Real Faux Pas: The moronic protester shouting, "Jail the bloody Windsors." The 
inept TV crewman trying to slip into the press area wearing someone else's 
official ID badge (he was hustled off by more security than is imaginable), and 
the character in the bad toupee who was pulled away from the prince's table for 
unexplained reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Standout: Carter wore a brown Morgane Le Fay shift with detachable 
gloves over a chiffon skirt and a large green velvet cloak. "It's Gothic, it's 
theatrical and it's the most inappropriate gear to sit through a movie in," 
Carter said.

MAKING A CASE FOR RECIPES WITH ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GIULIANO BUGIALLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What determines an authentic or classic recipe? One approach, used by some 
cookbook authors, is to tally and edit recipes solicited from restaurants 
throughout Italy. Although this may seem logical, these recipes are often 
either watered-down versions that have been redesigned to fit an individual 
restaurant's needs, or altogether misleading -- restaurateurs may deliberately 
omit ingredients so as not to give away their secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 When I research the origin and evolution of a dish, one source is not enough. 
I compare documented recipes (as early as the 14th Century) with the many oral 
versions handed down from one generation to the next within a region's 
long-native families. Through this process, I believe the essence of a 
particular dish -- its ingredients and preparation -- is most fully revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, it is important to use authentic ingredients and to eschew "creative" 
changes which bastardize the dish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This may make recipes that seem difficult for cooks to follow outside of 
Italy, but most Italian ingredients are now available abroad, although it 
sometimes requires a little effort to obtain them. Occasionally, I will list an 
ingredient which is truly hard to find, but in such cases I do offer a second 
choice. My experience over some 20 years has been that many ingredients that 
were not imported when my first books were published are now easily available. 
It is really worth it not to take the easy way out; the reward is a more 
delicious dish, in which the flavor comes from its historical roots. 
SCHIACCIATA WITH FRESH GRAPES 
</P>
<P>
 3 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon unbleached all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 ounce (2 cakes) compressed fresh yeast or 2 packages (4 teaspoons) active 
dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups lukewarm or hot water (depending on yeast used) 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 pounds red wine grapes (not Concord) or 2 1/2 pounds seedless ruby red 
grapes 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 Scant 1/2 cup lukewarm water 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare sponge by placing 1 cup flour in bowl and making well in center. 
Dissolve yeast in 3/4 cup water, then pour into well. Use wooden spoon to 
gradually incorporate flour into dissolved yeast. Sprinkle on another 1 
tablespoon flour. Cover bowl with cotton dish towel. Let stand, in warm place 
away from drafts, until sponge has doubled in size, about 1 hour. (Two signs 
that sponge has doubled in size are disappearance of tablespoon of flour and 
formation of large cracks on top.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, remove grape stems and carefully wash grapes in cold water. Pat dry 
with paper towels. Place grapes in large crockery or glass bowl and add sugar 
and fennel seeds. Mix with wooden spoon so that grapes are well coated with 
sugar. Let stand until needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare bread dough by placing remaining 2 1/2 cups flour in mound on board 
and making well in center. Pour sponge into well along with olive oil, salt and 
water. Use wooden spoon to mix together all ingredients in well. Then start 
mixing with hands, incorporating flour little by little from inside rim of 
well. Keep mixing until all but about 5 tablespoons flour are incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
 Knead dough with palm of hand, incorporating remaining flour in folding motion 
until dough is homogeneous and smooth, about 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide dough in half. Roll out each half with rolling pin into round about 16 
inches in diameter. Place 1 round of dough on bottom of oiled 14-inch pizza 
pan. Distribute half of sugared grapes over layer of dough. Cover with other 
round of dough. Seal edges together all around by pressing together. 
</P>
<P>
 Distribute remaining grapes on top of second layer. Cover pan with cotton dish 
towel. Let stand until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour. Remove towel. Bake 
at 375 degrees 1 hour. Remove from oven and let cool completely, about 1 hour. 
Serve from pan or on board to preserve rustic character, slicing like pizza. 
Makes 8 to 10 servings. ROLLED STUFFED SWORDFISH CUTLETS ON SKEWERS 
</P>
<P>
 3 pounds swordfish with bone, cut into 3 (1/2-inch-thick) slices 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium cloves garlic, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 3 heaping tablespoons capers in wine vinegar, drained and coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup very fine unseasoned bread crumbs, preferably homemade, lightly 
toasted 
</P>
<P>
 Juice 1/2 lemon 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 3 large ripe, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices 
</P>
<P>
 2 lemons, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices 
</P>
<P>
 Lemon wedges 
</P>
<P>
 18 sprigs Italian parsley, leaves only 
</P>
<P>
 Cut each slice of fish crosswise into 2 pieces, removing bone in center. Place 
6 pieces of fish in bowl and add olive oil. Season to taste with salt. Mix to 
coat evenly. Let stand 30 minutes, turning pieces over 2 or 3 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin stuffing by combining garlic and capers in small bowl. Add bread crumbs, 
lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Mix together with wooden spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove fish slices from bowl and place on platter. Place 1/6 of stuffing in 
center of each slice. Fold fish to make small package. 
</P>
<P>
 Thread long skewers starting with slice of tomato, slice of lemon and then 1 
folded fish package. Repeat until all ingredients are used. Brush everything 
threaded on skewers with oil left in bowl. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Place skewers on jellyroll pan or baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees on middle 
oven shelf 20 minutes. Increase temperature to 500 degrees and bake 3 minutes 
longer. Remove skewers from oven and transfer to serving platter. Serve fish 
with lemon wedges and parsley leaves. Makes 6 servings. TIRAMISU 
</P>
<P>
 6 extra-large egg yolks, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
 7 tablespoons granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup milk

VEGETARIAN WITH A THAI TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ordering vegetarian food in Asian restaurants can be a challenge, because 
dishes may be seasoned with meat and fish products that aren't apparent to the 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese chefs add a dash of chicken broth to make sauce. Japanese use dashi , 
which is based on dried fish. Thai cooks rely on fish sauce for saltiness and 
mix shrimp paste into dips and curry pastes. Vietnamese combine fish sauce with 
vinegar and sugar for nuoc cham , a dipping sauce. A strict vegetarian has to 
specify that such seasonings not be used. Otherwise, even dishes that appear to 
be meatless could be suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Thai restaurant in Hollywood, the waitress guaranteed that vegetarian 
dishes would not contain the offending seasonings. Soy sauce would replace fish 
sauce, she said, and the curry paste was made without shrimp paste. A meal of 
vegetable curry, hot and sour mushroom soup, pan-fried glass noodles and egg 
rolls was refreshing and light -- like spa food, but not much like Thai food. 
The flavors weren't as lively as they should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vegetarian eating and cooking is really not part of the Thai tradition as I 
understand it," says Edward J. McDonnell, an ordained Buddhist minister who 
teaches fundamentals of Buddhism at the Wat Thai of Los Angeles. "One would be 
hard pressed to find a Thai dish that did not have some meat product in it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Buddhist countries, vegetarianism can be a religious obligation. Mahayana 
Buddhism, practiced in China, Japan, parts of Vietnam and Korea, is strictly 
vegetarian. Some practitioners even avoid garlic, onion and chiles, believing 
they inflame the passions.  
</P>
<P>
 Theravada Buddhism, which is followed in Thailand, Sri Lanka, Burma, Laos and 
Cambodia, does not prohibit meat. Monks are permitted to eat it. And a book on 
Thai Buddhism published in Bangkok states that the Buddha ate pork at his final 
meal. A recent lunch at the Wat, a Buddhist temple in North Hollywood, included 
fried chicken and other non-vegetarian foods brought by parishioners for the 
monks. 
</P>
<P>
 For a Thai, vegetarianism would be a personal decision, McDonnell says. "It 
would be a complete change from the normal style of Thai cooking." 
</P>
<P>
 Thai vegetarian food can be very good, however, when prepared by an expert 
such as Sisamon Kongpan, cookbook author and associate dean of the Faculty of 
Home Economics at the Rajamangala Institute of Technology in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These recipes are from Kongpan's book, "The Best of Thai Vegetarian Food," 
published in Thailand by Sangdad Publishing Co. The salad makes a wonderful 
main dish. In Thailand, the mushroom soup would be made with fresh straw 
mushrooms, but canned can be substituted. In the fried rice, such typical Thai 
garnishes as shrimp and egg are replaced with pineapple, corn and red kidney 
beans. GRAND SPICY SALAD (Yam Yai)

COOK'S WALK; DINNER: MAKE IT UP AS YOU GO ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Shriveled salamis in string webbing, hanks of sausages and sheep's milk 
cheeses fill the coldcase at Reseda's Preboy Market. But what's what and what 
do you do with it? The cheese, for example: Can you eat it with crackers? 
Fruit? Do you cook with it? 
</P>
<P>
 We're out to buy dinner for eight in the ethnic markets of Reseda, but here, 
at our first stop, we're already stumped: How do you pick out food when little 
looks familiar?  
</P>
<P>
 Preboy owner Lubou Vaisman, it turns out, is all too happy to give us an 
impromptu education. Never mind that a man has come in right after us and is 
waiting to order. Cheerfully, stretching her Russian-inflected English to its 
limit, Vaisman instructs, giving us tastes of whatever we want. Of the two 
cheeses, she recommends the one that's less salted: "It's wonderful in a salad 
with cucumbers, white onions, tomato," she says, handing us a sliver. Indeed, 
it's creamy, milder than goat, smoother than a feta. We're sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Oblivious to the man fidgeting behind us -- she's on Reseda time -- Vaisman 
offers us slices of a pale smoked pork product. "Very delicious," she says, 
"Dipped in beef blood." To be polite, we taste it . . . and ask for half a 
pound, sliced thin. When she returns the remaining meat to the case we read the 
label -- why, it's just Canadian bacon! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We smile apologetically at the waiting man and ask the shopkeeper to suggest a 
good dry salami. She selects a French one, Florette de Lyons, and gives us a 
taste. She's right; it's dry, hard, aged, full of flavor. "Half a pound, 
please." 
</P>
<P>
 We might have asked about the various caviar in tins and the smoked fish that 
look like they're made of metal, but the man behind us is pacing, stopping only 
to drum his fingers on things. Besides, we now have our appetizer (a cold-cut 
plate) and a salad. Or at least part of a salad. As we leave, the man orders in 
rapid-fire Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 We have our foot in the door now. Excited, we plan our next moves: We need to 
finish shopping for the salad. Should we have another salad? What kind? And we 
definitely need bread. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Freedom Bakery, the barbari is still warm from the oven and only $1 for 
a yard-long loaf. At the Produce Club for salad makings, we carefully select a 
long, dark English cucumber. Red and yellow peppers are a bargain at 69 cents a 
pound. True, each has a small imperfection, but nothing that can't be cured 
with the flick of a knife. There's nothing wrong with the Japanese eggplant. 
Forget a second salad. Grilled vegetables will look beautiful. We can almost 
see the buffet before us. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda Bakery we buy iced cakes, one filled with fresh grapes and custard, 
the other with apples and cinnamon. We also grab a stollen, the first of the 
season. This buttery bread is flecked with candied fruit and filled with 
marzipan. A formidable block of brown bread tempts us, but Liane Schneider, the 
owner's daughter, shakes her head. "People need to work up slowly to such 
powerful doses of fiber. This loaf weighs 4 1/2 pounds and contains 80% rye 
chops (whole rye grains)." We pass.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Bangluck market, an array of fresh fish on ice is displayed in crates. 
A large sign hangs above a bank of deep-fat fryers: "You Buy We Fry." For those 
of us who grew up thinking fried fish meant fish sticks, salmon croquettes and 
fish and chips, the display is daunting: all those bulging eyes and toothy 
jaws.  
</P>
<P>
 We reject orange rock cod (the fish with the buggiest eyes), sheepshead and 
carp for pure ugliness. Some we can't even identify. Finally, we just ask the 
young man behind the counter what's the best fish to fry? 
</P>
<P>
 He recommends true red snapper and striped bass. We take one of each. He 
cleans and scales the fish for us, rinsing them often with a pressurized spray 
of water. Then, he plunges them, heads and all, into the deep fryer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good. But how to serve them? We turn to the Thai woman next to us. 
"What do you do with the fish once it's fried? Do you put a sauce on it or . . 
. ?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to eat it plain, just as it is," she says. "But my husband, who's 
Vietnamese, likes to eat it with lemon juice and a fish sauce with chiles." She 
then marches us down to her husband's favorite fish sauce, Hon Phan Thiet 
($2.79). "It's a little bit expensive," she says, "but it's not so salty and 
there's a lot of it." We grab a bottle and duck over to the produce section for 
chiles (serranos) and lemons. We also nab crisp green onions and tsoi choy, 
similar to baby bok choy, for our grilled vegetable platter. Our fish is ready 
now, wrapped in aluminum foil and stuck into bags. It smells heavenly. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question where to go for carnitas. In the back of the Corona X, 
there's a small taqueria where pork is fried daily. A pound of carnitas, a sack 
of corinas (snack-size tortillas), and we have tiny tacos. We don't want to buy 
canned salsa and don't have time to make it. No problem. The taqueria sells its 
own fresh salsas, $2 for a large cup. We buy some of each: the fiery red and 
the subtler green. 
</P>
<P>
 Our last stop is Miller's Marketplace to fill in the gaps. We pick up some 
cilantro and fresh limes for our tacos, some cracked green olives and plump 
purple Kalamata olives for our cold-cut platter. And while we're at it, we add 
some clusters of big, red grapes and ripe Bartlett pears to our basket.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We have an hour before the guests are due, and except for grilling the 
vegetables, there's no cooking to be done, only assembly.  
</P>
<P>
 This is what our guests found: Russian salad, French salami, Mexican carnitas, 
Thai fried fish, Iranian bread, Greek olives, German cakes . . . and Canadian 
bacon. They thought we'd plundered the world. 
</P>
<P>
 No, we said, just Reseda. CARNITAS TACOS 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 medium onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>

quickly, until hot. Warm tortillas on hot griddle or over direct flame. Place 2 
tablespoons of carnitas on doubled tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Garnish as desired with onion and cilantro mixture, lime juice and red and 
green salsas. Makes 18 tacos. 
</P>
<P>

 The Bangluck Market fries whole fish with no breading or seasoning . The 
result is delicious -- moist, unadulterated fish that's great with a little 
fresh lemon and even livelier with chile-spiked fish sauce. Don't worry about 
the fried fish cooling off between the market and home. If you keep it in foil, 
it stays quite warm for an hour or more. THAI FRIED FISH WITH SERRANO FISH

platter. Garnish with lemon wedges. Serve with chile-enhanced fish sauce. Makes

ARUGULA: THE LONG GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Less is more" has become the mantra of cooks seeking to speed up meals. 
Choose high-flavor ingredients, use fewer of them and get dinner on the table 
in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, arugula, a peppery salad green that is readily available this 
time of the year, is one of my favorite shortcuts to intense taste. When young, 
it has an almost nutty flavor; but when allowed to grow too long in the garden, 
it becomes sharp and mustard-like. Some people object to this; but I find it 
refreshing -- in small doses. 
</P>
<P>
 Arugula is sold in supermarkets and farmers markets, and a fistful is all that 
is necessary in an entree for two. (Nothing tastes just like arugula, but 
spinach and a generous dash of pepper could substitute.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other ingredients I rely on to pack a punch include jalapeno chiles, roasted 
sweet peppers, anchovies, garlic and goat cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The following fast and fresh-tasting pasta dishes include arugula. Bucatini 
with roasted pepper cream is a rich, satisfying dish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spaghetti with arugula and anchovies is a takeoff on bagna cauda, a type of 
fondue using anchovies, garlic and olive oil popular in Nice, France.  
</P>
<P>
 SPAGHETTI WITH ARUGULA AND ANCHOVIES 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces minced anchovies 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups sliced arugula 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup clam broth 
</P>
<P>
 8 ounces spaghetti 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in medium skillet. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and saute 1 
minute. Add anchovies and arugula and cook over medium heat 1 minute. Add clam 
broth and simmer 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile cook spaghetti in boiling, salted water according to package 
directions, or until just tender. Drain well. Return spaghetti to pan. Add 
anchovy mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix well. Makes 2 
servings. BUCATINI WITH ROASTED PEPPER CREAM 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium sweet red pepper 
</P>
<P>
 8 ounces bucatini 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium shallot 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 teaspoons chopped red jalapeno chiles 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons creme fraiche, or 1 tablespoon sour cream and 1 tablespoon 
whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chopped arugula 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons diced mild goat cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Place sweet red pepper over flame of stove and turn to blacken all sides. Or 
blacken under broiler. Remove and place in plastic food bag. Seal bag and set 
aside 20 to 30 minutes. Remove pepper from bag. Place under cold running water 
and scrape off skin with paring knife. Core and seed pepper. Cut into bite-size 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, cook bucatini in boiling, salted water according to package 
directions, or until just tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Puree pepper in blender along with shallot, chile, creme fraiche, 1/4 teaspoon 
salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Drain pasta well and pour pepper mixture over top. Toss well. Add arugula and 
goat cheese and toss again until cheese melts. Makes 2 servings.

 When did you last taste a carrot so sugar-sweet and richly flavored it seemed 
almost a different vegetable? When was the last time you pulled from the earth 
a fat round carrot no bigger than the tip of your thumb? When did you bite into 
a carrot so richly orange it was almost scarlet? And when did you munch on a 
single carrot that gave you more Vitamin A than the recommended minimum daily 
allowance?  
</P>
<P>
 The problem with carrots raised for mass marketing is that they're selected 
for one quality: They can be pulled and processed by a machine without 
breaking. By and large, they're Imperator types -- handsome extra-strong roots, 
but flavor is not on their resume.  
</P>
<P>
 The royalty of carrotdom are crisp rich orange Nantes types, long and straight 
with squarish tips, no core and glorious flavor. Developed in the 19th Century 
in France, Nantes are the carrots in French markets today. Since Nantes are too 
fragile for machine harvesting, to taste them in this country you must grow 
them yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nantes are at least 5 1/2 inches long, but there's delight and good flavor in 
baby carrots -- skinny and three inches long, or a fat inch around. These are 
not prematurely picked Nantes or Imperators, but actual types of carrots that 
are the easiest to grow and fastest to mature. 
</P>
<P>
 You can find carrots called "babies" in most markets, but unless you bought 
them from an honest farmer, they're probably what are known in the trade as 
"grinder baby carrots." Slender carrots pulled from the earth at six inches 
long, they're then cut in half and shaped at both ends to appear as two. 
Counterfeits. 
</P>
<P>
 The real things are slender three-inch cultivars such as Little Finger, 
Minicor and Baby Sweet Hybrid, and small beet-shaped carrots, the most 
noteworthy these days being Thumbelina, tender and sweet and ranging in size 
from grape to plum. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing carrots takes attention. The seeds are fine; they germinate slowly and 
irregularly and must never be allowed to dry out. A cover of burlap kept moist 
until they germinate is good insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trick to growing carrots effortlessly is to sow them so you don't have to 
thin them, but close enough so their roots will crowd out -- and leaves will 
shade out -- weeds. That's from two to four inches apart, depending on the 
thickness of the carrots. Stokes Seeds offers pelleted carrot seeds, which 
helps keep seeds moist while germinating and makes it easier to sow thinly. 
Otherwise, mix seeds with builder's sand (or raw Cream of Wheat) for easy 
visibility and handling. Sow seeds every few weeks during the season for an 
abundant and continuous supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrots need at least five hours of sun a day and normal amounts of water. 
Their ferny leaves (all you see) make a lovely addition to the mixed border, 
although they'll leave a bare space when you pull them up, so consider that in 
your plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal carrot soil is sandy loam, or at least something friable and 
well-draining. If your soil is clay or filled with rocks and you're feeling 
lazy, grow baby carrots in a foot-deep container filled with a good-quality 
soilless mix. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if your soil is inhospitable to carrots and you feel energetic, build a 
raised bed for them. Make a box with 10-inch-wide planks and fill with the 
closest thing you can get to sandy loam. The problem with adding organic 
amendments to clay soil for growing carrots is that materials high in nitrogen 
-- compost, rotted manure and such -- will make the carrots hairy and cause 
them to fork. It's best to work these amendments somewhere else and grow 
carrots there next year. But it's worth trying Red Cored Chantenay, Danvers 
Halflong and Thumbelina on problem soils. 
</P>
<P>
 To grow long carrots in hospitable soil, you must dig it to a fine tilth a 
foot deep, taking out all rocks. I've done this a few times, but I'd rather 
grow baby carrots and prepare the soil just six or eight inches down. It is 
true that the deeper the soil, the better the carrots, no matter what size. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, I also concentrate on the carrots rich in Vitamin A: A-Plus Hybrid 
is remarkably rich in the vitamin, and Sweetness Hybrid has both beta carotene 
(precursor of Vitamin A) and extra sweet flavor. Tastier than a pill. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby-type carrots -- except for Baby Spike and Thumbelina -- must be harvested 
at the length given in the catalogue. Should the weather turn hot or should the 
carrots be stressed any other way, these delicacies grow too big too fast and 
lose their quality. You won't know whether the carrot is ready to harvest until 
you've pulled it up, and once you've pulled it up, there's no setting it back 
in the soil. The solution? On a marker at each patch note its name and expected 
date of harvest -- that way, none will be lost to bumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other varieties store well in the ground without losing too much quality, 
although they won't have the texture and flavor of those dug at their 
appropriate time. I've even discovered carrots a year after sowing and although 
they were hairy, they were still sweet. Berlicummers are the best keepers. 
Store carrots in a cool, dark place with good circulation of air.  
</P>
<P>
 If you live in the low desert, you can sow carrots now -- time to plant is 
from early autumn through mid-winter. But generally hereabouts, carrots are 
sown from mid-winter through early autumn. In the high desert, sow late winter 
and early spring, then again in early autumn. In the mountains, sow mid-spring 
through late summer. Along the coast, sow late winter through mid-spring. Baby 
carrots are ready in less than two months; bigger ones take a couple of weeks 
longer. Sources:

 Don't peel carrots; you'll lose nourishment and flavor. To be convinced, 
remove a strip of skin with a vegetable peeler and taste -- you'll be amazed at 
the depth of flavor. Do scrub carrots well, however, just before cooking.  
</P>
<P>
 These gin-baked carrots are superb for entertaining. Gin itself is flavored 
with piney-tasting juniper berries, but most of the time, the juniper cooks 
away, leaving a hint of itself and enhanced flavor in the dish -- a dashing 
catalyst.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, add a handful of finely chopped fresh leaves of chervil, 
tarragon, flat-leaf parsley, thyme, sage, mint, cilantro, lovage, celery, 
fennel or dill. Try a tablespoon of finely shredded fresh ginger root. Sprinkle 
over a rounded teaspoon of fennel, caraway, dill, celery, sesame or nigella 
seeds. Add a veil of ground mace, nutmeg or coriander, or Chinese five-spice, 
curry powder or chili powder. CARROTS IN GIN

<P>
 1 3/4 to 2 pounds tender young carrots, preferably about 1 1/2 inches long and 
1/2 inch wide (larger carrots can be used), scrubbed but not peeled 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup gin, or water 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into very thin slices 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh herbs to taste 
</P>
<P>
 Leave baby carrots whole, trimming stem ends. To make baby-size pieces from 
large carrots, if thick, slice in quarters lengthwise to point where carrot is 
1/2 inch wide. Cut on diagonal to make pieces 1 1/2 inches long. If desired, 
use vegetable peeler to round edges of quartered pieces. You will need 7 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn carrots into 13x9-inch baking dish or 3-quart dish in which carrots can 
be no more than 1 inch deep. Add gin, salt, sugar and pepper to taste. 
Distribute flakes of butter over top, then pour over water. Cover tightly with 
foil (shiny side down) and bake in center of 400-degree oven until carrots test 
tender with thin skewer, about 40 minutes for babies and 50 minutes for older 
carrots. If convenient, stir carrots once while baking. Remove from oven and 
continue, or refrigerate until ready to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 To finish, turn contents of baking dish into broad, heavy skillet. Cook over 
highest heat, stirring frequently with wooden spoon, until all liquid has 
evaporated, butter remains and carrots are shiny. Adjust seasonings to taste. 
Add fresh herbs to taste. Turn into hot serving dish. Makes 8 servings.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: KANDY-KOLORED TUBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Chuck Barris had designed vegetables instead of hot rods in the '60s, he 
might have come up with something like olluco , an alarming-looking tuber from 
the high Peruvian Andes with Kustom Kar written all over it, sometimes 
salmon-pink, sometimes tangerine, most often canary yellow freckled with 
brilliant hot-pink spots. On visual evidence, olluco could be one of the lost 
crops of the Incas that might profitably have stayed lost. 
</P>
<P>
 But taste. Cooked, usually as the Peruvian stew olluquitos con carne , olluco 
has a sort of reassuringly neutral hue, a slippery crunch, and a mildly acidic 
flavor a little like roasted sweet peppers. Maybe because of its hot-zone 
color, maybe because it is difficult to grow outside the high Andes and isn't 
really imported much, olluco is only slightly easier to find in Los Angeles 
than Arequipa-style fried guinea pig. 
</P>
<P>
 El Hatuchay is a long, neat dining room in the back of a North Hollywood 
mini-mall, Machu Picchu travel posters on the walls and Peruvian pop on the 
tape deck, photocopied menus in front of each place on the glass-topped tables. 
Unlike other Peruvian restaurants in Los Angeles, most of which specialize in 
either Latinized Chinese dishes -- chifa -- or the rugged seafood cuisine of 
Lima's port suburb Callao, El Hatuchay seems to concentrate on Peruvian 
mountain food, the spicy, tuber-happy cooking of the Andes: tripe stewed with 
potatoes and mint; spicy stewed beef in a cilantro puree; carapulcra , a thick, 
mild stew made with chuno , the famous, slightly chewy freeze-dried potatoes 
grown in the highest agricultural region in the world. El Hatuchay is packed at 
mealtime, as a restaurant with a $4.95 fixed-price menu should be. 
</P>
<P>
 El Hatuchay has the usual chifa -style food: fried rice; won-ton soup; the 
crunchy bits of fried chicken called chicharrones de pollo , and a 
tamarind-based version of sweet-and-sour pork. (The standard chifa dish, a 
stir-fry of beef, onion and French fries that is often the only dependable 
thing in a Peruvian greasy spoon, is sort of boring here, flavorless without a 
few squeezes of the fresh hot-pepper sauce aji .) 
</P>
<P>
 The $4.95 dinner includes a soft drink and an appetizer, usually papas a la 
Huancaina , thinly sliced potatoes in a cool, slightly spicy cheese sauce, 
which is just as well because the other listed appetizer, causa rellena , is 
usually just two skips from regular deli potato salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Often it seems as if instead of red and white wine, Peruvian restaurants have 
Crush and Inca Cola, which is the bright-yellow color of Depression-era 
Vaseline glass and tastes almost exactly like a tincture of Bazooka bubble gum. 
(In Peru, Inca Cola's not-too-compelling slogan is " Es Nuestra " -- It's 
Ours.) Sometimes there is chicha morada here instead, a tart, violently purple 
Kool-Aid kind of thing made from steeped Andean purple corn. 
</P>
<P>
 And El Hatuchay has olluquitos in spades -- sweet, pleasantly vegetal, with a 
stewed-rutabaga texture, a bit of beef and a subtle hint of chile. You'll find 
better olluquitos in the picanterias of Pisac, but they'll probably be 
garnished with dried alpaca meat.

GOOD COOKING: PAELLA WITHOUT THE MEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's an informal vegetarian menu, built around a substantial roasted 
vegetable paella. It begins with a zesty Greek salad of Kalamata olives, 
vegetables and feta cheese, spooned into the inner leaves from romaine hearts 
-- perfect finger food to serve with drinks. For dessert, a soothing, delicate 
baked citrus custard, topped with a sprinkling of fresh raspberries or a warm 
caramel sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 This entire menu can be made ahead, and all the recipes are easily doubled or 
tripled. (However, each recipe for paella must be roasted in its own pan so the 
vegetables have room to brown.) If you are tempted to extend an invitation to 
friends who eat meat, this menu can be rounded out with simply roasted herbed 
lamb or chicken, served with their pan juices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This salad can be spooned into the leaves as a do-it-yourself finger food or 
attractively arranged on a salad plate where a knife and fork are more 
appropriate. The salad itself is best made a day in advance, except for the 
feta cheese and diced tomatoes, which are mixed in just before serving. This 
salad mixture would also be great in warm pita bread.  
</P>
<P>
 GREEK OLIVE SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup small dice celery 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup Kalamata olives, pitted, flesh cut into pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup small dice pimiento, well drained 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup small dice, peeled, seeded cucumber 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon water 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon dried basil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup small dice feta cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup small dice seeded tomato 
</P>
<P>
 20 chilled medium romaine heart leaves 
</P>
<P>
 In 1-quart bowl, combine celery, olives, green onions, pimiento, cucumber, 
olive oil, lemon juice, water, oregano and basil. Toss to combine well. 
Refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to 2 days. Let come to room temperature 
before using. Gently stir in cheese and tomato. Adjust seasonings and lemon to 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve as appetizer, arrange lettuce leaves on platter. Put salad in small 
bowl to fit into middle of platter for guests to help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternately, as salad, spoon salad mixture into lettuce leaves. Arrange on 
chilled salad plates, dividing evenly. Also, romaine leaves can be thinly 
sliced crosswise, mounded on salad plates, with salad mixture spooned over. 
Makes 4 servings.

 Don't be put off by the long list of ingredients. This is an impressive 
vegetarian main course that can be made in advance. As with Asian fried rice, 
this rice roasts better after it is chilled. These specific vegetables 
complement one another in color as well as flavor, but you can vary vegetables 
as you wish; just be sure to use about 14 cups of vegetables cut into similarly 
sized chunks.  
</P>
<P>
 ROASTED VEGETABLE PAELLA 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups long-grain converted rice 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
 3 1/2 cups vegetable broth 
</P>
<P>
 Pulverized saffron 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/16 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 cups halved small red potatoes 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups quartered small red onions 
</P>
<P>
 1 green pepper, cored, seeded, cut into 1-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 sweet red pepper, cored, seeded, cut into 1-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 3 1/2 cups 1-inch cubes unpeeled zucchini 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups seeded, quartered small tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups 1-inch cubes peeled large carrots 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup trimmed, halved medium white (or cremini) mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 
rice and 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic. Cook until mixture is fragrant and hot, 
about 3 minutes, stirring often. Add vegetable broth, dash saffron, 1/2 
teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Bring to boil. Simmer, covered, until rice 
absorbs liquid but is still firm, about 11 minutes. Refrigerate rice until 
chilled. Can be made up to 2 days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine 1/4 teaspoon pulverized saffron with 1 tablespoon warm water or 
vegetable broth. Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon garlic, 
cayenne and 1 teaspoon salt in small saute pan and add saffron-water mixture. 
Gently heat until garlic just begins to sizzle. Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Place potatoes, onions, peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, carrots and mushrooms in 
large shallow roasting pan. Toss with oil mixture until well coated. Arrange 
vegetables in single layer and roast at 450 degrees until just beginning to be 
tender, about 35 minutes, turning after 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Add chilled rice and mix well. Continue to roast until rice is fully cooked 
and vegetables are browned, about 30 to 40 more minutes, stirring twice during 
roasting. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Can be made 1 day ahead and refrigerated. Let come to room temperature before 
reheating. Reheat, covered, in 350-degree oven until hot, about 30 to 40 
minutes, sprinkling little vegetable broth or water over mixture if it seems 
dry. Stir once midway. Makes 4 servings.

 Caramel and raspberries are a great combination with citrus flavor. The 
custard is best made a day ahead and refrigerated, although it can be made just 
a few hours ahead and served at room temperature. Do not try to unmold the 
custards, as they are very fragile and tend to split.  
</P>
<P>
 BAKED CITRUS CUSTARD 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup milk 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1 large egg yolk 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup orange juice concentrate 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup warm caramel sauce and/or 1/2 pint raspberries 
</P>
<P>
 In pan, heat cream and milk until just beginning to scald. Keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 In food processor fitted with metal blade or blender, process sugar and lemon 
zest until zest is finely minced. Transfer to mixer bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Use mixer to whip eggs and egg yolk with lemon sugar until light-colored and 
slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Add cornstarch, orange juice concentrate 
and lemon juice. Mix well. With mixer on medium, slowly add hot milk mixture. 
Mix until combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide among 4 (3/4-cup) ramekins or souffle dishes. Place ramekins in 
high-sided baking pan large enough to hold all ramekins. Set pan on oven rack. 
Pour boiling water into baking pan until water reaches halfway up sides of 
ramekins. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 300 degrees until custard is almost set but still jiggles slightly in 
center, about 25 to 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove ramekins from pan to cool. Once cooled, they can be refrigerated up to 
2 days. Serve chilled or at room temperature. Garnish with caramel sauces and 
raspberries. Makes 4 servings.

KITCHEN MATRIARCHS; STILL COOKING AT 90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to live a long and healthy life? Eat Chinese food. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the advice from Madame S.T. Ting Wong, pioneer Chinese cooking teacher 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong was 72 -- a mere adolescent -- when she wrote "Madame Wong's Long-Life 
Chinese Cookbook." Now she is 90, and her vigor proves that her book offered 
more than just a catchy title. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong became a legend when she taught at UCLA Extension. Her classes were 
jammed, and those on the waiting list gnashed their teeth as regulars enrolled 
again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 They came for the wonderful food, and for Wong's peppery comments and 
no-nonsense philosophy. "A bombshell of intercultural energy" is the way former 
UCLA Arts/Extension director Robert Bartlett Hass describes her in the 
introduction to her book. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wong taught extension classes for 25 years. She still teaches privately, cooks 
Chinese food daily, does her own marketing and maintains her own apartment in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Her code of life is this: "Be optimistic. Ignore bad things. Love people. 
Think of others more." And, of course, eat well-balanced meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bean curd and bok choy -- those are my favorites," Wong says. For breakfast 
she eats half a bowl of congee (rice soup) with a few vegetables. For lunch she 
might have steamed fish and a vegetable. Dinner includes a soup. 
</P>
<P>
 What really keeps her going, though, is her wide circle of friends, many of 
them former students. "They inspired me. They encouraged me. You have no idea 
how sweet their words were to me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong still hears from people she taught 60 years ago in China. Born in 
Shanghai, she taught there and in Hong Kong before resettling in the United 
States. A second book, "More Long-Life Cooking From Madame Wong," came out in 
1982.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wong's former students include Barbra Streisand, Michael Caine, Dinah Shore, 
Linda Evans, Debbie Reynolds and Wolfgang Puck. She did not realize Streisand 
was in the class until university officials told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's favorite dish was crispy duck, Wong says. She taught Puck how to 
make it at Chinois and shows photographs of the two of them in the kitchen 
there. Puck celebrated one of her birthdays with a seven-course dinner.  
</P>
<P>
 Her 90th birthday party was held at the Plum Tree Inn in West Los Angeles. 
Invitations in Chinese lucky red bore a golden character meaning longevity 
twined around a peach, a traditional symbol of longevity. (Wong actually has 
two birthdays. Here, she celebrates on Oct. 2. The equivalent date on the 
Chinese calendar is Sept. 4, she says.) 
</P>
<P>
 Wong's party at the Plum Tree Inn featured a dinner that included spicy shrimp 
(a recipe that appears in her cookbook as imperial shrimp), velvet chicken, 
green beans and longevity noodle soup, containing noodles almost as long as her 
life.

 Although Wong is generous with advice and recipes, she keeps one secret: The 
crisp, lightly sweetened nuts she packs in jars bearing her own printed red 
label. A food company once wanted to market the nuts, but that never happened. 
</P>

 "In life, as in food, there are four kinds of taste," she says. "Sweet, sour, 
bitter and spicy. What has happened in your life happens in your food. You must 
go through these four tastes. If you lose them, that is the end of your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Far from losing her tastes, Wong is already looking forward to her 100th 
birthday. In her first cookbook, she wrote: "My uncle is 90 years old. His 
principle of living is laughter." And, "at 72, I cannot lose a moment to be 
unhappy." That's good advice at any age. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who were never fortunate enough to attend Wong's classes, here are 
three of her recipes, including Streisand's favorite duck, and congee like the 
one that Wong eats for breakfast. MADAME WONG'S CRISPY DUCK

KITCHEN MATRIARCHS; THE UNSINKABLE MADAME WU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Rolls Royce Silver Cloud rolls silently to the curb at Drago Restaurant. 
Madame Wu, looking regal in an upswept hairdo and Emanuelle Kahn glasses, opens 
the door and steps out, ignoring the proffered hand of the valet. This is one 
woman who needs no help from anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 For a woman who owns a city block of prime Santa Monica property and is a 
legend among restaurateurs in a town where restaurants die faster than the 
latest diet fad, Sylvia Wu amazes even herself. "I don't know where I got my 
ambition," she says. "As a Chinese woman I wasn't supposed to know anything 
about business. My husband didn't think I could run a restaurant by myself. He 
still doesn't, but I knew I could and did." 
</P>
<P>
 Wu, like her husband King Yan Wu, was born into a wealthy, political family in 
the early part of the century. When the Japanese invaded China, Wu's family 
fled to Hong Kong, where she befriended the first lady of China, Mme. Sun 
Yat-Sen, whose style and presence has been an inspiration to Wu throughout her 
life. King Yan Wu's father was ambassador to the United States in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "During my 12 years as a housewife in New York, I didn't know how to cook," Wu 
says. "I am thankful that my husband's mother sent us a cook. That's how I was 
able to show my restaurant cook how to prepare certain dishes." 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant started out with so-called Chinese dishes, some she had never 
heard of in China. "I never heard of egg foo yung and pressed duck, but that's 
what was being served in Chinese restaurants in those days," she says. "Now we 
don't serve any of those dishes."  
</P>
<P>
 Wu's ability to adapt quickly to change was probably what saved her restaurant 
from extinction. When the Pritikin Diet made a big splash, Wu came up with a 
"Long-Life Diet" (a name suggested by former Los Angeles Times restaurant 
critic Lois Dwan) imitating Pritikin's low-fat, low-salt, low-cholesterol 
restrictions. The Peking duck served at Madame Wu's Garden has no fat on the 
crisp skin. "In China, people like the fatty skin, but not here. We fan the 
duck dry and let the fat completely drain off."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She acted on her customers' needs and dietary requirements with dispatch. 
"Lawrence Welk wanted whole steamed duck and vegetables, so that's what we 
served him," she says. Cary Grant came into the restaurant one day raving about 
a chicken salad he had at a restaurant on La Cienega and asked why Wu didn't 
try something like it herself. Wu, remembering a Chinese banquet dish made with 
chicken, won tons and puffy noodles, came up with a Chinese chicken salad that 
has been copied by restaurants from here to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu has operated her restaurant since 1959 -- in two successive locations. She 
started out where Drago is now, but moved a few years later to the grand, 
12,000-square-foot exemplar of stylized Asian postmodern architecture, designed 
by architect Guy Moore, on 22nd Street in Santa Monica. She thinks she may be 
ready to let go, but not just yet. Who can give up a celebrity hangout where 
Cary Grant, Jimmy Doolittle, Robert Redford and Jane Fonda were at home? The 
memories!  
</P>
<P>
 And the dishes: Terrific Peking duck that is still served to visiting 
dignitaries; wonderful crab puffs that melt in your mouth; shrimp toast and 
Wu's beef (a version of orange beef without the orange). 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Wu refuses to stop working. She is a powerful presence at her 
restaurant, flitting from table to table, making small talk, checking the 
kitchen (although she throws up her hands at times), listening to requests and 
making suggestions with patience. Her energy, enthusiasm and positive outlook 
haven't waned an iota. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She loves being with her children and grandchildren and insists on regular 
Tuesday family dinners at her restaurant. On Sundays, her second son, George, a 
judge, does the cooking.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love young people," she says and wishes she would see more of them at her 
restaurant. (Friday's "crime night," in which diners solve a mystery during 
dinner, is an effort to attract a young crowd that she keeps going no matter 
what.) But she's happy. "I'm at peace. I love my life and I think I have 
accomplished something. My name is known wherever I go." 
</P>
<P>
 Wu is also well known for her philanthropy, having endowed a scholarship 
foundation at Marymount High School in her late daughter's name, as a Music 
Center patron for years and having given numerous dinners at her restaurant for 
charities.  
</P>
<P>
 "You know something," she says. "Years ago, I sold this restaurant (now the 
Drago location) to a French couple for $15,000" . . . " $15,000 ," she repeats, 
as if she herself can't fathom it. "You know how much they sold it for? 
$300,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Regrets? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no, not really. Everything is meant to be," she says. TOSSED SHREDDED

ROASTING EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NATHALIE DUPREE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I used to think the only kind of meat dishes that were possible for a busy day 
were quickly grilled chops or stir-fries. But elegant roasts such as a rib eye 
or tenderloin of beef, shoulder or leg of lamb, and pork loins and hams (both 
fresh and cured) are much easier to cook than a steak -- especially if you also 
need to prepare vegetables and get everything to come out at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember the first roast I fixed as a young bride more than 30 years ago. I 
invited my best friend's parents and the Van den Bergs, who were like second 
parents to me. I was terrified. I had never roasted a large piece of meat 
before. I rubbed it with seasonings and put it in the oven, set the timer and 
sat back, incredulous that this was all there was to it. It gave me time to set 
the table, do my hair and be completely relaxed when my guests arrived. It was 
miraculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain cuts of meat lend themselves to long, slow cooking, whether as roasts 
or as stews. These are usually the more flavorful, less tender cuts such as 
chuck, brisket and eye of round. Ground meat can also take a long cooking, 
either in Bolognese meat sauce (which cooks unattended all day) or a savory 
meat loaf, which is cooked, like a roast, according to weight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another advantage of cooking a large piece of meat or batch of stew is the 
bonus of reheatable leftovers, the biggest boon of all to busy cooks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My friend Alma regularly prepares this brisket, varying it each time, 
sometimes adding potatoes, carrots or peas along with, or instead of, lima 
beans. Not only is this brisket tastier and easier to slice the next day, it 
also keeps nicely for several days.  
</P>
<P>
 ALMA'S BRISKET AND LIMAS ONE-POT MEAL 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups dried lima beans 
</P>
<P>
 1 (2- to 2 1/2-pound) brisket 
</P>
<P>
 3 large onions, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups red or rose wine, beef stock or water 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup brandy or dry Sherry 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup ketchup 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 cups peeled and chunked vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, beans, 
peas, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Combine beans with water to cover by about 1 inch in large bowl. Soak 4 to 24 
hours. Drain and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat large Dutch oven. Place brisket in it, brown meat on 1 side, then turn 
and brown other side. Add lima beans, onions, wine, garlic, bay leaves, oregano 
and rosemary. Bring to boil. Reduce heat. Cover and simmer 2 hours or bake at 
300 degrees 2 hours. Brisket can be refrigerated at this point 1 to 2 days. 
Bring to boil on top of stove before continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add brandy, ketchup, 
vinegar, Worcestershire and vegetables. Cover and simmer on low heat, or bake 
at 300 degrees until vegetables are tender, about 1 hour. Remove bay leaves. 
Makes 4 servings.

 Meat loaf doesn't take long to put together, though it takes its time in the 
oven. I must admit I love the smell of meat loaf as much as the taste. It's 
good freshly made, but it's even better reheated the next day, and the 
leftovers also make wonderful sandwiches. I double the recipe when I am able to 
and freeze one of the loaves for another time. This is very good to use for 
leftover cooked rice.  
</P>
<P>
 This meat loaf combines what Paul Prudhomme calls the "trinity" of Cajun 
cooking: onions, garlic and peppers. The horseradish gives it an extra zing, 
and you can vary the spiciness with additional hot pepper sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 CAJUN COUNTRY MEAT LOAF 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound ground beef 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound ground pork

 On my first trip to Italy in 1971, I sat in a workingman's cafe in Bologna, 
trying to relate this Bolognese sauce to the long-cooked spaghetti sauces of my 
childhood. Unlike them, it was meaty, pale pink in color and, in fact, really 
had very little of what we think of as sauce. According to Marcella Hazan, who 
opened my eyes even more to the cooking of this region through her books and 
classes, Bolognese sauce is not traditionally served on spaghetti at all, but 
on any one of a number of other pastas.  
</P>
<P>
 Purists will applaud the addition of milk -- which, as I learned from Hazan, 
tempers the acidity -- but will decry the garlic and sugar, although I believe 
they round it out further.  
</P>
<P>
 This sauce cooks with little attention for a minimum of three hours. It likes 
even more time and needs a large, heavy pot. This makes two meals for four to 
six people. I usually serve one batch and freeze one.  
</P>
<P>
 If possible, reduce the wine and tomatoes and their juice separately. But if 
you have little time to watch, add them together after the milk has boiled away 
completely. The liquid in the sauce should be almost gone, with the meat and 
fat coating the pasta as a butter sauce would.  
</P>
<P>
 BOLOGNESE MEAT SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 5 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium onions, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 celery stalks, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 carrots, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 1 (28-ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes, cut up, with their juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 3 pounds pasta such as tortellini, rigatoni, conchiglie, fusilli  
</P>
<P>
 Freshly grated imported Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil and 3 tablespoons butter in large pan. Add onions and cook until 
tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, celery and carrots. Cook, stirring, 2 to 3 
minutes. Crumble beef into pan and cook, stirring, until beef starts to look 
cooked, 4 to 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Add milk. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until milk has evaporated. 
Season to taste with pepper. Add nutmeg and wine. Bring to boil. Reduce heat 
and simmer until evaporated. Stir in tomatoes. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and 
cook over very low heat, uncovered, until liquid is evaporated. (Process can be 
interrupted now or at any point from here on and partially finished sauce may 
be refrigerated. To resume, return sauce to boil before lowering heat to simmer 
and continuing.) 
</P>
<P>
 When reduced, stir in water and let simmer again. Repeat process until mixture 
has cooked total 3 to 4 hours. (Fat will rise to surface and separate; this is 
necessary to coat pasta.) Season to taste with sugar, salt and pepper. Sauce 
will keep, refrigerated, 2 to 3 days, or can be frozen up to 3 months. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to serve, toss hot sauce with cooked, drained pasta, remaining 2 
tablespoons butter and Parmesan cheese to taste. Makes 8 to 12 servings.

HOME COOK: SOUPS OUT OF STORAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mrs. Beeton's Cookery and Household Management," published in 1861, had it. 
Marion Harland's "Complete Cookbook," published in 1903, had it. "The Joy of 
Cooking," published in 1931, had it. I taught it in my first cooking classes in 
1968.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about mulligatawny, one of the many soups we seem to have 
forgotten these days, along with boula-boula, cock-a-leekie, kreplach and 
Senegalese. Each had its moment of glory, but for a recipe to survive and 
continue to appear in cookbooks for 130 years is surely some kind of a triumph. 
I've never missed some of the old soups, and I've never even tasted others, but 
I've elected myself a rescue team of one to save a couple of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligatawny and Senegalese are wonderful -- and ideally suited for fall. You 
never know about the weather this time of the year; it can be cloudy and cold, 
or clear and hot. These antique soups will answer either climate. Senegalese is 
served chilled, with a spoonful of chutney in the center of the soup dish; hot 
mulligatawny comes with a dollop of steaming white rice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lemon madeleines are a cross between cookies and small cakes. They are 
meant to go with either fresh or cooked fruit. Either soup will be nicely 
finished off with fruit and lemon madeleines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sliced cold bananas are often served with this soup.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chutney 
</P>
<P>

fluffy, pale yellow and tripled in volume, about 3 minutes. Add vanilla and 
salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Sift half of flour over batter and gently fold in only until mixed. Repeat 
with second half of flour, then gently fold in melted butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon generous tablespoon batter into each well-buttered madeleine mold. Do 
not level batter. Bake at 400 degrees about 10 minutes, until edges are golden 
and madeleines lift easily out of mold. 
</P>

THE NEGLECTED LUXURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In America, smoked fish is strangely overlooked, its use limited in many homes 
to occasional brunches of lox with bagels and cream cheese? 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the meal, nothing is simpler to serve, since smoked fish is ready 
to eat. On its own, it is one of the most elegant of first courses. Smoked 
salmon, for example, is a luxurious starter served at the finest of 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, smoked fish is also valuable as a flavoring. In green salads it 
makes a tasty, light substitute for bacon, contributing a similar smoky flavor. 
Strips of smoked fish are terrific with neutral-tasting, quick-cooking foods 
such as pasta and eggs. One of my favorite dishes at deli-type restaurants is 
lox and eggs. At home, I often make a quick-cooking dish of herbed noodles with 
smoked cod and roasted peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rice, too, benefits from the addition of smoked fish. A delicious rice salad I 
enjoyed in France featured smoked haddock, tomatoes, peppers, capers and 
parsley vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Far East, I discovered a way to match fish with rice for breakfast. A 
bowl of congee (the Chinese rice porridge otherwise known as juk ) was 
accompanied by small plates of savory items, including cured fish. It might 
seem like a curious combination, but it makes as much sense as lox with bagels, 
since a small amount of the fish flavors the bland, starchy food. 
</P>
<P>
 African cooks have long recognized that smoked fish adds good flavor to other 
foods. They often cook it with greens, as in Zairian spinach with smoked 
whitefish. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoked fish keeps well and is convenient to have on hand for a quick meal. 
Some types, such as smoked cod, haddock and herring, are reasonably priced. 
Even with expensive smoked salmon you can prepare economical dishes by 
combining the salmon with rice, pasta, eggs or vegetables; a little goes a long 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 You can buy smoked fish at fish markets, delis and at the fish and deli 
departments of supermarkets. Most do not need cooking. The exceptions are 
smoked haddock, sometimes labeled finnan haddie (which requires brief poaching 
in milk) and kippered herring (which is often broiled). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in smoked fish seems to be growing, at least in my neighborhood. At 
my local market there are new kinds of smoked salmon in such enticing flavors 
as dill smoked salmon, pepper smoked salmon and even Cajun smoked salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can prepare this colorful, easy dish with a creamy sauce or as a leaner 
version with vegetable oil. It is good with packaged barbecued cod, which turns 
the sauce bright orange, or with lox or smoked salmon. This is an adaptation 
from the cookbook I co-authored with Fernand Chambrette, "La Cuisine du 
Poisson" (Flammarion: Paris).  
</P>
<P>
 HERBED NOODLES WITH SMOKED COD AND ROASTED PEPPER 
</P>
<P>
 2 roasted green pepper halves from jar or 1 fresh green pepper, roasted 
</P>
<P>
 6 ounces smoked or barbecued cod, bones and skin removed 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup whipping cream or 2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound dried herb-flavored noodles or fettuccine 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons chopped green onions 
</P>
<P>
 4 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon, or 1/4 cup 1/8-inch-wide strips of basil 
leaves 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cut roasted green pepper halves into 1/4-inch strips. Cut cod into 
1/2x1/2x1/4-inch dice. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring cream to bare simmer in small saucepan. Add cod and heat through on low 
heat. If using oil, heat gently with cod over low heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook pasta, uncovered, in large pan of boiling, salted water over high heat 
until tender but firm to bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well. Transfer to heated 
bowl. Add cod mixture and toss. Add pepper strips, green onions, tarragon and 
salt and pepper to taste. Adjust seasonings to taste before serving. Makes 4 
first-course or 2 to 3 main-course servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : If using fresh green pepper, roast directly on burner or in broiler, 
turning often with tongs, until skin blackens. Place in plastic food bag and 
close bag. Let stand 10 minutes. Use knife to peel pepper. Halve pepper and 
discard seeds and ribs. Drain any liquid from inside pepper. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For this dish, Zairians generally use the type of smoked fish that requires 
cooking, such as smoked haddock or finnan haddie. Ready-to-eat smoked fish 
makes this dish quicker and easier to prepare. I like to use smoked whitefish.  
</P>
<P>
 This recipe was given to me by Mrs. Monzili, the wife of a colonel in the 
Zairian army. She serves the spinach accompanied by rice, plantains or boiled 
or steamed potatoes.  
</P>
<P>
 ZAIRIAN SPINACH WITH SMOKED FISH IN TOMATO SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 2 (10-ounce) packages fresh spinach leaves 
</P>
<P>
 1 (28-ounce) can plum tomatoes, drained 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 4 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 large onions, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound smoked whitefish, skinned and boned 
</P>
<P>
 Hot cooked rice 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse and stem spinach. Coarsely chop spinach and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Puree tomatoes in food processor or blender. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in large saucepan or Dutch oven. Add onions and saute over medium 
heat until golden, 10 minutes. Add pureed tomatoes, salt and pepper to taste 
and red pepper flakes. Bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat and cook until 
thickened, 10 minutes. Add chopped spinach and cook over medium-low heat until 
tender, about 7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Flake whitefish in about 1/2-inch pieces. Add to spinach mixture. Heat 1 to 2 
minutes over low heat and serve. Makes 3 to 4 main-course servings with rice.

 CLINTON IS COMING: He may not draw the same attention as Prince Charles has 
this week, but President Clinton is making a Southern California swing this 
weekend -- including a speaking engagement in Anaheim on Saturday. Clinton will 
address the National Assn. of Realtors at its annual gathering at the Anaheim 
Convention Center, at 9:15 a.m. . . . It's quite a switch for this group -- 
Republican presidential hopeful Jack F. Kemp was the scheduled speaker.

 WUNDERINGS: It's a busy time for Severin Wunderman, who founded the 
10-year-old Irvine museum bearing his name. The museum will exhibit next week 
one of its biggest projects, 200 pieces from the late Vaslav Nijinsky, the 
renowned ballet dancer who turned to art late in life (OC Live!). . . . 
Wunderman, 55, whose company makes Gucci timepieces, is also selling his South 
Laguna home on Camel Point. One of the most imposing properties on the coast, 
it's on the market for $10.8 million. But that includes a guest house. 
</P>
<P>
 SALVAGED ART: Leave it to an artist to find the silver lining in disaster. 
Irvine Valley College is displaying "Out of the Fire" featuring objects 
salvaged from last year's Laguna Beach firestorm. . . . Artist Rob Brennan 
gathered material from fire victims, and artist Jerome Gastaldi, above, 
searched through the debris of his own destroyed home. Says Gastaldi: "In a 
way, I was responding to materials that had become more interesting visually."

 CORNHUSKETEERS? If you were Michael Eisner and planning your next big 
Disneyland, how high on your list of sites would you place . . . Nebraska? 
After the Virginia Disneyland plans fell through, U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) 
asked Eisner, on behalf of Omaha business leaders, to consider Nebraska for the 
next Disney amusement park. Kerry says it would work great, with Nebraska being 
the heart of America's heartland. The Disney chairman, ever the diplomat, told 
Kerry he'd be the first one called if it ever happened.

ITALY SUSPECTS MAY HAVE SHOT AT WRONG CAR

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men arrested for the fatal shooting of a 7-year-old California boy may 
have mistaken the family's car for one transporting jewels, news reports said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An anonymous source told police he had revealed to one of the suspects that a 
car similar to the one rented by the parents of Nicholas Green regularly 
carried jewels to stores in the area where he was shot, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were arrested Tuesday. The Italian news agency ANSA identified 
them as Michele Iannello, 26, and Francesco Mesiano, 21, both of Vibo Valentia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greens were driving through Calabria on the way to Sicily when robbers 
fired at their car Sept. 29. Nicholas, asleep in the back seat, was struck in 
the head.

DONN ARDEN, 79, PRODUCER OF LAS VEGAS SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donn Arden, who staged musical extravaganzas from Las Vegas to Paris for more 
than six decades, died Wednesday at age 79. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donn was the one who gave Las Vegas the glamour look that Vegas had," said 
his lifetime companion, Walter Craig. "He was a much larger-than-life person." 
</P>
<P>
 In nightclubs throughout the world, Arden incorporated into his floor shows 
such events as the sinking of the Titanic, the burning of San Francisco, the 
crash of the Hindenburg and Samson toppling the temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm famous for beautiful girls and major disasters," Arden told Los Angeles 
Times columnist Joe Bell in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Arden tried to re-create the burning of Atlanta for the opening of 
the Las Vegas MGM Grand in the 1980s, the estate of "Gone With the Wind" author 
Margaret Mitchell refused permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1915 in St. Louis, Arden said he got his show business start in his 
early teens, tap dancing for quarters in local speak-easies to help support his 
widowed mother. By the early 1930s, Arden's dancing was good enough to win a 
Charleston contest, along with another young St. Louis dancer named Ginger 
Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 A diminutive man, Arden added an extra "n" to his first name and joined the 
vaudeville circuit as a solo act, ultimately adding two sets of twin sisters to 
his act, called "Donn Arden and the Artists Models." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I first got into the staging and choreographing," Arden said in 
the earlier interview. "We had to change costumes and routines when we were 
held over. Staying in one place felt so good that I figured, why not add 10 
more girls and be a house line? So we did that, and sometimes we'd stay three 
or four years at a time at the same vaudeville house." 
</P>
<P>
 A contemporary of Fred Astaire, Arden's own dance career was eclipsed by his 
choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once had 12 shows running at the same time in the U.S.," Arden said. In New 
York, he "cornered the girl market -- before modeling came in. I wanted 'em 
tall and leggy. I wouldn't hire anyone under 5-foot-9 for a dance line. If a 
girl was beautiful, she knew I'd dress her better than anyone else. I'd spend 
$50 on shoes for my girls in those Depression days."

SCOTT HARRIS: THE MAYOR PLAYS 'I'VE GOT A SECRET' ON PROPOSITION 187 
</P>

 The Honorable Richard Riordan 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor 
</P>
<P>
 City of Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 200 North Spring Street 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, Calif. 90012 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Mayor Riordan, 
</P>
<P>
 There's something you're not telling us, and it's something we want to know. 
You owe it to the citizens of Los Angeles, and especially to those of us who 
voted to make you mayor. And for the record, Your Honor, that includes me. 
</P>
<P>
 So what gives? Are you voting yes or no on Proposition 187? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be shy. The question doesn't bite, and a single word will do. Either 
you're in favor of 187 as a means of addressing illegal immigration, or you 
think it's a mistake. Yes or no. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if you decide to let us in on this secret before Tuesday's ballot, some 
elaboration would be helpful. You could say: "We need to send a message that 
illegal immigration is wrong and blah blah blah." Or perhaps: "Proposition 187 
isn't the answer. It hurts children and blah blah blah." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we're stuck with lame explanations of why you won't tell us. Your 
poor press secretary, Noelia Rodriguez, has to repeat them over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I've been out with the mayor," she told me the other day, "he will 
usually say something to the effect that he's not going to take a stand, 
because doing so will be divisive for the city." She also said you consider 
your stand "a highly personal matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Mr. Mayor, "a highly personal matter" is whom you sleep with. Your 
political bedfellows, your political views -- those are public matters. You 
can't endorse Feinstein for Senate and Wilson for governor and then say: "Prop. 
187? Why, that's personal!" And since Feinstein and Wilson disagree on 187, 
it's all the more reason for you to take a position. 
</P>
<P>
 And this business that taking a stand might be "divisive." Well, don't flatter 
yourself. Do you think your opinion of Proposition 187 is more significant than 
the measure itself? Your silence hasn't stopped neighbor from turning against 
neighbor, and it hasn't stopped student protests. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to understand your dilemma. After all, you're a Republican, and 
your party and Gov. Wilson are supporting 187. But you're also a Catholic, and 
your church and Cardinal Mahony oppose it. Whatever you do, your decision will 
disappoint a lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The funny thing is, I thought you tipped us off months ago. Early in this 
campaign, you warned that illegal immigrants shouldn't be the scapegoats for 
California's economic woes. Your press secretary reminded me that you've been 
critical of the federal government's efforts to enforce existing immigration 
laws, and that you believe the federal government should compensate states for 
the cost. Moreover, Ms. Rodriguez emphasized that you don't "believe that 
anybody, especially children, should be denied such basic human services as 
education, health and nutrition." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all of this sounds suspiciously like a no vote. But maybe not. Maybe 
you'll vote yes because you think fears of 187 are overblown and you want to 
"send a message." Perhaps you agree with the full-page pro-187 ad that ran in 
the Daily News the other day that warned of Mexican "agents" and asked: "Is 
Mexico working to retake California?" Perhaps you agree with Washington pundit 
Pat Buchanan, who in The Times' Op-Ed pages on Oct. 28 wrote ominously of UC 
Berkeley Chancellor Chang Lin-Tien's prediction that by the year 2050, "the 
majority of Americans will trace their roots to Latin America, Africa, Asia, 
the Middle East and Pacific Islands." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but Lin-Tien's words would have described my high school 20 years ago, 
and they've described Los Angeles for many years. Seems to me that most of us 
Americans with European roots aren't as fearful as brother Buchanan. What about 
you? Do you share his concern that Southern California may someday secede from 
the union? Or does that strike you as fear mongering of alarmist, even 
paranoid, proportions? 
</P>
<P>
 One reason we elected you was that you weren't a traditional politician, so 
it's sad to see you acting like one. Wilson and Feinstein couldn't dodge it 
because their names are on the ballot. But we didn't elect you to arrive at a 
fork in the road and then stop in your tracks. We elected you to take the high 
road -- and we thought you might know which is which. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe you're reading this with a knowing smile. Perhaps, like a savvy 
poker player, you've been sandbagging, letting the chips pile up, hoping to 
make the maximum impact. If you hold a press conference Saturday to display a 
little moral courage, a little leadership, it will be on TV that night and make 
the front page of the big Sunday papers. Perhaps you'll be on TV Sunday 
morning, chatting with Brinkley, Donaldson and Will. 
</P>
<P>
 But I doubt it. My money says you'll fold that hand, that you'll say it's 
"personal." And as you know, Your Honor, that's just a polite way of saying 
you're chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely,  
</P>

WOMAN, 82, IS APPARENT FIRE VICTIM; EMERGENCY: A CHARRED BODY BELIEVED TO BE 
THAT OF EVIZA CHRISTINA BLACKSHEAR IS FOUND INSIDE A MELTED CAR IN SANTA PAULA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An 82-year-old Santa Paula woman who ran a neighborhood market for three 
decades was apparently killed Wednesday when an intense fire consumed her small 
Bedford Street home. 
</P>
<P>
 A charred body believed to be that of Eviza Christina Blackshear was found 
inside her melted car, which was parked in the rubble of her garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities and Blackshear's family assumed she was the victim, the 
body was burned beyond recognition and no positive identification was made 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Santa Paula since 1936, Blackshear owned a small local grocery 
store -- Blackshear's Market on California 150 -- for 34 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was a landmark," neighbor Jim Bridges said of the tiny, gray-haired 
great-grandmother who still taught Sunday school until health problems slowed 
her this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackshear lived alone, but her son and grandson both live in Santa Paula. She 
is survived by two children, four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, 
said son Boyce Blackshear. The fire started at about 4 p.m. and moved rapidly 
from the garage to the rest of the house, fire officials said. The cause of the 
blaze -- which a witness said followed a series of explosions -- was still 
unconfirmed Wednesday night, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said they did not know why Blackshear was apparently sitting in 
the driver's seat of her Ford Granada when the fire erupted. One neighbor said 
the car was inoperable because of a dead battery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know it started in the garage. We don't know how it started," Santa Paula 
Fire Department spokeswoman Sheryl Trent said. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor said he heard a series of explosions before stepping outside to 
see Blackshear's house engulfed in flames. "It looked like someone launched a 
rocket into it," said Paul Bridges, who lives across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Police Sgt. George Brink, who is also a neighbor, was the first 
officer to arrive at the burning house. "I was just worried she was in there," 
he said. "It was all flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching quietly as fire officials sifted through the charred garage trying to 
determine the fire's cause, family members and friends shared memories of the 
elderly woman whom neighbors called "Grandma Blackshear." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyce Blackshear recalled how his mother bought a computer at age 80 and had 
mastered it by 82, despite a stroke and other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a great, independent lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chaplain Steve Kay, who is the minister at Blackshear's church, was 
stunned when he realized the fire had consumed Blackshear's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I was hoping she was someplace else. We kept hoping that," he said. 
"And then they got to the garage and said there was a body in the car. I 
couldn't believe it could happen to her."

MEDI-CAL FIGURES ON IMMIGRANTS ARE DISPUTED; HEALTH: STATE AUDIT SAYS COSTS IN 
COUNTY REACHED $9.3 MILLION LAST YEAR, BUT A TOP AREA OFFICIAL WARNS THAT 
REPORT MAY BE MISLEADING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week before Election Day, state health officials have released an audit 
concluding that Medi-Cal costs for illegal immigrants in Ventura County have 
quadrupled since 1989 -- a figure disputed by the county's top health official 
and denounced by immigrant advocates as a ploy to whip up support for 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, issued Tuesday by the state Health and Welfare Agency, said 
Medi-Cal expenditures for the county's illegal immigrants went from $2.1 
million in 1989 to $9.3 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 During that same period, the report states that the number of Medi-Cal cases 
grew fifteenfold, from an average of 284 a month to an average of 4,348 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just solely the case in Ventura County; I can tell you that we have 
seen this kind of growth statewide," said Shannon Bowman, spokeswoman for the 
state health agency. "The state cannot afford a program that is growing this 
quickly, especially when you are providing services to people who break the law 
to get here." 
</P>
<P>
 Medi-Cal is a state-administered program that provides health-care to the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants are eligible only for so-called restricted Medi-Cal 
benefits -- emergency care and the delivery of babies, costs which are 
reimbursed in part by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the undocumented are the only people eligible for those benefits, 
Bowman said the audit was done simply by tracking the number of restricted 
Medi-Cal claims submitted by doctors and hospitals in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gary Feldman, the county's public health officer, warned that the report 
could be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the state created the restricted Medi-Cal program in fiscal year 
1987-88, Feldman said illegal immigrants received health care that was paid for 
by the county or private hospitals. Feldman also said he believes many 
undocumented immigrants may have falsified documents to receive regular 
Medi-Cal benefits even though they were ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, Feldman said doctors and hospitals have stepped up 
efforts to determine the legal status of patients in an attempt to funnel 
illegal immigrants into the restricted Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
 As patients have been shifted into that program, the statistics have 
skyrocketed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Feldman said rising Medi-Cal expenditures could also be partly 
attributed to rising medical costs.  
</P>
<P>
 "They simply became more visible as the rules changed," Feldman said of 
illegal immigrants. "But if I was in the state administration, and I was 
working for some governor looking to get reelected on the back of some 
proposition, I might put out some scary figures too." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman was referring to the reelection bid of Gov. Pete Wilson and to 
Proposition 187, the initiative that would deny schooling, non-emergency health 
care and other public benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 State health officials denied Tuesday that the release of the report was 
connected to Wilson's reelection bid or the hotly contested ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, I didn't give that any thought," Bowman said. "But I would 
have still done it. It's just factual information; it's making data available 
to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, immigrant rights advocates questioned the timing of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time believing that the release of this information at this 
time isn't politically motivated," legal aid attorney Eileen McCarthy said. 
"The motivation is to put Prop. 187 over the top and to reelect the governor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the audit showed that 10 counties account for nearly 70% of the 
$800 million spent last year by the state on federally mandated health care for 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County led the way, spending nearly $341 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $9.3 million in Medi-Cal expenditures racked up by Ventura County, $8.3 
million was for federally mandated health care to the undocumented. The state 
and federal governments split the cost of that care 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
 The other $1 million was for prenatal care to illegal immigrants, a cost 
picked up solely by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said Tuesday that the state audit merely 
reaffirms something he has known all along: Ventura County spends a lot of 
money providing services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a pretty vivid picture of what was going on without looking at the 
numbers," said Gallegly, a longtime backer of tougher immigration policies. 
"The fact remains that the federal government has a responsibility to protect 
the state from this flow or be prepared to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 But McCarthy said she is upset that the undocumented are being used as fodder 
in the illegal immigration debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are one of the most vulnerable segments of our society and they are 
being used as scapegoats," she said.

INSTRUCTOR PROPOSES OJAI CHARTER SCHOOL; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT 
PUBLICLY FUNDED INSTITUTION THAT WOULD OPERATE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS OF STATE 
CODE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Ojai teacher has proposed opening Ventura County's first charter 
school, which would be publicly funded but largely free from the constraints of 
the state education code. 
</P>
<P>
 Deanna Nakosteen, who for seven years ran a private school in Ojai, has asked 
the Ojai Unified School District board to approve the founding of Discovery 
Charter School. 
</P>
<P>
 With small classes, individualized instruction and an emphasis on arts, music 
and other non-academic subjects, the school would offer families a no-cost 
alternative to expensive private schools and highly structured public schools, 
the 55-year-old Nakosteen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about choice, about giving parents a choice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ojai school officials warned Nakosteen on Tuesday that they viewed her 
proposal with great caution. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, although local school boards approve the founding of charter 
schools in their areas and are legally liable for them, districts have limited 
control over the schools' day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we approve a charter, we have vast responsibility and very little 
control," Ojai school board President Muriel Lavender said. 
</P>
<P>
 Featured in a Time magazine story this week, charter schools are becoming 
increasingly popular across the country, with numerous states allowing 
individual schools to break free from the public education system. 
</P>
<P>
 California joined the movement in 1992 under legislation sponsored by Sen. 
Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) that permits up to 100 charter schools statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the state has granted 70 charters, with two pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California allows start-up charter schools -- such as that proposed 
by Nakosteen -- most are public schools that have converted to independent 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Barbara, for instance, Peabody Charter School was previously a public 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Peabody officials said the change has given them more financial freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a charter, schools receive their per-pupil funding, roughly $3,200 per 
year, directly from the state instead of through the district office. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter schools may contract with the district to provide services such as bus 
transportation, school maintenance or bookkeeping, or they may elect to keep 
their overhead low by doing such tasks themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us a little more autonomy in the way we spend the money," Peabody 
secretary Kathryn Marr said. "Our money is also less watered down when it 
doesn't come through the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Peabody is doing some things differently, such as spending a certain amount of 
state textbook money on other classroom materials and contracting with parents 
to do weekly volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
 But in other ways, the school operates the same as before: Peabody hires only 
state-credentialed teachers, who earn the same as teachers in other Santa 
Barbara schools, and the school has classes as large as other public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to financial independence, charter schools have more academic 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they must meet the state minimum of 175 school days per year, they 
may structure their days any way they like, free of the state requirement to 
spend a certain amount of time on core academic subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakosteen is proposing taking advantage of that freedom. She said she would 
spend the mornings teaching core subjects such as math, science and reading, 
while devoting most afternoons to the fine arts, field trips and other 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery Charter School would operate much the same as the small Discovery 
Place school that Nakosteen operated from her upper Ojai Valley home from 1984 
to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 That school had up to 14 elementary school students at a time. Nakosteen said 
the school folded because children who reached the fifth grade generally wanted 
to be in classrooms with more students. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakosteen would start the charter school in a downtown Ojai building, where 
she already has reserved space. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she envisions beginning with about 15 children in kindergarten 
through fourth grade and gradually adding more, although she would try to have 
no more than 15 students per class. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school's core teachers would have state credentials, as Nakosteen 
does herself, she said she would negotiate teachers' pay on an individual basis 
rather than signing a contract with the local union. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don Ainsworth, president of the Ojai Federation of Teachers, said he is 
concerned about Nakosteen's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 One worry, he said, is that Discovery Charter School would draw students from 
Ojai's other public schools, leading the district to have to lay off teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wonders how the school could operate with such a low student-teacher 
ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion is there's no way it's going to financially fly," he said. "The 
only way they're going to able to do it financially is if they pay their 
teachers next to nothing and have a lot of volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that the state pays about $3,200 per student per year, limiting 
each class to about 15 students would give the school about $48,000 per class 
to cover salaries, administrative costs and other overhead.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's not a whole lot of money," Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nakosteen said she would supplement state money with private donations and 
fund-raisers. In addition, she said she planned to turn over to the school a 
private health-food distribution business she runs that brings in about $450 
per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent volunteers could run the business, she said, and put the money toward 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Having worked for 12 years in the Rio Elementary School District outside 
Oxnard, Nakosteen said she wanted to pay her teachers well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a teacher myself and wanting to be professional, too, I don't want to 
have really low services," she said.

CELEBRATING SPORTS; COUNTY HALL OF FAME SEEKS TO MOVE INTO CAMARILLO BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After honoring the county's greatest athletes for more than a decade, the 
Ventura County Sports Hall of Fame wants to move its memorabilia out of closets 
and dusty garages into a permanent home at the old Camarillo police station. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group pitched that idea to the City Council Wednesday, and 
council members ordered a study of whether the hall should move into the police 
station once it closes next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be the culmination of a dream," Hall of Fame Chairman Chuck Eskew 
said before the meeting. "It would be a place where our members and inductees 
could entrust their memorabilia and which we could use as a base of 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Eskew said the old Palm Drive station could be leased to his group for a 
nominal fee once police move to the remodeled Bill Esty Center in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
 The sports group would hire a part-time curator and pay insurance and other 
operating costs. Eskew said the museum would have a $20,000 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame has inducted more than 60 of the county's finest athletes 
since it was founded in 1982, including many who became professional athletes. 
Such athletes as former Los Angeles Dodger third baseman Ken McMullen and 
longtime Laker forward Jamaal Wilkes have been honored, Eskew said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eskew said the hall has all varieties of memorabilia from Ventura County's 
athletic past -- but no place to show it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Stored away in garages all over the county are famous baseball bats used for 
historic hits, cleats worn by local stars and old newspapers clippings and 
photographs, he said. And the shrine probably would also include Olympic gold 
medals won by local track stars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael Morgan said he liked the idea of the Hall of Fame museum at 
the police station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would help enliven that part of Ventura Boulevard. It's a solid 
idea that we should look into," Morgan said. "My only concern is whether the 
location isn't a little too far off the freeway for the public to find." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Bill Little said that while the idea deserves study, the city 
needs to consider other uses for the old building, a former Bank of America 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we leased it to them, there's a fairly complicated set of rules and 
regulations we would first have to follow before we could turn it over," Little 
said. "It's not as easy as it sounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Smith, a retired 30-year Ventura High School football coach who was 
inducted into the hall in 1988, said a permanent home for notable memorabilia 
is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because sports is such a rich part of our history as Americans and as Ventura 
County residents, it would be a shame not to find a place where these items can 
be shared with the public," he said.

COLLEGE BOOKSTORE MANAGER WINS REINSTATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to an independent commission's ruling, trustees of the Ventura County 
Community College District have opted to reinstate the Oxnard College bookstore 
manager they fired in June rather than fight her in court. 
</P>
<P>
 On the recommendation of Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin, trustees voted 4 to 1 
late Tuesday to rehire Sharon Davies, a 22-year college employee who was fired 
for failing to maintain adequate records at the bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's personnel commission ruled last week that Davies deserved her 
$60,000-a-year job back, in part because none of her supervisors at Oxnard 
College noticed that she was not keeping accurate books. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said the punishment did not match Davies' failings, and that a 
four-month suspension without pay was enough of a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also suggested a six-month probationary period and more 
training for Davies, 50, who received a promotion last year as well as a series 
of positive performance reviews throughout her employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin said there are portions of the five-page ruling that he did not agree 
with, but that he would recommend the ruling be approved if Davies agreed to 
initiate no further legal action against the college district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost of (fighting in court) will far outweigh any benefit to the 
district," Lakin told trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Karen M. Boone was the lone dissenting vote, saying that she could not 
support rehiring a person she believed was incapable of doing the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The findings listed in the commission's statement are inconsistent with the 
remedies suggested," Boone said during the meeting. "I have a problem with her 
being back in the same position," she said later. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent audit of the Oxnard College bookstore concluded in April that 
Davies had failed to close out registers on a daily basis, failed to keep track 
of the store's inventory, and failed to maintain proper paperwork and fiscal 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 That probe also turned up $40,000 or more in losses in the last six months of 
1993, which are still unaccounted for at the Oxnard College bookstore. The 
store does nearly $1 million in business each year. 
</P>
<P>
 There was never any indication that Davies was responsible for the bookstore 
losses, the commission noted in its findings. 
</P>
<P>
 During the board discussion, Trustee Timothy D. Hirschberg appeared angry that 
Oxnard College officials failed to address the sloppy bookstore records for so 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 "There didn't seem to be much concern for financial controls at the 
bookstore," Hirschberg said. "The personnel commission said enough about Ms. 
Davies, but the real message to the board is that the ball was dropped at 
Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's also the matter of funds in that operation that still need to be 
accounted for," he added. "We should take heed in the comments in the report 
relating to the college." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College President Elise D. Schneider, who made the recommendation to 
trustees that Davies be fired, refused to discuss the situation, despite 
Hirschberg's comment and the commission findings that she should have known 
about Davies' failings. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at work for the first time since June, Davies was greeted Wednesday with 
numerous welcome signs and a 3-by-5-foot card made by students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are going fine and I'm very happy to be back here," Davies said. 
"Everybody from the gardeners on up have come over to welcome me back, so it's 
been a pretty exciting day." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies declined to say, however, whether she would accept the commission 
findings that both she and the district pay their own attorney fees and that 
she forgo the four months salary she was penalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The only alternative would be to file a claim with the college district in 
preparation of a lawsuit.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; SUIT AGAINST D. A. GOES BACK TO COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A libel suit against Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury was tossed 
back Wednesday to the Van Nuys court where it originated by a Kern County judge 
who said he was too busy to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bradbury's attorney says he will try to have the suit by Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Deputy Gary Spencer moved from Los Angeles County to Ventura 
County for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Spencer who shot and killed Malibu-area millionaire Donald P. Scott 
during a fruitless drug raid on his property on Oct. 2, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury issued a 64-page report clearing Spencer in the shooting because 
Scott was waving a gun at the time. But Bradbury's report also said that the 
deputy may have lied to get a search warrant for Scott's 200-acre ranch, and it 
called him "a good officer . . . who lost his moral compass." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer sued Bradbury and four of his staff members last March, accusing him 
of defamation, libel, slander, infliction of emotional distress and violating 
his civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing Bradbury and Spencer agreed to move the case to Kern 
County Superior Court to avoid claims of conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Superior Court Judge Stephen P. Gildner heard early arguments and even 
made a ruling in September dismissing five of Spencer's claims from the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But at some point recently, Gildner telephoned Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge Robert M. Letteau to return the case because he lacked time and resources 
to hear it, Letteau said in court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The politics of it is that Kern County said, 'This is a bottomless pit, we 
have budgeting and fiscal problems too,' " Letteau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Letteau said he would put the case back on the Los Angeles Superior Court's 
law and motion calendar for further hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen M. Reiser, the attorney representing Bradbury, said he intends to ask 
Letteau within the next 10 days to move the case to Ventura County. Spencer's 
attorney, Jeff Giordano, argued that the case belongs in Los Angeles County.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; EQUESTRIAN KEEPS TIGHT 
REINS ON YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 "Fours! Left and right oblique. Ho!" ordered the cadet commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying on a nearly lost tradition of horse-mounted cavalry, Troop H members 
guided their horses into formation at a Sunland ranch bathed in electric light. 
But these troopers, with crossed-sword insignias on their uniform lapels, can 
be as young as 9 -- a few score pounds of humanity in command of an animal a 
dozen times their size. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very steep tradition," said Mike Stigers, regimental commander who 
oversees 150 troopers in the California Rangers, a little-known military style 
youth organization operating in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. 
"The commands and the formations trace back to battlefield tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization was created during World War II as a branch of the California 
state militia. Horse-mounted high school boys were assigned to patrol the Santa 
Monica Mountains and to spot submarines at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody ever saw any submarines," said Alex Wehrfritz, 
president of the group's board of directors.  
</P>
<P>
 After the war, the rangers became an independent nonprofit group run by 
volunteers, teaching youth self-respect and discipline through horsemanship. 
Members, ages 9 to 16, climb ranks, salute senior officers and learn to take 
care of their horses after a hard day. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're tired and you don't want to, but the horse comes first, always," said 
Lt. Alyson Morris, the cadet commander of Troop H, after wrapping up the weekly 
drill session. Alyson, 16, is a high school junior who may someday join the 
National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Rangers are an affordable way for kids to step into the 
equestrian world. Members pay $10 a month in dues plus horse rentals of $15 a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Each trooper trains on a different horse every week to learn to manage various 
animal personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got 30 personalities out there," said Stigers as he watched the 15 
members of Troop H drill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the horses are real slugs," Alyson said. "Some are real hyper." 
</P>
<P>
 But as rider and horse work as a team and as troopers learn to work with 
partners, columns and groups of four, all the personalities come together to 
create one, which is the troop, said Capt. Edith Conner of Van Nuys, Troop H 
commander. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something about riding a horse which is awesome," said Conner, who 
has seen her daughter, Rebecca, 16, grow up by "10,000 years" since she joined 
the Rangers three years ago. "(The youths) come in here and they'll mouth off 
at you and we'll tone them down, or they will come in very shy and they'll 
leave with three or four friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Conner said Rebecca came home crying after her first night, but then 
announced, "I think this will be good for me, Mom."  
</P>
<P>
 "She got yelled at and kept coming back," Conner said. Troopers learn to 
follow some basic behavior rules. "You don't talk back. You don't say, 'I'm 
trying.' You say 'Yes ma'am' and be quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca now is in the Rangers Eagle Troop, an elite unit commanded by Stigers 
that performs drills using only music and whistle commands. Troopers try out 
each year for the Eagle Troop and have to keep up good grades to stay in. 
</P>
<P>
 Dustin Weimann, 12, of Sunland, joined his sister three months ago to learn 
the Ranger way. "Heels down and toes in," explained the boy, adding that 
Rangers always ride with their shoulders square with one hand on the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids love discipline," said Stigers, 36, an electronics salesman who joined 
the Rangers when he was 10. "Kids love consistency."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; APARTMENT FIRE LEAVES FAMILY WITHOUT

<P>
 A 2-year-old playing with a cigarette lighter on a mattress caused a two-alarm 
fire that destroyed a Port Hueneme apartment unit and its contents Wednesday 
morning, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze severely damaged the apartment in the 200 block of Sharon Lane 
occupied by Mary Ann Gonzales, her five children and one grandchild, Ventura 
County Fire Capt. Ron Topolinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries in the fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross has housed the Gonzales family in a local motel and provided 
them with vouchers for restaurant meals and clothing, said Richard Rink, 
director of disaster services for the Ventura County Chapter of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything except for what they had on their backs was destroyed there,' Rink 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials estimated the damage to the structure at between $30,000 and 
$50,000. They said an additional $15,000 worth of damage was done to the 
contents of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighboring unit suffered smoke damage, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department was called at 8:27 a.m. and had the fire under control at 
9:04, Topolinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Capt. Kerry Ellison said the Oxnard Fire Department and U.S. Navy 
firefighters from Point Mugu helped fight the blaze.  
</P>
<P>
 Ellison said the firefighters succeeded in keeping the flames from spreading 
to four adjoining apartment units. IRA E. STOLL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; BOOK DAMAGE NOW SURPASSES $100,000 
</P>

<P>
 A month after a rainstorm drenched about 1,600 books in the Thousand Oaks 
Library, officials are estimating that it will cost more than $100,000 to 
replace those waterlogged books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot higher than we expected," said Steve Brogden, deputy director of 
the library.The books were ruined when a two-day storm in early October dropped 
more than a half-inch of rain on the library, which was being re-roofed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because construction was under way, portions of the roof were covered only 
with tarps and water poured on top of library bookshelves, protected only by 
thin plastic sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Early damage estimates by city and library officials were about $10,000. But 
after sorting through hundreds of damp books, library officials realized the 
damage was worse than initially thought, Brogden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction company's insurance will pay for the book replacement, 
Brogden said. The roofing project is expected to be completed during the next 
three weeks. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DISTRICT CAN'T FIRE TEACHER, PANEL RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state administrative panel has rejected the Ventura school district's 
request to fire a special education teacher accused of inappropriately touching 
and teasing his students. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-member panel issued its decision Wednesday, ruling 2-1 that the 
Ventura Unified School District must keep teacher Bryan Bowman as a full-time 
employee, return him to his previous position at Blanche Reynolds School and 
pay his legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel agreed that Bowman had engaged in much of the conduct attributed to 
him by the district. 
</P>
<P>
 That included making sexual comments about other school employees, holding 
children on his lap for extended periods and calling students "tards," -- a 
derogatory slang term for the mentally disabled. He also confined one child to 
her seat by stretching masking tape across her lower body, the panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 However, two of the three judges on the panel decided that such conduct was 
not grounds to fire the 39-year-old teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman worked in the Oxnard School District before taking a job at Cabrillo 
Middle School in Ventura in 1990 and eventually moving to Blanche Reynolds. He 
received several awards for teaching excellence during his first year in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, who has been on leave without pay since last fall, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supt. Joseph Spirito said he will recommend that the school board appeal 
the state's decision to the Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "My question is, 'What does it take to dismiss a teacher?' " Spirito said. 
"It's my opinion that we've proven our case." MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; VICTIM'S FAMILY CAN'T RECOVER DAMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a 90-year-old Ventura woman stabbed to death by a mental patient 
who walked out of the county hospital cannot recover damages from Ventura 
County or the city, a state appeals court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed by the husband, daughters and grandson of Velasta Johnson, 
who was murdered in January, 1992, by Kevin Jon Kolodziej. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous opinion filed Tuesday, the 2nd District Court of Appeal 
affirmed a March 24, 1993, Superior Court ruling that said Johnson's family 
lacked grounds for suing the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not minimize the tragedy, which could have been avoided," the ruling 
said. "We simply observe that the Legislature has determined that the benefits 
to society from governmental immunity preclude recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 State law strongly shields governments and public employees from liability for 
the actions of escaped mental patients or addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges quoted an earlier court decision that said, "Immunity is extended . 
. . because reasonable decisions as to how to control particular patients 
should not be chilled, at the time they are made, by the prospect of 
liability." 
</P>
<P>
 The family had sued for damages in compensation for wrongful death and the 
negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolodziej was admitted to the Ventura County Medical Center on July 5, 1992 
after stabbing himself. He was being treated for those wounds and for 
psychiatric disorders when he walked out of the hospital in his pajamas. 
Stopped by Ventura police, he promised to walk back to the hospital. Instead, 
he broke into Johnson's house and stabbed her to death with a knife he found in 
a pie in her kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolodziej was found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced in October, 
1992, to 16 years to life in a psychiatric prison facility. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY DIRECTS FUNDS TO DOWNTOWN EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council has agreed to fund a series of proposals to 
resuscitate the city's once-thriving downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's latest plan in a decades-long effort to spruce up the area involves 
using $1.6 million in redevelopment funds to spur private investment downtown 
and make the area competitive with newer office complexes and shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council Tuesday reviewed a mixture of old and new plans -- put 
together by consultants, merchants and city officials -- to revive the area and 
choosing the ones it thought would make the biggest impact for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the proposals the council selected: 
</P>
<P>
 * Erecting signs and kiosks throughout Oxnard, pointing the way to downtown 
and detailing what can be found in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Helping shop owners band together in marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assisting property owners in upgrading their buildings to create an 
attractive environment for pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing additional parking and greater storefront visibility on A Street, 
the center of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also decided to begin a $2.5-million program to upgrade downtown's 
Plaza Park by closing off North 5th Street to traffic, providing more 
landscaping and building a colonnade. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they will present the council with more detailed 
descriptions of the programs and requests for funding in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tom Holden said Oxnard needs to stop making bad decisions downtown 
and implement some quality programs to bring the area back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've screwed up enough projects downtown," Holden said to city staff 
members. "You can bring (projects) before us, but getting them done is another 
matter." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

<P>
 Students at Ventura County's community colleges will be able to register for 
classes by telephone beginning next summer under a program approved by trustees 
of the three-campus district. 
</P>
<P>
 District administrators hope the convenient sign-ups will eliminate the long 
lines and delays that have marred registration at Oxnard, Ventura and Moorpark 
colleges over the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
 But students complained to trustees late Tuesday that the schools should not 
charge as much as $3 for the phone-in service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like every single time we turn around, there seems to be a higher 
cost (to students)," said student trustee Chi Young Choe. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe was not alone. Other student leaders complained that the district should 
pay for improving its slow and unpopular registration system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the system. We need the system. We've been promised the system for 10 
years," said Kenn Woodward, Ventura College's student representative to the 
Board of Trustees. "But the problem we're having is being required to pay for 
this service." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin and David Fuhrmann, the district's director of 
information services, said the fee is necessary to offset the costs of 
informing students about the program and following up the telephone sign-ups by 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to mislead the board or the students," Lakin said. "It may end 
up being $2 (per call). It's a user fee. Students do have the option of 
registering in person." JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BOARD BACKS BILL TO SHIFT SALES TAX USES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Borrowing an idea from a Ventura councilman, county supervisors are supporting 
legislation that would allow voter-approved sales taxes to generate money for 
preserving open space as well as for improving roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously agreed to support a bill in 
Sacramento that would alter the law so that special half-cent sales tax 
measures could be used to purchase farmland or undeveloped property in addition 
to supporting transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the Ventura County Transportation Commission scrapped plans 
to put a measure on the November ballot that would raise the sales tax from 7 
1/4 cents to 7 3/4 cents. The measure would have raised more than $500 million 
for transportation projects over the next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But panel members said they did not think that they could muster enough 
support among county voters, who rejected a similar measure four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilman Steve Bennett suggested at the time that the measure would 
gain popularity if it helped preserve open space as well as pay for 
transportation projects. Some voters, he said, oppose such sales tax measures 
because they believe that improving roads will lead to rampant development. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Legislature has never given counties the authority to draft such 
mixed-use sales tax measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Susan K. Lacey and Maria VanderKolk, who brought the matter to the 
board, emphasized that support of the legislation did not mean that the 
supervisors wanted to hike taxes at this time. They just want the flexibility 
to consider it in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a creative way to combine the needs we've had in the past," VanderKolk 
said. KENNETH R. WEISS

AROUND THE VALLEY: SECRECY AND THEN ILLNESS WORK AGAINST ENGINEER'S PUBLIC BOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Ben Rich, the high point and the low point of his life came just about 
simultaneously. As the story of his secrecy-shrouded career as an engineer and 
administrator developing some of the military's most advanced aircraft was 
finally unveiled for a national television audience, Rich lay in a hospital bed 
recovering from a life-saving operation to remove his cancerous esophagus.  
</P>
<P>
 His new book, "Skunk Works," a history of the Lockheed Advanced Development 
Co. where he worked for 40 years, was the subject of a long, laudatory story on 
CBS-TV's "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 This is an author's dream. The dream, however, does not include lying in the 
University of Michigan Medical Center when fame comes knocking, fighting to 
remain alive. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where he was on the night of the show, though he is back home in Oxnard 
now, saying he expects to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich's work at the Lockheed facility in Burbank was under such heavy wraps 
that in 1975 when he received the Distinguished Service Medal, the highest 
military award a civilian can receive, he proudly displayed it to his family. 
He could not, however, tell them how he earned it. 
</P>
<P>
 And then Rich became ill -- so ill he couldn't eat a boiled egg -- only three 
weeks before "60 Minutes" explained to the entire nation just what he had 
accomplished, an irony not lost on Leo Janos, who co-authored the book with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he finally stands up to take a bow after 40 years in the deep black, 
this had to happen," Janos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Military secrecy prevented many public bows during his career, which ended 
with his becoming president of the Skunk Works, where he was the driving force 
behind an awesome list of high-tech military planes, culminating in the F-117 
Stealth fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The F-117, the military's top secret for years, won fame when it attacked the 
forces of Iraqi Premier Saddam Hussein in Operation Desert Storm, and all the 
planes of that type survived the war without a scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it has been exciting for him to talk about things he couldn't talk 
about before," said Hilda Rich, his wife, who sat at his hospital bedside in 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he would have liked to have been out signing his new book or spending 
time with his colleagues. He loves to speak with children to encourage them." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Rich wasn't up to the physical demands of a book-signing tour, the 
TV show suddenly made him a celebrity at the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great, like we have a hero in our unit," said Vicki Umaming, a nurse 
assigned to Rich's unit. 
</P>
<P>
 She quoted from the opening lines of the "60 Minutes" segment: "If there is 
one person that Saddam won't cross . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow!" Umaming said. "It's Mr. Rich!" 
</P>
<P>
 "We called every bookstore in town, and I bought four copies," she said. "I 
wanted him to sign it, it's an honor. For me, my friends, they're interested in 
all of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich's national television debut caused such a ruckus at the hospital that 
Nurse Manager Jean Shlafer had to declare Rich an honorary national disaster so 
20 or so nurses could gather around the television and watch their favorite 
patient on the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had sent out a memo that said the television shouldn't be on unless it's a 
state, national or local disaster, but they paged me at home to ask if they 
could watch," she said. She couldn't say no. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Timothy Sell, the chief resident in the thoracic surgery unit, sat in 
Rich's room to watch the show with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sell describes himself as a regular reader of Popular Science magazine, and 
while he knew of Rich's work because of his own interests in science, invention 
and technology, he never matched the name of his patient to those achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like he spent 36 years working on this stuff, he's in the hospital and 
normally he would be with a huge crowd of friends at his home. But it was just 
Mr. Rich and his wife, so I wanted to sit down with him and tell him that I was 
proud of his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I talked to him, the more I found out that I had been exposed to the 
stuff he had worked on in the past," Sell added. 
</P>
<P>
 The airing of the show at the same time that Rich was recovering from a 
life-threatening illness wasn't the first Rich's work at the old Skunk Works 
site in Burbank collided with another important day in a long and fruitful 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 19, 1991, as the aircraft that Rich worked for 15 years to develop 
made its debut combat run above the streets of downtown Baghdad, Rich was being 
honored at a retirement dinner in a small Burbank restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the revelations made in his book, there are things that the public 
will not know about for many years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "They spent more than two years, closer to three, writing the book and one of 
the things they had to do was to get the entire text reviewed by the CIA and 
the Defense Department to make sure they did not breach security," said Jim 
Ragsdale, a spokesman at the Skunk Works facility, which moved to Palmdale 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "And yes, they were required to leave some things out of the book." 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing that few people know, though Rich has never attempted to conceal 
it, is that he never flew in the Stealth fighter . . . or the SR-71 Blackbird. 
. . . or any other aircraft he helped design that required a pressure suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of the Stealth fighter is claustrophobic. The idea of climbing into 
a confining pressure suit is more than he can take, Ragsdale said.

THORNTON ADMITTED TRUCK THEFT, WITNESS SAYS; TRIAL: FRIEND TESTIFIES THAT THE 
THOUSAND OAKS DEFENDANT DENIED KILLING A WESTLAKE NURSE BUT SAID HE TOOK HER 
VEHICLE TO USE IN KIDNAPING HIS GIRLFRIEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before members of a search team found the decomposed body of Westlake nurse 
Kellie O'Sullivan last year, the Thousand Oaks man charged with shooting her 
three times admitted stealing the woman's truck, a friend of the defendant's 
testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But describing a jailhouse phone call he received from Mark Scott Thornton 
while a massive search for O'Sullivan's body was taking place, Darren Daewale 
said the man denied ever seeing or harming O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Daewale said Thornton made only one statement about the victim, whose body 
would not be discovered in the Santa Monica Mountains for several more days: "I 
pray every night that she comes up found, wherever that might be." 
</P>
<P>
 Daewale's statements came on the first full day of testimony in Thornton's 
murder trial before a Ventura County Superior Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors hope testimony by Daewale and three other witness called to the 
stand Wednesday would show the defendant's state of mind before and after 
O'Sullivan's killing. They also were trying to establish that Thornton had a 
motive to abduct the 34-year-old victim because he needed her truck to flee the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton is accused of kidnaping and murdering O'Sullivan on Sept. 14, 1993. 
Police say the victim was abducted in front of a Thousand Oaks pet store and 
taken to the mountains, where she was shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton could be sent to the gas chamber if the jury in Judge Charles R. 
McGrath's courtroom finds him guilty of first-degree murder and the special 
circumstance that he either robbed or kidnaped the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Other witnesses Wednesday included a man who ate dinner with Thornton at a 
church catering to the homeless. Robert Moore testified that Thornton told him 
a day before O'Sullivan's disappearance that he needed a truck to drive to 
Oregon so he could evade police. Thornton was wanted for a probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A bank teller testified that she cashed a forged check Thornton wrote to a 
teen-age friend Sept. 13, 1993. And another teen-ager who knew Thornton told 
the jury that the defendant told him he was moving that day. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-year-old Daewale, a close friend of Thornton at the time of 
O'Sullivan's death, said the defendant sounded "whimpery" when he phoned from 
jail in Reno after being arrested with O'Sullivan's truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton was carrying a .38-caliber snub-nosed pistol when he was taken into 
custody -- a gun that matched the bullets used to kill O'Sullivan, prosecutors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Daewale said before he got the call from the defendant in jail, he had not 
talked to Thornton since the day before O'Sullivan's slaying. The defendant 
told him he stole the truck so he could kidnap his girlfriend. Daewale said 
Thornton asked him to apologize for him to the girl, Stephanie Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thornton steadfastly denied kidnaping or shooting O'Sullivan, the witness 
said, even though he admitted taking the woman's truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that he saw it with the keys, and he just took it," said Daewale, who 
also testified that he had been the recipient of a number of stolen gifts from 
the defendant -- including a camera, a fish tank and a compact-disc player.

GROUP PLANS OPEN-AIR ZOO FOR ENDANGERED SPECIES; ANIMALS: THE PARK AND ITS RAIN 
FORESTS ARE PROPOSED FOR A 115-ACRE SITE BETWEEN MOORPARK AND SIMI VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A nonprofit group announced plans Wednesday to open a first-of-its-kind zoo 
for endangered species in a quiet, dusty Ventura County park midway between 
Moorpark and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Promising rain forests and virtual reality, Madagascan lemurs and Brazilian 
golden lion tamarins, proponent Mark Cartland told the Moorpark City Council of 
his plan to transform the scrublands of Oak Park, situated between the Simi 
Valley Freeway and Los Angeles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The park could draw up to 250,000 visitors a year, said Cartland, president of 
the Endangered Species Zoological Society, the Los Angeles-based group set up 
specifically to build the 115-acre open-air zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in being a good neighbor and providing a facility that will 
be of maximum benefit to Ventura County residents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Bernardo Perez chided Cartland for not bringing the plan to 
Moorpark officials sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Endangered Species EcoPark would be the first zoo in the nation to house 
only endangered species, according to the American Zoo and Aquarium Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's many zoos with endangered species, but my understanding is his would 
be all endangered species," association spokeswoman Jane Ballentine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rare animals would come from accredited zoos and aquariums worldwide, 
Cartland said Wednesday in an interview. "Obtaining the animals is not the 
greatest difficulty, raising the capital to build the project is." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballentine agreed, saying, "Building new exhibits is outrageously expensive." 
But the hardest part, she added, will be drafting plans for a zoo that works. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Santa Ana Zoo official who has been advising Cartland on her own time 
said the plans the society has drafted are feasible -- even plans for a rain 
forest fed by drip irrigation and mist-sprayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you need is water," said Connie Sweet, general curator at the Santa Ana 
Zoo. "Our year-round mild temperatures allow us to do an awful lot with 
tropical species." 
</P>
<P>
 While aquariums and terrariums would have to be built for fish and insects, 
many of the animals would be uncaged, free to roam subtly fenced "Ecozones" 
landscaped to mimic their natural habitats, Cartland said. If the zoo is 
completed as planned, there would be zones for forest, grassland, desert and 
aquatic species. 
</P>
<P>
 Where possible, the zoo also would cultivate endangered species of plants, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other plans have a strong educational bent, such as video links from 
classrooms to the zoo's operating room, and a virtual-reality flight simulation 
that promises to let a child see through the computer-generated eyes of a 
California condor. 
</P>
<P>
 County schools Supt. Charles Weis said he has talked with Cartland about the 
zoo plan over the past six months, offering advice on meshing zoo programs with 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it can provide a tremendous educational benefit to the children of 
Ventura County," Weis said. "We are a fairly large county, without a zoo, and 
this would give them multiple learning opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Cartland said the first phase of about 15 acres would probably include one 
Ecozone, the virtual-reality equipment and an interactive computer that would 
teach visitors on the politics of environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, Cartland said, the EcoPark is little more than paper, talk and 
about $130,000 the society has raised for planning. Millions more must be 
raised, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Moorpark and Simi Valley officials weigh the zoo's potential effect 
on their cities, county officials say they are still hammering out details of a 
lease option on the Oak Park acreage, which makes up about half EcoPark's total 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The society must maintain Oak Park's picnic areas and help make other 
arrangements for groups that meet there, said Robert Amore, lease development 
manager for the county General Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo plan goes to a public hearing Nov. 16 before the county Parks and 
Harbor Commission, which then will make a recommendation to the Board of 
Supervisors, Amore said.

THOUSAND OAKS APPROVES TRACT NEAR WETLAND; HOUSING: PROJECT FOR 87 HOMES GETS 
THE GO-AHEAD, DESPITE ARGUMENTS WARNING OF DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite bitter community opposition and four hours of emotional testimony, 
Thousand Oaks council members early Wednesday approved an 87-home project near 
a Newbury Park wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:10 a.m., developer representative Ellen Michiel stood in the hallway 
outside council chambers and wept with joy, absolutely astounded that she had 
just received the go-ahead for the controversial project. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the hearing, Michiel had feared that tense election-year politics might 
swing votes against her, especially since a vocal group of residents has long 
protested the project on environmental grounds. Three council candidates spoke 
against the development, along with nearly two dozen neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But most council members approved the project as designed by Raznick Community 
Builders. Dubbed "Creekside," the tract near Reino Road and Knollwood Drive 
will consist of one- and two-story homes selling for $250,000 to $300,000 
apiece, Michiel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Elois Zeanah and Jaime Zukowski voted against the project, 
arguing that the residential development would endanger the wetland and mar the 
quality of life in surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah and Zukowski had succeeded in killing an earlier version of the project 
when Councilman Frank Schillo joined them in opposition because of concerns 
about protecting the vegetation-choked stream. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on Wednesday, Schillo voted in favor of the development after professional 
consultants assured him that the project met local, state and federal standards 
for environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo also praised the developer for shaving the number of homes and 
enlarging some lots in a project redesign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased," Schillo said before the early-morning vote. "They have come up 
with a better project." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents opposed to the project had raised a dozen concerns during the 
exhaustive hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that homes built near a wetland, on soil imported to level the 
lots, would be keenly susceptible to earthquake damage. They described the 
entire tract as a flood plain. They warned of disastrous damage to the 
wetlands. And they said the construction work would kick up enough dirt to put 
neighbors at risk of Valley Fever. 
</P>
<P>
 But both city analysts and outside experts rebutted those arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 And they vowed to stand by their conclusions. "If we're incorrect or we did 
something negligent or the tests are (shown to be) incorrect, we could be held 
financially responsible or we could lose our licenses," geotechnical consultant 
Vincent Carnegie said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a final attempt to sway the council, foes of the project complained that 
the new lots will be smaller than those in surrounding streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, however, pointed out that the project actually contains fewer homes 
than anticipated under the city's General Plan. Before approving the 
development, the council had to down-zone the site to a lower density. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the most emotional issue -- the health of the riparian habitat -- 
several council members said they believe the wetland's condition will improve, 
not deteriorate, after the project is built. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandals now dump trash into the stream -- everything from water heaters and 
beer bottles to rusty cars and old tires. Once the new Creekside residents move 
in, Fiore said, they might be more vigilant about keeping the wetland clean.  
</P>
<P>
 Casting her minority vote, Zukowski disagreed. "You are taking over habitat, 
intruding on a wetlands, and there is no way that can be mitigated," she said.

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS COUNCIL; LAZAR, ZEANAH FED UP WITH UGLY CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As they jostle for votes in a rough campaign, Thousand Oaks Councilwomen Judy 
Lazar and Elois Zeanah have made it clear that they disagree on most issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, they have arrived at consensus on one key point: Fed up with a 
nasty, brutal campaign, they cannot wait for the election to be over and done 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 As the two incumbents in a 16-candidate field, both Lazar and Zeanah have come 
under repeated attack. Lazar has been painted as gung-ho on development, while 
Zeanah has been criticized for advocating extremely slow growth. Their records 
have been picked apart by environmental groups, homeowners' associations and 
business people. 
</P>
<P>
 In printed flyers, public comments, television commercials and newspaper ads, 
fellow candidates and angry voters have denounced Zeanah for her slow-growth 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest blow came Wednesday, when a dozen residents determined to deny 
Zeanah votes announced that they have raised $10,000 for a blitz of opposition 
ads in the campaign's final six days. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling themselves "Citizens to Save Thousand Oaks," the residents urged 
voters to check any name on the ballot but Zeanah's. Their freshly printed 
yellow signs also criticize the two candidates Zeanah has endorsed: retired 
filmmaker M. Ali Issari and city Operations Manager David Hare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do ads on the radio, in the newspapers, on airplanes -- whatever it 
takes," organizer Brian Collier said. "We cannot afford to have Elois Zeanah 
and her people in office." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who object to Zeanah tend to focus on her slow-growth policies -- 
manifested in her "no" votes opposing most development. Citing her votes 
against The Oaks mall renovation and Janss Mall signs, they paint her as an 
enemy to the business community. They contend she comes to council meetings 
with her mind made up, unwilling to listen to residents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar, on the other hand, draws flak from voters who view her as part of the 
political establishment that has long dominated Thousand Oaks. Although she has 
served only one term on the council, she tends to vote in a bloc with veteran 
politicians Alex Fiore and Frank Schillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar's critics say she is too eager to accommodate big businesses such as the 
Auto Mall, since she negotiated with car dealers who wanted a marquee-like 
flashing billboard on the Ventura Freeway. They also blast her for considering 
building a golf course on Broome Ranch, a newly acquired piece of parkland off 
Potrero Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The philosophical schism between the two camps is clear from their 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah's slate has received a strong endorsement from the Sierra Club and 
local environmental groups. Lazar, in contrast, has been backed by the 
president of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce and has received donations 
from the Auto Mall and local real estate brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Citing talks with voters and walks through precincts, both candidates claim 
widespread support. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither Lazar nor Zeanah is confident enough to predict victory in next 
week's balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tuesday will tell the tale," Lazar said. "I can't wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to sway that outcome, Collier's anti-Zeanah group has launched a major 
offensive. Collier refused to list contributors to his campaign, saying he 
wanted to focus on one issue: ousting Zeanah from office after a single 
four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's responsible for the divisiveness on the council," Collier said in a 
press conference outside the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Another member of the anti-Zeanah group, Raul Guttierez, added, "She's an 
intransigent obstructionist who refuses to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 But the very qualities that outrage her foes serve to inspire Zeanah's 
supporters. They praise her for standing up for her beliefs, for refusing to 
bend her philosophies to meet the circumstances.  
</P>
<P>
 One ardent backer, Harry Evry, wrote in a recent flyer: "Once inside the gates 
of City Hall, Elois would not be corrupted. She refused the enticements of the 
special interests and social elite, and began in earnest her crusade for 
consistent planning, fiscal accountability and open government." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to parry every blow from opponents, Zeanah's camp has produced 
several television commercials, countless signs and an impassioned brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 When her foes began wearing buttons emblazoned with a red slash through a 
black "Z," her supporters countered by pasting stickers on their lapels with 
the defiant response: "Z!" 
</P>
<P>
 And on Wednesday, Zeanah lashed back at her opponents, describing them as "a 
small group of power brokers who are very fearful that they're about to lose 
their power, their stranglehold grip on this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissing the accusations brought by Citizens to Save Thousand Oaks, Zeanah 
added: "If they can't come up with anything besides character assassination . . 
. I must be squeaky clean. They're doing me a favor by giving me free 
advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 But several veteran politicians and city leaders have said this campaign does 
no one a favor. Disgusted by the mud-slinging, they have described this 
election as the ugliest in Thousand Oaks history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting out of hand," Lazar said. "I think it is sad that we have come 
to this. This is too good a city to have this kind of thing happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing both Lazar and Zeanah, Chamber of Commerce President Steve Rubenstein 
decried "all this name-calling and subterfuge" and said the campaign was the 
dirtiest he has seen in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much anger, so much divisiveness, so much neighbor against 
neighbor," Rubenstein said. "I'm just looking forward to Wednesday."

COMPROMISE APPROVED FOR MUSEUM IN FORMER CITY HALL; THOUSAND OAKS: IF DISCOVERY 
CENTER FINANCES SITE'S RENOVATION, IT COULD EARN THE RIGHT TO RENT-FREE USE. 
BUT THE COUNCIL ISN'T MAKING ANY PROMISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No exhibits have opened, no labs have materialized, but the proposed Ventura 
County Discovery Center has already taught residents a key lesson in science -- 
political science. 
</P>
<P>
 Before an enthusiastic audience of children and adults, Thousand Oaks council 
members forged a compromise that gives the proposed museum a shot at leasing 
the former City Hall, but retains the city's flexibility to consider better 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members on Tuesday unanimously voiced support for the concept of a 
center in the sleek gray building tucked into a slope at 401 W. Hillcrest 
Drive. And they encouraged museum supporters to begin raising money to repair 
the abandoned City Hall, which sits shabby and neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 But they warned that they cannot simply give away a valuable asset to a 
nonprofit group, however worthy the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Discovery Center is a wonderful concept, but it's not a proven entity," 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "They've got to come up with the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the compromise: If Discovery Center backers amass $600,000 to renovate 
the former City Hall, the council will consider letting them use the facility, 
rent free, for five years. If, however, a richer tenant bids to lease the 
building, the council may accept that offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have liked to see more commitment from the city, but we're still 
very pleased," said Hope Colt-Mette, who serves as vice president of the museum 
group's board of directors. "There's a terrific possibility that we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have long counted on raising $13 million from the sale or 
lease of the old City Hall to pay off debts from the Civic Arts Plaza project. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Discovery Center cannot afford to pay market-rate leases, however, 
the city could still reap revenue from the Hillcrest Drive site by subdividing 
the property and auctioning part of it off to developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Gary Heathcote, who studied the parcel on a citizens committee 
earlier this year, suggested that the city could approve a restaurant or even 
condominiums along the property's fringes. 
</P>
<P>
 Such development might be compatible with a museum -- allowing council members 
to give the Discovery Center a break without breaking the city's budget, he 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "That concept is extremely viable and it lets the city off the hook," 
Heathcote said. Wearing an orange pin in support of the Discovery Center, 
Heathcote added: "This is such a great idea. As a museum site, it's fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally excited, more than 100 Discovery Center backers streamed out of the 
council meeting Tuesday night eager to start reeling in funding commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have the hard work to do," said Gary Elliot, an associate scientist at 
the biotechnology firm Amgen Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Museum supporters said they have lined up tentative commitments from several 
major corporations, and will pursue federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
 They aim to fill about 50,000 square feet with hands-on displays, technology 
labs, and exhibits exploring the link between science and the arts. They also 
hope to develop a nature curriculum that would teach visitors about the 
outdoors through overnight camp-outs and day hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Their plans have won support from a diverse group, including teachers, 
scientists, artists, lawyers and even a virtual reality expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "In today's society, everybody really sees the need for science museums," 
Elliott said. "It's in the news every day, from the O.J. Simpson trial to 
computers to the Internet. A center like this would be a great resource for 
teachers, a showplace for technology and a fun learning experience for kids."

<P>
 The Orange County edition of the Los Angeles Times has apparently adopted a 
style of headline writing commonly found in grocery store tabloids and in the 
process has revealed a lack of objectivity unbefitting the state's largest 
newspaper. (Your) editors placed the headline "Lungren 'Sleaze' Is Assailed" 
(Oct. 26) over a story about a sick political commercial being aired by Tom 
Umberg, which accuses me, as attorney general, of being responsible for the 
death of Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me get this straight: A candidate for attorney general -- Tom Umberg -- 
who is badly trailing in every independent poll decides the only way he can 
improve his situation is to put a desperate attack ad on the air which accuses 
me as attorney general of being responsible for a young girl's death. The ad 
has been condemned by, among others, the Polly Klaas Foundation (which asked 
Umberg to take it off the air -- Umberg refused); the Los Angeles Times (which 
also called on Umberg to pull the ad immediately, and labeled the ad "a vicious 
low blow"), the Sacramento Bee ("His (Umberg's) campaign ethics leave much to 
be desired"), the San Jose Mercury News ("Cheap shot"), and Sonoma Sheriff Mark 
Ihde, whose deputies encountered the man suspected of killing Polly Klaas (the 
ad "distorts the truth"). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the editors of The Times' Orange County edition fell for Tom Umberg's late 
October desperation and gave credibility to his sleazy ad. Headline writers are 
supposed to be immune from political spin, at least more so than tabloid 
papers.

 Gus Frerotte appears to be the Washington Redskins' starting quarterback for 
at least the next few weeks, whatever Heath Shuler's condition. Redskin Coach 
Norv Turner said that Frerotte probably will start against the Dallas Cowboys 
on Nov. 20. Dallas is the Redskins' next opponent after the San Francisco 49ers 
on Sunday because they have their bye week between the two dates.

ART REVIEW; SURVEYING THE PUSH-PULL OF FRENCH RENAISSANCE PRINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just about everything you ever wanted to know about French prints of the 16th 
Century will be found in a sizable survey show newly opened at the Armand 
Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center -- although, you may not have wanted 
to know anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Printmaking flourished as a medium in Renaissance France, especially during 
the later decades. The exhibition, however, is pretty clear evidence of just 
how specialized a taste this work is today. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to know just why. One reason might be the inescapable feeling that 
French Renaissance art represents, to a significant degree, an imported 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis I, while warring in Lombardy in northern Italy, acquired an avid taste 
for Italian culture, and he was soon determined to shake off any lingering 
traces of medievalism at home. Eager to be up-to-date, as well as to make his 
ambitious court rival the princely grandeur of neighboring city-states to the 
south, he spent considerable energy (not to mention funds) wooing Italian 
artists northward. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelangelo and Raphael wouldn't come. The aged Leonardo da Vinci did -- only 
to die there not long after. 
</P>
<P>
 More important for what was to follow, Rosso Fiorentino and Francesco 
Primaticcio also came. The two gifted, younger artists, who had left the 
classicism of the earlier generation behind in favor of Mannerist elaborations, 
were commissioned to renovate and decorate the king's hunting lodge at 
Fontainebleau. Their high-style achievement set a tone that would redound in 
French art into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Prints were one way the stylistic news spread. "The French Renaissance in 
Prints From the Biblio-theque Nationale de France" is a selection of nearly 200 
engravings, etchings and woodcuts drawn from the extraordinary collection of 
the great Parisian library. The prints were chosen by Harvard professor Henri 
Zerner, who also worked with Marianne Grivel of the University of Rennes, 
France, and Cynthia Burlingham, curator at UCLA's Grunwald Center for the 
Graphic Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-organized by the Biblio-theque and the Grunwald, the exhibition does a good 
job of sorting through very complicated terrain. The curators have given useful 
shape to a mightily tangled era. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate sections of the show are devoted to prints derived from the elaborate 
decorations at Fontainebleau; to the highly finished (and often mechanistically 
dull) work of the School of Paris, where printmaking was soon centered; to 
regional developments in smaller cities; and, to political tracts and 
propaganda related to the seemingly endless wars between Catholics and 
Protestants in this most tumultuous of French centuries, when royal rulers 
sometimes seemed to change with the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more intriguing of the latter group is a long, horizontal woodcut, 
printed from three plates and hand-colored, which depicts a meandering 
procession of 22 religious penitents in identical white robes, their faces 
hidden beneath hoods. One of them is the king -- although you can't tell him 
apart from all the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretive costumes speak of the political peril of religious affiliation. 
They also level all penitents in the eyes of God, regardless of station. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is bracketed at each end by an in-depth look at a single artist -- 
Jean Duvet in the first half of the 16th Century, and Jacques Bellange at the 
start of the 17th -- who both worked in provincial centers far from the 
Parisian court. (Their distinctiveness was no doubt enhanced by the fact.) With 
14 prints by each, it's possible to get a good sense of the work of both. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, the figures in Jean Duvet's engravings tend to be marked by an 
intense naturalism, but typically they are deployed in fantastic, roiling, 
densely packed scenes. Duvet illustrated biblical tales from the Book of 
Revelations in a manner that sent the mundane mortal world spinning. 
</P>
<P>
 The prints of Jacques Bellange, by contrast, couldn't be more gossamer, 
courtly and ethereal. Attenuated, transparent, crystalline forms achieve an 
otherworldly air. 
</P>
<P>
 The miraculous ascension of the crucified Christ is announced by an angel in 
"The Three Marys at the Tomb" in a manner that renders all of them as ghostly 
apparitions. Bellange's prints can be nearly as crowded with people and 
incidents as Duvet's, but his rendering of space is somehow thinned out, like 
the Venetian Tintoretto's, as if lit by the glow of an inner light. 
</P>
<P>
 One provocative element of the show concerns the abundance of popular woodcuts 
made in Paris, such as the complicated, hand-colored "Judgment of Solomon" 
(circa 1560) by Mathurin Nicolas. Not much is known about the market for these 
relatively inexpensive broadsides, moral allegories and didactic narratives, 
though it likely differed from the courtly audience for engravings. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the often polite and slickly refined engravings of the School of 
Paris, the woodcuts can possess a lively freshness that puts you in mind of 
popular posters or cheeky cartoons. They set you up for Honore Daumier three 
centuries down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The French Renaissance in Prints" isn't a show that will send you out the 
door humming its greatest hits, but it is an admirable scholarly endeavor that 
fits an essential piece into a European historical puzzle. With its hefty, 
well-written, 493-page catalogue, and with a tour that will bring the show to 
New York's Metropolitan Museum in January, then home to Paris in April, it will 
likely stand as the definitive exhibition of its subject for some time to come.

 Disappointing Auction Start: Los Angeles collector Eli Broad bought the top 
lot Tuesday at Sotheby's contemporary art auction in New York, paying $2.5 
million for Roy Lichtenstein's "I . . . I'm Sorry," a comic-strip-style 
painting of a teary-eyed blonde. The previous record for a Lichtenstein, $6 
million, was set in 1990 for "Kiss II." However, the sale did set a record for 
artist Ellsworth Kelly, whose 1965 work "Green Red Yellow Blue" went for 
$805,500, besting his previous top price of $715,000. Overall, though, the 
auction was a disappointing start for the fall season, with the night's total 
take only $12 million, below the pre-sale estimate of $14 million to $19 
million. And only 43 of the 71 works offered found buyers. "We were of course 
disappointed with the number of lots which failed to sell," said Anthony Grant, 
Sotheby's director of contemporary art. The auctions were continuing Wednesday, 
with one item, a 1978 Andy Warhol silk-screen of football 
star-turned-murder-defendant O.J. Simpson, attracting more interest from 
reporters than bidders. After only two minutes of anticlimactic bidding, the 
portrait sold to a Colombian collector for $34,500, within its pre-sale 
estimate of $30,000 to $40,000. TELEVISION

 Cable Nods: As it has in the past, HBO dominated the nominations announced 
Wednesday for the 16th annual CableACE Awards for cable-TV programming between 
Sept. 1, 1993 and Aug. 31, 1994. The pay channel collected 99 of the 391 
nominations, including 12 for "Dream On," 10 for "And the Band Played On," 9 
for "The Larry Sanders Show" and 8 for "Tales From the Crypt." The only other 
program with more than 6 nods was TBS' "National Geographic Explorer," which 
got 10. Winners in 86 categories will be announced in two batches: a 
non-televised ceremony Jan. 13 and another Jan. 15 to be carried on TNT.

 Break Time: Bandleader Branford Marsalis will take a leave of absence from 
NBC's "Tonight Show" early next year to spend time touring and being with his 
8-year-old son, Reese. Marsalis' spokeswoman said Wednesday that the 
saxophonist's departure -- which so far has no set date or length -- does not 
reflect any unhappiness with the job or host Jay Leno. Meanwhile, a "Tonight 
Show" spokeswoman said Marsalis, who has conducted the NBC Orchestra since Leno 
assumed Johnny Carson's mantle, won't be replaced since the show is "planning 
on him coming back." Guitarist Kevin Eubanks will fill in temporarily.

 Remembering Julia: A private memorial will be held at Hollywood's Pantages 
Theatre at 11 a.m. next Wednesday for actor Raul Julia, who died in New York on 
Oct. 24. Scheduled speakers include Ruben Blades, Laura Dern, Paul Mazursky, 
Barry Primus and Edward James Olmos. A separate memorial, with speakers 
including Arthur Kopit, Susan Sarandon and Meryl Streep, will be held Sunday at 
New York's Joseph Papp Public Theatre. On Wednesday, 10 Hollywood figures, 
including Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Harvey Keitel, Penny Marshall, Danny 
DeVito and Streep, took out full-page ads in the industry trade papers Daily 
Variety and Hollywood Reporter, remembering Julia as "the actor we all loved, a 
wonderful friend, and a great man." PERFORMING ARTS

 Gielgud's Theater: The British stage world, honoring one of the greatest 
classical actors of the 20th Century, on Wednesday renamed the Globe theater in 
London's West End after Sir John Gielgud. But the 90-year-old Oscar winner will 
not be treading the boards at the theater that was almost his second home for 
30 years. "I am too nervous to play on stage any more," he confessed as fellow 
thespians gathered to pay homage to the grand old man of British theater, who 
popularized Shakespeare and then went on to win worldwide fame in a varied film 
career. Gielgud, who last appeared on the London stage in 1987, will be seen on 
CBS later this month playing Scarlett O'Hara's grandfather in "Scarlett," the 
TV sequel to "Gone With the Wind." QUICK TAKES

work at D&D advertising who heads for a "direct collision" with Amanda (series 
star Heather Locklear). . . . "Madonna: Innocence Lost," Fox's unauthorized 
biography movie chronicling the Material Girl's tumultuous rise to fame, has 
been scheduled to air Nov. 29, from 8 to 10 p.m. . . . Actress Kelly Le Brock 
filed in Los Angeles this week seeking divorce from action film star Steven 
Seagal. The couple separated Oct. 1 after seven years of marriage. Le Brock is 
seeking custody of the couple's three children. SHAUNA SNOW

POP MUSIC REVIEW; AN UNEVEN OUTING HAMPERS MALDITA VECINDAD AT PALACE 
</P>

 Forget Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through their 90-minute show on Tuesday at the Palace, Mexico City's 
Maldita Vecindad, with the help of comedy team the Chicano Secret Service, 
turned the stage into a brutal anti-Pete Wilson scene that might have been 
written by Quentin Tarantino after a dozen Jolt Colas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a key moment in a politically charged night that, despite its intensity 
and many enjoyable moments, was uneven -- thanks to Maldita's insistence on 
long, moody versions of songs whose strength is their edgy simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, the popular group confirmed that guitarist Pato is arguably the 
best right hand in Mexican rock, with irresistible strumming that stressed the 
group's fondness for Caribbean rhythms and Mexican folk. In this vein, the new 
"Atole con el dedo" ranks among the group's best songs, but the rest of the new 
material didn't sound as impressive as it did in February at the Universal 
Amphitheatre, when the band shared the stage with six other acts. 
</P>
<P>
 This time on its own, Maldita Vecindad satisfied die-hard fans, but those who 
remember previous killer performances left feeling a little shortchanged.

CLUB REVIEW; GOOD BLUES FOR THE BUCK AT THE HOSPITABLE MINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the blues is rapidly becoming a commodity around town, purists will 
tell you that the Mint's soul is perfectly intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The little club, which is located in a gritty stretch of Pico Boulevard, is 
not only a truly hospitable place, but it also continuously offers some of the 
best blues for your buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Performers and customers alike credit owner Jed Ojeda for setting the Mint's 
standard for quality music without pretentiousness. Ojeda took over the 
85-capacity club (in business since 1937) nearly five years ago and built it 
into a popular blues haven. The Mint was nearly forced to close its doors when 
business fell off after the '92 riots, but Ojeda managed to weather the period 
without compromising his format. When the club isn't showcasing such acts as 
Robben Ford and Jimmy Witherspoon or New Orleans' famed Leo Nocentelli and 
Ziggy Modeliste, its small stage features some of L.A.'s most talented 
singer-songwriters. Ben Harper and Bill Bonk are two of the most inspired Mint 
performers from this category. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's sound system is basic, which suits the music just fine. And, if you 
haven't already visited, you may want to check it out before Ojeda expands the 
room slightly next year -- so on really packed evenings "customers can 
breathe." The sweaty closeness on such nights is currently part of the fun. 
</P>

MUSIC REVIEW; PHILHARMONIC CHAMBER GROUP OPENS SEASON AT GINDI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seriously damaged in last January's earthquake, Gindi Auditorium at the 
University of Judaism reopened Monday along with another season, the 10th, of 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons paid $90 to attend this benefit concert for Lee College and received 
-- Esa-Pekka Salonen's influence apparently not extending to these environs -- 
an ultra-safe program for the price. The performers, all donating their 
services this evening, offered a send-'em-home-humming program of easy 
Schubert, sugary Dvorak and light Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was even more going on than most realized. Listed as a guest 
musician in the program booklet, one Martin Chalifour, acting concertmaster of 
the Cleveland Orchestra, was actually being put through the paces of an 
audition for the position, vacated suddenly last spring by Sidney Weiss, of 
concertmaster of our own orchestra. (Chalifour also occupied the 
concertmaster's chair at orchestral concerts in the past two weeks.) 
</P>
<P>
 The challenges were exposing. In the 19-year-old Schubert's one-movement 
String Trio, D. 471, with a Philharmonic audition committee listening, the 
34-year-old violinist, perhaps showing some nerves at first, warmed up to 
produce a handsome tone and dainty details, in a polished run-through with 
violist Evan N. Wilson and cellist Daniel Rothmuller. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalifour returned later to lead a spiffy account of Beethoven's Septet, Opus 
20, at times a virtual violin concerto. He dashed elegantly and sang gracefully 
in a tasteful display of musicianship and virtuosity, eliciting approving 
smiles and pats on the back from his fellow musicians. The ensemble played with 
lithe energy and precision in a speedy, bouncy and pleasing reading. 
</P>
<P>
 In between came a not altogether successful revisit to Dvorak's Piano Quintet. 
The problem was simple: With the piano lid at full height, Mona Golabek's 
always engaging, poetic and fiery pianism proved overbearing to the 
Philharmonic quartet. Still, consistently spirited and warmly felt playing by 
all exposed most of the work's charms.TIMOTHY MANGAN

ART REVIEW; A COMPRESSED LESSON IN MODERN ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a pleasure to see Michael Goldberg's 10 paintings from the 1950s at Manny 
Silverman Gallery. As a group, they present a compressed lesson in Modern Art 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 More instructive than many full-dress retrospectives, Goldberg's focused 
exhibition is true to the risks taken by American abstract painters. This 
mini-survey offers a lucid, step-by-step demonstration of the artist's struggle 
to take possession of a dynamic, wide-open style. 
</P>
<P>
 The unevenness of Goldberg's paintings clarifies the fresh, experimental 
nature of Abstract Expressionism's first decade. Large-scale oils that have the 
tense, physical presence of impacted explosions hang next to smaller works that 
seem to fizzle out before capturing the visual urgency they sought. 
</P>
<P>
 With almost 40 years of hindsight, it's not difficult to distinguish the 
70-year-old painter's knock-outs -- the frenetic "Madame Recamier," the lyrical 
"Still Life with Onion Rolls" and the foreboding "Casserine Pass" -- from his 
less stunning works, such as "House of Medici" and "Snow Walk." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also easy to see that Goldberg followed no formulas when he painted, 
instead taking chances and improvising. The two earliest works reveal his 
attentiveness to European abstraction, particularly Cubist facture and the 
palette and substantiality of Leger's simplified forms. The rest of the 
paintings swiftly build in ambition and decisiveness, if not always in strength 
and resonance. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decade, Goldberg moved away from rapid-fire, gestural flourishes 
indebted to De Kooning's fluid brushwork and toward his own signature style, in 
which composition bears an architectural weight. A vivid green field 
interrupted by a fractured double-cross embodies the crisp impact of the 
artist's best works. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's rambunctious paintings from the 1950s link his recent mixed-media 
abstractions (which include vibrant, eye-popping stripes and star-bursts) to 
the original impulses of the New York School. For the last 40 years, he has 
loaded abstract, visual energy into his pictures, pushing beyond his sources 
into a lively realm all his own. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Silence Is Golden: Alan Wayne's multi-panel monochromes are some of the 
slowest paintings being made today. At first glance, there's not much to see 
and even less to look for. After a bit of time, it becomes clear that his 
resoundingly silent installation at Newspace is the most beautiful show the 
gallery has mounted in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's exceptionally understated paintings intrigue because they eliminate 
the distance on which contemplation is ordinarily predicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing before any of his single or multi-part oils on canvas invites all the 
responses normally associated with attentive gazing. Thoughtful deliberation, 
careful consideration, quasi-mystical or spiritual musing and the serenity that 
sometimes accompanies these heightened mental activities are some of the 
experiences Wayne's art gradually and generously elicits. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when you are looking at his deep blue, buttery white, intense red and 
nearly black canvases, it doesn't feel like you are scrutinizing external 
objects. As Wayne's graceful paintings slip out of focus and into your memory, 
your sense of objectivity diminishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Detached observation and painstaking study slowly give way to introspective 
meditation. You find yourself in the middle of a participatory drama that is 
potentially endless. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne juxtaposes nearly identical canvases in groups of two, three or four 
panels. Since it is impossible to distinguish one rectangle of saturated color 
from the next, it is impossible to establish any sort of chronological or 
narrative sequence. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, time physically comes to a halt, drawing viewers into individual 
face-offs with their perceptions, expectations and prejudices. Wayne's 
adamantly passive paintings don't provide any answers, only more focused 
questions.

<P>
 A Fastidious Craftsman: Richard Baker's odd little still lifes floating in 
fragmented landscapes are painted in an academic style that is dry without 
being lifeless. At Louis Stern Fine Arts, the young, New York-based artist's 
studies of fruits, tools, rocks, fish and face masks manage to be charming 
despite the well-worn territory they trod. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker lavishes a lot of attention on the surfaces he paints, fleshing out the 
objects he depicts with palpable textures and occasionally juicy details. To 
his credit, his fastidious craftsmanship never gets fussy or precious. On the 
contrary, a stubborn sense of mere approximation or perfunctory adequacy 
infuses his well-worked pictures with a toughness that borders on indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's backgrounds are rendered with an equally perverse insistence on 
inconsistency. Their jarring shifts in perspective are so awkward, programmatic 
and studied that they appear to be the ham-fisted exercises of an unimaginative 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the disjunctive backdrops in Baker's paintings cannot be 
described as standard attempts to exploit figure-ground ambiguity. His lumpy 
paintings save themselves from such cliched conventions by maintaining a deeply 
ambivalent relationship between haplessness and inevitability. In these 
endearing pictures, details seem to fall into place despite the artist's best 
intentions.

<P>
 A Spin on Surrealism: Bay Area artist Jay DeFeo (1929-1989) puts a delicate 
spin on Surrealism in her drawings and photo-collages from the 1970s. Best 
known for "The Rose," a 2,300-pound painting that devoured seven years of her 
life (plus the remnants of her jewelry-making business and an entire wall of 
her studio), DeFeo's small works on paper at Kohn Turner Gallery reveal a more 
intimate, subtle and sexy side of her art. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fine drawings depict partial views of tripods, swim goggles, 
tape-dispensers and other gracefully curved forms that seem simultaneously 
organic and mechanical. The objects fade near the edges of the paper, 
suggesting that these anthropomorphic forms belong not to the world of concrete 
substances but to an intangible realm of fragile, crystalline memories. 
</P>
<P>
 DeFeo's collages also eschew real-world specificity in favor of dreamy 
associations. The slight dramas of her often abstract pictures evoke moods, 
textures and drifting reveries, rather than eliciting direct messages or 
describing shocking scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike her one-ton magnum opus and much of the flamboyant Beat poetry of her 
generation, DeFeo's works on paper enter consciousness on tiptoe. They 
reverberate like musical jingles you can't get out of your head, but never know 
why they got stuck there.

THEATER REVIEW; GARDEN GROVE 'DRACULA' WELL-MOUNTED BUT BLOODLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With vampires all the rage from Hollywood to Romania, how could the Grove 
Theater Center's "Dracula" possibly compete? 
</P>
<P>
 Not badly, it turns out, if you're looking for a handsomely designed, 
attractively appointed, beautifully lighted, well-cast show. 
</P>
<P>
 But will somebody please call the script doctor? 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Cochran's tedious new adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel is dead on 
arrival. It could use a whopping transfusion of writer's blood or at least an 
infusion of stage smarts equal to the production values. 
</P>
<P>
 The verbose script lays out the famous tale like a Victorian stiff pumped full 
of formaldehyde. Archaic dialogue and windy languors of exposition keep getting 
in the way of the action. Given the tin-ear squareness of this primly mannered 
kitsch, it's a wonder the show comes off as well as it does. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit must go in large measure to a cast capable of finessing its lines 
without winking for sympathy, which can't have been easy. The material, after 
all, begs for satirical treatment -- even if Cochran, who also directed, keeps 
wanting it go straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Wilson cuts an imposing figure as Dracula, a tall, dark hunk more sexy 
than scary in his black velvet cape. Beth Bates exudes blond beauty, innocence 
and a requisite sensuality as his victim, Mina. And in the unenviable role of 
Jonathan Harker, Mina's husband, Doug Tompos completes the triangle by managing 
to play the dumb cuckold-cum-doctor without losing his dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 The jewel in the crown, though, is the one instance of sheer buffoonery. 
Lighting up the stage and making the entire show worth seeing is Matthew 
Walker's lunatic performance as Renfield, a sweet madman who never met a bug he 
didn't like, especially for breakfast. Walker's simian antics -- no pun 
intended -- dispel the dramatic stasis that keeps sneaking up on the production 
whenever he's not around. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast's only letdown is Mink Stole. Her schoolmarmish portrait of Prof. Van 
Helsing, a garlic-bearing vampire scholar from Mitteleuropa, loses its fizz and 
goes flat before the meandering first act reaches intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, while it may not be the same as seeing Tom Cruise do his stuff in 
"Interview With the Vampire," opening Nov. 11, and while it may not match a 
visit to the count's hometown in Transylvania (where they're making a killing 
on tourists these days), this "Dracula" does have compensations. 
</P>
<P>
 David Darwin's steeply raked set is picture-perfect. A striking tableau framed 
within a Gothic arch, the design makes remarkable use of the theater's deep yet 
narrow stage. It also underscores the warped reality of Dracula's universe and, 
not incidentally, enhances the towering impression of his grand entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 And wait till you get a load of the razzle-dazzle finale. It may be a tad 
clumsy. It may not satisfy "Phantom of the Opera" fans jaded by multiple 
viewings of the fabled flying chandelier. But this "Dracula" does pull out, 
shall we say, a cute, groundbreaking surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Any qualms the city fathers might have had that their latest attempt to revive 
the downtown arts scene would not provide its share of peculiar special effects 
surely have been put to rest. Pace Dracula.

ART REVIEW; 'GESTURE': FORCE OF FRAGMENTARY FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A show about fragmentary human forms in modern and post-modern sculpture might 
sound intriguing, since so many artists have devised their own visual 
vocabularies for the human figure, replacing the whole by the part to heighten 
or emphasize certain emotional, kinesthetic or formal qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the roster of American and European artists in "The Essential Gesture" 
at Newport Harbor Art Museum (through Dec. 31) is hard to fault in terms of 
quality. But the show itself is disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of finding fresh ways to explore artists' attitudes toward the body, 
chief curator Bruce Guenther has opted for a rote art history lesson. The 
exhibition lacks a sense of the relationships among pieces from different 
artists and from different eras -- and gives little sense of why the incomplete 
figure has been such a satisfactory solution for so many. 
</P>
<P>
 The show begins with Auguste Rodin's "Walking Man," the larger-than-life 
bronze torso and striding legs dating from the late 19th Century. The artist's 
stature and the sheer power of the piece helped legitimize the use of 
incomplete figures in modern sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing fascination of "Walking Man" stems from its concentrated 
evocation of forward movement, a decisive shifting of weight from leg to leg. 
Given this overriding theme, arms and a head would be superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rodin could have been juxtaposed with, say, Joel Shapiro's 1987 "Untitled 
(JS 768)," shown elsewhere in the exhibition. The small bronze is composed of 
four smooth rectangular bars representing a head, torso and legs. By virtue of 
deft angling, the figure stands on one leg. Lacking arms, the piece exquisitely 
emphasizes the tenuousness of balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the Rodin is juxtaposed with two Giacometti sculptures of attenuated 
women, Gaston Lachaise's daintily gesticulating female torso with the swelling 
breast-buttocks of a fertility amulet, and Picasso's flattened, tactile image 
of a single arm. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, these artists -- as well as Constantin Brancusi, Hans Belmer, Jean 
Arp and others -- made a decisive break with normative ideas of what a figure 
sculpture could be. But this is not news. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not show the ultra-vulnerable Giacometti women next to Kiki Smith's 
extraordinary and shockingly fragile paper sculpture of a dead body? Drained of 
its organs and vital juices, it dangles above its cast-off head and arms, 
heaped on the floor like pathetically useless armor. Why not discuss the 
different ways male and female artists have condensed and exaggerated the 
female form? 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, the essay and wall texts offer only basic information about the 
individual works, art movements and traditional sculptural materials -- 
information more appropriate to an art history survey.  
</P>
<P>
 Rather than represent 22 artists with 33 pieces, the show might have gained in 
breadth by winnowing out a few of the multiple works by a single sculptor and 
including more artists working in nontraditional media. Additionally, several 
works -- such as Willem de Kooning's "Seated Woman on a Bench," Oliver Lee 
Jackson's "Untitled," and Antony Gormley's "Word Made Flesh" -- seem rather too 
"whole" to fit comfortably within the show's theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the stature of the artists and the quality of the art -- reason enough 
to visit -- "The Essential Gesture" is a discouragingly hollow curatorial 
gesture.

WESTSIDE WATCH: LUDMILLA, I DON'T THINK WE'RE IN KAZAN ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian tourists Edward Poshedsky, 58, and his wife, Ludmilla, 55, knew their 
visit to Los Angeles would be an eye-opener. Even so, they were taken aback by 
the Halloween scene on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Three blond transvestites, all well over 6-feet tall, strutted by Monday night 
in shimmering, tight-fitting dresses. A pet Chihuahua outfitted with bat wings 
scampered underfoot. A man in a halter top and caked with makeup, "Shteena, 
Queen of the Go-Go Cage," writhed inside a homemade cage on wheels. An ersatz 
San Francisco policeman in full regalia displayed well-defined pecs inside an 
unbuttoned uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 And Edward Poshedsky tried frantically to capture the passing parade on his 
video camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to shoot this to show my friends back home, otherwise they'll never 
believe it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90,000 people surged through the famed promenade on Halloween night, 
reveling in fashion's closest thing to anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward said: "I think even Boris Yeltsin would have a great problem trying to 
(control) this crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT GOES AROUND: Imagine the distress of the Beverly Hills bank teller who 
lost a gym bag containing 12 personal checks made out to his creditors. Police 
say that on Oct. 28, the teller (they decline to identify him or his bank) lost 
the bag when thieves broke into a friend's car, where he had left it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now imagine the surprise of the same teller when a man walked up to his bank 
window three days later -- on Halloween, no less -- and plunked down one of the 
missing checks. Originally made out to the teller's mortgage company, the $213 
check had been altered to indicate it was payable to "Alberto Hernandez." 
</P>
<P>
 The man presented it to the very same teller who had lost it, saying: "I want 
to cash this check," police said. 
</P>

 The teller managed to delay the transaction and called police with some 
enthusiasm. Mr. Hernandez was arrested on charges of forgery, commercial 
burglary, receiving stolen property and possession of less than an ounce of 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 So in one small case, at least, crime did not pay.

 ON APPROACH: The drive to Los Angeles International Airport could take a bit 
longer than usual because of road repair work under way on parts of Sepulveda 
Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 Traffic will be confined to one lane in the construction areas between 
Manchester Avenue and Lincoln Boulevard. Road crews will spend a little more 
than two weeks grinding and resurfacing Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Work will be done by the Los Angeles Bureau of Street Maintenance, from 6 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. daily through Nov. 17, according to city officials.  
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials suggest that motorists heading to LAX from the San Fernando 
Valley area stay on the San Diego (405) Freeway until the Century Boulevard 
exit, avoiding the earlier exits of Howard Hughes Parkway and La Tijera 
Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 They also suggest that motorists approaching from the south take the San Diego 
Freeway to the westbound Century (105) Freeway, get off at Sepulveda Boulevard 
and follow the signs back to LAX.

ELECTIONS / SANTA MONICA CITY COUNCIL; COMPETING SLATES VIEW SAFETY AS KEY 
ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past four years, Bob Holbrook and Tony Vazquez have stood out as the 
gentlemen of the Santa Monica City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 While others clawed and back-stabbed, Vazquez and Holbrook built a reputation 
as go-along, get-along guys. Civility was their method, and they could agree to 
disagree with no hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 There are similarities in private life too. Both are family men, and both hold 
degrees from USC, where Holbrook is a professor of pharmacy. Vazquez is a 
community planner for United Way. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to the issues, especially how to go about ensuring public 
safety, the two part company dramatically. Holbrook favors strict enforcement 
of city ordinances; Vazquez stresses addressing the underlying social problems 
that could lead to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the philosophical gulf is being scrutinized as Holbrook and Vazquez 
seek reelection to second four-year-terms on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not only their own futures at stake. The two are heading up competing 
slates of candidates for the three available seats on the seven-member council. 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez is at the top of a slate endorsed and financed by the city's powerful 
rent-control organization, Santa Monicans for Renters Rights (SMRR). His 
running mates are urban planner Pam O'Connor and artist Bruria Finkel. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook and his running mates, Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Ruth Ebner and 
labor lawyer Matthew P. Kanny, are backed by a group called Coalition for a 
Safe Santa Monica.  
</P>
<P>
 Five other candidates are running independent campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first term on the council, Holbrook has heavily stressed enforcement 
measures, including closing parks overnight, prohibiting homeless encampments 
in public places, beefing up police patrols in the downtown area and enacting a 
teen curfew that would require teen-agers under 18 to be off the streets after 
10 p.m. on weeknights and 11 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays unless they are 
traveling to or from an event. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook, Ebner and Kanny have all stressed the need to make parks and streets 
safe for citizens, something they claim current council members backed by SMRR 
have not done. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've demonstrated time and time again, they do not believe in enforcing 
laws on the books," Ebner said at a recent debate. "I can't use the parks. My 
son can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez is the embodiment of the social service model of dealing with public 
safety and homeless issues. He voted against banning encampments in the park, 
saying such measures criminalize poverty. The teen curfew was in his view 
discriminatory, so he opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Vazquez asked the council to let homeless people sleep overnight in 
the parks. A month earlier, he voted against beefing up the police presence 
downtown because he feared it would draw officers away from residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez has also been a strong voice for increasing citizen input in police 
matters. If elected again, Vazquez said, he will press for civilian review of 
the police force. 
</P>
<P>
 These positions have not endeared Vazquez to the Santa Monica Police Officers 
Assn., which is mounting a campaign against him. The union has endorsed 
Holbrook, Ebner and O'Connor. Historically, the police union has split its 
endorsements across slates. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Vazquez, police association President Stephen Brackett said, "he's 
voted against every public safety measure that has come before the council." 
</P>
<P>
 "What this campaign has been about is SMRR's policies, and Tony exemplifies 
them," Holbrook said. "They allow people to live on the street and hold them to 
no responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 SMRR co-chair Nancy Greenstein said she was shocked at the police union's 
"gall" in criticizing Vazquez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked police personnel would be so vindictive," Greenstein said. "How 
can I trust them to be neutral in situations in the community?" 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez insists it is wrong to construe him as soft on crime. He said he 
favors early intervention programs to prevent crime and believes that 
homelessness should be dealt with by seeking federal funding to provide 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez also notes that he voted to add 20 police officers to the force in 
1991, but Holbrook did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook said he voted against the entire budget that year because the council 
decided, without sufficient study, to pay for the officers by enacting a 1% tax 
on the sale of all property in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his slate-mates, Finkel seems to be most closely attuned to Vazquez. A 
longtime champion of the homeless, Finkel opposes closing the parks at night 
and the teen curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come with me to the parks," Finkel said recently. "I go to the city parks all 
the time with my grandson. I can tell you it's safe." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor says she supports most of the controversial public safety measures 
passed by the current council over the past few years.  
</P>
<P>
 If elected, that would put her in the public safety majority on the council, 
which should not be confused with the SMRR majority itself. Though SMRR-backed 
council members hold five of seven council seats, they are split on public 
safety matters. 
</P>
<P>
 SMRR-backed councilmen Paul Rosenstein, Ken Genser and Kelly Olsen routinely 
join Holbrook and Councilwoman Asha Greenberg in supporting these measures. 
Vazquez and Mayor Judy Abdo routinely oppose them. Olsen, who initiated many 
public safety measures, was dropped from the SMRR slate, leaving it without a 
strong public-safety voice.  
</P>
<P>
 SMRR itself is not conceding the public safety territory to the Holbrook 
crowd. In a campaign mailer to the city's Republicans, the SMRR-backed slate is 
portrayed as Santa Monica's "crime-fighting team."  
</P>
<P>
 The Holbrook slate has an advantage compared to the 1992 election because this 
year there is no competing conservative slate running to its political right. 
Indeed, candidate Bob Kronovet, as he repeatedly says, is the only registered 
Republican in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 But money is tight, and the Holbrook slate has precious little of it, about 
$45,000, to get the word out. SMRR, on the other hand, raised $150,000 this 
year and had $68,000 as of Sept. 30. All of its candidates have separate 
campaign accounts as well. Slates and Independents

JUDICIAL / CULVER MUNICIPAL COURT; 2 CONTENDERS VOW TO MAKE SERVICES MORE 
ACCESSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U ser-friendly is not a term often used to describe the Los Angeles County 
judicial system, but both candidates seeking the Culver Municipal Court seat up 
for grabs Nov. 8 have pledged to make the court more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 How? 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be helpful to have a night court so that citizens wouldn't have to 
take time out of work," said one of the candidates, Allan J. Goodman, 48, a 
former California deputy attorney general now in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 That's also the position of Goodman's rival -- Paul A. Jacobs, 52, a 
15-year-veteran of the Culver City Council who is working as a consultant for 
several law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men are competing for a seat that has been held for nearly 25 years by 
Judge Harold I. Cherness, who is retiring at the end of this year. Seven 
candidates ran in the June primary, which ended with Jacobs and Goodman as the 
top two vote-getters. Because neither candidate won more than 50% of the vote 
(Jacobs finished with 31% and Goodman with 24%) a runoff was scheduled for Nov. 
8. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Tuesday's race will be decided by voters in the five communities covered 
by the Culver Municipal Court -- Marina del Rey, Ladera Heights, Windsor Hills, 
Fox Hills and Culver City. Each of the court's two judges serves a six-year 
term and can run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Goodman and Jacobs have received a "well-qualified" rating from the Los 
Angeles County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, who advocates punishing criminals to the fullest extent allowed by law 
and who would punish certain juvenile offenders as adults, also supports using 
alternatives to the court system for the resolution of some legal disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see alternative ways that are less costly -- arbitration and 
mediation," Jacobs said. "And I'd like to see the Legislature expand the 
jurisdictional limits of small claims courts to add more judge pro-tem to 
resolve smaller disputes." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Jacobs' supporters are U.S. Rep. Julian Dixon, Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Los Angeles City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman, who supports tough anti-graffiti efforts, would like to see some 
state statutes rewritten to clarify the law on tenant and landlord disputes. He 
is supported by Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, former Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley and Culver City Mayor Albert Vera. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is one provision in the code that is 300 to 400 words long and is about 
50 years old," he said. "Landlord and tenant issues take up a great portion of 
the civil calendar. It would be better if the law was rewritten in (everyday) 
English." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the two candidates -- both Culver City residents -- support similar 
reforms, they would bring different backgrounds to the $95,214-a-year judicial 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman, who as of Sept. 30 had spent at least $76,000 of his own money on the 
campaign, served as a deputy attorney general for nine years during the 1970s 
and argued two cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was a member of the attorney general's task force that investigated 
allegations of use of unnecessary force by police during the 1970 Isla Vista 
riots -- a confrontation between police and students at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, who had spent nearly $18,000 of his own money on his campaign as of 
Sept. 30, has greater name recognition in Culver City. He has been a leader in 
city politics, both as a member of the Culver City Council from 1976 to 1992 
and as a four-time mayor. He was on the Culver City Planning Commission from 
1973 to 1976 and chaired Culver City's 75th anniversary committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Jacobs sold the private law practice that he had run for 25 
years and now works on a contract basis for other firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever wins the open seat on the Culver Municipal Court will bring new blood 
to a court that has been influenced for nearly a quarter of a century by 
Cherness. As he heads toward retirement, Cherness says he remembers the people 
he helped from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been able to do something in the community that has meaning," he said. 
"There are people that I've put into all sorts of rehabilitation programs and 
years later they come back just to say hello and to tell me that they 
appreciate the help I've given them."

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTWOOD; UCLA STUDENTS ADAPT TO CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUISE YARNALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction is nothing new at UCLA, but post-earthquake rebuilding efforts 
have propelled hard-hat activity to new heights this fall, transforming the 
heart of the Westwood campus into a rat's maze of chain-link corridors, dirt 
trenches and scaffolding. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and professors dodge dump trucks and endure whining drills and 
rumbling bulldozers. The setting is anything but pastoral. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of it all, students seem to be adapting. Even the high-decibel roar 
of a jackhammer one recent morning failed to break the conversation of dozens 
of students relaxing in a courtyard near Kerckhoff Hall, the hub of student 
government and campus publications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of typical of UCLA to have something under construction," said Ivan 
Marks, a 22-year-old senior in biochemistry. "Our flag should be this (yellow) 
caution tape. There's so much of it here." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA was performing seismic reinforcement well before the earthquake as part 
of a two-decade program to make 30 campus buildings more quake-resistant. But 
the Jan. 17 earthquake forced UCLA to accelerate the program, which is now 
one-third complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students say they never expect to see the university as it was meant to 
be. They'll be the graduates of the University of Construction, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little more trouble getting from class to class, but it's better than 
having the buildings fall down on you," said Robin Au, an 18-year-old freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, most of the construction is concentrated in the campus's core. 
Among the buildings affected is the Ackerman student union, a beehive of 
student life that is being expanded and seismically upgraded. It now resembles 
a military bunker surrounded by a plywood barricade. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dust settles, students and university officials can blame January's 
magnitude 6.7 earthquake for stepping up the construction schedule and 
dramatically increasing the costs of repairs and seismic upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake left cracks in the university's trademark towers at Royce Hall, 
now swathed in scaffolding. And it damaged at least half a dozen other main 
campus structures and up to 13 buildings at the vast Center for Health 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus officials had hoped before the quake to work on Royce Hall after 
completing seismic work on historic Powell Library, across the main quad. Now, 
however, with the two projects taking place simultaneously, most of the 
once-scenic central quad is blocked off with chain-link fence and green canvas. 
Some enterprising students have attempted to turn this maze into an impromptu 
billboard for events and political statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides causing inconvenience, the earthquake damage might have increased the 
cost of the university's seismic work by nearly 50%, mostly in added repairs, 
said Charles W. Oakley, campus architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding further to the bill is the cost of meeting the seismic standards of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which are more rigorous than those 
included in UCLA's original seismic improvement plan. The university wants to 
comply with the FEMA standards, however, because it hopes the agency will pay 
for 90% of the work, Oakley said. Seismic repairs on the medical buildings 
alone could soar to $500 million, and to $125 million for Royce and six other 
significantly damaged buildings. LOUISE YARNALL

MALIBU; MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS SEEK TO CLOSE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owners of the Paradise Cove mobile home park in Malibu have begun taking steps 
to close the park as part of a plan to sell half of the property to tenants and 
turn the other half into a mixed-use commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 In a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing last month, Kissel Co., owner of Paradise 
Cove, requested the use of $200,000 to hire consultants to assist in closing 
the park. The company, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in September, 
1993, must seek approval from the court when making financial moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Dahlberg, president of Kissel Co., said that about six consultant groups 
will be hired to prepare a formal relocation impact report as is required by 
state and city laws. The report will address, among other issues, the 
availability of adequate replacement housing and the relocation costs for the 
90 tenants who live in the lower portion of the park, where a hotel and 
multifamily housing would be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlberg said that the company has 15 acres of land to the west of the park 
and 10 acres to the east that are being considered as relocation sites. He 
added that Kissel's bank, Wells Fargo, has "confidence" in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The move by Kissel Co. comes amid a long legal battle between the city of 
Malibu and the owners of the city's only two mobile home parks. Kissel Co. and 
Adamson Cos., which owns the Point Dume Club mobile home park, sued the city 
over its mobile home rent control ordinance, overturning key provisions of the 
law in federal court in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissel Co. claimed in bankruptcy proceedings last year that the rent control 
law of 1991, which rolled rental rates back to 1984 levels and required they 
remain at that level for two years, forced the company to file Chapter 11. 
</P>
<P>
 After the city lost its battle to defend the law in its entirety in federal 
court, City Atty. Christi Hogin initiated settlement negotiations with the two 
companies, which are now suing the city for over $3 million in back rent and 
attorneys' fees. The damages trial is scheduled for Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working with the city toward a settlement, but if the settlement 
doesn't happen, we'll continue with the closure," Dahlberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement proposal being discussed by the two parties, Kissel Co. 
would sell the upper portion of the park to the tenants, relocate residents of 
the park's lower section, and receive city support for its plan to develop the 
lower park into a multiuse commercial development. KATHLEEN KELLEHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: MALIBU; GOURMET FEAST TO RAISE FUNDS FOR FIRE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Artists, writers, restaurateurs, culinary gurus and gastronomes are planning a 
fund-raiser Sunday for a group serving victims of last year's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the "Sunset Celebration," featuring live jazz and foods from 
well-known restaurants, will go to Operation Recovery, a group that formed 
within weeks of the fire to assist residents whose homes burned down. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration will be held at the home of artist Arlene Waxman, who has 
installed a monumental sculpture using debris from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50-a-person feast will feature food from restaurants such as Wolfgang 
Puck's Granita and Alice's, both in Malibu, and Michael's in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Collaborating in the effort is Cathy Rogers, a cooking instructor who has 
compiled a cookbook of family recipes from fire victims, with vignettes about 
why the dishes are significant to them. Priced at $19.95, the cookbook is to be 
released at the end of this month, with proceeds going to Operation Recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 To make reservations for "Sunset Celebration," call Ruth Rubenstein at (310) 
456-2348. The event is to be held at 29377 Cliffside Drive in the Point Dume 
community of Malibu. KATHLEEN KELLEHER

 Thousands turned out to celebrate Halloween on Monday night in Hollywood, but 
what began as an informal, carnival-like event on Hollywood Boulevard turned 
scary for Los Angeles police when some of the revelers began pelting officers 
with bottles and rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence broke out after officers decided to disperse the crowds in the 
area of Hollywood Boulevard between Highland Avenue and the Hollywood (101) 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen people were arrested -- seven on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon in the rock- and bottle-throwing incident, and others on a variety of 
charges. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until 11:50 p.m., it was a pretty happy crowd, everyone walking around and 
looking at each others' costumes," said Los Angeles police spokeswoman Lorie 
Taylor. "Some small fights broke out, so that's when officers began moving 
people out of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Police were low-key about the incident, but eyewitnesses said the situation 
was more volatile than authorities let on. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an occasion with a lot of potential for violence," said Joe Shea, 
president of the Ivar Hill Community Assn. and a member of the Hollywood 
Community Police Advisory Board. "Whenever a whole bunch of gang members are 
throwing rocks and bottles at police, you have a powder-keg situation that can 
start off a riot." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that rock throwing was the most serious incident was beside the 
point, Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't congratulate police for being lucky, you can only be thankful that 
they were," he said, adding that he plans to petition police to prohibit the 
Halloween gathering in Hollywood next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Police estimate that 1 million revelers turned out in Hollywood, but Shea and 
other onlookers said the number was closer to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West Hollywood area, meanwhile, 75,000 people paraded along Santa 
Monica Boulevard, many until after midnight, Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were arrested in West Hollywood on suspicion of being drunk in 
public, and a woman was taken for medical treatment, apparently the victim of a 
drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, police reported that a would-be attacker got a Halloween 
surprise when the "woman" he threatened to rape turned out to be a man dressed 
in female clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was approached from behind in the 1700 block of Ocean Ave., Santa 
Monica police Sgt. Gary Gallinot said. The male suspect threatened to rape the 
costumed victim, who spun around, prompting the surprised suspect to exclaim, 
"You're a guy!," Gallinot said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect fled, but was later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sheriff's deputies in Malibu and Los Angeles police in the West Los 
Angeles, Wilshire and Pacific divisions reported no Halloween-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A police officer-involved shooting of a robbery suspect in Culver City earlier 
in the day was not connected to Halloween, said police spokesman Lt. Tom Gabor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, hundreds of youths joined in what has become an annual 
egg-throwing and shaving cream-spraying melee in front of the 
multimillion-dollar mansions north of Santa Monica Boulevard. Besides some 
spray and eggs hitting property and some unlucky passersby, there was no damage 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 One juvenile was arrested for assaulting a police officer, however, when he 
smashed an egg on the officer's chest. SUSAN STEINBERG

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; SEEKING JUSTICE FOR LATINOS; FABIAN NUNEZ 
LEADS AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE 'DISENFRANCHISED.' HIS 
TACTICS HAVE DRAWN PRAISE AND STIRRED CRITICISM.

 Is la migra on your back? 
</P>
<P>
 Does the sewing factory refuse to pay minimum wage? 
</P>
<P>
 Want to become a U.S. citizen and cast your ballot against Proposition 187? 
</P>
<P>
 If you live in the Pomona Valley and have answered yes to any of these 
questions, chances are that sooner or later you will cross paths with Fabian 
Nunez. 
</P>
<P>
 In a community where Latinos -- many of them poor and undocumented -- make up 
more than half of all residents, Nunez is something of a folk hero: a labor 
organizer, immigration activist and businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a struggle for justice for a segment of the population that has 
been marginalized and disenfranchised," thunders Nunez, who favors the fiery 
rhetoric of the civil rights movement. "We're tired of being scapegoats. We 
want to be part of the mainstream of American society and we want the door to 
be open to us as people who give more to the system than they take." 
</P>
<P>
 But the fast-talking, 28-year-old Mexican American also has become a lightning 
rod for controversy among some who believe his methods are manipulative and his 
voice shrill. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, after helping students at Ganesha High School organize a walkout 
in opposition to Proposition 187, the initiative that would deny education and 
most social services to undocumented immigrants, Nunez drew the wrath of school 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not against any of his political activities," said Cassandra A. George, 
Pomona Unified School District's assistant superintendent of secondary schools. 
"But adults who use schoolchildren as a ticket to publicity for their own 
personal political agendas are harming the education of children who need it 
the most." 
</P>
<P>
 With days to go before the election, Nunez has even drawn criticism from more 
conservative Latino leaders who prefer a more low-key approach and think that 
mass demonstrations and the waving of Mexican flags will raise the hackles of 
white voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them that our people have been taking a conventional approach for the 
last 502 years and look where it's gotten us," Nunez fumed. "As a community we 
haven't prospered. So it's time for a different approach." 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes, Nunez's tactics can lead to a bigger reaction than even he 
anticipates. 
</P>
<P>
 When he helped the students organize the walkout against Proposition 187, the 
teens marched to City Hall, where they slammed Pomona Unified for failing to 
take a stance against the measure, even though the school board had already 
adopted a resolution opposing it. The lead speaker and organizer of the protest 
also used derogatory terms for homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The district responded by suspending 70 students, infuriating Nunez. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez defends the students, saying the district hadn't gone far enough in 
fighting the initiative. "It's a nice gesture to see them wearing 
(anti-Proposition 187) buttons, but we want to see concrete action" fighting 
the measure, Nunez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the derogatory comments, Nunez said that they could not be seen as 
discriminatory against gays, another group that has been fighting for civil 
rights, because Latinos are not powerful enough to be guilty of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 500 years of having to endure slavery, oppression, exploitation in our 
community, our people are in no way, shape or form able to discriminate," Nunez 
said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Many of the kids in the San Diego barrio where Nunez grew up became junkies 
and criminals, he says. Some were recruited by Mexican gangsters last year to 
kill the Catholic archbishop of Tijuana. But Nunez, one of 12 children in a 
poor family of day laborers, says he realized early that education was a ticket 
out. Encouraged by an eighth-grade teacher who prodded him to consider college, 
Nunez challenged counselors who wanted to track him into vocational education 
courses and signed up for advanced-placement classes instead. 
</P>
<P>
 He also began questioning the disparity of wealth around him. In Tijuana, the 
young man saw mansions standing next to cardboard shanties. In his San Diego 
neighborhood, he saw bright, talented friends succumb to violence. He was told 
it was a matter of choice, but to him it seemed more like luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can walk away from it but you can't take it out of you," he says of the 
barrio. 
</P>
<P>
 While taking Latin American studies and political science courses at UC San 
Diego, Nunez had his first taste of activism, organizing workers to join a 
shipbuilders union and writing political stories for the school newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, after graduating from UC San Diego, Nunez wanted to head for Central 
America. "I was ready to join the Sandinistas," he said. Instead, a friend 
persuaded him to take a job in East Los Angeles at the One Stop Immigration and 
Educational Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez stayed four years, teaching English and civics to immigrants and helping 
them become legal residents under the amnesty law. He rose to regional director 
at One Stop Immigration and opened offices statewide. Along the way, he married 
his college sweetheart, a nurse. Nunez and his wife, Maria, have two children, 
Esteban, 5, and Teresa, 3. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Nunez moved to Pomona as a consultant for a nonprofit group called 
the Small Business Development Center. He learned how to do feasibility 
studies, draw up business plans and assess the needs of small Latino 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 After concluding that more networking was needed, Nunez founded the Latino 
Chamber of Commerce in Pomona, which now has 70 members. He also used the 
skills he had learned to start his own mortgage business, which provides a 
modest living for his family and gives him the flexibility to continue his 
activism. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Nunez started La Alianza (The Alliance), a Pomona immigrant 
rights group, with Humberto Camacho, a labor union organizer. He also helped 
found the Latino Forum, an umbrella organization that coordinates the 
activities of various community groups in the Pomona Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Latino Forum's biggest successes so far has been pushing through 
district elections for City Council to replace at-large elections, a change 
aimed at taking advantage of Latino voting blocs. As a result, the number of 
Latino City Council members jumped from two to four (there are seven seats). 
The city also has a Latino mayor, Edward Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With his '90s yuppie savvy and '60s civil rights consciousness, with one foot 
in Mexican issues -- he writes a weekly column for a Mexico City newspaper -- 
and another planted in U.S. ones, many say Nunez exemplifies the coming of age 
and diversity of Latino power in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Pachon, director of the Tomas Rivera Center, a national policy research 
institute at the Claremont Colleges, says changing demographics in the Inland 
Empire have helped propel Nunez into the limelight. In the 1980s, Pachon says, 
cities such as Pomona, Montclair and Ontario became ports of entry for Latino 
immigrants. The newcomers brought with them a panoply of needs that Nunez is 
bent on addressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fabian emerged out of nowhere two years ago," Pachon said, "and it's his 
constant presence on issues that has made him a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 When the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service staged a raid near a 
Pomona school last May, Nunez organized press conferences and rallies to focus 
attention on what he called civil rights violations. They culminated with Mayor 
Cortez announcing the city would sue the INS over what it considered a pattern 
of illegal search and seizure by Border Patrol agents targeting people with 
brown skin. 
</P>
<P>
 When 200 Latino workers walked off the job last year, claiming unfair labor 
practices at Cal Spas, a Pomona firm that manufactures fiberglass spas and wood 
frames, La Alianza organized a food drive to make sure their families didn't go 
hungry. Nunez has kept the issue in the public eye, organizing demonstrations 
and lobbying the City Council to investigate whether Cal Spas violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Through its attorneys, Cal Spas said that Nunez offered to mediate the labor 
dispute but that it declined because the matter is before the National Labor 
Relations Board. Cal Spas declined to comment further. The NLRB has scheduled a 
hearing in December to address the complaints and cross complaints filed in the 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe Nunez's tactics are divisive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 16, Nunez, who is on the steering committee of the National 
Coordinating Committee for Citizenship and Civic Participation, an 
anti-Proposition 187 group, filled 27 buses with 3,000 protesters to join the 
70,000 people who marched through downtown Los Angeles to denounce the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Lopez, a community and civic leader who has organized the Cinco de Mayo 
festival in Pomona for 16 years, also opposes the initiative but believes that 
a confrontational approach can only backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a shouter," Lopez said. "I respect and admire the young man but I 
don't believe in marches. I felt that they only gave more strength to those who 
are in favor of Proposition 187 when they go to this extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Fabian wants recognition. He wants to be out there in front. There's 
nothing wrong with that, but it's the way you do it. He says he's for the 
Hispanic people, but he's not completely honest. Fabian is looking for 
something for himself and he's using people to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez contests that view. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no gain for me in this. I have no interest in running for political 
office," the activist responds. "I feel a responsibility to work with the 
community I serve. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night if I didn't battle the 
problem, make a dent in history, not as an individual but collectively with the 
work we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Nunez seems to relish the battle, choosing inflammatory metaphors to 
make his point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latino workers are the modern-day slaves of Southern California," he said. 
"The only difference between slaves in the 1800s and workers in factories today 
is $4.25 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 The activist said he recently received a death threat. He also says he gets 
frequent anonymous calls from people who utter racist slurs, then hang up. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nunez says he is willing to use whatever means necessary to bring 
attention to issues he considers important. For that he has won kudos from 
other local organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has brought fresh blood to the labor movement and is a key player, not 
only in Pomona but in the region. One thing that stands out is his willingness 
to unite workers across ethnicity," said Trevor Campbell, an African American 
labor consultant who teaches sociology and history at Cal State San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent day, Nunez got a call from a woman who worked at a lamp factory in 
the Inland Empire. The workers had been told that from now on they would be 
paid 19 cents for each lamp they assembled instead of being paid by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a streaked dawn sky, Nunez pulled up outside the factory in his beat-up 
BMW with a bumper sticker proclaiming "No Te Dejes, Inmigrante" ("Defend 
Yourself, Immigrant") to meet the workers before their morning shift. 
Nervously, they gathered.  
</P>
<P>
 "Look, what's important is to set a time to meet so that we can talk about 
these problems," Nunez told them in rapid-fire Spanish. "How about in someone's 
house? Where? What time do you think we can get the most people to attend?" 
</P>
<P>
 After setting a date, Nunez handed out his La Alianza business card. Then, as 
the workers filed in to start their shift, Nunez loitered conspicuously around 
the back entrance, making sure he caught the eye of the foreman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it helps if they know someone is watching," he muttered. "Then 
maybe they'll realize they have to pay attention to the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez says immigrant workers often don't realize they even have rights -- thus 
a large part of his job is explaining the law to them. Sometimes, factory 
bosses actually like having him come around, he says, because when workers know 
their rights, they're less likely to run from INS agents and their companies 
don't lose a trained employee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With polls showing Proposition 187 with a shrinking lead, the controversial 
measure is shaping up as Nunez's biggest challenge. But whether it wins or 
loses, Nunez says he believes the proposal has had an effect its backers never 
intended: galvanizing Latinos into a massive political bloc that will make them 
a potent force in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week, Nunez visits factories and wades into strawberry fields to persuade 
Latinos to apply for amnesty in their adopted country, become citizens and vote 
for leaders who will fight for their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimates that since 1991, community groups in the Pomona Valley have 
registered 10,000 people who are eligible to become citizens. (There's no way 
to confirm this since figures are kept by county and Nunez's work spans Los 
Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some, including Pachon, believe the figure may be high, they point out 
that even half that number is significant, since 200 votes can often decide a 
local election. In the Pomona Valley, La Alianza is at the center of efforts to 
mobilize Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fabian has become a symbol in Pomona," said Angie Carrizosa, a Pomona 
councilwoman and bilingual education teacher. "To many people in our community, 
he represents the soldier against discrimination. He can articulate the fear, 
the anger. . . . Whenever he needs my assistance or support, I'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrizosa said that Nunez was instrumental in resolving a perennial problem 
with Latino laborers -- many of them legal immigrants -- who congregated in 
front of a Pomona hardware store looking for day work. Concerned that the 
loitering would scare off customers, local merchants called the police, which 
brought the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez brought the issue before the City Council, Carrizosa said, offering 
suggestions such as setting up a center where workers could register for jobs 
and employers could call up to hire day labor. Pomona has allocated $100,000 to 
do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 On a more personal level, Nunez set up a canopy under which workers could get 
doughnuts and coffee on rainy days while they waited for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Garcia-Ponce, a Cal Spas worker who walked off the job last year, says 
Nunez helped his family survive when he was unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know where to turn to find food, we didn't know the government had 
a plan to help people in need, and he found this out for us," Garcia-Ponce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to intervene for those who are oppressed," the laborer added. "He 
wants to work with the most humble."

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; BOHEMIA AT THE BEACH; VENICE: HUMAN TIDE, SPIRITUAL 
CURRENTS ARE BIG DRAWS FOR BOARDWALK AREA RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting at a table in her oceanfront apartment, Stephanie Fields takes in a 
post-sundown Venice Boardwalk, the daytime carnival of street performers and 
vendors long since departed. 
</P>
<P>
 A bearded transient swathed in rags floats by ghostlike on in-line skates, 
pushing a shopping cart full of bags. Puppies, leashes dragging behind them, 
frolic amid scattered trash as their owners huddle nearby, smoking and talking. 
Later, a man wearing sunglasses, a beret and a wool poncho struts jauntily by. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see tonight that there is such a contrast between Saturday afternoons 
and a Friday night," reflects Fields, a four-year resident of the Charlie 
Chaplin apartment building on Ocean Front Walk, just south of Westminster 
Avenue. The boardwalk "is interesting to watch. Forget about taking a nap 
during the day. But in the midst of it all, there is this sense of community . 
. . and the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists flock to the Venice boardwalk to see what many consider 
quintessential California -- the sun worshipers and weightlifters, the 
musicians and the magicians, the basketball hustlers and the hustled, all mixed 
amid people-watching throngs. 
</P>
<P>
 But little noticed in the hubbub are the people who live in the apartment 
buildings and bungalows that line Ocean Front Walk, a low-rent alternative to 
the glitzier Santa Monica and Malibu neighborhoods up the coast.  
</P>
<P>
 Ranging from young professionals taking their first job to middle-aged 
new-agers struggling at second careers, they have in many cases set down roots 
so deep that not even the boardwalk's noise, congestion and increasing crime 
will drive them out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived four blocks from the ocean in Playa del Rey and it's a different kind 
of energy down there," said Fields, 42, an airline flight attendant and 
postgraduate student. "I came back to Venice with all the artists. . . . Poor 
people can live next to rich people. White people can live next to black 
people. It doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the diverse, Bohemian flavor, many residents say, Ocean Front Walk's 
drawbacks are a small price to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "You open the front door and there's music . . . polka, rap and Indian music. 
You could be talking to somebody about therapy, then the next thing you're 
talking about praying to Buddha and then you're at a Baptist revival at the 
church on Brooks (Avenue)," said Robyn Bernard, 33, who shares a tiny single 
apartment in the Chaplin with fellow country and gospel musician Bobby Paine, 
47. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living here for a year, it was like the ultimate Venice experience right out 
your front door," Paine said. "It's a complete cross-section of L.A. . . . It's 
the human tide and with it, you take the good and bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The tolerance of boardwalk residents, however, is not without limits. Two 
months ago, four sledgehammer-wielding oceanfront residents destroyed several 
concrete and marble tables at Westminster Avenue and Ocean Front Walk. The 
tables had become a late-night gathering place for drug dealers, revelers 
blaring loud music and transients and youths who often came to blows. The 
racket enraged sleep-deprived residents, who say they felt under siege by a 
"virus" of "disaffected youth."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the tables were destroyed, Ocean Front Walk has been relatively quiet 
after dark. Police investigated the destruction of the tables, which were 
donated to the city by a restaurant owner, but no arrests have been made. Many 
residents, meanwhile, display a proud defiance about the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ecstatic that the tables were gone," said Fields, who calls all her 
friends honey . "I should have opened a bottle of champagne." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Albertano, a 10-year resident of the Ocean Front Walk area, said she has 
felt liberated from fear since the tables were removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Venice," she said. "That was really the first time I thought of 
moving. There was just this disaffected, angry, lost youth -- flotsam and 
jetsam, getting into fisticuffs right outside my window. I used to have a 
problem with people (urinating) outside my window. But you don't yell anything 
because you are afraid of retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
 For Albertano, however, the benefits of life on the boardwalk more than make 
up for the hassles. A self-described "spoken word" artist, she lives in a 
basement apartment in the 20-unit Morrison building -- named for the late rock 
singer Jim Morrison, who reportedly slept on the roof. Her kitchen is filled 
with herbs, vitamins, tinctures and teas. In her bedroom stands an antique 
piano, a violin and a floral cloth-draped bed that doubles as a couch. By day, 
she works out of her apartment as a nutritional counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Albertano considers Venice an artistic community, despite its 
commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Soho West," she said, donning a black and white vintage floral 
dress. "This is the last slum on the beach, dare I say it." 
</P>
<P>
 Affordability and Venice's reputation as a "colorful place" drew Lou Aguilar, 
a former video reviewer for the Washington Post and the Washington Times, to 
the Morrison. Aguilar, who "threw away my journalism fortunes" and moved West 
to pursue screenwriting, said he found Los Angeles to be "the ugliest city in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 So he moved to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a tiny, like, closet," said Aguilar, who rents a single apartment in 
the Morrison for $475. "It's like a dorm room. I haven't lived like this since 
college. I am gonna write the ultimate Venice screenplay. I mean, for a writer 
it's great, even though you hear gunshots and stuff. It's just, you wanna be 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the neighborhood's troubles, Aguilar has grown fond of the 
mood-elevating qualities of the ocean, a valuable tonic for the hard knocks of 
the film industry. "It has a gorgeous view, with sea gulls that sit on the 
windows," Aguilar says over lunch at the nearby Sidewalk Cafe "No matter how 
depressed I am, I always feel better looking out at the ocean. You never know 
what ships you'll see, or which one I might jump on. And the sunsets are 
gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the Venice boardwalk appeal comes down to a matter of dollars and 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to be by the beach and I couldn't afford Santa Monica," said 
James Webster, a 26-year-old lawyer from Australia who for just under $1,000 a 
month gets a 180-degree view of the coast from his rooftop bungalow in the the 
Waldorf building, an apartment complex at the corner of Westminster Avenue and 
Ocean Front Walk. "I don't know anyone in the building. I just know who to pay 
the rent to. That seems to be the way it is in L.A. People seem to be 
detached." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster's opinion, however, is not shared by longtime residents such as 
Albertano and Fields, who say they enjoy a combination of urban living and 
small-town familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Windward (Avenue) is like a little community," Albertano said. "You can walk 
to the post office, the greengrocer, the bank . . . you get to know your 
neighbors. I like knowing the name of my pharmacist because I have been going 
there for 10 years. And there are elements of European society here with the 
mix of commercial and residential." 
</P>
<P>
 Fields says that sense of familiarity promotes a mutual sense of trust and a 
concern for others.

 "I parked my car on a Tuesday where the street sweepers came and someone 
yelled up at me, 'Hey, Steph, move your car,' " Fields said. "I had my plumbing 
break and four of my neighbors came and helped me. . . . I go down to the food 
court, want something to eat and am short of money and I say 'I'll pay you 
tomorrow.' Where else can you do that in L.A.?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Renn, 52, who lives a few floors below Webster in the Waldorf, is a 
co-founder of Los Angeles Shanti Foundation, a support organization for the 
terminally ill. He has spent most of the last 10 years working with AIDS 
patients. He says he moved to Venice from West Hollywood, where he had watched 
many friends die. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a really spiritual element here," said Renn, a Buddhist who 
meditates four times a day in front of the seaside window of his sparsely 
furnished apartment. "There is a freedom from judgment. Not that people don't 
judge, but there is an honest attempt, you see it in their eyes, demeanor and 
nature to withhold judgment about lifestyles, attitudes, personalities, the 
whole gamut of the human experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there are some residents who believe the neighborhood has become too 
accepting. Aguilar worries that Venice is "paying the price of reckless 
liberalism." 
</P>
<P>
 When he first moved to Venice, Aguilar said, "I had kind of expected 'Beach 
Blanket Bingo,' Frankie and Annette, places for young people to go. But the 
young people who are out at night are lame. (They) worship stupidity . . (and) 
are on drugs. Some of them are homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 The destruction of the picnic tables last summer is not the only sign that the 
neighborhood's attitude has hardened. Frank Lutz, manager of the Morrison, has 
installed huge iron gates on the building's entrance, alarms on all the doors 
and security cameras throughout the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Frank Montelongo, the officer in charge of the beach unit that patrols 
the boardwalk, says crime is clearly a problem in the boardwalk area, though by 
no means more so than in other parts of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like a cockroach problem in a supermarket; they're always there 
and you've just got to stay on top of it," Montelongo said. "Everybody sees 
money down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Even residents who have fallen victim to crime, however, are loathe to live 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Fields and a reporter were robbed at gunpoint at 
Westminster Avenue and Main Street. The robbers were two youths who appeared to 
be between 13 and 15 years of age. While the experience stunned Fields, she 
retains strong devotion to the boardwalk neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery "didn't change my mind about Venice," said Fields, who paused to 
draw on her cigarette. "There is a closeness among people who have been here a 
long time. I still am not afraid. . . . But I'll be a lot more cautious now."

OUT AND ABOUT / LITA ALBUQUERQUE EXHIBIT: ROCK AND ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rocks speak to Los Angeles artist Lita Albuquerque. They've done so since she 
was a girl growing up in Tunisia, in the area that was once the ancient 
city-state of Carthage. 
</P>
<P>
 They speak of time and place, of the Earth's essence and of our own existence 
because, after all, we humans are made up of the same elements found in a rock 
or a piece of coal. In "Remembrance," her series of paintings and sculptures, 
she brings the natural world, which is so much a part of her being, into the 
center of her art. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this particular series, I am using the rock as a metaphor for the planet 
Earth, and thinking of it as a fragment floating through space," said 
Albuquerque of her solo show, now in its last week at the University of 
Judaism's Platt Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 The intense blue hues of her work, generated from powdered pigment, are the 
colors of the sea and sky of her childhood home. The gold, from gold leaf, is 
of its sun. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tunisia, "the nighttime sky was not black, but blue," she said. "What I'm 
interested in is the effect of the sea, sun and sky on our physiology, the 
physiological need and response to them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Remembrance" is the first exhibit to open in the gallery since the Jan. 17 
earthquake closed the space.  
</P>
<P>
 The earliest works in the "Remembrance" series, which Albuquerque began in 
1988, present a square painted panel with a metal leaf-disk at its center. A 
rock emanates from the disk's center. 
</P>
<P>
 Later works include vibrant auras around the disk and a piece of coal rather 
than rock. Albuquerque uses coal for "what it represents in terms of time and 
information, and that it comes from the core of the Earth," she said. "I'm 
putting all these elements out as questions about 'What is matter?"' 
</P>
<P>
 A recent untitled work depicts the horizon of the Earth, painted in black, 
against deep blue space. Beneath the painting lies a glass box filled with 
gold-leaf fragments. Here she asks, "What was the alchemical work?" What was 
the process that transformed base metals into gold? But she explained that she 
seeks not so much a literal answer, as a poetic one. 
</P>
<P>
 To shed some light on her process, Albuquerque has included an alchemical 
workshop in the center of the gallery. On display are artist's pages -- her 
writings about the ideas behind the pieces -- as well as journal writings that 
began after the earthquake. Elements have been set on a scale, calibrated, 
measured. Gold and coal symbolize the equilibrium of light and dark. Numbers on 
paper suggest another kind of information in the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something representative of my studio at home, the inner works 
of how I get from here to there," she said. Through writing, meditation and 
artistic processing of elements, "I project myself to all known reaches of the 
outer universe." 
</P>
<P>
 "Remembrance: Paintings and Sculpture by Lita Albuquerque." University of 
Judaism's Platt Gallery, 15600 Mulholland Drive, Bel-Air. Hours are 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m. today and Sunday through Wednesday; 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Friday. Closed 
Saturday. Show ends Nov. 9. Call: (310) 476-9777, Ext. 276. NANCY KAPITANOFF

Southern Section's 26 votes was instrumental in defeating the proposal.

 ALL THE RIGHT MOVES 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills High quarterback Chris Wallace plays football like a chess 
match, waiting for an opponent to make a move before he makes his. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing plays at the line of scrimmage, Wallace directed Beverly Hills to an 
easy 35-12 win over Redondo in an Ocean League game at Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace passed for 206 yards and three touchdowns. Aaron Kogan had 121 yards 
and a touchdown as the Normans had 400 yards in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans, winners of five of their last six games, improved to 5-3 and 4-1 
in league play. They trail Culver City by a game and will play the Centaurs in 
the season finale Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris Wallace was the key to the game," Beverly Hills Coach Carter Paysinger 
said. "He made the right calls at the line and took us in and out of plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Hakim also had an exceptional day, catching nine passes for 155 yards and 
two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans play El Segundo in their homecoming game at 2:30 p.m. Friday. NEW 
SIGNALS 
</P>
<P>
 After losing third-string quarterback Kerry McGonigal to an injury, Cal turned 
to former Beverly Hills standout Ziv Gottlieb during the second half of its 
game against Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb, who saw some action at quarterback last season against USC, was 
switched to receiver during the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing No. 81, Gottlieb guided the Bears to a field goal. Gottlieb completed 
five of 11 passes for 61 yards and ran six times for 17 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears lost, 26-23. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were real excited about what he did considering he hasn't taken any snaps 
in practice," Paysinger said. "He came in and ran their offense like he had 
been practicing all season." 
</P>
<P>
 McGonigal suffered a separated left shoulder early in the third quarter. 
First-stringer Dave Barr is sidelined for the season after breaking his 
collarbone and Pat Barnes sat out because of a bruised nerve in his shoulder. 
JUST KICK IT 
</P>
<P>
 University High faced a do-or-die situation trailing Los Angeles, 16-15, 
during the final two minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing fourth down and five, University Coach Marshall Jones wanted to call 
another pass play. Jones' assistant, Terry Louis, wanted the team to kick a 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that Carlos Campos, the team's kicker and starting 
quarterback, had never made a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones decided to take a chance and Campos responded by making a 22-yard field 
goal with 1:20 left. University won, 18-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Campos has a good leg and is pretty accurate," Jones said. "But he's not in 
the class of (Venice kicker) Mike Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry said to go for the field goal and it seemed like the right thing to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (4-1 in Coastal Conference play) play at Hamilton (1-4) Friday 
and at Fairfax (0-5) Nov. 10. Last season, the Warriors lost to Hamilton and 
had to rally to beat Fairfax after trailing, 21-7, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not taking anything for granted," Jones said. "We're thinking about 
Hamilton and Hamilton only." SECRET WEAPON 
</P>
<P>
 St. Monica Coach Norm Lacy has kept quiet about Jason Jones' potential as a 
running back, but he let his secret out Thursday against Verbum Dei at Compton 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariners starting tailback Phil Austin injured his right leg during a 
two-point conversion and had to be carried off the field in the third quarter. 
Austin's injury was later diagnosed as a sprained medial collateral ligament in 
his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 With Austin sidelined, Jones took over as the team's tailback. 
</P>
<P>
 After Verbum Dei closed to within 28-16, Jones took control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners drove 47 yards for a touchdown on three runs by Jones to take a 
34-16 lead with 4:35 left. They won, 34-22. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was awesome," Verbum Dei Coach Lalo Mendoza said. "We had six guys who 
didn't want any part of him. They were slipping and falling down. No one wanted 
to tackle him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see him play Division I ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Lacy acknowledges that he wanted to play Jones at tailback since the beginning 
of the season, but didn't want to risk injury to Jones. Now that playoff time 
is two weeks away, Lacy plans to use Jones more often. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason runs like this all the time during practice," Lacy said. "We haven't 
exposed him because we didn't want to lose him during a meaningless game." 
</P>
<P>
 Lacy said if Jones were to get injured, "we wouldn't have a receiver of his 
caliber in the offense and teams would start double-teaming Dwight Carter." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had an exception game, catching touchdown passes of 42, 49 and 40 yards 
from quarterback Steve Pulley. STREAKING 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy won its fifth consecutive game with a 41-0 defeat of Bell-Jeff on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Danny Ragsdale passed for 151 yards and four touchdowns. Strong 
safety Damion Rucker returned two fumbles for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally put a complete game together," Murphy Coach Greg Dixon said. "The 
kids realize it's crunch time, league title time and the playoffs are coming. 
It's time to put things together." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobles, who are 5-3 and 5-0 in league, are in first place and can clinch at 
least a tie for the Santa Fe League championship with a win against Pius X on 
Saturday at St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy has won the league title two of the last three years. WINGING IT 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity level figures to be turned up Friday night when Serra visits St. 
Bernard in a game with playoff implications. Adding to the highly charged 
atmosphere will be the season's most intriguing coaching matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard's offensive coordinator is Kevin Crawley, who was dismissed as 
Serra's coach midway through last season. Crawley was added to the staff after 
the Vikings lost their opener against Culver City, 26-12. He is using the same 
offense, the run-oriented wing-T, that he did at Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Culver City game, I knew we needed help with the offense and more 
help with the line," said St. Bernard co-coach Bob Yarnall, who took over the 
team with Tom Burgess after Mike Noonan resigned as coach shortly before the 
season. "Lo and behold, (Crawley) showed up. He said he saw the Culver City 
game and would be glad to help out in any way, even if it was carrying water. I 
talked with him and was very impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Yarnall made several inquiries and came to the conclusion that Crawley's 
dismissal at Serra was caused by parental pressure. Crawley came under fire at 
Serra for allegedly being verbally abusive to his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarnall said Crawley has exhibited no such behavior at St. Bernard. RECRUITING 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax point guard Duane Davis decided to accept a basketball scholarship 
from Arizona State and will sign Wednesday during the November early signing 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a 5-foot-11 point guard, averaged 15.5 points and 4.5 assists for the 
Lions last season. He had narrowed his choices to UC Santa Clara, Oregon State 
and San Francisco. 
</P>

RATS DEVOUR RUSSIAN WOMAN'S STASH OF CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An elderly villager lost nearly all her savings when rats ate the cash she had 
hoarded in the basement of her house. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, living alone in a village 80 miles east of Moscow, earns her living 
by making moonshine, the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda reported Wednesday, and had 
saved a million rubles, equivalent to $300. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having studied a variety of Russian state and commercial banks, the lady 
concluded that the safest place was her cellar," the paper said. It did not 
identify her further. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Russians prefer to keep their savings at home, since Russian banks offer 
interest rates lower than the high inflation rate and deposits are not 
considered safe.

BREAKING THE CYCLE; LAPD PROGRAM HELPS OFFICERS STEP IN BEFORE DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE ESCALATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC GUZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ann's boyfriend yanked her hair so violently that he tore out a patch of her 
scalp four inches in diameter and then hit her so hard she nearly passed out. 
Semiconscious, she was only aware of a warm stream of blood flowing from her 
left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 When LAPD officers responded to Ann's call at 2:40 a.m. on a recent Friday, 
they had been presented only two days earlier with the basic tools and tenets 
of a new police program designed for victims of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Equipped with what Hollywood Division police call a "domestic violence kit," 
the officers were better prepared than before to meet the demands of being the 
first contact with the victim and suspect in a domestic battering. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the officers were able to provide a victim with 
transportation to a shelter with the assurance that they would be able to find 
her safe harbor. For the first time, they could offer her detailed information, 
available in a variety of languages, about what she could do to protect herself 
and her children from further violence. For the first time, the officers had 
been provided with the means to document her injuries at the scene, ensuring 
that the proper evidence would be brought to bear when the case went to court. 
</P>
<P>
 These innovations are the result of a new domestic violence policy adopted by 
the Los Angeles Police Department this year, spearheaded by LAPD Cmdr. John 
White. The new guidelines, developed over the last year in conjunction with 
prosecutors and shelters for battered women, are an effort to break the cycle 
of violence that escalates from verbal to physical abuse and -- in more than 
100 cases last year -- to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trick is to get the services and intervention there before you have a 
homicide," White said. "Also, if you do not interdict the violence, you get 
more abusers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic violence incidents account for a staggering number of emergency calls 
to police, as many as 40% in some areas of the city. Last year, LAPD officers 
responded to 43,000 domestic violence calls and made 9,000 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1994, the LAPD implemented the major assault crimes unit. Citywide, 
the LAPD has 102 investigators assigned to the new units, handling domestic 
violence, rape and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program requires each division to work closely with domestic violence 
social services and implement a new protocol that involves officer training, 
investigations that have an expanded scope, and guidelines for dealing with 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 18 LAPD divisions, however, is free to develop its own program. 
Last year, the Southwest division ran a pilot program that united police with 
the Jenesse Center, which provides counseling and shelter for victims of 
domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 So while officers in Hollywood respond to each call with a domestic violence 
kit, in the Harbor and Van Nuys divisions, domestic violence volunteers respond 
to weekend calls in a follow-up unit after officers have apprehended the 
suspect or made sure the home is safe. No program imitates the Southwest pilot 
program, but they all try to match its spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't dictate standards and programs that will meet the needs of everyone," 
White said. "Innovative cops will make it happen in each division." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting battered women into shelters where they can receive counseling is one 
of the most important goals of the program. In the past, victims who requested 
transportation to a shelter often put officers in a difficult position. The 
officers wanted to help but did not have the time or resources to find the 
victim a place to stay. Officers might spend an hour or more calling shelter 
after shelter only to find that there were no beds available. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood officers now have only one phone call to make: to the Center for the 
Pacific Asian Family, which has agreed in advance to place the abused spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. County domestic violence shelters have been trying for 10 years to 
establish working arrangements" with the LAPD, center official Julie Lee said. 
"Our role in the response team is that once the officers identify the woman as 
being in need of services, then we are the ones they contact for crisis 
counseling, shelter services or to situate the woman in a safe place." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann's ordeal is a prime example of how police hope their improved response to 
domestic violence calls will work. At his arraignment, Ann's boyfriend pleaded 
guilty to beating her, was sentenced to 45 days in jail and required to undergo 
a year of counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 But police intervention in what many officers have traditionally seen as 
family disputes has not always been a priority. One of the biggest problems the 
department faces in implementing the new program is getting the full 
cooperation of field officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Street cops don't like to do this touchy-feely stuff," said Detective Rick 
Papke, who heads Hollywood's unit. They wonder "what's that got to do with 
ass-kicking police work? They say, 'Give me tools I can work with.' So we want 
to give them nuts and bolts and tools they can use." 
</P>
<P>
 The tool Papke refers to is the domestic violence kit assembled by Reserve 
Officer Anne Marie Lardeau. In 12 black plastic tool boxes (one for each 
neighborhood patrol car), are pamphlets translated into 11 languages, including 
Spanish, Vietnamese, Farsi, Russian and Hebrew. The pamphlets inform women of 
their rights and provide information on access to social services. 
</P>
<P>
 The brochures also include an "escape list" that tells victims what they will 
need to bring with them if they decide to flee their homes for a shelter. Too 
many women are forced to return home because they do not take identification, 
extra clothing or important personal possessions when they leave, Lardeau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the kit are practical items for an officer's use in the field: a teddy 
bear to comfort distressed children, a pamphlet for victims of sexual assault 
and blank Emergency Protective Order forms that can require a batterer to stay 
away from the victim, her residence and place of work for five days -- enough 
time for her to apply for a lasting court order. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most crucial piece of equipment in the kit is a Polaroid camera 
for officers to document victim's injuries in the field.  
</P>
<P>
 "Photos are immensely valuable," said Assistant City Atty. Rob Pingle, 
recalling a case in which photographs and a strong narrative account filed by 
investigators resulted in a conviction without the testimony of a reluctant 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy seems to be working. Several detectives from the unit say they 
have noticed a significant increase in the number of photos being booked into 
evidence since the cameras were issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the LAPD's new policies, there is still evidence that some officers 
are insensitive to victims of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann said that although the new policy was in force and the investigating 
officers were sensitive, she got a cold response from some of the officers she 
met. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after the attack, a detective instructed her to wait at the reception 
desk for an investigator. People coming into the reception area stared at her 
injuries while she waited 45 minutes to talk to a detective. It turned out he 
was there all along. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was beginning to feel like I did something wrong," she said. "I wouldn't 
have known they'd had the training. They're just not skilled in dealing with 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone involved in the new program emphasizes that it is an evolving 
process. Lardeau refers to the Hollywood protocol as "a living document" and 
Papke is determined to get feedback from shelters, officers on the beat and 
victims to improve Hollywood's response. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her concerns, Ann is glad to know that her boyfriend will get help in 
dealing with his temper and his attitudes toward women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once he got so mad at me that he broke the windshield of my car with his 
fist," she said. "But he never hit me before and he will never hit me again."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: CLARK CONFRONTS 2 POTENT ISSUES: RACE AND MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Wednesday Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark confronted two powerful outside 
forces shaping the O.J. Simpson murder trial -- race and media manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an impassioned speech to an audience that counted -- potential jurors 
beginning the final phase of questioning in the long screening process they 
must endure to join the panel that will decide Simpson's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial question has been part of the case from the beginning. That's 
because Simpson is a famed African American football hero accused of killing 
his white former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, 
who was also white. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon of media manipulation has also permeated the case. News leaks 
from somewhere in Los Angeles law enforcement have inflicted damage to 
Simpson's side. At the same time, the defense has been planting stories 
suggesting that the prosecution and the Los Angeles Police Department have been 
guilty of racist behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 All this has been staple fare for newspapers and television, both mainstream 
and tabloid. The racist accusations against the LAPD and the D.A.'s office have 
been particularly damaging, coming as they do in a city recovering from the 
1992 riots and with a long history of conflict between the cops and the African 
American community. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt fearing that some of the media chatter had found its way into 
potential jurors' ears, Clark brought the matter up during juror questioning. 
It was the first time Clark has acknowledged race as an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clark walked back and forth, looking the jurors in the eye, establishing 
one-on-one contact as she tried to discredit the defense portrayal of Simpson 
as a beloved figure who is being framed. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense, she said, is "playing public relations games on you," giving 
inaccurate pictures of what's happening in the courtroom. Obviously, she was 
referring to news conferences last week by Simpson attorneys Robert L. Shapiro 
and Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. in which they said the prosecution was being too 
tough in its questioning of black jurors in an effort to have them 
disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have been hearing media spinning going on there about what is 
happening in court, that's junk, throw it out," she said. And ignore the 
journalistic and legal commentators, she said, for "they will lead you astray." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the jury candidates have been ordered by Superior Court Judge Lance 
A. Ito to refrain from reading, hearing or viewing any news whatsoever. But 
Clark was dealing with reality. As civil rights attorney Melanie Lomax told me 
the other day, human curiosity is a powerful force. "The judge's caution cannot 
be adhered to," she said. "People will get their information in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said she didn't want to talk about race but "we've got to get it out so 
we can get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Race is not a reason to convict," she said. "Race is not a reason to acquit." 
Racial issues, she said, are political and sociological. "These are issues," 
she said, "that can be resolved at the ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
 There was one other aspect of the case that Clark confronted -- Simpson's 
image from the football field and the screen. Both she and co-prosecutor 
William Hodgman have made it clear that O.J.'s fame poses a real threat to 
their case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a popular case for the prosecution to bring," she said. "I saw 
him in 'Naked Gun' and he made me laugh." But she urged the jury panelists to 
ignore the image and focus on the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, she said, is "such a famous guy, he's such a sympathetic guy, there's 
going to be a real pull to do something different than the law requires." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Cochran also urged the jury prospects to take a good look at 
Simpson. But where Clark wanted them to see a murder suspect, Cochran urged 
them to focus on the man. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense, he said, refers to him as the defendant to depersonalize him. 
"This is Mr. O.J. Simpson," Cochran said, "a human being."  
</P>
<P>
 Besides Simpson's personality, Cochran also spoke of race. He wanted to make 
sure jurors will not count Simpson's race "for him or against him" or will be 
influenced by the fact that "Mr. Simpson is an African American married to a 
Caucasian." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clark vs. Cochran. It was a great matchup, not only in terms of oratorical 
style but in presentation of the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a preview of opening arguments, which may be two months away. The 
underlying themes of the trial have now been clearly written into the judicial 
record.

PANEL RIPS MTA FOR NOT FIRING BUILDERS; SUBWAY: AGENCY CHIEF TELLS LEGISLATORS 
AT HEARING THAT DISMISSING TUNNEL CONTRACTORS WOULD HAVE COST TOO MUCH MONEY 
AND TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 During a hearing near a sunken stretch of Hollywood Boulevard, state 
legislators sharply criticized local transit officials Wednesday for their 
decision to stick with firms that are building the troubled Los Angeles subway. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing of the Assembly and Senate transportation committees came as new 
measurements showed that surface sinkage above the tunnels in Hollywood has 
grown to as much as 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Hayden chided Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chief Executive 
Officer Franklin E. White for his treatment of the contractors who are 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 White decided last month not to terminate the tunneling contractor, 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, or construction management firm, Parsons-Dillingham. 
Instead, White plans to phase out Parsons-Dillingham from the next segment of 
subway construction and more closely supervise the work of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to thank Mr. White for giving the greatest defense of 
rehabilitation as an approach to crime that I have heard this year," said 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica), referring to construction shortcomings and alleged 
violations of safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mess up," he said. "You get more money. You get better supervision. And 
you get back on the job. I only wish it would apply to everyone -- and not 
simply to contractors in subway fiascoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin L. Kopp also questioned the 
MTA's decision to retain the contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "When are we ever going to hold people accountable?" asked Kopp (I-San 
Francisco), who took the unusual step of swearing in witnesses. "Why don't you 
yank them? . . . I disagree with keeping on the job firms that haven't cut it." 
</P>
<P>
 White defended his decision to retain the firms, saying it would be too 
expensive to terminate them. "Our highest priority must be to complete these 
tunnels in a professional manner as expeditiously as possible," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Adams, the MTA's acting chief of construction, told the committee: "We 
have made great changes in the way we're going to do business. For us to take a 
vengeful attitude, I think, is a disservice to the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp mocked Adams' statement. " Vengeful ?" Kopp said, noting the millions of 
dollars of extra costs at stake for taxpayers. "It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz said the decision to 
retain one or both firms was "short-term wise, long-term foolish." 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody has got to be taught a lesson," said Katz (D-Sylmar). "It's worth it 
for the long-term gain in restoring public confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was prompted by the Federal Transit Administration's announcement 
Oct. 5 that it was withholding $1.6 billion for future construction until the 
MTA proves it can competently manage the project. Tunneling in Hollywood has 
been stopped since Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams confirmed in an interview that the worst sinkage, at Hollywood Boulevard 
and Hudson Avenue, has increased to 10 inches, compared to nine inches in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 White last week submitted to the federal government a plan designed to prevent 
the kinds of problems that have plagued the construction. The MTA proposes to 
take more direct responsibility for quality control and safety inspections. New 
procedures and materials also are to be used, including metal struts -- not 
wooden wedges -- for bracing the outer tunnel shell. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent engineering firm retained by the MTA reported Oct. 18 that the 
substitution of the wooden wedges for the metal struts was "inappropriate." 
Earlier studies concluded that failure of the wooden wedges contributed to the 
sinkages in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has provided the third-largest share of funding for construction of 
the subway. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the firm building the tunnels along Hollywood Boulevard and 
Vermont Avenue defended the work and placed blame for problems on project 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding upon comments made in a recent letter to the MTA, John F. Shea, head 
of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, said the partnership was concerned as of late July, when 
sinkages of four inches had emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 His cousin, Peter Shea, said they recommended that soil-stabilizing grouting 
be performed to prevent worse sinking, but the idea was rejected by project 
officials, whom he did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I became aware of the four-inch subsidence . . . I brought up the 
subject of chemical grouting and compaction grouting," Peter Shea said. 
"However, the attitude of the construction manager (Parsons-Dillingham) was 
such that they . . . considered compaction grouting and chemical grouting as 
too costly." 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by committee members, the Sheas said they had been unable to 
locate any document verifying their earlier suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked later during the hearing about the matter, Chris Dixon, an executive 
with Parsons-Dillingham who has helped oversee the work, said he could not 
remember whether the Sheas had suggested performing chemical or compaction 
grouting. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislators did not question the Sheas regarding what engineers have found 
to be improper installation of the wedges. The wedges, placed in gaps of 
precast concrete segments, were not surrounded with high-strength grout 
material, as required. The Sheas also were not asked to explain why wooden 
wedges were used that fall short of the strength specified in advance of 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "What major project of this size has not had problems?" John Shea told the 
committee. He said he believes that sinkages in Hollywood were caused by the 
"highly unusual loose soil conditions," not because of the wood wedges. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapered, 32-inch-long wedges -- one of which was on display at the hearing 
-- have become for some a focal point of the problems. Substitution of the 
wedges was approved in 1992 by Parsons-Dillingham and by the project's chief 
design engineer, employed by the firm of Parsons Brinckerhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing also focused on whether the MTA, created by the Legislature, has 
the capacity to build proposed rail projects without siphoning money from a bus 
system that largely serves the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come to question whether the problems that MTA is having reflect 
merely growth pains of a fledgling agency or whether we have given birth to 
some kind of fiscal Frankenstein," Hayden said.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / 41ST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; KUEHL BLASTED FOR MAILER SHOWING 
NICOLE SIMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assembly candidate Sheila James Kuehl is being accused by her opponent of 
exploiting the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson for political gain while at the 
same time poisoning the jury pool in the trial of O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges stem from a campaign brochure that Kuehl, a Democrat, sent this 
week to voters in the 41st Assembly District, which runs from Santa Monica to 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The front page of the letter-sized mailer carries a color reprint of a 
Newsweek cover photo of Nicole Simpson, with a smiling O.J. Simpson at her 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer's headline says, "Before it made the evening news, before it made 
the cover of Newsweek, before it became a 'Movie of the Week' . . . Sheila 
Kuehl was leading the fight against domestic violence."  
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl's Republican opponent complained that Kuehl, a nationally known expert 
on domestic abuse, appears to be "climbing over the bodies of battered women in 
an attempt to gain votes."  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Meehan further said that Kuehl breached confidentiality by telling a 
Baltimore Sun columnist two weeks ago of Nicole Simpson's calls to a Santa 
Monica battered women's shelter hot line in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Revealing the identity of hot line callers is against the policy of the 
shelter, called Sojourn, said Vivian Rothstein, executive director of the 
umbrella agency that runs the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuehl, who heads Sojourn's board of directors, defends the disclosure. 
Confidentiality rules do not apply because Nicole Brown Simpson is dead, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After someone is dead and there's an investigation, I didn't feel it was 
confidential anymore," said Kuehl, a former child actor who played Zelda in 
"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl denied that her campaign piece exploited Nicole Simpson's death, saying 
the point of the mailer was that helping battered women has been her life's 
work, which included years of lobbying in Sacramento for domestic abuse laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say Kuehl could have found a less inflammatory way to communicate her 
expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said the mailer was in bad taste. "I'm 
appalled," Jeffe said. "It's out of bounds for any candidate to use a victim of 
crime for political purposes. . . . I do not understand this decision 
politically or ethically." 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer also puzzled political pros because Kuehl is believed to be far 
ahead of Meehan, a reserve deputy sheriff, law student and political newcomer 
with minimal campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Kuehl would become the first openly gay or lesbian state 
legislator in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very poor political judgment," said Republican consultant Allan 
Hoffenblum. "It's a safe election. You don't need any negative publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan said Kuehl, an attorney, should have known better than to send out the 
sort of material that Superior Court Judge Lance Ito has ordered potential 
jurors in the Simpson case to avoid. Questioning of a second pool of 
prospective jurors began Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuehl argued that the Newsweek cover is several months old. "I don't think 
you can ruin the jury pool with something they've already seen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting UCLA Law School professor Richard H. Sanders, a legal ethics expert, 
said attorneys are generally expected to behave more carefully in commenting on 
ongoing legal matters than the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's commendable of her (Kuehl) to champion the issue of domestic violence, 
but perhaps she hasn't thought through carefully the side effects of this 
approach to publicizing the issue," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Professor of Law Peter Arenella said he found nothing ethically amiss 
with Kuehl's mailer, which was factual. "Mr. Simpson was in fact convicted of 
domestic violence," Arenella said.

THEIR PRINCE HAS COME -- TO THE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan White has made an avocation of scouring the royal residences of England. 
He's been to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle (the Queen's weekend place). 
He toured Kensington Palace (former home to Charles and Diana, where the 
princess now lives) and scrutinized Marlborough House, onetime home to King 
Edward VII, looking for a plaque dedicated to Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to England quite a bit -- always on some royal hunt," said White, a 
special-education teacher in his mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
 However, being a dedicated royalty buff who devours biographies of kings and 
queens, he will go wherever the royal pursuit leads. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why he was walking down Manchester Boulevard, umbrella and jacket in 
hand, to the Vons supermarket in Inglewood Wednesday morning. He was hoping to 
take a picture of Prince Charles on his first stop of Day 3 in Los Angeles -- 
the Royal Visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy in Sweden once said to me, 'You're black. Why should you be interested 
in the royal family?' " White said of a Scandinavian trip he took. "I said, 
'Well, the British Empire was all over the world at one time and touched every 
culture and people." 
</P>
<P>
 This being the late 20th Century, though, the Prince of Wales and heir to the 
British throne was just touching the culture of Vons -- picked as a symbol of 
Los Angeles' urban landscape. The mammoth store has only existed since the 1992 
riots and features a special program to train local residents for employment in 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
 But the promise of a mere glimpse of Charles was enough to draw several 
hundred to the parking lot. The store was closed to the public while Charles 
got the royal tour -- under an ugly sky that intermittently sprinkled rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it sounds interesting, we'll be there," said radio station 92.3 FM disc 
jockey Paul Ramirez, otherwise known as P-Funk. From the front of the crowd, 
Ramirez was broadcasting remote reports on his "house party" show. 
</P>
<P>
 Even non-Charles fans showed up. "I don't like the fact that he's being 
paraded through all our schools," said Suzanne Jones, a science coordinator at 
Ambler Avenue Elementary School, alluding to published reports of Charles' 
crumbling marriage and his own admission of adultery. "We're trying to teach 
our kids morals. . . . He doesn't represent family values." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles is concentrating on community projects in Los Angeles because those 
are his interests back home, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to see how we built ourselves back up from the riots," said Jones 
in a sarcastic, been-there-done-that voice. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did Jones take the day off work to be there? 
</P>
<P>
 "I live across the street," she said with a grin. "And I want to see the 
(future) king of England." 
</P>
<P>
 They barely saw Charles as he got out of his Jaguar and headed straight into 
the store. But the hardy crowd waited him out. After all, a ribbon of people 
tamely stretched behind a police cordon of grocery carts offered the perfect 
"walkabout," as the British call Charles' forays into crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour, the Highway Patrol officers revved up their motorcycles in 
anticipation of the royal exit and the crowd readied itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, he's little !" cried one woman with a baby strapped in a backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without his money, he's broke just like us," Guy Gibbons mused as he waited 
to snap a photo. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with a look of bemusement on his face, Charles headed for the captive 
crowd. They pressed forward, offering hands to shake, business cards, and a few 
words of advice. "Ask Jesus to save you!" cried one. Charles worked the line, 
shaking hands. Spying Tony Williams' brightly colored African hat, Charles 
pointed to his own head and nodded his approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Deejay Ramirez, flush from his encounter with the prince, turned to Gibbons 
and looked at his camera. "Did you get me, man? Did you get me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez beamed, his house party day complete. "He said he was listening to the 
station on the way over!"

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TOLL-FREE 
HOT LINE FOR ABUSE VICTIMS UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Against a backdrop of grainy photographs of more than 50 Los Angeles women 
killed last year by their spouses or boyfriends, county officials Wednesday 
unveiled a new toll-free hot line offering victims of domestic violence advice 
on how to protect themselves and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The number is (800) 978-3600. 
</P>
<P>
 The line, which operates 24 hours a day, gives callers recorded advice on how 
to obtain a restraining order, offers referrals for shelters and outlines a 
brief plan on immediate steps needed to find safety. The service is in English, 
Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese and two Chinese dialects, Mandarin and Cantonese. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti referred to the pictures of the 
slain women and said they had come from all walks of life and from every part 
of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are a victim of domestic violence or feel threatened, you now have the 
ability pick up the phone and do something about it," he said. "A safe way out 
is now possible for you and your children." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Telesis and GTE each contributed $5,000 toward the establishment of 
the line, but Garcetti said about $40,000 is needed to keep the line going for 
more than a few months and to expand the informational content available 
through the service. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who joined Garcetti at the news 
conference, said supporters will solicit contributions from other major 
corporations and that some county funds might be found to bolster the service. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the hot line, Burke and Garcetti announced the opening of two 
20-bed shelters for battered women in South Los Angeles. CARLA RIVERA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTIES KILL MAN AFTER 
STANDOFF IN ESTRANGED WIFE'S HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA O'NEILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 27-year-old man wielding a butcher knife was shot and killed by sheriff's 
deputies Wednesday morning after he forced his way into his estranged wife's 
home in violation of a restraining order and holed up in a bedroom with their 
8-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Albert Figueroa died at the home in an unincorporated area near 
Monrovia about 5:20 a.m. after being shot several times by three deputies, 
sheriff's spokeswoman Benita Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa entered the one-story pink home that he previously shared with 
Marguerita Viramontes, 26, at the end of Shrode Avenue at about 2:20 a.m., 
forcing his way in the front door, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman at the home -- either Viramontes or her sister -- called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies arrived, they found Figueroa barricaded inside the bedroom where 
his 8-year-old son had been sleeping, Hinojos said. Figueroa was sitting with 
his back against the door, holding the knife to his own throat, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For about two hours, deputies tried to persuade Figueroa to allow his son, who 
had awakened and was sitting up watching his father, to leave the room and to 
surrender the knife. As deputies talked through the closed door to Figueroa, 
other deputies quietly removed the iron bars from the bedroom window, Hinojos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 5 a.m., Figueroa, still holding the knife, tried to get his son to 
come to him. Deputies fired rubber bullets at him and simultaneously pulled the 
boy out of the window.  
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa then ran into the living room toward deputies, waving the knife, 
Hinojos said. Deputies ordered Figueroa to drop the knife, but he kept 
advancing, Hinojos said. Three deputies then shot at Figueroa, killing him. No 
one else was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa was living at the house until several weeks ago, deputies said. 
Viramontes and Figueroa have two children, the 8-year-old boy and a 4-year-old 
girl, who was not at the house Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 A therapist who specializes in domestic abuse said this case typifies the 
weaknesses of court restraining orders. Effectiveness depends on the restrained 
person's cooperation, the response of police and the willingness of the victim 
to call for help, said Jane Lawless, who does consulting work for a shelter for 
battered women in Los Angeles. "If somebody is determined to knife you, shoot 
you or beat you up, a piece of paper is not going to stop them," she said. LISA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; STATE 800 
NUMBER SET UP TO REPORT VOTING FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recent reports of alleged fraudulent voter registrations in the Southland have 
prompted state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren to set up a statewide 800 telephone 
number, hoping to help citizens report illegal voting activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The (800) FRAUD98 hot line will operate 24 hours a day. It will remain in use 
during business hours for two weeks after next Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said that with the election a week away, he hopes the hot line will 
act as a deterrent against people who want to tamper with the democratic 
process. Examples of voter fraud Lungren cited included voters who are 
underage, non-citizens and people registered to vote more than once.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORWALK; EX-CONVICT 
GUILTY IN BEATING OF MAN, 72, WHO LATER DIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ex-convict was convicted Wednesday of elder abuse and assault with a deadly 
weapon in connection with the beating of a 72-year-old Navy veteran of World 
War II who died after the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors will seek the maximum term of nine years in prison when Marcos 
Valentine Ramos, 47, is sentenced Nov. 17, according to the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 A Norwalk Superior Court jury convicted Ramos of the assault on Clyde Kennedy, 
who was severely beaten in the patio of his modest trailer court home in 
Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he died, Kennedy told relatives that Ramos -- who has served several 
prison terms, mostly for burglary -- demanded money and then punched, kicked 
and beat the elderly man with a cane. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, who was decorated for service in the South Pacific, was recovering 
from cancer of the larynx and was in frail physical condition. He died Dec. 21 
after being treated for the beating and then contracting pneumonia. The 
coroner's office initially listed the death as homicide, but subsequently found 
that Kennedy died of natural causes.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
COUNCIL TAKES STAND AGAINST PROP. 184 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday voted to oppose Prop. 184, which 
would make it difficult for Legislators to change the recently approved "three 
strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 The council members, voting 9-3, said they are leery of amending the state 
Constitution to include the anti-crime law, which has been beset by problems. 
</P>
<P>
 If voters approve the initiative, the Legislature can only change the statute, 
which significantly lengthens criminal sentences, by mustering a two-thirds 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to be able to make changes, even if you support 'three strikes,' " 
said Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. "It puts the Constitution out of reach."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SYLMAR; QUAKE PROMPTS 
REDESIGN OF HOSPITAL ADDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction of a much-needed emergency room and prenatal facility at Olive 
View Medical Center in Sylmar will be delayed at least four months while 
engineers scramble to improve the design of the steel-frame building after the 
high failure rate of similar structures in the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Tearing up the blueprint and redesigning the proposed four-story building will 
cost at least $2 million extra, officials said.The county plans to apply to the 
Federal Emergency Management Administration for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the redesign of the $54-million building could end up saving lives, said 
Larry Colvin, director of the county Department of Health Services' facilities 
implementation team. Colvin said several other proposed buildings in the 
county's $2.3-billion health facilities replacement and improvement plan may 
also have to be redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "In reality, we could go ahead and build using our current designs because the 
plans were approved before the Northridge quake," Colvin said. "But it would be 
the wrong thing to do. It's important to build the safest structures possible 
to avoid the potential of a collapse."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH BAY; FOES OF OIL 
DRILLING PLAN WIN A ROUND IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of a plan to drill for oil in Hermosa Beach won a victory this week 
when a judge ruled the project violates city zoning codes and must be revised 
before plans go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Macpherson Oil Co. of Santa Monica holds a lease to dig 30 wells on a 1.3-acre 
city yard.But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne ruled Monday that 
the proposed site is too large, violating a city code that limits drilling 
projects to one acre. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said she did not rule on a claim that the project violates 
environmental laws because the size already invalidates the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Macpherson Oil Co. planned to drill for oil at a slant under the city to reach 
about 30 million barrels of oil, some of which is under Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will be revised, but will go forward, said Scott Macpherson, the 
company's senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply with the court ruling, the company will consider building a sound 
wall within a one-acre perimeter on the site, leaving the remaining land for 
the city, Macpherson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Limiting the size of the project would make for a tighter work space, but 
would not reduce the number of wells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hermosa Beach Stop Oil Coalition filed suit against the city and the oil 
company last year.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGE DISTRICT FILLS $800,000 BUDGET GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With none of the feisty debate that accompanied earlier budget talks, trustees 
of the Ventura County Community College District did away with an $800,000 
deficit by agreeing to cover the loss with an anticipated health insurance 
refund. 
</P>
<P>
 The action brings into balance the three-campus district's 1994-95 spending 
plan, which now stands at $58.8 million, nearly $4 million short of what the 
district spent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only option we had was to use the health rebate," Trustee Pete E. Tafoya 
said Wednesday. "We had that money available and it created the minimum impact 
on the educational services we deliver." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees passed a $59.6-million budget just days before it was due in 
Sacramento. But that plan included $800,000 the district hoped to receive under 
a state Assembly bill that was later vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment approved late Tuesday calls for the district to lower by 
$832,000 its anticipated health costs this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Chancellor Jeffrey Marsee had told the governing board that there was 
nothing left to cut from the 1994-95 budget, except classes and part-time 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 But he announced last month that he expected to receive up to $1.2 million 
from an insurance refund. That money, however, had been earmarked for other 
unfunded costs such as debt payments and faculty benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no plan in place yet on how to pay those costs, but they can be 
delayed, Marsee said. 
</P>
<P>
 In private memos written by officials at the district and each campus last 
month, administrators suggested cuts of $400,000 in various accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But those potential cuts became unnecessary after trustees voted to trim 
1994-95 health costs. JEFF McDONALD

BRANCH OFFICES OF NAACP STILL OPEN; ORGANIZATIONS: LAYOFFS AT NATIONAL 
HEADQUARTERS IN BALTIMORE LEAD MANY TO ERRONEOUSLY CONCLUDE THAT LOCAL SITES 
ARE ALSO CLOSED.

<P>
 The phone rang all day Wednesday at the NAACP branch office in Hollywood. And 
callers seemed surprised when it was answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks we're closed," office manager Veronica McCreary said. "We're 
not the ones. It's the national headquarters that's closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Word that the venerable civil rights organization was broke and laying off 
employees at its main office in Baltimore was creating unexpected confusion at 
some of the 1,800 local chapters across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People officials said Tuesday 
they hope the unpaid furloughs last only a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the layoffs are affecting about 80 headquarters workers, along with 
employees at regional offices, they were not hindering work at local chapter 
offices. The regional office in Los Angeles, where three people work, could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all volunteers, anyway, at the branch level," explained Robert Winn, a 
vice president of the 900-member San Fernando Valley NAACP office in Pacoima. 
"We send them money -- the national office doesn't send us any." 
</P>
<P>
 But fallout from the reported $3.5-million headquarters deficit and a national 
leadership scandal are distracting to local operations, Los Angeles-area 
leaders acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members have quit because of accusations of sexual harassment and 
discrimination leveled against former Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. 
He was fired after it was disclosed that he promised to settle a former 
employee's claims with $332,000 in association money. 
</P>
<P>
 Some longtime San Fernando Valley donors have warned that they will not 
contribute until the national headquarters "cleans up its act," Winn said. "It 
hurts my heart to see what's happening at the national level. It's bad PR -- it 
makes people wonder whether they should get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 People should "look at the 85-year history we have and give us the boost we 
need to get through these times," said Frank Berry, branch executive assistant 
of the 8,000-member Los Angeles chapter.

RIGHT TO CRITICIZE JUDGES DEBATED AT LAWYER'S HEARING; LAW: PANEL IS 
CONSIDERING APPEAL BY STEPHEN YAGMAN, WHO WAS SUSPENDED FOR LAMBASTING A 
JURIST. ONE MEMBER APPEARS TO LEAN TOWARD ALLOWING SUCH CRITICISM. 
</P>

<P>
 A federal appeals court judge -- part of a panel considering whether to uphold 
the punishment of an outspoken attorney who lambasted a judge -- on Wednesday 
questioned whether his judicial brethren should enjoy special protection 
against such criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are judges so special?" asked Judge Alex Kozinski. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just public officials. We get a public paycheck, just like 
prosecutors. Why does a whole different standard apply to attacks on judges?" 
the judge said at a packed hearing in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozinski posed the question to Los Angeles attorney Graham E. Berry, who was 
urging Kozinski and two of his colleagues to uphold a lower court decision 
suspending Venice civil rights lawyer Stephen Yagman for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower court panel ruled that Yagman had "impugned the integrity" of the 
court by making blistering and unfounded charges about their colleague, U.S. 
District Judge William D. Keller -- including accusing him of being 
anti-Semitic, "ignorant, dishonest . . . a bully on the bench and one of the 
worst judges in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Berry, who is the attorney for a special federal court disciplinary committee 
that recommended that Yagman be sanctioned, responded: 
</P>
<P>
 "The cases . . . have made it clear that judges are integral to the judicial 
process and that an attack, especially a false, unsubstantiated attack, that 
has no objective basis, on a sitting judge assails the very foundation of the 
judicial process and undermines the public confidence in the judicial process 
which is essential for its proper administration." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kozinski expressed skepticism, noting that attacks on a prosecutor, other 
lawyers or the clerk of the court also could undermine public confidence in the 
judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman was suspended in early July by three judges who ruled that he had 
criticized Keller, a conservative judge, in hopes of forcing Keller to remove 
himself from Yagman's cases. Yagman has consistently denied this and on 
Wednesday his attorney, Ramsey Clark, the former U.S. attorney general, said 
the charge was absurd. Berry retorted that the lower court judges had found 
this charge credible. 
</P>
<P>
 In late July, Yagman's suspension was stayed by the 9th Circuit, pending his 
appeal. Although there is no firm timetable on when the appeals court will 
rule, it ordered an expedited hearing. The three-judge panel, which also 
includes David Thompson and Charles Wiggins, could uphold the lower-court 
decision, reverse it or send the case back for further proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has drawn considerable interest in legal circles. More than 100 Los 
Angeles lawyers and law professors signed a friend of the court brief on 
Yagman's behalf, contending that the decision to suspend him potentially 
threatens the free speech rights of all attorneys. A number of the supporters 
helped pack the courtroom Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozinski, whose questioning dominated the one-hour oral argument, flatly 
disagreed with Berry's contention that it was Yagman's obligation to prove that 
the allegations he made were true. The judge seemed to be leaning toward the 
argument made by Yagman's lawyer, Clark, who said it was Keller's obligation to 
prove that the charges were false or made in reckless disregard for the truth.

ACCIDENTS, A SINKHOLE FOLLOW SUDDEN RAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In a sudden change in the weather, a cold front swept into the San Fernando 
Valley on Wednesday morning, bringing strong wind and rain that set off a rash 
of fender-bender car crashes and perhaps opened a sinkhole in a Granada Hills 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were no major rain-related crashes, Officer Frank Zdroy of the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic division said: "We've had more 
than our share of (minor) accidents. The streets are slick and people are 
driving like fools." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the California Highway Patrol routinely puts out advisories telling 
drivers to slow down on rainy roads and the state includes weather questions on 
the driver's license test, many drivers don't change their fair weather driving 
habits on slick streets, traffic safety experts complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Californians are notoriously horrible drivers," said Officer Joseph Gomez, a 
veteran San Fernando Valley motorcycle officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said the state Department of Motor Vehicles should include skid training 
as part of the license test, so drivers would not have to perform their first 
panic stop on a slick road with another car a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't adjust to the weather. They fail to realize the stopping 
distance of a vehicle is increased. Mix rain with the oil on the roads and it's 
like driving on ice." 
</P>
<P>
 In Granada Hills, a sinkhole the size of a car opened in Balboa Boulevard, 
closing two lanes of traffic during rush hour on Wednesday evening, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said it was unclear whether the rain was to blame for the hole, 
but they would continue to investigate. "There is water under the street," said 
Bob Hayes, spokesman for the Department of Public Works. "But we don't know 
where it came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Street maintenance crews put up barriers around the sinkhole in front of the 
Knollwood Country Club at about 3 p.m., Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was limited to one lane in each direction, causing a jam that 
stretched three quarters of a mile to the Simi Valley Freeway. Officials said 
the blockage would last several days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mess out there," said Cheryl Horning, a waitress at the country 
club's coffee shop. "I am taking a short cut home." 
</P>
<P>
 At the All Safe Driving School in Tarzana, students routinely cancel their 
lessons on rainy days, even though that is an ideal time to practice defensive 
driving, said the school's operator, Chahin Moussavi. 
</P>
<P>
 Moussavi said drivers should maintain an extra-long distance between cars in 
the rain, turn on headlights and slow down. Other tips include making sure 
tires have enough tread, and avoiding hard braking, accelerating or swerving. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm driving on a rainy day, I'm always looking around," said Moussavi, 
who trains driving instructors. "I never assume that the other guy knows what 
he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for drivers everywhere: The morning rainstorm has headed out of 
the region, leaving partly cloudy skies and temperatures in the 60s in coming 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 But beware. Curtis Brock, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times, says Southern California may see light showers return 
early next week.

FOR THESE KIDS, PATH OF PROTEST IS A HARD ROAD; ACTIVISM: BIRMINGHAM HIGH 
STUDENTS MOUNT A NOT-VERY-ORGANIZED MARCH AGAINST PROPOSITION 187. IT RAINS ON 
THEIR PARADE BUT THE URGE TO ACTION PERSEVERES. 
</P>

<P>
 For the ragtag band of teen-age protesters, Wednesday was a test of the 
faithful, a soggy check of the spirit of their dissent, a temperature gauge of 
the fire they said burned in their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 It was raining. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it was pouring . The two dozen Birmingham High School students who ditched 
class to walk along Victory Boulevard -- waving anti-Proposition 187 banners 
and shouting slogans to passing cars -- looked more like waterlogged rodents 
than concerned youths protesting a ballot measure they consider an immoral ban 
on immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 All morning, rain pelted their parade, ripping their cardboard protest banner 
to tatters, running rivers of mascara down the faces of the young girls. "It's 
sunny all the time here," said 15-year-old William Mejia, his slicked-back hair 
glistening in the downpour. "And the one day we want to walk outside and speak 
our minds, it rains like nobody's business. It's scaring kids away. It's 
ruining things." 
</P>
<P>
 One day after Birmingham High officials locked students inside campus grounds 
and successfully stifled their protest, unfazed organizers planned a pre-school 
march outside the grounds of the Van Nuys school. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 8 a.m., their best-laid plans unraveled at the corner of Balboa and 
Victory boulevards: Some confused students went to the wrong meeting spot. 
Others were shepherded inside campus gates by insistent teachers. And many took 
one look at the skies and decided it wasn't a very good day for peaceful civil 
disobedience after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all who remained were the most stubborn of teens. The Defiant Ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The largely Latino group huddled inside a nearby doughnut shop and plotted 
their strategy -- a walk around the campus perimeter and then on to the Van 
Nuys courthouse, where perhaps someone would listen to their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they hit the streets, this throng too young to vote but not too timid to 
speak its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Their leader was a tough-talking 16-year-old named Desiree Saravia. Desiree, 
her eyebrows shaved and wrist tattooed, said she grew up in the streets near 
Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Like some skinny platform-shoed drill sergeant, Desiree barked orders at the 
others, who treated her with deference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's got a cigarette?" she snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, here, take mine," one girl responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiree took a dramatic drag, then demanded: "Somebody, get me some coffee!" 
</P>
<P>
 Talking nonstop, Desiree, who spoke out at the previous day's assembly, told 
her troops: 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody listened to me yesterday because I was brave enough to speak my 
mind. I speak for myself because I'm too young to vote. So this is how I make 
my ideas known, by protest. But the rest of you, speak for yourself. Go ahead!" 
</P>
<P>
 Kamesha Smith, 14, said she was marching because she feared that passage of 
Proposition 187, which in part would bar illegal immigrants from public 
education, would mean that some of her Latino friends would have to leave the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like her," Kamesha said, pointing to a 14-year-old classmate. "She's like a 
cousin to me. If this thing passes, she and her family might have to leave. And 
who wants that?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 William said he had seen TV shows about all those student protests back during 
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be part of the protest today," he said. "People might think we're 
immature. No, dude. We have a mentality that tells us this is just not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 All along the sidewalk march, Desiree ordered students to keep their hands off 
parked cars. At intersections, she herded them through the street like a 
crosswalk guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, one student noticed a patrol car trailing the procession. When 
students tried to enter a McDonald's to get out of the rain, the officer used 
his loudspeaker to tell them they would have to keep moving or be subject to 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're truant from school," the patrolman later said. "My orders are to make 
sure they don't cause any trouble. During the protest last week, some kids went 
on beer runs and caused trouble. That won't happen today." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so the group kept moving, yelling when motorists beeped their horns in 
support, shrieking even louder when passing cars sent up a drenching spray from 
roadside puddles. Observed one student: "Hey, how come it's only the Mexicans 
who are beeping at us? Doesn't anybody else care?" 
</P>
<P>
 As they circled the school grounds, the protesters hooted at non-participating 
students who congregated on a asphalt playing field inside the fence. Some 
cheered back before being shooed inside by teachers. The marchers squealed in 
delight when one young boy suddenly leaped over the fence to join their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "One out," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 " Vamonos ," let's go, said another. 
</P>
<P>
 Then dissension hit the ranks. One by one, students began to peel away from 
the group, some heading for home, others back to school. Students complained of 
the cold and their dwindling numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd keep going but there's not enough kids," said Oscar Elias. "You need lots 
more people to make a demonstration work." 
</P>
<P>
 Desiree stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter how many of us there are," she assured them. "We're making 
our point, even if there are only one or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the back of the pack, a teen-ager named Anita wasn't listening. Later, 
she and a friend would ditch the others and head home for a snack. Now, though, 
she was worried about some guy at school she thinks is cute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like him. He's gorgeous," she told her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a dork," the other girl said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a dork," Anita responded. "I'm going to tell him I was sorry I got 
so drunk the other night. As soon as we get back to campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Up front, Desiree talked of her plans after high school. She once wanted to 
become a model, but now realizes she has too many tattoos. "So, I guess I'll 
just be a psychologist or something," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then somebody asked her how she's going to make it all the way to the Van Nuys 
courthouse with her platform shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll make it," Desiree said. "So shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 Along Victory Boulevard, the shouts of the protesters were drowned out by the 
roar of passing cars and construction jackhammers. Drenched, the students held 
up placards to the windows of storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You break my window, I'll break your face," said the cook at Panus 
Charbroiler. Then, to his customers: "Those kids, they're just looking for a 
break from classes. They don't fool me for one minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, less than a third of the way to the courthouse, a car driven by a 
student friend pulls up, giving Desiree an idea: It was taking too long to make 
the walk, so the student would ferry protesters by the carload. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 a.m., three hours after their adventure began, their numbers halved, the 
group stood before the Marine Corps recruiting office outside the Van Nuys 
courthouse -- wet, tired, dispirited. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines invited them in. But instead of making their case against 
Proposition 187, they stood around in a silent, bashful cluster, waiting for 
Desiree to speak for them. Somehow, this march wasn't working out like she had 
expected, one young girl whispered to her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for one last time, Desiree laid out her strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to wait here until somebody talks to us," she told the 
others. "Maybe we'll talk to the police. Or the mayor. Anybody who will listen. 
And we'll keep doing this until somebody does listen. We've still got a week to 
go before the vote."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; WIDOW WINS 1ST CIVIL TRIAL IN ESTATE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A filmmaker's widow who has been embroiled in a complicated dispute over his 
multimillion estate for the past five years has won the first of a series of 
related civil trials, paving the way for a possible criminal investigation of 
one of her brothers-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 In a decision issued last week by retired appellate court Justice Robert 
Feinerman, any rights to "Gone in 60 Seconds II" -- the unfinished last movie 
project of the late Henry B. (Toby) Halicki -- were denied to his brother 
Ronald Halicki, who runs an upstate New York towing and auto-salvaging business 
and had claimed nearly $2.3 million for work he said he and his company 
contributed to the car-crash action film. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Halicki also claimed that he co-wrote the movie and helped develop a 
custom, car-hurling vehicle called "The Slicer," among other creative 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But while he acknowledged that "Ronald did render valuable pre-film services 
to his brother," Feinerman ultimately agreed with Halicki's widow, Denice, that 
Ronald signed a release relinquishing any rights to the movie. Feinerman also 
cited the testimony of a handwriting expert who cast doubt on the validity of 
documents that Denice Halicki and her lawyers accused Ronald Halicki of 
forging. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won on everything," Denice Halicki's lawyer, Brian Lysaght, crowed this 
week. "He got zero and a lot of trouble to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Lysaght said he has already asked Feinerman to refer the forgery allegations 
to the district attorney's office for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Ronald Halicki, Robert Masenga, declined to comment on the 
forgery claims, saying only that he disagreed with Feinerman's decision and was 
considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Halicki, best known for his 1974 car-theft chronicle "Gone in 60 Seconds," was 
48 when he died in a key stunt during the making of the sequel. Though he and 
Denice Halicki had a home in Gardena, she now lives in Encino with her fiance, 
lawyer and O.J. Simpson confidant Robert Kardashian. 
</P>
<P>
 Denice Halicki will receive no immediate financial gain from Feinerman's 
decision. But in denying Ronald Halicki's claims, Feinerman restored more than 
$2 million to the filmmaker's estate, of which she is the chief beneficiary.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the estate was initially valued at $14.7 million, a court-appointed 
admininistrator has stated that it could end up insolvent once debts, including 
Ronald Halicki's claims, were paid. LESLIE BERGER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: BELL CANYON; FIREFIGHTERS PLAN CONTROLLED BURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters will conduct a controlled burn of vegetation in the Santa Monica 
Mountains today to thin out tinder-dry growth, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The burn will begin at 5 a.m. on 700 acres near Bell Canyon, fire officials 
said. Residents of Bell Canyon, Agoura Hills, Hidden Hills, Las Virgenes Canyon 
and Liberty Canyon may notice smoke from the exercise, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials expect most of the smoke to loft high over populated areas. The 
burn is needed to eliminate dry grass, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 That particular area has not burned in over 10 years, officials said. The burn 
will be canceled if windy or other unfavorable weather conditions develop, fire 
authorities said. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE STUDENTS OFFERED QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When the Northridge earthquake struck Jan. 17, it nearly derailed the plans of 
Pierce College sophomore Nicole Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen of Encino said she lost one of her two part-time jobs -- and a major 
portion of her income -- when the quake-damaged Topanga Theatre was closed. 
That left her, she said, with one low-paying, part-time job at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 She figures she lost between $2,000 and $3,000 in wages because of the quake. 
With her reduced income, she said, it was a struggle to pay the rent for her 
one-bedroom apartment and meet other bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, 20, recently received some good news. Pierce College, school officials 
say, will soon distribute $1 million in federal grant money to students who 
have been affected by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor disrupted the lives of hundreds of students at the school, said 
Joy McCaslin, the school's associate dean of student services. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who were left homeless had to spend much of their time looking for 
places to live instead of concentrating on school, said McCaslin. And, like 
Nguyen, many students lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaslin said that new students may also be eligible for the grants. "They can 
file a financial application now before they even sign up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaslin said the grant amounts have not yet been determined, but because 
several hundred students are eligible, a $500 cap may have to be set. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is expected to start allocating the money within the next two 
weeks, she said. Those seeking information are asked to call McCaslin's office 
at (818) 719-6422, or the financial aid office at (818) 719-6428. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the grant arrangement, $435,000 is available in supplemental education 
opportunity grants, which students can spend on living expenses, McCaslin said. 
The remaining portion, $670,955, will be used to fund work-study jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps a lot," said Nguyen, a biology major who plans to transfer next year 
to UC San Diego. "Now, I will be able to save a little of it for some other 
emergencies." FRANK MANNING

ELECTION '94; 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), 61, is seeking his 10th term 
in congress. A lawyer by training, the former state legislator is married and 
has three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican challenger Richard Sybert, 42, is an attorney and businessman who 
was director of Gov. Pete Wilson's Office of Planning and Research. He and his 
wife have one child. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the most closely watched congressional races in the state. The 
GOP is hopeful that Sybert, a Harvard Law School-trained policy wonk with money 
(he has already loaned more than $420,000 of his own money to the campaign), 
can bring the 24th District home as a trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 To help out, a hit parade of national GOP leaders, including U.S. Rep. Newt 
Gingrich (R-Georgia) and U.S. Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kansas), have visited the 
24th District to appear at Sybert fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the professorial Beilenson, a legislator in Sacramento or Washington, D.C. 
since LBJ was president, is no easy target and in 1992 he gave GOP challenger 
Tom McClintock, a state assemblyman, a drubbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson has contrasted his own refusal to take campaign contributions from 
political action committees with Sybert's record of soliciting such special 
interest money. And the incumbent, relying on another old but often effective 
cliche, is painting Sybert as the rank outsider who only moved to the 24th 
District last year and relies on national GOP leaders to prop up his 
non-indigenous candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sybert says Beilenson is too liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert notes that Beilenson opposes Proposition 187 (the ballot measure to 
deny key social and educational services to illegal immigrants); voted for the 
tax hikes in the Clinton administration's deficit reduction plan; and has 
opposed the death penalty. Sybert backs Prop. 187; says he would have voted 
against raising taxes to reduce the deficit; and backs the deathy penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of this race could be a cliffhanger. 
</P>
<P>
 The district runs westward from Sherman Oaks across the San Fernando Valley to 
Malibu and to Thousands Oaks in Ventura County. The registration is 46% 
Democratic, 39% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running is Libertarian John Koehler, a small business developer from Oak 
Park. JOHN SCHWADA

VALLEY: RESIDENTS TO HONOR POST-QUAKE EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to recognize the hard work and good deeds of thousands of San 
Fernando Valley residents during and since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, a 
group of residents has organized a day of celebration and ceremony honoring a 
vast cross-section of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to take place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Nov. 12 at the Balboa 
Recreation Center, "San Fernando Rebuilds" will include celebrity participation 
in softball, volleyball, basketball, raffles, picnics and door prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is not open to the general public, however. Local chambers of 
commerce, Kiwanis and other service organizations were asked to identify 
leaders who dedicated time and resources to help the community rebound from the 
quake. Invitations are being mailed to more than 2,500 local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan is scheduled to appear. He will be thanked for his work 
in providing a $300-million housing loan package for those who were uninsured 
or underinsured when the temblor struck.  
</P>
<P>
 Each of those invited to the event will receive a special gift package 
provided by local businesses and other corporations. More than 5,000 compact 
discs will be distributed by Motown. Other merchandise and gift certificates 
will be provided by Pep Boys and McDonald's, according to Horace L. Walker, 
co-chairman of the event. TIM MAY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COUNCIL OKS NEW HOURS FOR CITY OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to become more customer-friendly, the Glendale City Council has 
approved a new work schedule at City Hall to cut the confusion caused by the 
irregular hours some city departments have been keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The adoption last year of a "9/80" schedule -- in which city offices are 
closed every other Friday -- plus the limited business hours kept by the 
Department of Water and Power's billing counter and the offices that issue 
building permits and related services, have created headaches for the public 
and the business community, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to standardize our hours as best we can so that when you do 
business with the city, it will be very clear when we are open and when we are 
not," said City Manager David Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheduling changes were recommended by the Warner Group, a firm that 
recently audited the city's organizational structure.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the city stopped short of reverting to the traditional 40-hour week 
without the alternating "dark Fridays" -- which Warner suggested. Ramsay said 
the 9/80 workweek has helped the city comply with South Coast Air Quality 
Management District trip-reduction guidelines and avoid costly fines, as well 
as reducing overtime and sick pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the new schedule will have all general city offices open from 7:30 
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every other 
Friday. Offices that cover zoning, planning, fire, public works, public service 
and permit services will be open 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 
alternate Fridays. The public-service department counter, where water and 
electric bills are paid, will be open 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through 
Thursday and alternate Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 While the changes are relatively minor -- some departments will merely be open 
a half hour longer each day -- Ramsay said they should help people pay their 
bills and get more business finished. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; NEW HOT LINE HELPS REUNITE OWNERS, PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doubt lingers: Whiskers has been missing for a week. But maybe she hasn't met 
with some terrible fate. Maybe somebody has found her. 
</P>
<P>
 There's one way to find out: Call the Pet Lost and Found Hotline, a new 
24-hour automated pet locater service started by William McLean, a 56-year-old 
pet-sitter from Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 If an animal was lost within a 10-mile radius of Sherman Oaks, its owner can 
leave a message, free of charge, on the hot line -- (818) 386-1475 -- and 
McLean will include the information on a recorded list of missing pets that he 
updates daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if a pet has been found by someone in the Sherman Oaks area, a message 
describing the animal can be left. Callers can check hot-line recordings at the 
push of a button. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean came up with the idea while walking someone's dogs a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love animals," McLean said. "As I walked around and saw all the signs for 
missing pets, I thought a lost and found hot line wouldn't be too difficult. I 
had an extra phone line with 30 minutes of voice mail space. And if that fills 
up, I can switch a line to my computer, and I have virtually unlimited space 
for people to record messages about animals they've lost or found." 
</P>
<P>
 McLean launched the hot line last week and hopes to encourage pet lovers in 
other areas to begin similar services. He's gone to local animal clinics and 
pet stores to notify them about the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The service costs McLean little to maintain -- he pays the phone company a 
basic charge for the extra line and four phone mailboxes -- and, so far, 
updating the message list takes him only 20 minutes each day. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean said about 10 people have left messages listing pets lost in the area, 
with several offering rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, who recovered his missing dog after leaving a message -- and a reward 
offering -- on the hot line, raised questions about the possibility of con 
artists using the system for phony pet ransom schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying it happened to me," said the man, who asked not to be 
identified. "I'm just saying it's a possibility." 'I thought a lost and found 
hot line wouldn't be too difficult. I had an extra phone line with 30 minutes 
of voice mail space. And if that fills up, I can switch a line to my computer, 
and I have virtually unlimited space for people to record messages about 
animals they've lost or found.' WILLIAM MCLEAN TIM MAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; SIDEWALK ASTRONOMY PROGRAM SCHEDULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget Cruise as the Vampire Lestat. Forget DeNiro as Dr. Frankenstein's 
monster. For some real full-moon action, check out the Sylmar branch of the Los 
Angeles Public Library on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the public can peer at the solar system through telescopes, check out 
craters on the full moon, and take a gander at Saturn and possibly Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special "Sidewalk Astronomy" program to be held at the library from 6 to 
8 p.m., members of an amateur astronomers group from Santa Clarita will set up 
their scopes for public viewing, offering insight into some murky universal 
matter, including nebulas, dust lanes and galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under really good conditions, you might be able to see the Andromeda galaxy," 
said LaVerne Booth, one of the astronomers who will be there with her 
eight-inch telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a full moon, and a lot of city light, too, so we'll probably 
see a lot of the moon and Saturn," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's cloudy or raining, the astronomers plan to set up a slide show inside 
and conduct a question-and-answer program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sidewalk Astronomy program was started a few years ago by Dana Eklund, a 
librarian at the Benjamin Franklin Branch Library. An amateur astronomer, 
Eklund invited some of his friends to set up their telescopes at a public 
library and answer questions posed by curious stargazers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really successful," Eklund said. "We've done most of the programs 
in the Los Angeles area -- some have drawn as many as 200 people -- and the 
Sylmar program is one of the first we've scheduled in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the program, call Eklund at (213) 263-6901. TIM MAY

ELECTION '94; 20TH SENATE DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Senator Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), 76, is seeking his fourth 
term in the senate. A partner in a printing company who was in the state 
assembly from 1974 to 1982, Rosenthal is married and has two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican challenger Dolores White, 59, is running for the seat for the third 
time. A real estate broker from Reseda who formerly taught college-level 
business classes, White is married and has five children. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the seat with a Byzantine history. Alan Robbins held it until 
November, 1991 when he resigned after pleading guilty to political corruption 
charges. It next was captured in a June, 1992 special election by state Sen. 
David Roberti. He had been on the prowl for a new political digs after 
reapportionment had dismantled his old Hollywood-based district. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti survived a nasty recall election in April, 1994 engineered by gun 
rights advocates that stunted his bid to become the Democratic nominee for 
state treasurer. Term limits are now forcing Roberti to step down in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Rosenthal, who has represented mostly West Side-based districts 
during his two-decades-long legislative career. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal had been expected to retire rather than seek reelection to the 
unfamiliar and heavily Latino 22nd District seat allotted to him by the 1992 
reapportionment plan. But Roberti's own imminent departure and - so the story 
goes - the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake changed that. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing his sympathies for the earthquake-ravaged Valley, Rosenthal has said he 
has felt called by duty to put his long years of legislative experience to good 
use by representing the Valley in its hour of need. 
</P>
<P>
 White doesn't buy any of this, of course. Rosenthal is a "left-wing 
carpetbagger" using the 20th District as a sanctuary, she claims. 
</P>
<P>
 But White, a sponsor of last spring's recall crusade against Roberti, is not 
expected to have the money to effectively make her case against Rosenthal. 
Meanwhile, the senator can rely on the financial firepower of the political 
machine of U.S. Rep. Howard Berman (D-Mission Hills) and Henry Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles) of which he is a member. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, a GOP candidate in this heavily Democratic, working class east 
Valley district faces tough odds. The registration here is 58% Democratic, 29% 
Republican. JOHN SCHWADA

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; LEADERSHIP RETREAT PLANNED FOR LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latino students from 35 Southland colleges and universities will converge in 
Glendale beginning today for a four-day retreat that focuses on improving 
leadership and human-relations skills. 
</P>
<P>
 About 130 students will take part in the eighth annual Latino College 
Leadership Institute, which continues through Sunday at Camp Max Strauss in the 
Verdugo Hills.The program, sponsored by the National Conference of Christians 
and Jews and the Assn. of Mexican American Educators, prepares students to 
combat racism and intercultural hostilities, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although (the program) is for one ethnic group only, the skills being 
imparted to these young people will benefit our multicultural Southern 
California by developing future leaders who are sensitive to intercultural 
understanding and who know how to lead," said Jim Hilvert, National Conference 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Loera, conference coordinator, said the students will spend the first 
two days in discussion groups, working on ways to deal with discrimination 
based on race, gender, age and sexual orientation. In the second half, the 
students will identify discrimination issues on their respective campuses and 
put together action plans to deal with such problems.  
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday morning, the students will present their plans to a panel of 
professionals and educators for critiquing.  
</P>
<P>
 During the weekend, Loera said the group also will undoubtedly debate 
Proposition 187, the measure on Tuesday's ballot that would deny public 
benefits to illegal immigrants.STEVE RYFLE

LESSONS LEARNED; SCHOOLS GET CREDIT FOR HOLDING TEEN SMOKING STEADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Camel sure looks cool, decked out in sunglasses and plastered on 
billboards throughout the city. But the fictional cigarette company character 
can bury his butts in the Mojave, as far as Carlos and Luis Basulto are 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers -- ages 15 and 10 -- say they've been taught at school what 
cigarette smoking can do. "We know it hurts you," said Carlos, who attends 
Cleveland High in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Such classroom lessons are believed to be part of the reason teen-age smoking 
in California has leveled off in the past three years, while teen-agers in 
other states across the country are lighting up more than ever. About 3 million 
teen-agers smoke nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos and Luis say it was in the classroom, not from television or at home 
(their father smokes) that they learned nicotine, tar and lung tissue don't 
mix, no matter what the Marlboro Man might say. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators and activists say California's anti-tobacco media campaign and 
education program is making the difference. The program -- which includes TV 
commercials -- is funded by a 25-cent excise tax on cigarette packs. The tax, 
known as Proposition 99, was approved by voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 About 19% of California boys ages 16 and 17 smoked in 1990, a percentage that 
has held steady through 1993, according to a study completed this year by the 
Cancer Prevention and Control Program at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The same study found that California girls ages 16 and 17 smoke less than boys 
the same age. Slightly more than 15% of California girls 16 and 17 smoked in 
1990, and only 14% percent of that age group said they smoked in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, about 25% of all 17- and 18-year-olds are smokers, and the rate is 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Valley Community Clinic in North Hollywood, Reasie Flagg, director of 
tobacco education, says it's important to ensure teen-agers learn to ignore 
peer pressure and resist glitzy cigarette ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagg uses Proposition 99 funds to pay a group of young actors to perform such 
plays as "The Trial of Virginia Slimes" at area schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an 'L.A. Law' type production," Flagg said. "We ask the audience to 
decide whether Virginia Slimes should be held responsible for the deaths of 
those she persuaded to smoke. We have to make it very corny or the students 
would feel insulted." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Pierce, director of UCSD's cancer prevention program, agrees that 
increased education is the key to neutralizing teen-age smoking rates in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tobacco tax and the programs appear to be working," said Pierce. "It's 
kept teen smoking in check, and it's also preventing young adults from 
starting."  
</P>
<P>
 But cigarette advertising that targets youth often hits the mark, Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With your average 16-year-old, we found they're smoking one of two brands: 
Camel or Marlboro," Pierce said. "That tells us they're not impacted by the 
higher cost, or they'd be smoking cheaper generic brands. We concluded that the 
school-based tobacco education programs are working."  
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Costas, principal at Charles Maclay Middle School in Pacoima, said 
students who sneak smokes are rare at her school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids are really into doing what's good for the environment and good for 
their bodies," Costas said. "We teach them in class to have self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 99 funds are also used to send thousands of Los Angeles-area 
children to a three-day smoke-free camp in Saugus near Magic Mountain amusement 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Basulto went to the camp this year with his 10-year-old classmate, 
Francisco Avalos. Both attend Cantara Street Elementary School in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "They showed us videos about how smoking affects you," Francisco said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They took us hiking and told us not to smoke," Luis added. His older brother, 
Mario, 19, doesn't smoke either, but said his decision was personal. Mario, who 
attends Pierce College, said most of his close friends are non-smokers, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cigarette ads don't really get to us, I guess," Basulto added. 
"California is a relatively healthy state. As a state, we're not too good at 
too many things, but I guess if the teen-agers don't smoke as much as the rest 
of the country, that's one good thing."  
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Dietsch, coordinator of the Tobacco Use Prevention and Education 
program for the Los Angeles Unified School District, said Proposition 99 funds 
this year are being used mostly for education programs that target students in 
the fourth through eighth grades.  
</P>
<P>
 Some students say they don't need a corny play or a day camp to help them 
understand why smoking isn't healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Morales, an eighth-grader at Northridge Middle School, shrugged his 
shoulders when asked why he doesn't smoke, even though his friends do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I don't want to die too fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of teen-age smoking on next week's vote on Proposition 188 -- a 
ballot initiative designed to replace California's current smoking restrictions 
with a weaker set of rules -- is a matter of debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who oppose the measure, including the local unit of the American Cancer 
Society, say it will lead to increased teen-age smoking. But the tobacco 
industry says 188 would lead to reduced levels of teen-age tobacco use by 
putting restrictions on cigarette vending machines.

MAN FATALLY SHOT IN VAN NUYS

 A 27-year-old man who had recently moved to Panorama City was fatally wounded 
by gunfire as he walked to a friend's house late Tuesday, hours before he was 
about to start a new job at a bakery, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Huezo was apparently shot several times in the upper torso by a robber, 
Los Angeles Police Detective Stephen Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 10:45 p.m. outside an apartment complex in the 
8500 block of Cedros Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huezo, originally from El Salvador, had recently moved to the San Fernando 
Valley from San Francisco and "was on his way to a new job when the incident 
took place," Fisk said. "Physical evidence indicates there was a struggle prior 
to the shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics rushed Huezo to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where 
he died shortly afterward, authorities said.

INSIDE THE ADS; 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GOP candidate Richard Sybert has sent a political mailer this week to 
thousands of 24th Congressional District voters as part of his campaign to 
unseat U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). The 24th District race 
has attracted national attention, including visits from top Republican leaders 
to raise funds for Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE SYBERT MAILER: In a sendup of the popular 1982 movie "E.T.", the cover 
of the four page Sybert mailer shows a photo of the moon with the caption: 
"T.B. Phone Home!" Page two consists of a photo of Beilenson and the following 
quote attributed to the congressman: "I love being a member of Congress . . . I 
would be really sad if I were not." The mailer continues on the third page, 
saying: "Liberal Congressman Tony Beilenson used to live in California. But 
after 18 years in Congress, he's lost touch and now 'prefers spending his time 
in Maryland.' No wonder he says 'to be honest with you, I don't think about 
California's problems very much.' " The mailer attributes these two quotes to a 
Los Angeles Times article from June, 1989. The mailer goes on to contend that 
politicians who have been in office as long as Beilenson "start thinking 
they're a cut above the rest of us. They flip-flop on issues and change their 
positions to fit the latest polls." To prove its point, the mailer cites an 
October, 1990, Times article that quotes Beilenson as saying: "I do not support 
capital punishment."But now, the mailer states, the incumbent says he supports 
the death penalty. Hypocrisy is the next target of the mailer. Although 
Beilenson has pledged for years that he would not take special interest money 
from political action committees, the Sybert piece cites a 1992 Times inquiry 
that found that Beilenson -- during his congressional race that year -- was 
"benefiting from at least three special interest groups." Beilenson also is 
quoted as saying in 1988 that the answer to the nation's budget deficit was 
higher taxes, not spending cuts. Later, the mailer observes, Beilenson voted 
for the Clinton Administration deficit reduction plan and a $285-billion tax 
hike to fund it. 
</P>
<P>
 * ANALYSIS: Two of the quotes attributed to The Times are incomplete or have 
been taken out of context. A June, 1989, Times article included an observation 
that Beilenson leads a quiet social life in Washington and "prefers to spend 
his time gardening (emphasis added) at his home in Maryland." On capital 
punishment, the quote attributed to Beilenson by Sybert is incomplete. What 
Beilenson actually said was: "In general, I do not support capital punishment 
-- but I have voted for imposing it in a limited number of cases, including 
punishment for persons convicted of being kingpins in illegal drug operations . 
. . and for several other categories of heinous crimes." Finally, a 1992 Times 
inquiry did find that Beilenson was getting help from an abortion rights group, 
CARAL, that might have been construed as a political action committee 
contribution and that two other groups, the Sierra Club and United Teachers of 
Los Angeles, were making independent expenditures on Beilenson's behalf. 
Beilenson later asked CARAL to cease its activities. Beilenson did vote for the 
Clinton deficit reduction plan.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CURBSIDE TRASH RECYCLING DROPS TO LOWEST 
LEVEL; ENVIRONMENT: CITY OFFICIALS BLAME NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE FOR LAG IN 
PARTICIPATION IN FIRST HALF OF 1994. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Residents' use of the city's curbside trash recycling program fell in the 
first half of this year to the lowest level in the two-year history of the 
program, despite city advertising campaigns, school presentations and cash 
awards, city public works officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, under pressure from a state law to encourage recycling, blamed 
the Northridge earthquake for the drop-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 3,680 tons of reusable materials were picked up between January and June, 
25% less than during the same period in 1993 and 162 tons less than in the 
first six months of the program in 1992, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, residents separate newspapers, aluminum cans and glass for 
separate pickup by trash collectors for the city, who pass the material on to 
recyclers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all California municipalities, Santa Clarita is subject to a state law 
that requires a reduction of trash going into local dumps -- 25% by 1995 and 
50% by 2000. Cities and counties that fail to meet the requirement face fines 
of $10,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 An even bigger incentive for Santa Clarita to reduce its trash output is the 
city's fight against a proposed dump in Elsmere Canyon, southeast of where San 
Fernando Road intersects the Antelope Valley Freeway. City leaders oppose the 
190-million ton landfill and argue that other methods of trash disposal -- from 
reduction to recycling to rail-hauling -- make the dump unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Santa Clarita Public Works Department, which operates the 
recycling program, suggest the Northridge earthquake was responsible for the 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that many people were probably significantly distracted from their 
recycling effort," said Jeff Kolin, city public works director. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop-off in recyclables -- and the explanation for it -- is similar to 
that described by some other recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles residents put out 5,000 tons of materials for recycling in January 
and 5,600 tons in February, fewer than the 6,600 tons brought in monthly from 
March through June, according to the Los Angeles Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake is the only thing we had that happened any different," said 
Gyl Elliott, public information director for the department's waste reduction 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott also suggested that people may become complacent over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a natural dip when you've been in a program for years," said Elliott. 
"It's not right in front of them any more. They're not getting the flyers in 
the mail." 
</P>
<P>
 More recent statistics on Santa Clarita recycling won't be available for 
months, but independent recycling centers -- where residents bring materials 
ranging from aluminum foil to car batteries to magazines for cash payments -- 
say business is back to pre-quake levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about the same, more or less," said Robert Tabajdi, who works at Santa 
Clarita Recycling Center in Newhall. "For a few weeks after the earthquake, 
there weren't very many customers coming in. Then it picked up gradually." 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling traditionally dips during the winter months, Tabajdi said. Fewer 
residents drink beverages from aluminum cans or are willing to travel to a 
recycling center during poor weather.

 Sheriff's deputies are looking for several men, possibly transients, suspected 
of setting six fires in vacant Palmdale businesses and houses on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured, and little property damage was reported, Sgt. Bob Denham 
said.The motive for the fires was not immediately determined, and investigators 
were seeking the public's help in identifying and locating an unknown number of 
men seen running from the blazes set throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were all abandoned structures," Denham said. "In several of those 
places, there was evidence that transients had been living there." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses reported seeing men running from the scene of several of the fires, 
but descriptions were sketchy. The fires occurred mainly in Palmdale's former 
business district, near Sierra Highway.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STATE PLANS TO BUILD 400-BED VETERANS HOME IN 
LANCASTER; HIGH DESERT: APARTMENT COMPLEX IS EXPECTED TO SERVE A SUBSTANTIAL 
NUMBER OF RETIREES FROM EDWARDS AIR BASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four new veterans homes planned for Southern California will include a 
$31-million, 400-bed facility in Lancaster, state officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment complex for disabled and elderly war veterans is expected to 
serve a substantial number of retirees from nearby Edwards Air Force Base, and 
will be located across from a new county hospital, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it will dovetail nicely" with the new hospital's opening, said 
Michael Kilbane, a spokesman for the state Department of Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster officials, clearly pleased by the announcement, said the veterans 
home could be built within two years if the state Legislature quickly approves 
its $11-million share of the cost. The federal government will pay the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 One state-run veterans home is under construction in Barstow, and it will be 
followed by another in Chula Vista and then the one in Lancaster, said Kilbane. 
</P>
<P>
 The site of the fourth home has not been determined, but proposals from 
Ventura, Perris in Riverside County and an unidentified city in Orange County 
are under consideration by the Governor's Commission on a Southern California 
Veterans Home, Kilbane said. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory panel put Chula Vista ahead of Lancaster on the tentative 
construction schedule primarily because a hospital is already located next to 
the Chula Vista site, Kilbane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster has been lobbying actively for a veterans home since the state 
announced plans two years ago to build four such facilities in Southern 
California, where none now exist despite a growing number of aging and disabled 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, hoping to gain an edge over competing cities, the Lancaster 
Redevelopment Agency bought a 38-acre vacant parcel at the northwest corner of 
30th Street West and Avenue I -- across from the proposed county hospital site 
-- as a potential location for the veterans home. 
</P>
<P>
 The land cost $1.9 million, and the city is spending additional money for 
street widening and sewers. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility would include 220 small apartments for veterans who do not need 
special medical supervision. The remaining units would be for patients who need 
varying degrees of nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
 The home will be open to wartime veterans who are disabled or at least 62 
years old, as well as their spouses. Residents will contribute a percentage of 
their income to help defray the costs.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 200 INVOLVED IN FIGHT AT PITCHESS 
</P>

<P>
 An argument between two county jail inmates over sleeping arrangements erupted 
into a racially tainted brawl involving 200 fellow prisoners, the largest such 
incident in recent weeks at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, authorities 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Six inmates suffered minor injuries in the fights in which Latino and African 
American inmates, some armed with broken broom handles, took sides against each 
other, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Irma Becerra. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies, none of whom was injured, regained control in six minutes using 
verbal commands and pepper spray, Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday at the minimum security facility 
when two inmates -- one Latino and one black -- began arguing over bunk 
assignments and exchanged punches. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 140 inmates engaged in a fight that led to 10 stabbings. That was 
the 52nd such incident this year at the jail, long plagued by racial tension 
and violence. In June, 800 black and Latino inmates fought each other while 600 
took part in a similar brawl in January. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Tuesday's fights, Becerra said jail officials are considering 
filing charges against four inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Two may be charged with assault and a third with interfering with a peace 
officer. A fourth inmate, caught with a broom handle, may be charged with 
possessing a weapon in jail, Becerra said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PROP. 187 HATE FLYERS FOUND IN MAILBOXES; 
SAUGUS: MATERIALS URGING THE KILLING OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE HAND-DELIVERED 
TO RESIDENCES ON THREE STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Flyers advocating the killing of illegal immigrants and the passage of 
Proposition 187 have appeared in local mailboxes, apparently left by a militant 
white supremacist, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers were hand-delivered, not mailed, to residences on at least three 
streets in Saugus this week, said Sgt. Howard Fairchild of the Santa Clarita 
Valley sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 About six people have reported finding the flyers, but Fairchild said he 
suspects many more received them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we just got the tip of the iceberg," he said. "Most people probably 
just threw them in the trash." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one other flyer was found last week in Glendale, said Tzivia 
Schwartz, an attorney for the Anti-Defamation League. Schwartz said she 
believes a man who has placed similar literature in stores and school lockers 
throughout Southern California the past couple years is responsible, though no 
one has been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 One Saugus recipient said her husband found the flyer when he went out for the 
mail Monday morning. Sarah Hicks, 52, said if the person who put it there is 
trying to collect support for Proposition 187, which would deny state-funded 
medical care and education to illegal immigrants, then he or she is not 
succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to vote 'yes' for it, but I don't know now," Hicks said. "I don't 
like that kind of stuff. I don't like hate against other nationalities. It just 
upsets the both of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Saugus resident told sheriff's deputies he was smoking a cigarette in 
his garage about 4 a.m. Tuesday when he heard a car pull up to his mailbox, put 
something in it, and possibly stop at other houses along the street. When the 
car left, the man found one of the flyers in his mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyer proclaims: "If it ain't white . . . waste it!" and shows a drawing 
of a dark-haired, mustachioed man being shot repeatedly by a shotgun. It urges 
readers to vote "yes" on Proposition 187 and supports the deportation of 
African Americans, Latinos and Southeast Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 A Glendale phone number listed on all the flyers was answered by a recording 
of a man promoting himself as "the voice of reason." Schwartz of the ADL said 
the man she believes is responsible for the flyers works in cooperation with 
but is not a part of the militant White Aryan Resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I can tell, this is one guy doing this, and this is all he does," 
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairchild said sheriff's officials are investigating the matter as a possible 
civil rights violation. He said they have a suspect, but not enough evidence to 
arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we'd like to do is know how many more people got affected by this," he 
said.

EVEN MORE BAD NEWS FOR MCNALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Despite continuing protestations that the Kings were sheltered from Bruce 
McNall's deteriorating financial condition, federal prosecutors charged 
Wednesday that as much as $7 million was diverted from the elite Senate Seat 
program at the Forum in 1993 to support McNall's collapsing business empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation marks the first time the government has detailed an incident in 
which money from the team was improperly used to ease McNall's severe cash-flow 
problems. It was made in court papers filed in U.S. District Court by 
prosecutors, who charged two more former business associates of the King 
president as part of an investigation into McNall's banking practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged were Bruce Bargmann and Patricia Linden, whose lawyers said their 
clients plan to plead guilty and are cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation about the Senate Seat funds contradicts previous assertions by 
McNall officials that the Kings were shielded from McNall's financial problems 
and that the business of hockey continued as usual. In the Senate program, fans 
pay thousands of dollars for season tickets to King and Laker games, other 
Forum events and such perks as preferred parking and waitress service. 
</P>
<P>
 Bargmann, 37, executive vice president of McNall Sports & Entertainment, Inc., 
and a former King executive, was charged with two criminal counts in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bargmann specifically is charged with defrauding two financial institutions -- 
Bank of America and First Los Angeles Bank -- regarding $39 million worth of 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bargmann's lawyer, Mark E. Beck: "When the entire story is told, he will 
be found to be a less significant player than many of the others." 
</P>
<P>
 Linden, 39, former vice president and controller of McNall's World Numismatics 
coin business, was charged with one count of conspiracy for helping divert 
about $13 million from a coin fund McNall had organized with securities giant 
Merrill Lynch to a shell company to help ease McNall's ongoing cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "She made errors of judgment," said Linden's lawyer, Harriet Beegun Leva, 
adding that Linden had not benefited personally from the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges bring to five the number of former McNall officials who have been 
formally charged -- all have pleaded guilty or plan to -- stemming from the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation has uncovered a systematic practice in McNall's operations 
of obtaining loans from banks and thrifts by deliberately overstating McNall's 
personal and business assets while understating or concealing debts. Sources 
have previously confirmed that McNall has agreed to plead guilty to four 
criminal counts, with charges likely to be filed this month. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the court papers, Bargmann and others requested a $20-million 
increase in an $80-million loan from Bank of America, $10 million of which was 
eventually approved. Papers allege that Bargmann helped prepare fraudulent cash 
flow figures to get the loan, hiding the fact that Bank of America loan money 
was used to improperly pay interest on other McNall loans as well as to cover 
McNall's personal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the charges against Bargmann is that he helped divert the Senate Seat 
money on two occasions -- once while the team was advancing for the first time 
to the Stanley Cup finals -- when the money belonged to Bank of America under a 
cash management agreement the bank had with McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the charges, Bargmann and other McNall officials agreed with Bank 
of America to deposit all cash receipts from the Kings in an account at Union 
Bank and to use the money only to service the $90-million loan as well as pay 
the team's expenses and payroll. Instead, Bargmann and others diverted $7 
million to McNall Sports and Entertainment, covering up the transaction with 
phony team cash-flow reports that understated Senate seat revenue by $7 
million.

<P>
 -- He's rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his $1.3-million annual salary, the recent sale of the Warriors 
brought him a huge bonus -- $4 million by the estimate of one source -- for the 
share of the club he held under previous ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has his best team, assuming he can get it on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Hardaway is back. Latrell Sprewell has become a star. Rony Seikaly has 
just come over from Miami. Nelson and Chris Webber have had a season to get 
used to one another, even if there's speculation Webber doesn't dig his coach 
and wants to know how long he'll be there before signing a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Nellie never had a young man who demanded to be spoken to in gentle tones at 
all times, but now he knows how sensitive today's young people can be. If 
there's another generation as distinct coming 
</P>
<P>
 after this one, Nelson isn't sure he is ready for it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nelson is about to become a free agent, himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors have just been purchased by a 44-year-old cable TV magnate named 
Chris Cohan, known in underground circles as Dan Quayle because of his cherubic 
good looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohan just spent $100 million for the remaining 75% of this cash cow -- he was 
previously a 25% owner -- but has a problem: Nelson, who rebuilt the franchise 
from a grease spot on the East Bay, has an out in his contract next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 By next summer several teams with young stars and unproven coaches -- 
Charlotte? Orlando? -- might be looking for someone more proven. The Warriors 
were assembled by Nellie to play his peculiar Nellie Ball and might not be the 
same without him. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudent ownership might take him off the market at whatever price, but Cohan 
may hear other voices who think Nelson is a dinosaur to young players or a 
spendthrift general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 At his introductory news conference, Cohan, asked about securing Nelson, 
shadow boxed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don and I are going to talk about that . . . right, Don?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, interested enough to have left practice in the hands of his 
assistants, was standing in the back of a room loaded with reporters, wearing 
his trademark jeans and T-shirt. Grinning, he turned his palms up and said, 
"All right with me." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the last anyone heard of a new contract for what might have been 
Nelson's last exhibition season in California. MACHIA-NELLIE AND OTHER 
INCARNATIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Who is like unto thee, oh Nellie? 
</P>
<P>
 Next to him, 90% in the profession are hacks who never had an idea of their 
own. Nelson is all originality and vision, unafraid to do it his way, or to 
change the way he does it, or to ask someone for help, or to listen to a 
suggestion whether he asked for it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the NBA's only three-time coach of the year, despite never having been 
to the finals. A veritable cradle of coaches and administrators have come from 
his staff: Laker Coach Del Harris, Milwaukee Buck Coach Mike Dunleavy, Seattle 
SuperSonic Coach George Karl, University of Utah Coach Rick Majerus, Sacramento 
King Coach Garry St. Jean, former Portland and Clipper coach Mike Shuler, San 
Antonio Spur General Manager Gregg Popovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretive as his mentor, Red Auerbach, Nelson is similarly suspected of being 
up to something all the time -- and generally is. Ideas seemingly too numerous 
to count spin in the Nelson noodle. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the great safari to Africa a few summers ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon was from Africa, wasn't he? And Dikembe Mutombo and Manute Bol 
and Yinka Dare, none of them recruited, all of them just showing up on some 
college's doorstep? Anyone who took the time to think about it might sense an 
entire continent of NBA centers waiting for a coach to steam up the river. 
</P>
<P>
 So Nelson enlisted Majerus, an old Bucks' assistant, and off they went. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know anything about African basketball?" Majerus says. "We didn't 
either. So we went over there to look. And we also each thought if there was 
another Olajuwon, if he was too old, he could go with Nellie. If he was young, 
I could get him." 
</P>
<P>
 The most important thing they learned about African basketball was that there 
wasn't much of it. Nelson and Majerus came home without an Olajuwon of any age. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an age-old problem for creative thinkers: A lot of your best ideas 
somehow just don't turn out. Nelson is still trying to prove the one about 
winning an NBA title with small players. He has fielded some wonderfully 
exciting teams, but has yet to take one into June. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson once had the entire state of Wisconsin eating out of his hand. That was 
in the '80s, when his Bucks ran with the elite teams and he drove a tractor 
around the state, raising money for Nellie's Farm Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is another place and another time. When he joined the Warriors, they 
had had two winning seasons -- 42-40 and 45-37 -- in nine years and were 
playing to an average of 10,584. He built them into a budding power that hasn't 
played to an empty seat in the Oakland Coliseum in five seasons but raised 
expectations that he has yet to deliver upon. The last two seasons were 
sabotaged by injury and became struggles for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's sponsor with the Bucks and Warriors, Jim Fitzgerald, brought Nelson 
out West and gave him powers unknown for a coach since the days of Auerbach. 
But when Nelson, who needed some kind of big men, went down the drain with 
Ralph Sampson, Jim Petersen and Alton Lister, even the fatherly Fitzgerald let 
a previously silent partner named Dan Finnane take control of the finances. 
</P>
<P>
 A backstage Nelson-Finnane battle of wills resulted while people wondered why 
Fitzgerald would sit still for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the question was answered, Fitzgerald, who had bought the team for $18 
million in 1986, sold it for $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In 17 years as a coach, Nelson has worked only one season that wasn't for 
Fitzgerald, whom he calls "my very best friend." That was the year after 
Fitzgerald sold the Bucks to Sen. Herb Kohl. Nelson bristled at Kohl's input 
and resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson appeared to struggle last season as Finnane jerked the reins. Nelson 
even began mentioning how apt some of his game plans had been -- a marked 
change by a man who often refused to do interviews for features because he 
didn't want personal publicity. Nelson claims he knows his own worth and can 
handle any situation, but the record suggests he works best when he feels 
safest. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a challenge for Chris Cohan. SON OF RED MEETS THE '90S 
</P>
<P>
 When Nelson began coaching, he patterned himself after Auerbach, who had seen 
something in Nelson when he was languishing on the bench with the Lakers, 
averaging 1.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Auerbach was a churl to outsiders and no day at the beach to insiders, but he 
cared about his people. That was the kind of program Nelson wanted and had, 
even if it has become harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder to have a family atmosphere in today's game than ever before, but 
it's not impossible," Nelson says. "And I think if you continually try to do 
that, players appreciate it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's impossible in some situations, but it's not impossible here. It's 
harder and we can't do as good a job maybe as we did when I was in Milwaukee 
because of money and agents and free agency and everything else. It's harder to 
do it, but it's not impossible and we try to do it and probably do as good a 
job as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 They did a great job of it until the old Hardaway-Chris Mullin-Mitch Richmond 
nucleus turned over. 
</P>
<P>
 By last season, it had become Sprewell-Webber-Mullin, with Mullin, the 
arch-Nellie favorite, tiptoeing around to keep from disturbing the new order. 
</P>
<P>
 It was said it wasn't a Nellie-type team. He had always picked his players for 
coachability and if he screamed at them, they understood. Now there were 
ruffled feelings, especially on the part of Webber. The Warriors won 50 games, 
but there was so much grumbling, a player -- Billy Owens, the spokesman for the 
new breed -- said that the previous season, when they went 34-48, had been 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of injuries that really caused a lot of conflicts last year but 
that's basketball," said Owens, who was traded to Miami on Wednesday for 
Seikaly. "You're going to have conflicts. You've got to get to know each other 
before things can smooth out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year things were all bottled up. Everybody wanted to play here and play 
there and a lot of things were said, but that's how a team is. I'm sure the 
Lakers had to get to know each other before they started to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Discontent bred speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports that Nelson was headed to San Antonio, where his old 
assistant, Popovich, had become general manager; to the Lakers, where Jerry 
West is a longtime admirer. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be more reports until Nelson's situation is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if his players start wondering about them? 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if a young team with so many pieces that have to be reintegrated, 
that will be without Mullin for six weeks and never had Webber in the 
exhibition season, gets off to a slow start? 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, now 54, says he wants to stay, vows he will always call the Bay Area 
home but looks like a man trying to figure out how best to tie a ribbon to his 
career, here, there, wherever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not difficult at all," Nelson says. "Whatever happens, happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm to the point now I can do three different things in my life. I can 
retire, I can stay here and coach on, or if they want to make a change here, I 
can move on and coach somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter that much to me anymore. I want to be in a good situation. 
That's the first thing that's important to me, or I won't coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is, then I love coaching and I want to continue to coach, to be part of 
the excitement. I think it's the most exciting business in the whole world, 
professional sports. I like to be part of that."  
</P>
<P>
 Laughing, he said, "Am I going to die early? Probably. But I tell you, there's 
nothing like it. When you go through it -- the highs and lows, the ups and 
downs of it and all the rest of it . . . But one thing it is, it is exciting. 
And rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
 Get set for the most exciting, rewarding season of all. Nellie is spinning, 
and where he stops, nobody knows. 
</P>

JIM MURRAY: HE FACES TOUGH FOE -- OLD AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Old age is a state of mind, not body. You're only as old as you feel. Age is 
only a number. If you didn't know how old you were, how old would you be? Age 
cannot wither nor custom stale. Age, thou art shamed! 
</P>
<P>
 And so on. Take every cliche about aging and George Foreman has the answer.  
</P>
<P>
 George is a surrogate for every guy whose wife ever said, "Don't lift that! 
You'll hurt yourself!" For every guy to whom a young kid ever said, "Hey, Pops, 
got a light?" Every guy who forgot where he put the keys, paid senior rates at 
the movies, noticed that his knees hurt when it was going to rain and wonders 
why all that hair is coming out in his comb and it's gray. Every guy who looks 
in the mirror and an old stranger stares back at him. Every man who looks at 
the calendar and wonders how it got to be 1994. I mean, what happened to the 
'80s? 
</P>
<P>
 George is going to climb into the ring in Las Vegas and fight for the 
heavyweight championship of the world for all of us Saturday and we're all 25 
years younger for a day.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know about you, but if he wins I may get a gold necklace, grow a 
ponytail and go without stockings. Maybe even get an earring.  
</P>
<P>
 I remember the first time I ever saw George Foreman. It was in 1968 in Mexico 
City. The Olympic boxing finals. George had just manhandled some poor clumsy 
Russian with a pole-ax left and a paving-block right so badly the ref knew he 
had to call the fight or call the morgue.  
</P>
<P>
 I remember seeing the fight through a chicken-wire fence, erected because the 
local crowd might be tempted to pelt the ring with live chickens or live snakes 
or heavy coins when a local favorite lost.  
</P>
<P>
 It had been a troubled Olympics. First of all, in the weeks before it took 
place, the International Olympic Committee, disturbed by student unrest and 
opposition to the Games, had weighed transferring them out of Mexico. This was 
obviated when the government militia opened fire on a student demonstration in 
the Plaza of the Three Cultures, leaving dozens of the dissidents slain.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, the American 200-meter medalists, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, had used 
the platform of the award ceremony to raise gloved black fists to protest 
racism in America, signaling to the world what a great place the Olympics were 
to get a political message across.  
</P>
<P>
 So, the IOC was jittery, reeling, that night when George Foreman reached down 
behind him after the fight to pick up a miniature American flag. They feared 
the worst. I remember someone gasping, "My God, he's going to burn it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Not George. He was going to kiss it. And wave it. Then, he gave a dozen roses 
to his fallen opponent.  
</P>
<P>
 George became everybody's hero. He came home America's champion. He launched 
his pro career to ringing cheers and well-wishes.  
</P>
<P>
 But that was 26 years ago. Nixon was still to be elected President. Coffee was 
a quarter, gas 40 cents. You could get a Cadillac for seven grand. Russia was 
an "evil empire" and we hadn't even been to the moon yet. Jimmy Ellis was 
heavyweight champion of the world. "Oliver!" won the Academy Award. Cliff 
Robertson was best actor.  
</P>
<P>
 And if anyone had suggested that George Foreman would be climbing into the 
ring 26 years later to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world, in 
November of 1994, people would have begun edging away from him. It was about as 
likely as Russia turning capitalist.  
</P>
<P>
 To everyone but George.  
</P>
<P>
 You can play golf as long as you can stand up. You can play tennis with 
bifocals. You can play baseball till you're 40-something. Football and 
basketball come to a stop in the mid-30s. But bleeding for a living, getting 
hit in a helmetless head, is something few people can do into their dotage. 
Dempsey fought for 14 years, Joe Louis for 17. Archie Moore fought for 27 years 
and was 43 when he stepped into the ring to fight for the heavyweight 
championship against Floyd Patterson in 1956.  
</P>
<P>
 If you can believe the old record books, Jack Johnson fought for 31 years and 
was 50 when he had his last fight. But he was a mere 37 when he got his last 
title fight.  
</P>
<P>
 George ignores the actuarial tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "Numbers," George says reproachfully. "People live their lives by numbers. 
They say, 'Oh, I'm 80! I better go off somewhere and die.' Numbers are for 
accountants." 
</P>
<P>
 George once lived by the numbers. Embittered and disillusioned by his knockout 
by Muhammad Ali in Africa in 1974, he retired for almost 10 years and turned to 
preaching the word of God. But ministry is expensive. One day, George happened 
to catch some fights on TV. He was surprised to find how unskilled the game had 
become, how carelessly the modern fighters were exposed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then, I thought, 'Hey, you're old! You can't be doing that!' " George 
recalls. "Then, I thought, 'Wait a minute! Who says so? Just a number.' We say, 
'Well, I can't do that. I'm 50!' Or, 'I better not try that, I'm 60!' We're 
slaves to numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 George looked at the numbers and divided by two. George had reason to feel 
young. George had never abused his body -- with anything except double 
cheeseburgers with fries, pizza with everything, sno cones and banana splits. 
George didn't drink, smoke, chew or swear and he mostly heeded the advice of 
that other noted senior, Satchel Paige, who had once observed, "The social 
ramble ain't restful." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, George had some difficulty convincing the world that he was ready to 
leave the rocking chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed a sponsor," he says. "So I called up about 10 of them and I said, 'I 
want to make a comeback but I need $700,000. For that, I will give you 40% of 
the purses.' They all hung up on me. They thought it was a con. But George 
Foreman don't con. Now, if they stayed on the line and took that option, they 
would have gotten 40% of $60 million today." 
</P>
<P>
 George, unlike the venerable Paige, knew how old he was. Satch, when asked how 
old he was, used to stall. "People says different things," he would answer, 
"but I would judge between 30 and 70." 
</P>
<P>
 George could give them an honest count -- 40. Unsponsored, he fought his way 
back to the top. When he got his title shot against Evander Holyfield, he was a 
boyish 43. Holyfield thought it would be a walk in the park. It was. Central 
Park. At 2 a.m. Wearing a Rolex. When the fight ended, Holyfield was looking 
frantically up at the clock and wondering, "Where's that damn bell?" 
</P>
<P>
 George had to go to court to get his title shot Saturday at Michael Moorer. 
Some say it should have been the other way round.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's a nice fight for Moorer. He's getting to fight a man old enough to 
be his father. And if he fought the other heavyweight champ, Oliver McCall, the 
public wouldn't know one from the other.  
</P>
<P>
 The public will know George in the fight at the MGM Grand. Every guy in the 
country with a hearing aid, bifocals, a cane or a walker, stomach gas or store 
teeth will be in his corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fighting for every guy who ever got told to 'act your age,' " George 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 Every guy who got a gold watch, a set of luggage. Every guy who wonders why 
people don't speak up anymore or why print is smaller these days. Every guy who 
wonders if it was always this chilly in the mornings and what he did with his 
keys.  
</P>
<P>
 George is our champion. If George wins, his victory will not be over Michael 
Moorer. It'll be over that ancient foe of mankind -- old age. Who is 
undefeated.

NO APOLOGIES; MICHAEL MOORER REALIZES HE'S NOT THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE AGAINST 
FOREMAN, BUT IT SEEMS TO MATTER LITTLE TO CHAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Moorer, the cautious champion, blends into crowds, keeps his smiles 
private and stares at the world with suspicious eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Call him the heavyweight champion of the Slacker Generation: cynical, world 
weary beyond his 27 years, winning despite his own unspoken doubts, and 
determined to answer only to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 If that means that he is not embraced by the public at large, Moorer says, if 
that means that even those in his sport view him with at best tepid respect, 
despite his International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Assn. titles, then 
that is the way life goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating Evander Holyfield for the heavyweight title hasn't changed Moorer. In 
fact, it probably has made him seek to dive deeper into the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think I'm such a bad person," Moorer said this week during 
final preparations for his title defense Saturday against 45-year-old George 
Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relaxed and quiet, so they think that. I'll say what I want. I wouldn't 
bite my tongue. But because I don't rant and rave and call people names, they 
think I'm not the heavyweight champion." 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, Moorer, the first left-handed champion in the heavyweight division, 
is passionate about his 2-year-old son, Michael, and about his desire, once he 
sheds his boxing career, to work in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 And he obviously has flourished under the tutelage of trainer Teddy Atlas, who 
acts as drill sergeant, confessor and emotional harbor for the moody champion. 
</P>
<P>
 But on other issues more closely related to the sport that is making him 
millions -- $7 million, to be precise, for this fight -- Moorer is distant, 
often diffident. Boxing, even the heavyweight title, he says, is a means to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if his son understands how important his father is, Moorer shakes his 
head and laughs softly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a friend taking a lot of pictures," Moorer said. "I'm going to keep 
everything together so he can see, once he gets older, and understand the 
pictures of him and I, the things I was going through and the videotapes and 
all that. I'm looking forward to it, actually. I want him to see what I went 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 And what will Moorer tell his son about this time in his life? 
</P>
<P>
 "That it was a good feeling," Moorer said. "It was something I worked so hard 
for and continued to work hard after I won it. I would probably tell him that 
everything was behind him. I want him to see what Dad did and try to make a 
better life for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The current hurdle is Foreman, a much older, much larger and much more popular 
man. Moorer's camp acknowledges that Moorer probably won't win any more respect 
unless he demolishes Foreman, and recognizes that losing the fight would be a 
mortal blow to his career. 
</P>
<P>
 That Moorer is only a 3-1 betting favorite is testament to his cautious 
fighting style and Foreman's standing with the mass audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer was inactive for much of the summer after undergoing surgery on his 
right hand last summer and gained about 20 extra pounds. So when he steps on 
the scale today and weighs about 10 pounds more than the 214 he weighed against 
Holyfield, the odds might go lower, although Atlas is unconcerned about the 
extra pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer was irritated by some of the stunts Foreman pulled during a press tour, 
and clearly views Foreman as all show-biz hype.  
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Foreman charged that Moorer was taking this fight only for the money, 
and chortled that he would be glad to rid Moorer of the "burden" of being 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He psychs other people out," Moorer said of Foreman. "All the games that he's 
going to try to play, all the tactics and everything like that, he's going to 
say what he wants to say to try to lure people into believing in him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to try to intimidate. I'm the wrong person to intimidate. I'm not 
going to lose my mental thought and my ability to go out there and do what I 
have to do by listening to his nonsense. I know what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably going to be the sentimental favorite in this fight because of 
the way he is and the following that he has, the older generation. That's all 
well and good. I'm not worried about what he has to say. That doesn't win the 
fight. What happens in the ring does." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer's manager, John Davimos, who has traveled with Moorer through all the 
bumps and crises of his early and recent career, argues that it is precisely 
Moorer's less-than-flamboyant ways that probably will keep him on top as long 
as he cares to be champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, 35-0 with 30 knockouts, may fight Riddick Bowe in February, assuming 
he defeats Foreman. Mike Tyson will be out of jail soon. And both fighters are 
far more appreciated by the boxing community than the title-holder. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the first guy in the world to tell you he's a beatable champion, and 
that anybody's beatable and that anybody can lose," Davimos said. "When you're 
aware of that, you do everything you can to prevent that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Bowe got the feeling that he was an unbeatable champion, that if he 
just did the minimum he'd be just fine. I think Tyson with (Buster) Douglas, 
the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the public perception of him? I don't think he cares. If he does, 
he shouldn't. The fact is, Evander didn't get any respect until he lost to 
Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later something happens in your career that defines it. And it's 
not going to be this fight and it's probably not going to be the next fight and 
it probably won't be until the end of his career, like it is with most guys. 
And then it'll be defined. And I think he has that perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas, for one, is more than willing to take on anybody who wants to proclaim 
Bowe, Tyson or anybody else the real heavyweight champion of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same Bowe who's 300 pounds? The same Bowe who lost to Holyfield, the guy 
that we beat?" Atlas challenged. "The same Tyson who lost to Buster Douglas and 
who really deteriorated before he went into jail? And the same Tyson who now 
after deteriorating before he went into jail is going to be suddenly better 
three years later after sitting idle? 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone John makes the fight with is a fight we're prepared for. Right now, 
Michael has more credibility than ever, especially with (Oliver) McCall having 
won (the World Boxing Council title). Michael's the heavyweight champ of the 
world right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't had the household name of Tyson because he hasn't had that kind of 
exposure, but this fight will broaden Michael's visibility tremendously. And I 
also believe for Michael, possibly, the best is in front of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas, Davimos and Moorer emphasize how much smoother this training camp has 
gone, compared to previous ones, suggesting that his previous quiet worries and 
self-destructive mood swings have gradually dissipated.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's become a stronger person to rely on," Atlas said. "I think last camp he 
submitted to me in the last two weeks before the fight and he kind of trusted . 
. . He believed if he faced everything and did all the things I had told him 
that everything would be OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, we won the fight, and I think we're reaping some of the benefits 
of that happening. Now he has trust in me and there's less need to test. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain bond there. I care about Michael. John cares about him. He 
asked us to be there for something that was important for him, his hometown. We 
were there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael did something special for me. He gave me a heavyweight champion. I'll 
never forget that. Without getting mushy or stupid about it, Michael will 
always have a special place with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about the parade that Moorer's hometown of Monessen, Pa., threw for 
him in the weeks after he beat Holyfield brought out Moorer's warmest words and 
unguarded emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer had previously been involved in a few ugly incidents in the town, 
including an alcohol-induced brawl with several local policemen that resulted 
in the town's suing him for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 If his own hometown didn't love him, who would? 
</P>
<P>
 But, after the parade, Moorer believes that the wounds have been healed. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the bad news is gone," Moorer said. "I came back; they gave me a hell of 
a parade. It was one of the best days of my life. All the bad stuff, that's all 
put behind me. The parade was a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times, (the problems in Monessen) probably got to me, when I was less 
mature than I am now. But I can handle it. I was there. I apologized to the 
people for all the things that happened between them and I and the city. . . . 
I just bought guns for the police department. It's not that I felt I had to do 
it, it's that I want to be in some type of law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he think that the town, also, was apologizing to him? 
</P>
<P>
 "They were happy for me," Moorer said. "So if you want to take it as an 
apology, then that's what we'll do."

 Venus Williams ran out of energy and lost for the first time as a pro 
Wednesday night, dropping the final 11 games in a 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 loss to Arantxa 
Sanchez Vicario, the world's No. 2 player. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 14, who won her pro debut Monday night in the Bank of the West 
Classic at Oakland, overpowered the top-seeded Spaniard in the first set and 
led, 3-1, in the second before faltering. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario, winner of the French and U.S. Open titles this year, began 
cutting down on her errors midway through the second set and took control as 
Williams succumbed to exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 "She picked her game up and I changed my game," Williams said. "I guess she 
knew how to come back and what to do."

 Gerry Sandusky, the weeknight sports anchor at a Baltimore television station, 
is one of 62 Associated Press poll voters, and the only one to have cast a 
first-place vote this week for No. 3 Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandusky assumed that the poll panel was substantially larger, or at least 
large enough to give him a measure of anonymity. No chance. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been fielding phone calls and giving interviews to radio talk shows and 
newspapers all season about his votes.

 Said Sandusky: "When I came across the (acknowledgment) letter and I saw the 
number of voters, I said, 'Gulp.' Then I came across the next big lie, namely 
that they won't release your name. Yeah, right. I should have a bumper sticker

RAIDER RESERVE WILLIAMS HAS MORE THAN FOOTBALL ON MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jamie Williams' name does not show up often in the Raiders' offensive 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight games, he is not listed under scoring because he has not scored a 
touchdown. He is not listed under receiving because he has not caught a pass. 
The only category the reserve tight end can be found under is kickoff returns. 
He has one, for no yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 So after catching 178 passes for nearly 2,000 yards in 12 seasons in the NFL, 
Williams finds himself as a seldom-used short-yardage run-blocking specialist 
in the twilight of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this bother Williams? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, because I have so many other interests than football," said Williams, who 
signed with the Raiders before the season as a free agent from the San 
Francisco 49ers. "Football now is a lot easier for me as a whole because there 
are so many other things I am interested in from an academic standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 One area Williams is greatly concerned about is how African American males are 
depicted by the media in society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've realized that there are other things in life a lot more complicated than 
football," he said. "I have a tougher time trying to figure out the cause and 
effect of the black male's position in society. It's of great concern for me to 
find out what can be done to turn the tide." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who began his career with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1983 before 
playing with the Houston Oilers and the 49ers, has paid more than lip service 
to this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1993, he produced a 30-minute film documentary, "The Black 
Quarterback and the Media," as a master's degree project for the School of 
Journalism and Mass Communications at San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary has received rave reviews for its in-depth look at issues 
seldom talked about in football. Williams interviewed current and former 
players, reporters and sociologists about the black quarterback's role in the 
NFL.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was glad to see such pertinent information given through the media," Raider 
quarterback Vince Evans said. "The black quarterback has not been given the 
same opportunity as white quarterbacks. It is a situation that has been 
hush-hush over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams not only traces the history of the black quarterback in the NFL from 
"Jefferson Street" Joe Jefferson to Warren Moon, but also deals with the 
portrayal of such quarterbacks in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (a black) gets in that leadership role, whether as quarterback or coach, 
our society as a whole is not quite comfortable with that," Gene Washington, a 
former college quarterback and NFL wide receiver, says in the film. "That's the 
issue that really needs to be looked at. I think clearly that we've gotten to 
the point that we realize that black athletes and black coaches can do the job 
well. But, there are still some problems and why is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Williams does not provide answers in his film, but he does ask many questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not out to say this group is racist or that group is racist, but I do 
feel that there are too many myths portrayed by the media," said Williams, who 
graduated with a degree in broadcast journalism from Nebraska.  
</P>
<P>
 "For example, it's crazy to say that a white player can be very heady and 
intelligent, but can't be a great athlete. While it's also as crazy to say that 
a black player can be a great athlete but not heady and intelligent at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams followed closely the coverage of the sideline argument between Raider 
Coach Art Shell and quarterback Jeff Hostetler during the Miami game and the 
debate about whether Shell uttered a racist remark. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the perspective of someone on the team, it was a dead issue right after 
it happened," Williams said. "Most guys who've ever played know that stuff like 
that happens and it is all part of the process. You play with people you don't 
really like at times and you have disagreements, but you get over it and no 
one's feelings are hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "But because our society is race sensitive again, when that report (of Shell 
allegedly calling Hostetler "another white quarterback, just like Schroeder") 
came out, it raised a few eyebrows. The thing is that (Shell) is and always 
will be a black man who is in a leadership position. Everything he does is 
under the microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothers me that he has had to go through this when both sides have denied 
the story, while other highly visible coaches like Mike Ditka, Buddy Ryan and 
Bobby Knight -- who have constantly demoralized players -- are treated 
differently. It seems like the media was just looking for something to attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 34, took nearly a year to produce the documentary and hopes to make 
it into a two-hour film. He already has contacted ESPN and Fox television, and 
says they have expressed interest in making it into a larger project. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways, sports are a reflection of society," Williams said. 
"Stereotypes will continue to be in the back of our minds until we are showed 
differently. The media has the opportunity and should have the obligation to 
break down and enlighten the public."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, Angelo Dundee was in the corner opposite George Foreman when 
Foreman lost the heavyweight championship to Muhammad Ali in Zaire. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, Dundee will be Foreman's cut-and-whisper man when he tries 
to win a two-thirds share of the title from Michael Moorer. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's a miracle -- or a reflection of the state of the heavyweight division -- 
that Rev. Foreman, 45, is getting another shot at the championship after a 
10-year retirement and a hiatus the last 17 months . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Does he have a chance?" Dundee said. "Of course. He's going to win the fight 
by knockout. We'll have a new champ in the fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh 
round." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dundee has worked Foreman's corner since his 12-round loss to then-champion 
Evander Holyfield three years ago. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "George is a good listener," Dundee said. "I'll tell him between rounds what I 
think is working well and what he's doing wrong." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dundee, who says he had nothing to do with Ali's rope-a-dope tactics that 
early morning in Zaire, would like to think that Moorer is made to order for 
Foreman. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Moorer's a southpaw, but he's a converted right-hander and pretty orthodox," 
Dundee said. "He's no ballerina. He's there to be hit, and George will nail 
him." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Other, more objective observers believe Moorer will do a job on Foreman with 
his right jab, the weapon that won him the title from Holyfield. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dundee admits, "George has three speeds -- slow, stop, and wait a minute." . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Having trained an assortment of all-time greats, journeymen and prelim kids 
since 1948, Dundee is still active in a gym in Miami and has a stable of 11. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Among them is a 6-foot-4, 240-pound heavyweight from Japan. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Wednesday, Foreman wore a suit and tie, Moorer a sweat 
suit. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Foreman easily outpointed the Moorer camp in insults, then said, "I think 
those extra 4,000 seats will be sold, so now we can be quiet." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Those closest to Foreman say he is edgy for the first time during his 
comeback. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 When Foreman won the title from Joe Frazier in 1973, Moorer was 5. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 During his 35-bout career, the unbeaten champion has been knocked down twice 
by Bert Cooper and once each by Everett (Big Foot) Martin and Holyfield. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Moorer will receive a $5-million check from the Nevada State Athletic 
Commission on Saturday night, and Foreman one for $1.5 million. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But money from the live gate and HBO telecast eventually could increase 
Moorer's purse to $7 million and Foreman's to $4 million. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 All officials will be from Nevada -- referee Joe Cortez and judges Jerry Roth, 
Duane Ford and Chuck Giampa. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bob Arum plans to feature the Ruelas brothers, Rafael and Gabriel, in title 
defenses on a pay-per-view show at the MGM Grand the night before the Super 
Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The brothers from Sylmar were named co-fighters of the year at the World 
Boxing Hall of Fame banquet last week. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the better heavyweight prospects, Jeremy Williams of the Ten Goose 
Stable, returns after suffering a broken hand and will fight journeyman Levi 
Billups on Nov. 16. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It will be one of five fight cards at the MGM Grand in three weeks, the finale 
being the U.S.-Mexico amateur dual meet Nov. 19. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Winner of the James Toney-Roy Jones fight probably will face Chris Eubanks 
next summer outdoors in London. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Eubanks can't fight much, but is a big draw at home. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pernell Whitaker, who would have loved a rematch with Julio Cesar Chavez, most 
likely will settle for the winner of the Jake (The Snake) Rodriguez-Kostya 
Tszyu match. No kidding. . . . Those who have seen British heavyweight Herbie 
Hide, 26-0 with 25 KOs, say he is a powerful puncher, but raw and probably not 
as dangerous as Oliver McCall. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Boxing reporter and "SportsCenter" anchorman Charley Steiner has signed a new 
four-year contract with ESPN. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 At last report, Riddick Bowe-Larry Donald was still on for Dec. 3 at Caesars 
Palace. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll fight Moorer or McCall for nothing, but not Tyson," Bowe said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Dan Duva, who had a tumor removed from his brain last week, is 
recuperating at his home in New Jersey and the prognosis is good. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, the sentimental favorite, is a 3-1 betting underdog. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'll make the safest prediction -- Moorer by decision.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; PENN STATE HYPE? PATERNO ISN'T BUYING 
INTO IT--YET

<P>
 Before anyone starts ordering bronze for the statues, Penn State Coach Joe 
Paterno wants the world to know that the Nittany Lions are good, really good, 
but not invincible. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're unstoppable," he said. "That's kind of a ridiculous 
statement to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Is it? Penn State, ranked No. 1 in the coaches' poll and No. 2 in the 
Associated Press poll, is averaging 50.3 points and 542.7 yards. Its turnover 
ratio is plus-10. The offense is so balanced that the difference in yards 
passing vs. yards rushing is only 4.1--273.4 to 269.3. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yikes, the personnel the Nittany Lions have. Kerry Collins at 
quarterback. Ki-Jana Carter at running back. Bobby Engram and Freddie Scott at 
wide receiver. Kyle Brady, a blocker extraordinaire, at tight end. A solid 
offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, they have a chance to be the best offensive team we've had," said 
Paterno, who has been at Penn State 45 seasons, 29 as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, Paterno is too busy being paranoid to think about his team's 
place in Nittany Lion history. Rather than totally enjoying the moment--as he 
often tells his team to--he frets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not perfect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why Paterno, like Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne, isn't spending much 
time pondering the whims and quirks of poll voters. Then again, it is only Nov. 
3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't even thought about it, really," Paterno said. "As I've said from 
Day 1, when the season's over we'll see what's going on and I'll start to think 
about it. Maybe at that time I'll have some comments. But I don't think there's 
anything to comment on (now)." 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno reserves the right to complain, mostly because of what happened to 
Penn State in 1968, '69 and '73. The Nittany Lions finished 11-0, 11-0 and 
12-0, respectively, and finished no higher than second in the polls. In 1973, 
they were ranked fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the playoff's the only way to do it," Paterno said. "I think it's a 
disgrace to college football that Division I-A football is the only sport that 
not's decided on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may obviously be affected by the fact that there are only, I think, six or 
seven undefeated, untied football teams at the end of the bowl season that have 
not been selected as national champions--and three of those were Penn State 
teams." WISHFUL THINKING 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific 10 Conference Commissioner Tom Hansen is a progressive enough guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen knew all hell would break loose when Notre Dame bolted the College 
Football Assn. to make its own deal with NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen accurately predicted the trickle-down effect of the expanded 
Southeastern, Big Ten, Big East and Big Eight conferences--viz., every league 
for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hansen said the bowl alliance would never last if it didn't make some 
significant changes in its selection process. (It did.) 
</P>
<P>
 So, Tom, do you think the Rose Bowl will join the bowl coalition someday, thus 
guaranteeing America of the true national championship game that Paterno thinks 
it deserves? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the contracts between the Big Ten, the Pac-10 and ABC, which 
televises the game, run through 2001. So even if the Rose Bowl wanted to make a 
change, it couldn't for seven more years. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, nobody wants to make a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's impossible to predict after (2001)," Hansen said. "All the 
parties involved in the agreement today are very pleased with it and the two 
conferences are not interested in a football playoff. Joining the alliance 
might promote that." SEEING RED

<P>
 Several days after Colorado's 24-7 loss to Nebraska, Buffalo Coach Bill 
McCartney knows exactly why his team got beat. 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney gave boffo marks to Nebraska's athleticism on defense, its superior 
kicking game and also praised the Cornhusker coaches for running a conservative 
offensive game plan to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 But . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If Nebraska wants to win a national championship, suggested McCartney, 
quarterback Brook Berringer will have to do more than throw safe passes to his 
tight ends and running backs. Until then, there will be questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I believe he has to keep answering (those questions)," McCartney said. 
"Against us, he didn't throw to his wide receivers hardly at all and he's 
certainly going to have to do that. I'm not questioning his ability to do that, 
I'm just saying that he's got to do that over a period of time. In our game 
they didn't ask him to do that." UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE COTTON 
</P>
<P>
 It now appears that if Notre Dame doesn't completely gag and lose its 
remaining games against Florida State, Air Force and USC, the Irish are Cotton 
Bowl-bound . . . again. 
</P>
<P>
 Under coalition rules, Notre Dame, which has been to Dallas the last two 
years, could decline the invitation and play elsewhere, presumably the Fiesta 
Bowl or maybe the Sugar. But that would be bad manners and anyway, the Irish 
are this close to qualifying for Texas residency. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous seasons, Notre Dame was too proud to go anywhere with six or seven 
victories. They passed on postseason play in 1982 with a 6-4-1 mark, as well as 
1979 with a 7-4 record and 1975 with an 8-3 record.  
</P>
<P>
 This time the Irish are 5-3 and have to travel to Orlando for the game Nov. 12 
against Florida State and to Los Angeles for the game Nov. 26 against the 
Trojans. Air Force plays at South Bend on Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame needs one more victory to qualify for a bowl. Now then, will the 
Irish vote to stay home if they somehow finish with a 6-5 record? Put it this 
way: Would you turn down a minimum $3-million payday in the name of pride? 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish could eventually face Baylor in the Cotton Bowl, which means Notre 
Dame might hit the religious denomination trifecta: losses to the Mormons 
(Brigham Young), other Catholics (Boston College) and Baptists (Baylor). THE 
REST 
</P>
<P>
 The Pac-10 still is trying to find a place for its No. 4 team in next season's 
bowl lineup. So far, the second-place finisher is guaranteed a place in the 
Cotton or Holiday. The third-place team will play in the Sun Bowl. The 
fourth-place team will likely play in the Copper--at least, that's what the 
Pac-10 prefers. Expect an announcement soon. . . . If Notre Dame is invited to 
the Cotton Bowl this season, the Fiesta is expected to choose Colorado to play 
the second-place team from the Pac-10, the Atlantic Coast Conference or the Big 
East. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Nevada Las Vegas Athletic Director Jim Weaver shouldn't have hired 
Rollie Massimino and then helped arrange the secret supplemental contract that 
eventually blew up in his face. But if nothing else, Weaver, who has since 
announced his resignation, can be proud of his other hire, Jeff Horton. Horton, 
who ditched Nevada and took six assistants with him to UNLV this season, is 5-3 
overall and 4-0 in the Big West Conference. Meanwhile, his mentor at Nevada, 
Chris Ault, is 7-1 and also unbeaten in the Big West. The teams will meet at 
UNLV Nov. 19. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to touch a nerve with Missouri Coach Larry Smith, simply ask him 
about the heat Gary Gibbs is taking at Oklahoma. Smith was forced out at USC 
and the same thing might be happening to Gibbs. "You pick up that (Oklahoma 
game) program . . . and they have a picture of the national championship ring 
on there," Smith said. "I mean, people live in the past, particularly when it's 
glory days. Everybody thinks just because your name is OU, or SC or Notre Dame 
or whatever, you're supposed to be undefeated all the time. And if you're not, 
it's the coach's fault. But what people don't give credit to is that there are 
other programs in the country, and there are other coaches working hard, 
there's other people who recruit well, and there's other people who get good 
recruiting classes and have good talent. The thing that people fail to 
understand or accept, I think, in every respect--that's the media and 
everybody--is the fact that with only 85 scholarships it has really evened the 
field out." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska has submitted its application to the NCAA, requesting an additional 
year of eligibility for quarterback Tommie Frazier, who developed a 
season-ending blood clot after a game Sept. 24 against Pacific. Under the 
NCAA's injury hardship rule, Frazier is eligible for an extra season if he 
participated in fewer than 20% of the Cornhusker plays. And there's the rub. If 
the NCAA includes the Kickoff Classic, an extra game added to Nebraska's 
schedule this year, Frazier exceeded the play limit by 10 or 12 snaps, said 
Cornhusker Coach Osborne. If the NCAA exempts the game in its calculations, 
then Frazier is OK. The irony: Frazier was one of the few Nebraska players who 
voted against accepting a bid to the Kickoff Classic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Coaching rumors are like cotton candy. They look impressive, but usually are 
mostly air. Anyway, some of the latest hot-stove league stuff: North Carolina's 
Mack Brown, Mississippi State's Jackie Sherrill or--and this can't be true, can 
it?--Miami's Dennis Erickson to Oklahoma if Gibbs gets fired; Auburn defensive 
coordinator Wayne Hall to Georgia if Ray Goff gets the pink slip. Iowa State, 
which is breaking ground on an $8-million athletic facility, is interested in 
Minnesota Viking defensive coordinator Tony Dungy. Another possibility: If John 
Cooper gets forced out at Ohio State--and it might happen if the 6-3 Buckeyes 
lose two of their last three (Wisconsin, at Indiana, Michigan)--Iowa State 
might look at the Cyclone alum, class of '62; Ohio State alum Glen Mason (class 
of '72) to Columbus if Cooper leaves. Other jobs expected to be available: 
Louisiana State's and possibly, if Hayden Fry decides to call it quits after a 
third consecutive so-so season (5-7, 6-6, 3-5-1 this year) Iowa's. Also, expect 
East Carolina's Steve Logan and Bowling Green's Gary Blackney to be in demand 
during the off-season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Is Penn State's Carter, who still has a year of eligibility left, coming out 
early? ABC's Dick Vermeil seems to think so and apparently made it clear on a 
recent telecast. Vermeil's source: Paterno. Or was it? Said Paterno: "I don't 
know whether I said that. I may have said that. Dick may have asked me. I don't 
think I said that. If Dick said it, he should not have told you--if I indeed 
said that. I have not talked to Ki-Jana about it." . . . 
</P>

 Kansas' Mason, fresh from a Nebraska film session, on the Cornhuskers' main 
strength: "Whatever area I'm looking at." . . . Suddenly USC's 38-14 loss to 
Penn State isn't looking so bad, after all. Except for the Trojans and 
Michigan, no other Nittany Lion opponent has come within 27 points. . . . And 
to all those Nebraska yahoos we have mercilessly mocked in seasons past--and 
this hurts--we now officially apologize for picking Colorado over the 
Cornhuskers. The Top 10

<P>
 Good news for Nebraska I-back Lawrence Phillips. His 100-yard rushing streak 
is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 After a review of game films and a check of NCAA rules, a change has been made 
in the official statistics from the Cornhuskers' 24-7 victory over Colorado on 
Saturday, Nebraska officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska's sports information office conferred with NCAA statistics 
coordinator Jim Wright, who said the 17 yards lost in the second half on an 
errant pitch from quarterback Brook Berringer to Phillips should be credited to 
Berringer. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially the loss went to Phillips, whose string of eight consecutive games 
of 100 yards or more rushing would have ended with his 86-yard total. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the film and review of Article 8 of the NCAA Football Statisticians' 
Manual indicated Berringer has to be charged with the loss because Phillips had 
no "opportunity to advance" the pitch that bounced off his shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
 The change means Phillips finished with 103 yards rushing in 24 carries. That 
gave him nine consecutive games of 100 yards or more rushing.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; REPORT: PLAYERS TOOK TEST AGAIN

 USC tailback Delon Washington, who hasn't played since the season's second 
game while his ACT score was challenged, has taken the test again, the Los 
Angeles Daily News reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper, citing an unnamed USC official, reported Washington took the test 
again Tuesday. Another player, redshirt tight end Ken Cooper, whose score was 
also challenged, reportedly took the test again Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 USC won't comment on the cases, citing privacy laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Oct. 1 that the two freshmen were under investigation for 
academic fraud, that ACT officials were trying to determine if someone took 
their tests for them. 
</P>

 USC's Rob Johnson is among six players selected as finalists for the Johnny 
Unitas Golden Arm Award, which is presented annually to the nation's top senior 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 The other finalists are Jay Barker of Alabama, Chad May of Kansas State, Steve 
McNair of Alcorn State, Kordell Stewart of Colorado and Eric Zeier of Georgia. 
</P>

 USC Coach John Robinson said that offensive tackle Tony Boselli is having a 
monster season. "He's the best offensive lineman in the country," Robinson said 
of the 6-foot-8, 320-pound senior.  
</P>
<P>
 "He sustains his block longer than anyone I ever coached. He's definitely 
risen his game. He spent a lot of time in the off-season thinking about how 
good he wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 USC tailback Shawn Walters, with 788 yards, is on his way to becoming USC's 
20th 1,000-yard rusher. 
</P>
<P>
 His total projects to 1,351 yards, which would be the most by a Trojan since 
1989, when Ricky Ervins ran for 1,395. And Walters would become the first to 
top 1,000 since Mazio Royster had 1,168 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters had a career-best 234 yards against Stanford on Oct. 15, then had 76 
in two quarters in a 61-0 rout of California on Oct. 22 before reserves began 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely because of Walters, USC's run offense is significantly improved over 
recent seasons. The Trojans averaged 115 yards per game in 1992 and 109 last 
season, but are at 157 this season. 
</P>
<P>

 Former Washington State quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who now plays for the New 
England Patriots, returned to his alma mater last spring and wrote a $150,000 
check to the WSU athletic department.  
</P>
<P>
 The money will endow a football scholarship and it matches a 1993 contribution 
made by another former Cougar, Mark Rypien. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Washington State Coach Mike Price, whose team will play USC on Saturday at 
Pullman, was asked how he let Trojan sophomore quarterback Brad Otton slip away 
last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 After Otton decided to leave Weber State, he first committed to enroll at 
Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd previously told my other four quarterbacks I wouldn't recruit any more 
quarterbacks," Price said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I could have gotten out of it on a technicality because we didn't recruit 
Brad, he just walked in the door. He was going to be a transfer. The day that 
got out, my office was full of quarterbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't do it. A man is only as good as his word. I called Brad and told 
him it just wouldn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tempted, though." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 From 1927 to 1978, Washington State had a live mascot, a cougar. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition began in 1927, when a Washington governor presented a cougar cub 
to the university. Students named him Butch, in honor of a WSU football star of 
the day, Butch Meeker. 
</P>
<P>
 In later years, there was a succession of mascots. 
</P>
<P>
 Butch VI died in the summer of 1978. The university tried to find a Butch VII, 
but animal rights activists intervened, ending the tradition.

 Teams are listed in projected order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
 ATLANTIC DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 NEW YORK KNICKS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 57-25. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 98.5 (21st). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 91.5 (first). 
</P>
<P>
 Having failed to climb through their window of opportunity last season when it 
was wide open, the Knicks are back, not as young, not as strong and no longer 
allowed to be as rough. 
</P>
<P>
 Never fear, Riley is on the case. Having popularized both "Showtime" and "Ugly 
Ball," he went back to the drawing board and will finally introduce the running 
game to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Having Derek Harper all season will help but the invaluable Charles Oakley has 
a troublesome toe injury and Patrick Ewing, who sagged last season, had his 
arthroscopic surgery on his problem knee and missed the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, everyone wants to know why Riley won't sign that $3-million-a-year 
extension he has been offered. Maybe it isn't an accident that he never changed 
his watch from West Coast time. 
</P>
<P>
 ORLANDO MAGIC 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 50-32. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 105.7 (sixth). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 101.8 (13th). 
</P>
<P>
 The question isn't so much if as when? Horace Grant, 29, comes from Chicago to 
fill the power forward hole. He and Shaquille O'Neal, 22, are the scariest 
tandem since the Philadelphia 76ers' Wilt Chamberlain and Luke Jackson in the 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Anfernee Hardaway, 22, is a comer. Nick Anderson, 26, averaged 20 
points before the new arrivals reduced him to a role player. They have only to 
accumulate some experience and keep their heads on straight to be the next 
dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's sweep by the Indiana Pacers hangs from their necks like an 
albatross, especially that of second-year Coach Brian Hill. Nobody cares about 
potential anymore, they want to see it happen on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 MIAMI HEAT 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 42-40. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 103.4 (seventh). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 100.7 (11th). 
</P>
<P>
 A pall is all there is over Miami now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat tried to land Danny Manning, tried to trade for Scottie Pippen, tried 
to sign Manning as a free agent and went 0 for 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Cunningham, who built the franchise from expansion weakling, is selling 
out but it won't be final until January. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Kevin Loughery was put on hold for weeks before being re-signed last 
spring. Players are lamenting the inability to acquire a star and wondering 
who's running this team. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham replies they should grow up and become a team at long last but it 
hasn't happened yet. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW JERSEY NETS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 45-37. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 103.2 (eighth). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 101 (12th). 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Daly, patron saint of survivors, bailed out, which is all you need to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years of Derrick Coleman, the prototype law-unto-himself rock head, plus 
Benoit (Huh?) Benjamin and high-strung, low-producing Chris Morris was enough 
for Daly. Snits R Us now turns to -- or upon -- young Butch Beard, who is 
personable, intelligent and overmatched. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Willis Reed, who already has the Benjamin trade on his 
conscience, compounded the felony by wasting a No. 1 pick on a 
Benoit-in-training, Yinka Dare, already nicknamed "Stinka" by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 BOSTON CELTICS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 32-50. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 100.8 (16th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 105.1 (21st). 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Red Auerbach blowing clouds of cigar smoke on the bench? What went 
around is coming around. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics lost 50 games last season, their second-worst finish since 
Auerbach joined the franchise in 1950. Red is only a consultant these days and 
even he can't figure a way out of this hole in the age of the salary cap. His 
designated successor, Dave Gavitt, arrived at the wrong time, never adjusted to 
the league and was forced out. 
</P>
<P>
 M.L. Carr became general manager after Larry Bird turned it down, in the hope 
M.L.'s popularity could get the press off ownership's back. M.L. got headlines, 
signing Dominique Wilkins and offering a No. 1 pick just for the right to talk 
to Michael Jordan. But the latter was meaningless and the former will help the 
Celtics win 35 games -- and miss the premium lottery slots. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a great life or what? 
</P>
<P>
 WASHINGTON BULLETS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 24-58. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 100.4 (17th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 107.7 (26th). 
</P>
<P>
 Bad finishes, worse luck. In 1992, for instance, after a 22-victory season, 
they drew the lottery pick that became Tom Gugliotta. The Hornets won 44 and 
drew Alonzo Mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 The talent deficit caught up with Wes Unseld, whose players learned to tune 
out his grizzly-bear growls. Owner Abe Pollin retired his old favorite to the 
front office and hired Jim Lynam, who didn't know when he was well off as 
general manager of the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollin, desperate or trying to set the franchise up for a sale, tried to trade 
No. 1 pick Juwan Howard for Scottie Pippen but the Bulls wanted Gugliotta, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, a model of industry at Michigan, promised to sign right away but 
hasn't been seen since the draft, and his agent, Washington-based David Falk, 
tortures the hometown team.

 1993-94 record: 25-57.

 Everyone knew Shawn Bradley would need time but at his current pace, by the 
time he becomes an NBA center, his teammates will have died of old age. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley has looked more pathetic than awkward and hasn't impressed anyone with 
his attitude. Last season, 76er officials called him the Mormon Charles 
Barkley. Lynam, the general manager who signed him, now coaches the Bullets and 
says that, given the size of their contracts, he prefers 7-7 Gheorghe Muresan. 
Fast-talking John Lucas has taken over as coach and general manager and has 
dispensed with Fred Carter's gentle treatment of Bradley. So far, no results. 
CENTRAL DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 INDIANA PACERS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 47-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 101.0 (15th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 97.5 (eighth). 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brown's first Pacer season produced the usual miracle, only bigger. He 
took a team that had never won an NBA playoff series to within one victory of 
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 This was followed by the usual speculation he was getting antsy again. Reports 
circulated that his wife, a Californian, didn't like Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 A funny thing happened on the way to the airport. Instead of looking around, 
Brown signed a contract extension, underlining his commitment to his old buddy, 
General Manager Donnie Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers have youth, energy and size. The front line of Rik Smits, Dale 
Davis and Derrick McKey goes 7-feet-4, 6-11, 6-11, and they're backed by a 
coveted young player, 6-9 Antonio Davis. And there's an emerging star, Reggie 
Miller. They also picked up Mark Jackson for a song. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, anything is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLOTTE HORNETS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 41-41. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 106.5 (fourth). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 106.7 (24th). 
</P>
<P>
 Having built a powerhouse with two lottery draws, the Hornets prepared 
themselves for elite status, giving Larry Johnson that $84-million extension. 
Johnson missed most of the season with back problems. 
</P>
<P>
 They were going to give Alonzo Mourning a $100-million extension this year but 
he hurt his toe in camp. Instead of forging bravely ahead as they had with 
Johnson, the Hornets decided to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't say these guys can't learn from their mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything will be OK if L.J. returns to form but only the regular season will 
tell. He missed most of the exhibition season with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Parish joins up to provide veteran leadership. Very veteran. He's 41. 
The search for a point guard to back up 5-3 Muggsy Bogues yielded 5-9 Michael 
Adams. Coach Allan Bristow is still on thin ice. Aside from that, our dynasts 
are right on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 CHICAGO BULLS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 55-27. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 98 (23rd). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 94.9 (third). 
</P>
<P>
 Since the spring of 1993, when the Bulls won their third title, they have lost 
Jordan, Grant, Bill Cartwright, John Paxson, Scott Williams, Stacey King, 
assistant coach John Bach, assistant coach Tex Winter and Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Pippen, B.J. Armstrong and Will Perdue remain from the '93 champions. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the Bulls signed Ron Harper of San Quentin, er, the 
Clippers. Consigned to the junk heap of history after Jordan's retirement, the 
Bulls instead went 55-27. Only home losses the last weekend of the season to 
the Celtics and Knicks kept them from finishing No. 1 in the East. Only Hue 
Hollins' call in Game 5 of the Knick series kept the Bulls from coming home 
with a 3-2 lead in their series. 
</P>
<P>
 If Phil Jackson does it again, he ought to go right to the Hall of Fame. The 
party's over and now it's just a matter of how fast the guests leave. 
</P>
<P>
 CLEVELAND CAVALIERS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 47-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 101.2 (12th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 96.9 (sixth). 
</P>
<P>
 If only they hadn't traded Ron Harper for Danny Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
 If only Rick Mahorn hadn't clothes-lined Mark Price two months before the '89 
playoffs with the Cavaliers off to a 43-12 start. 
</P>
<P>
 If only Brad Daugherty had had that back surgery last summer. If only his back 
hadn't gone out again this fall. If only Larry Nance were still around. If only 
Gerald Wilkins, who had finally learned to shoot, hadn't blown out an Achilles' 
tendon this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 If only Mike Fratello could get his NBC gig back as czar of the Telestrator. 
</P>
<P>
 DETROIT PISTONS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 20-62. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 96.9 (24th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 104.7 (20th). 
</P>
<P>
 Nice rebuilding program. The Pistons hung on to their two greatest assets, 
Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars, traded Dennis Rodman for Sean Elliott, traded 
Elliott . . . and then lucked into Grant Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Krzyzewski swore anyone who passed on his Dukie would feel foolish one 
day and, sure enough, Hill had a monster exhibition season. People are already 
comparing him to Jordan which is, of course, ridiculous. But comparisons to 
Pippen are possible. Off the exhibitions, Hill looks about like Pippen did 
after three seasons in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 ATLANTA HAWKS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 57-25. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 101.4 (11th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 96.2 (fourth). 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Wilkens improved the Hawks by an amazing 14 victories and General 
Manager Pete Babcock went for broke, trading 34-year-old Dominique Wilkins -- 
and whatever title chance they had -- for Danny Manning and a shot at a future. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning left, though, taking their future with him. Sometimes you do the right 
thing and it just doesn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkens has Mookie Blaylock, now an elite point guard, and hustling Stacey 
Augmon but little else to build on. The Hawks may sneak back into the playoffs 
but they're headed back to Square one. 
</P>
<P>
 MILWAUKEE BUCKS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 20-62. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 96.9 (25th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 103.4 (15th). 
</P>
<P>
 Big Doggie, come home. Coach Mike Dunleavy, who salivated all summer at the 
thought of Glenn Robinson, is still drooling while Robinson's agent, Dr. 
Charles Tucker, tries to get his mind around the idea that his rookie isn't 
going to get sport's first nine-figure salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunleavy has built up a pool of talented young players -- Vin Baker, Eric 
Murdock, Todd Day. Robinson's late arrival will hurt but by January, he should 
be wowing them. It might be too early for the Bucks to make a playoff run but 
their future is bright.

ROUNDUP; WARRIORS FINALLY GET A CENTER IN SEIKALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Golden State Warriors acquired center Rony Seikaly from the Miami Heat for 
forward Billy Owens on Wednesday, two days before the opening of the NBA 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 foot 11 1/2, Seikaly is the type of center long sought after by Warrior 
Coach Don Nelson, who can now move Chris Webber, a contract holdout, back to 
power forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat also received the rights to 6-6 guard Predrag Danilovic, the 
Warriors' second round pick in the 1992 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 For Owens, the timing of the trade was familiar. As a rookie, he was dealt to 
the Warriors from Sacramento on Nov. 1, 1991, the night that NBA season 
started. In three years with Golden State, he averaged 15 points, 7.9 rebounds 
and 3.5 assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Owens, Seikaly played at Syracuse before being the ninth player selected 
in the 1988 draft, the Heat's first. He has averaged 15.4 points, 10.4 rebounds 
and 1.4 blocks in six years with Miami. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dennis Rodman was suspended without pay by the San Antonio Spurs for the first 
three games of the NBA season because of his recent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "This action is not taken lightly," General Manager Gregg Popovich said in 
announcing the length of Rodman's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my sincere hope that Dennis will decide to become a productive part of 
this basketball team." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Less than an hour before his car was involved in an accident, Roy Tarpley of 
the Dallas Mavericks was ticketed on the North Dallas Toll Road for driving 
nearly 92 m.p.h. in a 55-m.p.h. zone at 2:50 a.m. Saturday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:41 a.m., Tarpley's black 1986 Mercedes was involved in an accident, 
sustaining heavy damage to the right front when it hit a utility pole in north 
Dallas. Tarpley said he loaned his car to a friend after he and his wife were 
dropped off at their residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarpley, recently reinstated after a two-year absence from the NBA for 
violating its drug policies, is expected to begin the season on the injured 
list. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Phoenix Sun star forward Charles Barkley is questionable for the season opener 
Friday at Sacramento because of a strained stomach muscle. Barkley sat out 
practice Wednesday but said he was leaning toward playing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The agent for Glenn Robinson, saying the Milwaukee Bucks are portraying his 
client as a "greedy little black athlete," is angered with the club for going 
public with its contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Charles Tucker initially said neither he nor Robinson, the top pick in 
the NBA draft, was bothered by the Bucks' decision to hold a news conference 
Oct. 17 to disclose their $60-million guaranteed offer. The Bucks also said 
Robinson was seeking $100 million over 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Wednesday's editions of the Milwaukee Journal, Tucker said he and 
Robinson are indeed upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was their intention for Glenn to jump up and come in and sign, it 
didn't work," Tucker said. "If they want to portray Glenn as a greedy little 
black athlete, well, I look it as a business and it was something that was not 
a very productive way of doing things."

THE NBA: 1994-95 PREVIEW; A MAGIC KINGDOM OR ANOTHER SHAQ-SIZED SETBACK?; PRO 
BASKETBALL: O'NEAL READY TO SERIOUSLY CONTEND FOR NBA TITLE WITH ADDITION OF 
HORACE GRANT, BUT GROWING PAINS MAY STILL GET IN THE WAY OF YOUNG TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They don't build dynasties the way they used to. 
</P>
<P>
 Scene 1: Here's General Manager Pat Williams of the Orlando Magic sticking in 
his thumb and pulling out the plum of the 1992 draft, 20-year-old Shaquille 
O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 Scene 2: Here's O'Neal, 21, tooling around Los Angeles the summer after his 
first NBA season in the car he garages here just so he can have wheels whenever 
he's in town. Shaq's working on his first movie, "Blue Chips," and has just met 
21-year-old Anfernee (Penny) Hardaway, who also has a part. 
</P>
<P>
 Having played pickup ball with him, Shaq is impressed enough to pick up his 
car phone, call the office and tell the Magic brass to take another look at 
this guy. Hardaway's first workout had been so-so, but the Magic bring him 
back, fall in love with him and make a draft-day deal for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Scene 3: Here's O'Neal, 22, driving free agent Horace Grant around Orlando to 
show he isn't the jerk some people are saying he is. Shaq's second season has 
been highlighted by an All-Star game in which Western Conference veterans 
ganged up on the young star of stage, screen and rap music, bumming corporate 
America's young hero out so much, he charged around the NBA like an angry bull, 
dropping large numbers on anyone he could identify who helped do this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other teams were telling him, 'Shaq don't work hard.' 'Shaq's an arrogant 
person, don't go down there,' " O'Neal says later. "I just wanted him to see 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant, convinced that this great big lug is really only a huge teddy bear, 
signs with the Magic, giving the team the perfect self-effacing power forward 
to complete the puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Scene 4: Here are Shaq, Penny and Horace accepting the Larry O'Brien Trophy 
from David Stern after winning the NBA title. This, of course, is only their 
first of many. What's the Celtics' record, eight in a row? Should be no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OK, there is one little problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our goal is a championship, and with a team like this, we shouldn't 
think anything less," O'Neal says, grinning. "But we've got to win a playoff 
game first." 
</P>
<P>
 That would certainly help. Shaq and his teammates boogied on the court last 
spring after clinching their first postseason berth, but they drew the wrong 
team for their maiden voyage. The fast-closing Indiana Pacers swept them in 
three games, the first two in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing was all but over when Byron Scott dropped a three-pointer on them at 
the end of Game 1 to win it, 89-88. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, when the Pacers polished them off in Indianapolis, Magic 
players could attest that there was, indeed, something different about the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Byron, he's been there," Nick Anderson said. "He made it when it counted.  
</P>
<P>
 "The intensity level. Every basket counts. You've got to play every play like 
it's the last play. You've got to come to play and play the whole game. Every 
turnover, every missed shot, every missed rebound, every pass that you had the 
opportunity to score off of -- everything counts. You can't fall asleep because 
in the blink of an eye, you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The sneaker companies might dote on young stars, but NBA coaches understand 
what it takes to win a title: experience, and lots of it. Michael Jordan, the 
greatest player who ever lived, didn't win a title until his seventh season. It 
took three tries for the Bulls to get past the hoary, old Detroit Pistons, who 
gave the youngsters some experiences to remember: Scottie Pippen's migraine, 
Jordan challenging his teammates to stand up to "the Bad Boys." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the expectations are unrealistic, to be totally honest with you," 
says Magic Coach Brian Hill, the man first in line to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was our first year in the playoffs and we didn't win a playoff game 
and for us to be expected to be in the NBA finals this year really kind of 
borders on the ridiculous, I think. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a process you have to go through to get there and you have to 
learn what it takes to get there and I think history proves that. It took the 
Pistons three years to break through on Boston. It took the Bulls three years 
to finally break through the Pistons. It took New York three years to finally 
break through Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why the process is going to be any different for us. I think 
we're going to have to learn what it takes and I think we're going to have to 
probably suffer some more playoff hardship before we ultimately get to where we 
want to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's Shaq, finally settling into the life of a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, players resented him. Only Jordan ever made as much commercially as 
he did and it took him years to build up what O'Neal walked into as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 A competitor such as Charlotte's Alonzo Mourning might have been offended at 
his very presence. Whether Mourning shared the sentiment or not, Hornet 
officials said they would have drafted Mourning ahead of Shaq, praising their 
player's work ethic and questioning O'Neal's. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, O'Neal would call it press hype. Then when the session was over, 
he'd often turn to a reporter and say, "Alonzo Mourning, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 But they became teammates at the World Championships last summer and, as Magic 
Johnson and Larry Bird had after making a commercial together, became friendly. 
From now on, O'Neal and Mourning may be fierce rivals but not bitter ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys perceive me as being intense, intimidating," Mourning says. 
"They're just going by what they see when they compete against me, but by 
hanging out with me, they understand I'm fun to be around. I joke around a lot. 
There's a lot of things I like doing that don't really connect with how I play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shaq and I had fun together, had a chance to talk. He's fun to be around. I 
like his personality. He's a big kid in a whole lot of ways. A lot of people 
wouldn't see that, but he is." 
</P>
<P>
 This is how the world changes, slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 If the best team never to win a playoff game has to have its heart broken some 
more to acquire the character it will need, it had better get to it. The world 
hates to be kept waiting.

POSITIONS COULD BE THE KEY SATURDAY; HORSE RACING: DEVIL HIS DUE, PARADISE 
CREEK AND LURE WILL START ON THE OUTSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Devil His Due, Paradise Creek and Lure, three of the favorites for Saturday's 
Breeders' Cup races, have drawn outside post positions that might hurt their 
chances in capacity fields. 
</P>
<P>
 When Devil His Due drew the No. 14 spot Wednesday for the $3-million Breeders' 
Cup Classic, Mike Battaglia, the Churchill Downs handicapper, switched his 
morning-line favorite to Tabasco Cat. Devil His Due was listed as the second 
choice at 4-1, and Tabasco Cat, who drew the No. 4 post, is 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Lure, with the No. 14 post, is still the favorite in the $1-million Mile for 
an unprecedented third consecutive year, but Battaglia said that his 9-5 odds 
would have been lower "if he wasn't breaking from the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Creek, who drew the No. 13 post, is still the 8-5 favorite in the 
$1-million Turf. 
</P>
<P>
 A record 94 horses were entered in seven races worth $10 million. There are 
capacity fields of 14 starters in each race except the Distaff, which might be 
the toughest to win because of a deep 10-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 Other favorites are Soviet Problem at 7-2 in the Sprint; the entry of Flanders 
and Cat Appeal, 6-5 in the Juvenile Fillies; Timber Country, 7-2 in the 
Juvenile, and Hollywood Wildcat and Sky Beauty, who are each 2-1 in the 
Distaff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't separate those two horses," Battaglia said. "This is the first 
time I've ever had co-favorites in a race." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Shug McGaughey tried to find something positive about Lure's outside 
draw, and mentioned that he had won the Mile a year ago at Santa Anita after 
starting from No. 12 in a 13-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to use him more leaving the gate," McGaughey said. "But since he's 
only running a mile, that shouldn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Battaglia said that he would have made Holy Bull "less than 2-1" if the 
colt had run in the Classic. Holy Bull, who is favored to win the 
horse-of-the-year title without running Saturday, is being rested for a 
4-year-old campaign. His owner-trainer, Jimmy Croll, sent in Holy Bull's $500 
nomination fee a year late, when he was a yearling instead of a weanling, and 
it would have cost Croll a penalty of $360,000 to run him in the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a chance of rain Friday and Saturday, with temperatures dropping from 
the 60s Friday to the 50s for race day. . . . Donald Calabria, attorney for 
trainers Ron McAnally, Willard Proctor, Richard Mandella and Mark Hennig, said 
they would appeal the fines ordered Tuesday by California Horse Racing Board 
stewards. The four trainers raced horses at Santa Anita that tested positive 
for a prohibited medication. "The fact that they issued these relatively small 
fines without comment still leaves a cloud over the trainers' heads," Calabria 
said. "If they really believe these trainers did something, why didn't they 
give them six-month suspensions?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella, who had two horses that tested positive, was fined $750 and the 
others were fined $500. "Even the way they totaled up the fines doesn't make 
sense," Hennig said. "In effect, Mandella got $250 for his second positive. 
What would they have done if he'd had a third positive, fine him only $125?"

TYSON WILL BE NO. 1 CONTENDER UPON RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson will be the No. 1 contender for the 
World Boxing Council crown on his release from jail early next year, the WBC 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued at a Council meeting in Seville said that an "overwhelming 
majority" of the WBC board of governors had voted to reinstate Tyson as the No. 
1 challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson, who was waiting for a title chance when jailed for rape in 1992, is due 
out of prison in Indiana next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson, seen as virtually invincible until dethroned by James (Buster) Douglas 
in 1990, would be expected to go through one warm-up fight before a new title 
challenge, WBC President Jose Sulaiman told reporters.

NHL CANCELS 10 GAMES, PLOTS SEASON OF 50 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NHL on Wednesday canceled 10 more games per team and worked on plans for a 
50-game season with a completely new schedule matching teams solely against 
conference opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 That schedule, which reflects the minimum number of games the league says 
would constitute a meaningful season, would take effect if the lockout ended by 
mid- or late December. Clubs would then conduct training camps of seven to 10 
days and play one exhibition game each to benefit charity. Playoff seedings 
would be based on conference standings, as they were last season. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are no indications that the 34-day-old dispute will be resolved 
in time to salvage 50 games. Commissioner Gary Bettman and Bob Goodenow, 
executive director of the NHL Players Assn., reported no progress after meeting 
Monday for only the second time since Oct. 11. They are not likely to talk 
again until next Monday. Through Wednesday, 183 games had been wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting very close to the point of no return now," said Toronto's Mike 
Gartner, president of the NHLPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tony Tavares, president of the Mighty Ducks, "You've got to have half the 
season. If you're not going to do that, what's the sense of bothering?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's cancellations brought the total to 14, one-sixth of each club's 
84-game schedule. Each club lost an additional four home games, four road games 
and two neutral-site games. Which games will be wiped out besides the 
neutral-site games won't be announced until a starting date for the season is 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the neutral-site games, which were run as a joint venture with 
the NHLPA, helped bankroll the players' pension fund. The NHL said those 
cancellations were made after discussion with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six games were scheduled at neutral sites. 
</P>
<P>
 While the NHL pared its schedule, 200 players met in Toronto to be updated on 
the negotiations and on the NHLPA's plan to provide insurance for them at its 
exhibition tournament Nov. 10-12 in Hamilton. Afterward, they reaffirmed their 
solidarity.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to bend for all the wrong reasons," Buffalo Sabre forward 
Brad May said. "It's a psychological fight as much as a financial one now. The 
frustrating thing is, there doesn't seem to be a light at the end of the 
tunnel."

TWICE THE VICE FINDS SANTA ANITA THRICE NICE

<P>
 All Twice The Vice needed was a return to a track she likes. 
</P>
<P>
 After racing on soft turf at Belmont Park and a track at Keeneland that 
promoted speed horses in her two previous starts, Twice The Vice rebounded in a 
big way Wednesday at Santa Anita, pulling away through the stretch under Eddie 
Delahoussaye and beating Malli Star by five lengths in the $101,150 Linda Vista 
Breeders' Cup Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner of five of eight starts overall, Twice The Vice is now perfect in 
three starts at Santa Anita. She picked up $61,150 Wednesday for owners Bob and 
Beverly Lewis and covered the 1 1/16 miles in 1:41 2/5. She paid $9.40 as the 
7-2 second choice. 
</P>
<P>

LOS ALAMITOS; GRISWOLD'S LOSS DRAWS FANS' IRE; RIDER SUSPENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A six-horse trial last Thursday night drew most of the weekend attention at 
Los Alamitos and resulted in some irate patrons and a five-day suspension for 
jockey John Creager. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first of two trials for the AQHA Challenge Distance Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, 4-5 favorite Griswold took the lead early in the 870-yard race 
and led by two lengths rounding the turn for home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final yards, however, Creager appeared to ease up on Griswold, who 
immediately slowed, allowing a fast-closing Better Than Never to win by a head. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold, owned by Legacy Ranch of Chino, finished second, a neck ahead of 
Racin Deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (quit) on me," Creager said. "He was running a really good, strong race, 
and we come down (the stretch), and he just (quit)." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pete Parella, co-owner of Legacy Ranch: "I think what happened was that 
Creager thought he was sitting on the best race this horse has run this year, 
and that he had plenty of horse left. I think the horse kind of cheated on him, 
and when he quit riding, the horse stopped faster than he thought he would, and 
it kind of surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Griswold) is so smart. He's been around for so long that when you quit 
riding him, he thinks it's over. He won't give you any more than he needs to." 
</P>
<P>
 Parella understands the problem jockeys often face in trial races. The object 
is to win, at the same time saving the horse for the final, when the big money 
is on the line. The AQHA trial was a particularly touchy situation, since eight 
of the 11 horses in the two races would qualify for the final. In the end, five 
of the six in the first trial qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think everybody in that race was trying to win," Parella said. "Had 
the horses in second place not been aggressive and trying to win, Griswold 
would have won. I can't blame John (Creager). Griswold is a cheating son of a 
gun, and he just fooled him." 
</P>
<P>
 After the race, as Creager and Griswold galloped back, they were met with a 
chorus of boos. Five races later, when Creager reappeared to ride his next 
mount, the boos continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was horrible for me to see that," Parella said. "When we lost the match 
race (Griswold vs. Valient Pete at Santa Anita in 1991), I thought that was the 
worst thing that's ever happened to me in racing. But listening to the crowd 
the other night was worse. It was a horrible, horrible feeing." 
</P>
<P>
 The following night, Creager went before the Los Alamitos stewards and was 
suspended for "failure to persevere with his mount to the finish line, a 
violation of California Horse Racing Board rule 1893 (best effort required)." 
With two exceptions, Creager will sit out this weekend's racing and the program 
Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my honest opinion, I think he deserved (suspension)," Parella said. "'If a 
jockey makes a mistake or uses poor judgment, you've got to pay for that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "John was not trying to run second or third. John's a great rider, and I'm 
sure he feels worse than anybody. I know he didn't do it intentionally. It was 
just a judgment decision, and one I'm sure he wishes he hadn't made." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Creager: "The only place I think I messed up is that I trusted the old 
horse to keep going like he was, and he didn't. I didn't want the horse to get 
beat. When you're in front by that far, you're not supposed to get beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Creager, the third-leading quarter horse jockey of the meeting, will ride 
fastest-qualifier Ah Sigh in the $150,000 Ed Burke Memorial Futurity on Friday 
and Moo Vin First in the Golden State Derby on Saturday. They are designated 
races and, because of their importance, suspended jockeys are allowed to ride 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Creager, however, might be off Griswold in the final of the AQHA Challenge 
Distance Championship on Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't make a change and the same thing happens, people are going to 
say, 'What's going on?' " Parella said. "All these questions come up, like 
maybe we bet on the other horse, or (Griswold) wasn't right. The integrity of 
the sport is too important. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do make a change, I feel bad for John, because he won't have a chance 
to redeem himself. To be honest with you, I don't think he'd make the same 
mistake twice." 
</P>

 Live harness racing is guaranteed at Los Alamitos this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Premier Group, the harness racing group responsible for running the Los 
Alamitos harness meeting last year, signed a lease with Los Alamitos last week 
for the winter season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lease is signed and the dates were approved at the (California Horse 
Racing Board) meeting Friday in Arcadia," said Dick Feinberg, vice president 
and general manager of the Horsemen's Quarter Horse Racing Assn.

IT'S NFL, NOT GEOGRAPHY CLASS; PRO FOOTBALL: CAROLINA TO DEBUT IN NFC WEST AND 
JACKSONVILLE JOINS AFC CENTRAL IN TEMPORARY MOVE. SAN FRANCISCO GETS '99 SUPER 
BOWL. 
</P>

<P>
 Did you hear about the new NFC West Division rivalry? Between regional foes 
Carolina and San Francisco? 
</P>
<P>
 And how about that emerging feud in the AFC Central, that back-yard battle 
between Jacksonville and, uh, Cleveland? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're natural rivals, we're 30 miles apart," Browns' owner Art Modell said, 
smiling and pausing. "By supersonic jet." 
</P>
<P>
 It was confusing. It seemed a bit silly. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, NFL owners agreed Wednesday to allow Commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
to slot the two expansion teams into the two four-team divisions for 1995, with 
realignment expected at the owners' meetings in Phoenix next March. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it fair?" Modell said. "Well, it's just a one-year thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For one year, Carolina will compete for the NFC West championship with the 
49ers, Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans Saints and the Rams. Wherever the Rams may 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacksonville will be in the AFC Central with the Browns, Houston Oilers, 
Pittsburgh Steelers, and Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the stubbornness of league owners who could not agree to 
realign, Tagliabue ordered that some sort of alignment be approved by a vote 
next March, even if it's the current alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most owners say that by opening it to a vote, there will be enough 
arm-twisting to reach a majority on a new plan that will make more sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "This now puts realignment on the front burner and forces us to look at it," 
said Oiler owner Bud Adams, who desperately wants to move to the AFC West. "I 
think next year we will make some progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Or fall asleep trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will get a vote if we have the longest meeting in league history," 
Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers and Jaguars are thrilled with their new, if interim, homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolina officials love the possibility of competing with natural rivals in 
New Orleans and Atlanta. Jacksonville officials hope to match the interest 
created by the Miami Dolphins when they joined the AFC East and played against 
teams from northern cities where many Miami residents once lived. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news on the final day of an uneventful meeting, San Francisco was 
awarded the 1999 Super Bowl and Pasadena was announced as one of six candidates 
for the Super Bowl of 2000.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; HARVEY WILLIAMS TAKES FIRST SHOT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raiders vs. Chiefs on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 You know it's going to be a good game when they start taking shots at each 
other Wednesday . 
</P>
<P>
 Raider running back Harvey Williams has been telling any and all who would 
listen that he was not treated fairly during his three years with the Chiefs, 
implying that he was set up to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marty (Schottenheimer, head coach) brought me to his house and said, 'You're 
the man. You're the man,' " Williams said Wednesday. "Then the next week they 
signed Marcus (Allen). Not taking anything away from Marcus, but I felt I had 
paid my dues there. Give me an opportunity like you gave Christian (Okoye) and 
gave Barry (Word). After you do that, then judge. But don't judge me on just 
one or two carries a game. (It would have been better) if he (Schottenheimer) 
would have come to me and told me, 'Look Harvey, we want Marcus in there.' But 
don't lie to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Williams was directing his remarks at Schottenheimer, when his former 
teammate, defensive end Neil Smith, heard the remarks in a television 
interview, he took them personally and had some advice for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing Harvey can do is just shut up right now," Smith said. "That 
would be the easy way for Harvey to really come in here and be safe coming out. 
Because right now, this ballclub was embarrassed last week (losing, 44-10, to 
the Buffalo Bills). That's all we need is one little spark from anything or 
someone to get us going. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's flat-out that he just disrespected us and that he (thinks) he's going to 
come in and do whatever he's capable of doing. Well, that's all well and good. 
He knows exactly what he said. He just can't wait. Well, we can't wait, 
either." STEVE SPRINGER

 The Chicago Bears have switched quarterbacks. Steve Walsh will start and Erik 
Kramer will sit. "I think Steve has earned an opportunity to start," Coach Dave 
Wannstedt said.The Bears, 4-4 after a two-game losing streak, play at Tampa Bay 
Sunday. Kramer, given a three-year, $8.1-million contract, was 1-4 as a 
starter. . . . After wading through stacks of records, the NFL confirmed that 
Minnesota cornerback Anthony Parker is the first defensive player to score 
touchdowns in three consecutive games. Parker returned an interception 41 yards 
for a touchdown against Tampa Bay on Sunday, a fumble 23 yards against Green 
Bay on Oct. 20 and an interception 44 yards against the New York Giants on Oct. 
10. . . . Gus Frerotte will start at least the next two games, said Washington 
Coach Norv Turner, relegating Heath Shuler to the bench whether he is healthy 
or not. . . . Barry Switzer, still fuming over an elbow thrown by Cincinnati's 
James Francis, wants the league to suspend any defensive player who 
intentionally targets concussion-prone Troy Aikman, starting with the Bengals' 
Francis. The play is being reviewed by the league.

WOODLAND HILLS FIGHT CARD COULD HAVE USED THREE RINGS; BOXING: GOOSSEN AWARDED 
SPLIT DECISION. SEATING PROBLEMS MAR MARRIOTT SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A night that started in controversy ended the same way Wednesday at the Warner 
Center Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. Goossen, who grew up in North Hollywood and now resides in Palmdale was 
awarded a split decision over Irish Pat Lawlor in a 10-round superwelterweight 
bout. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges' scores were widely divergent. One had it 98-92 in favor of Lawlor. 
The other two had Goossen winning, 97-93 and 96-95. 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen, who is trained by his father, Pat, improved to 13-0 in his first 
main-event victory. Lawlor, whose victories include decisions over champions 
Wilfredo Benitez and Robert Duran, fell to 20-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I dominated every round except for maybe one or two," P.J. Goossen 
said. "I don't know what the one judge was thinking. Maybe he's Irish." 
</P>
<P>
 A victory over an experienced veteran like the 30-year old Lawlor should give 
Goossen, 25, a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It catapults me up to fighting tougher opponents and getting more fights. And 
maybe some bigger money -- what we're all in this for." 
</P>
<P>
 Professional boxing's first excursion into the upscale surroundings of a West 
Valley ballroom was, in attendance, an overwhelming success. 
</P>
<P>
 Too much of a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Fight organizers reported 1,204 seats inside, and all of them were filled. 
Problem was, they were in a different configuration than what had been 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire marshal saw to that. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute change in seating led to mass confusion. Some fans were 
required to change seats while dozens of others were kept in the lobby while 
organizers searched for open places. 
</P>
<P>
 During the second bout of the five-fight card, the crowd outside the 
facility's doors swelled to nearly 100, many of whom were trying to re-enter 
after visiting the restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 After that bout, ring announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr. told the crowd that the fire 
marshal was stopping the action until fans outside the room could be seated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your seat may be taken if you're not in it," he calmly added. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Broudy, the card's promoter, offered full refunds to the dissatisfied 
who reported to a bar outside within a 10-minute span. 
</P>
<P>
 Broudy estimated that more than 300 fans took him up on the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Lewis, an attorney who attended the fights with four friends and a client, 
was among those who demanded their money. "We had planned a nice evening," 
Lewis said. "Well, the dinner was nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Another man in Lewis' party said he had a ticket in Section 1, Row 6. "But 
Section 1 had only five rows," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Dontco, another fight fan in a party of six, said he had never seen 
anything like the confusion that occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Country Club was never like this," he said. The Country Club in Reseda 
regularly hosted professional boxing cards until earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennon, who is following in the footsteps of his father, a ring legend, said 
he had never been in a similar situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done a lot of fights," he said. "And this is a first." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Nadley, a hotel catering executive, said hotel officials would meet this 
morning to discuss whether future boxing events would be held in the ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the response was phenomenal," Nadley said. "I'm sure it was a 
success from the standpoint of making money. But obviously, if we do this 
again, we're going to have to have a seating arrangement that's closer to 
scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Broudy said the event was not oversold. "I pulled the seats," he said. "But 
the configuration was changed. That was the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In undercard bouts, Santiago Negro Franco of Torreon, Mexico, won a majority 
decision over Juan West of Riverside in a welterweight fight; Anthony Johnson 
of Los Angeles won a unanimous decision over Tony West of Bermuda Dunes in a 
junior-welterweight bout, and Obed Sullivan of Lancaster knocked out Jim Mullen 
of Simi Valley at 2:15 of the fifth round in their heavyweight match. 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. Goossen of Palmdale was scheduled to face Irish Pat Lawlor of San 
Francisco in the main event, which had not started at press time.

PATIENCE PAYS OFF FOR CSUN; VOLLEYBALL: MATADORS DEFEAT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN 
DIEGO, 15-11, 19-17, 15-11, BEHIND CLEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As musical selections go, it was extremely apropos. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge had just come from behind to defeat the University of San 
Diego in the second game of Wednesday's nonconference women's volleyball match 
at Northridge Gymnasium, and blaring over the public address system was the 
song "All Right Now." 
</P>
<P>
 Things were all right and about to get better for Northridge as the Matadors 
surged to a nine-point lead in Game 3 before sweeping San Diego, 15-11, 19-17, 
15-11. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, the third in the last four matches for Northridge (13-8), avenged 
a five-game loss to San Diego and could be the biggest victory of the year if 
the Matadors can win their final four matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is regarded as a long shot to make the 32-team field for the NCAA 
playoffs. But a 17-8 record, a five-match winning streak to end the season and 
a victory over San Diego -- which has spent much of the season ranked among the 
nation's top 25 teams -- just might do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know where we stand," CSUN outside hitter Missy Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements, a 5-foot-11 senior from La Habra High, played a big part in 
Wednesday's victory with a match-high 25 kills and a .389 hitting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 After recording eight kills in Game 1, Clements had 11 in Game 2 when the 
Matadors came back from deficits of 7-0 and 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 11-9, Northridge scored three consecutive points with Heather 
Anderson serving to take a 12-11 lead, but San Diego countered with a 
three-point run to go ahead, 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toreros (16-8) had a chance to win the game with Kym Phillips serving, but 
the Matadors sided out on a Clements kill. After a pair of sideouts, Northridge 
tied the score, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego eventually took a 17-16 lead, but the Toreros couldn't attain the 
required two-point advantage to win the game as the teams sided out 17 times in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge tied the score, 17-17, when San Diego was called for a double hit. 
After a pair of sideouts, the Matadors took an 18-17 lead on a cross-court kill 
by Ana Kristich, and won the game when Amy McMahon hit a ball wide right for 
the Toreros. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements, who is 33 kills away from becoming Northridge's all-time leader with 
1,327, said that relaxation keyed the Matadors' ability to come from behind in 
each of the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a lot to do with our patience," she said. "Tonight, we felt like they 
had a lot more to lose than we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Middle blocker Heather Anderson continued her hot hitting for Northridge, 
recording 18 kills with a .358 hitting percentage to go along with three blocks 
and a match-high 22 digs.

NICE TOUCH; CSUN QUARTERBACK O'LAUGHLIN A PEOPLE-PLEASING PROSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let it be written here, for the first time anywhere: J.J. O'Laughlin was a 
chunky kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a big bag of blubber, mind you, but a wide load nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a pudgy little guy," said his brother, Brian. "Chubby as in, built 
like a catcher eating a Snickers bar." 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoy the snickers and chuckles while you can, because when it comes to James 
Joseph O'Laughlin, there aren't many opportunities to laugh at his expense. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin, a preseason All-American quarterback at Cal State Northridge, is 
the closest thing to Frank Merriwell as there can be in the 1990s. People speak 
of him in almost- reverential terms, which strikes an unaffected O'Laughlin as 
borderline hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflated as a kid, nothing of the sort as an adult. Particularly when it comes 
to ego. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of guy you'd want your daughter to marry," football Coach Bob Burt 
said. Gee whiz. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you see is what you get," teammate Travis Hall said. "He's the real 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Golly gosh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also help old ladies cross the street," O'Laughlin said.. 
</P>
<P>
 Old scouts cross the country to eye his wares. They furiously scribble notes 
at practice and carefully scrutinize his game film. 
</P>
<P>
 He ranks among the best college players in Southern California, sentiments 
bellowed from the mountaintops by Burt. 
</P>
<P>
 He might be the best quarterback in Northridge history. Care to hear 
O'Laughlin discuss the validity of the issue? 
</P>
<P>
 As his brother might say: Fat chance.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time O'Laughlin ever quit anything. It tore at his very moral 
fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, J.J. wanted to win so badly, his older brothers on occasion 
half-seriously accused him of cheating. Now he was coming home to Glendora with 
his tail between his legs and his belongings in a U-Haul trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 A disenchanted O'Laughlin packed up his truck last August, grabbed a road map 
and headed west, leaving the University of Illinois and the Big Ten Conference 
in the old rear-view. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in Southern California on a Friday and drove to San Diego the 
following day to catch Northridge in action against San Diego State. He watched 
from the stands as quarterback Coley Kyman suffered a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Burt afterward: "Get ready. We're down to two (quarterbacks)." 
</P>
<P>
 . At that point, O'Laughlin hadn't even met his new teammates, who gathered 
around during his first practice to see what all the hubbub was about. Sure, he 
was a transfer from D-1, but was he the one? 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day of practice, he threw a deep ball, with the tightest spiral 
I've ever seen, right on the money," said Hall, a junior tight end. "I thought, 
'Maybe we've got something here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Something else, it seemed. O'Laughlin practiced for one week, then saw action 
in Northridge's next game against Weber State. He threw two touchdown passes 
and was named the starter, which means that either Northridge was running an 
offense that Fred Flintstone could master or J.J.'s a quick study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely the former," O'Laughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. O'Laughlin, who carries a grade-point average of 3.5, saw a new 
playbook about every 15 minutes at Illinois. In three years with the Illini, he 
had three different position coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 He first committed to Illinois and Coach John Mackovic in 1990, after three 
years as the starter at Glendora High. Mom and dad bought a satellite TV dish 
to follow his athletic progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying ComSat itself wouldn't have helped, the way things turned out. He 
hardly played. 
</P>
<P>
 Mackovic bolted for Texas a year later and was replaced by Lou Tepper. With 
his parents' encouragement, O'Laughlin stuck it out as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured that sooner or later, they'd finally see that he was the best man 
for the job," said his mother, Terry. 
</P>
<P>
 He was -- if the job was holding a clipboard and trying to look interested. 
After participating in summer camp in '93, O'Laughlin requested and received a 
blunt assessment.  
</P>
<P>
 "They told me I was not in the picture," O'Laughlin said. "They had their guys 
they recruited. I really had no choice if I wanted to play. And I had to play." 
</P>
<P>
 To gain immediate eligibility, O'Laughlin needed to join a program that 
competed in Division I-AA or lower. Northridge, which plays in I-AA and fit the 
profile, was close to home.  
</P>
<P>
 Burt, who also coached at Cal State Fullerton, UCLA and Hawaii, said 
O'Laughlin (6 feet 3, 200 pounds) is the most complete quarterback he's 
coached. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's what coaches dream of having at that position," Burt said. "He has the 
ability and the intangibles. If a coach could have a guy like him every year, 
he'd have a major problem solved -- forever." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin's arrival was the solution for team and player, though there are 
trade-offs for the latter. After all, ambushing opponents like Cal State Chico 
and Sonoma State doesn't exactly spice up a guy's football portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin has passed for 1,697 yards and ranks 19th in total offense in I-AA, 
yet the Matadors are 3-4. Funding issues have been a major distraction and 
football could face the chopping block.  
</P>
<P>
 "I realize and understand my environment and everything that comes with it," 
he said, diplomatically. "I'm making do and so is everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Making hay, too. Despite O'Laughlin's new mailing address, dozens of football 
scouts found him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that he was recruited by (Illinois) tells you that he's pretty 
good," said one NFL scout as he watched O'Laughlin practice. "But if I'm out 
here to see him, it means he's a prospect." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin ultimately could receive an invitation to the NFL Scouting Combine, 
scheduled over the winter in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a pretty good shot," said the scout. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin takes the attention with aplomb. He's been shrugging off this sort 
of thing for years, probably because his family wouldn't stand for so much as a 
swig of swagger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was understood that we wouldn't put up with that stuff," Brian O'Laughlin 
said. "We'd shut him down, big time." 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody say big time? When O'Laughlin heard he'd been named an All-American 
by one periodical, he laughed. Before he was sidelined with a shoulder injury, 
O'Laughlin passed for 1,181 yards and nine touchdowns over 6 1/2 games. Not 
bad. Not great. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seems kind of odd, don't you think?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crazed might be more accurate, he said. Last year, O'Laughlin's right shoulder 
suffered a dislocation and torn rotator cuff when he was mauled by a Chico 
tackler. 
</P>
<P>
 His career in jeopardy, he had major surgery Dec. 14 and didn't begin throwing 
until summer camp. For one of the few times in his life, there was an element 
of self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wondered if I was going to be able to throw a ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So did everybody else. He finally was given full medical clearance on July 1. 
Talk about matters picking up in a hurry: O'Laughlin proposed to his 
girlfriend, Kathleen Shannon, the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon, a setter on the Northridge women's volleyball team who also 
transferred from Illinois, knows O'Laughlin better than anyone, and she said 
there are few chinks in his armor. In fact, what gets on her nerves most may 
not be a bad characteristic at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never loses his temper," she said. "He's calm about everything. I'll get 
all over him about something and he says, 'Now, Kathleen, I don't think that's 
any reason to raise your voice.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everyone who's run across O'Laughlin has voiced a gushing testimonial, 
some relating to his athleticism, some to his self-effacing style. 
Hypoglycemics, read on. 
</P>
<P>
 As a high school senior, O'Laughlin squared off in the state basketball 
playoffs against Artesia High and Ed O'Bannon, now at UCLA. Artesia won, but 
O'Laughlin scored 16 points and held O'Bannon to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin played center as a senior in 1989-90, the position occupied the 
season before by Tracy Murray. Minus Murray, who set a slew of state scoring 
records and now plays for the Portland Trail Blazers, Glendora still won the 
Southern Section 4-AA title. 
</P>
<P>
 During football season, O'Laughlin's car broke down before Glendora's 
customary pregame meal. Rules were clear: Miss a team dinner, miss a start. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dean Karnoski could easily have relented. O'Laughlin was the feature 
attraction and was in the process of passing for at least 1,500 yards for the 
third consecutive season. Though he had a legitimate reason for missing the 
dinner, O'Laughlin didn't whine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, he stood on the sideline and cheered the other (quarterback) on," 
Karnoski said. "Then he went in and led us to the promised land." 
</P>
<P>
 To the Southern Section Division II co-championship, one of a zillion 
credentials. He might have been the most-loved and most-resented perfect kid at 
Glendora. He was junior class president, a homecoming king, not to mention 
captain of the football, baseball and basketball teams as a senior. He was, of 
course, on the honor roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the neatest kids I've ever met," said Glendora basketball Coach 
Mike LeDuc. "I respect him. You won't hear anybody say anything bad about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody's All-American is altruistic, even. He stumped vigorously in support 
of the athletics fee referendum that failed last month. He gave speeches to 
student clubs in support of the plan, which wouldn't have gone into effect 
until next year -- by when he'll be long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program doesn't deserve to go down the drain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of thing is why O'Laughlin's mother says he is as loyal as the 
family mutt. Loyalty and togetherness are big in this clan. O'Laughlin's mom, a 
talkative sort who clearly dotes on her youngest son, has been known to turn up 
at Northridge practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loves to watch practice," J.J. said. "She loves it. Scouts are out there 
and she loves to see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Guess again. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Practices) are miserable," she said. "I go out there to see J.J. I take him 
his mail. I need my J.J. fix." 
</P>
<P>
 All this and magnetic too? 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, though the Matadors' homecoming had been ruined in a 30-6 loss to 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, O'Laughlin patiently signed autographs outside the 
team locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're my favorite player," one starry-eyed boy said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin gave the kid a souvenir: A plain white towel used by the 
quarterback during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The towel was not festooned with a skull and crossbones, murderous message or 
other such inflammatory fare. Perfect garb for the unpretentious type. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never wanted people to think of me as cocky," he said. "Maybe my parents 
drilled it into my head. I hated people who were rude to others, who thought 
they were better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to be nice to the equipment people, everybody I run across. No amount 
of success gives me reason to act like that."

MONROE DOCTRINE: RUN NUCCITELLI; FOOTBALL: AMONG AREA'S TOP RUNNERS WITH 1,100 
YARDS, HE SHUNS STARDOM'S NOTORIETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BRESNAHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few minutes early for class, running back extraordinaire Nick Nuccitelli 
plops himself down for what will undoubtedly be an all-too-long lecture on 
money-market mutual funds or straight-line depreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute preparations for class -- asking a fellow student for a pen 
and hoping, no, praying there won't be a pop quiz -- are quickly dropped, 
however. Two people are talking about him in the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 They are wondering where this new kid on the gridiron block came from. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuccitelli's amusement peaks when they turn around and ask him if he knows who 
this Nuccitelli kid is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he answers with a smile. "I haven't seen him." 
</P>
<P>
 Such is life for the 5-foot-9, 175-pound Nuccitelli, who simply hands the ball 
to an official after scoring a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really try to get known," says Nuccitelli who, whether he likes it or 
not, has raised several eyebrows with his recent play at Monroe High. "I never 
wear my jersey (to school) on Friday. I don't need to shine out and have people 
go, 'Oh, there's that (football) guy over there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in part to his last name, which has suffered numerous casualties in 
game programs and box scores, Nuccitelli has managed to keep a reasonably low 
profile. Even the school paper garbled Nuccitelli's name three times in a 
recent article. 
</P>
<P>
 Such trivial mistakes don't matter much to him. There are, after all, 
significantly more important aspects of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Take his grandmother, Frances Nuccitelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick moved out of his parents' home and in with her immediately after his 
grandfather, Joseph, died in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has helped out Grandma in any way possible, mowing the lawn, 
taking her to the hairdresser or simply taking out the trash. "I could write a 
book on what he means to me," Frances Nuccitelli says. "He's a very unusual 
young man and we're lucky God gave him to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked fifth among area City Section running backs with 1,110 yards rushing in 
132 carries, Nuccitelli (pronounced nooch-uh-TELL-e) could walk around Monroe 
with an inflated head. He chooses not to, probably because nobody, himself 
included, predicted he would be where he is now. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuccitelli, a senior, didn't exactly fall out of the cradle with a football in 
his hand. Not only is this is his first year at running back, it's his first 
full year of football. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't play the game until last season, when as a junior, he picked up his 
class schedule and found himself accidentally enrolled for football. A 
conditioning or weightlifting class sounded more like it for the in-shape but 
never in-pads Nuccitelli, but a friend on the team begged him to give football 
a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 He came out for the junior varsity but did not play in the first five games. 
In the sixth, he showed such unusual tenacity on special teams he was promptly 
named starting linebacker. Carrying the ball came later. It took untold begging 
and cajoling before he was finally put in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuccitelli carried the ball once in the season finale against Van Nuys. He ran 
35 yards for a touchdown. Since then, he has been a ball carrier rather than a 
ball chaser. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuccitelli shows off the dings and scars that come with being the star of a 
running-oriented offense. Most memorable is his right pinkie, which splays out 
at an ugly 45-degree angle thanks to a dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I could ever wear a ring on that finger," Nuccitelli says with 
a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Vowing to be the first in his immediate family to attend college, Nuccitelli 
wants to be a mechanical engineer or a marine biologist. A football scholarship 
at Northern Arizona or Lewis and Clark, schools Nuccitelli has had contact 
with, would help accomplish that. 
</P>
<P>
 "In his situation, (a football scholarship) would mean a difference of 
everything in terms of having financial backing," Monroe Coach Fred Cuccia 
says. "As soon as the season's over, videos of him go out and I'll make phone 
calls to schools. I'm sure he'll also be getting some letters from schools 
because of the 286." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be Nuccitelli's 286-yard performance in 23 carries against Poly 
earlier this season, a mark that led to an influx of letters from colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got two more in the mail today," Nuccitelli says proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 An Italian American born and raised in Southern California, Nuccitelli is 
constantly reminded of his roots. If it's not his grandmother trying to 
force-feed him her special pasta (plenty of meatballs, but hold the onions), 
it's his teammates telling him to load up on Italian carbohydrates before each 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nuccitelli is not on the field or in Grandma's kitchen, he hangs out in 
his . . . garage? 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, he can be found tinkering away on the newest family 
automobile -- a race car. His father, Joseph, drives in the Grand American 
series, a step down from NASCAR. After a game against Canoga Park last month, 
the younger Nuccitelli left in a hurry for a race at Mesa Marin track in 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my big thing now," Nuccitelli says. "If it's not football, I'm always 
working on race cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why Monroe running backs coach Rachel Gagliano compares him to . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "A machine," she says. "Give him the ball and he'll run." 
</P>
<P>
 Gagliano, a former scoring machine herself as a kicker for Monroe, likes what 
she sees in Nuccitelli. "He's like a quiet force," Gagliano says. "He doesn't 
say much in practice. He gets done what needs to be done. He's got an aura 
around him and everybody sees him just working so hard, they want to fall in 
behind him." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't tell Nuccitelli that he has an aura. Or, for that matter, that this 
story is in the paper. He'd prefer it that way.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: BARNUM, SPARKS USE TIME WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1994 college football season has delivered the unexpected to USC's Terry 
Barnum and Washington State's Derek Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks, a redshirt junior who rushed for 1,944 yards and 35 touchdowns in 1989 
at Montclair Prep, was bumped from No. 1 to No. 2 at running back on the Cougar 
depth chart and now finds himself rotating with Frank Madu and Kevin Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a rotation back," Sparks said. "But it's something that's working and 
we're winning. So I'm a role back now." 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks has rushed for only 214 yards in eight games for an average of 2.9 
yards a carry. But Washington State (6-2) is in a four-way tie for first place 
in the Pacific 10 Conference along with Arizona, Oregon and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum, a junior who played about five miles north of Sparks at Alemany, has 
moved this season from cornerback to tailback to fullback. But he didn't go in 
cold. He rushed for more than 2,800 yards in three seasons with the Indians, 
including 349 and six touchdowns in one game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, I'm right where I want be," Barnum said. "I wanted to be a starter 
and I wanted to start in the backfield." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5-feet-10, 180 pounds last spring, Barnum had average size for a tailback 
and would have been small for a fullback.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he was anticipating the second position change, because he spent the 
summer in the weight room and bulked up to 200 pounds. Still, Barnum blocks for 
a bigger man. Tailback Shawn Walters is 6-0, 225. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was going to be a necessity, but I really surprised myself," he 
said. "I didn't think I could carry this much weight. But I put it on as muscle 
mass. Now they want 10 more." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum, like Sparks, is a role player. In six games, Barnum has rushed only 
four times, gaining five yards. But he has proved to be a reliable receiver, 
with 20 receptions (third on the team) for 150 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The game: Though favored, Washington State (6-2, 4-1) faces tall odds this 
Saturday against USC when history is taken into consideration: The Trojans are 
45-5-4 against the Cougars, and Washington State has never beaten USC and UCLA 
in the same season. The Cougars defeated UCLA, 21-0, on Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys realize it's a real important game," Sparks said.  
</P>
<P>
 "A better part of our team is from Northern California and Southern 
California. They're aware of (USC's history). They know about the Heisman 
Trophy and O.J. (Simpson) and the tradition. But those guys are done; they're 
not suiting up Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum and the Trojans have the unenviable task of going into Pullman, Wash., 
and facing a defense that ranks first in points allowed (10.4 per game) and 
first against the run (58 yards per game) in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which had a bye last week, looks better when comparing the scores against 
California. The Trojans beat the Bears, 61-0, two weeks ago; the Cougars beat 
Cal, 26-23, last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an error on our part to look at that as an indication of who's 
better," Barnum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal is a very good football team and they didn't get any breaks against us. 
We'll have to play a very good game and not make any mistakes to beat 
Washington State. We can't give them anything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Sparks: Perhaps one reason for Sparks' low numbers is his rehabilitation. 
He redshirted during the 1993 season while recovering from surgery in both 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "My running is improving each week," Sparks said. "But I'm still not back to 
the old 'D.' I gotta be patient with myself. As long as I can do something 
positive. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 On that note, Sparks carried only four times against Cal, but one was a 
seven-yard touchdown run that capped a 91-yard drive. He picked up a first down 
on one of his other carries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add USC: Senior linebacker Errol Small (Notre Dame) has made game-saving plays 
in two recent games. Midway through the fourth quarter at Oregon State, Small 
came across the field to tackle quarterback Tim Alexander at the Trojan 14 
after a 31-yard gain. Alexander suffered a broken collarbone on the play. USC 
won, 27-19. At Stanford, Small intercepted a Steve Stenstrom pass at the Trojan 
36 with 4 minutes 7 seconds left and USC leading, 20-13. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country: Notre Dame sophomore Cindy Daws (Louisville) has led the 
women's soccer team to the nation's No. 1 ranking. It marks the first time 
since 1990 that a team other than eight-time defending NCAA champion North 
Carolina was ranked first. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the Fighting Irish ended North Carolina's record 92-match 
winning streak. Daws, an All-American midfielder as a freshman, is second on 
the team with 36 points (11 goals, 14 assists). Notre Dame is 17-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford sophomore midfielder Alyze Lowen (Harvard-Westlake), a part-time 
starter last season, is out for the season with a knee injury. The Cardinal 
(15-1-1) is ranked fifth.

THE COLLEGES / FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ; MOORPARK'S BITTNER CAN CITE NEARLY 100 
REASONS TO BE HAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the question many football coaches hate to answer for fear of offending 
some or neglecting others, so Jim Bittner paused briefly before taking the 
diplomatic road. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is something the Moorpark College coach knows, it is how to build 
winning teams and keep his feet planted firmly on the ground instead of lodged 
in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he said, there have been many outstanding players at Moorpark since he 
took over the program in 1979, but it would be unfair to call one the best and 
ignore the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have said Fred Bradley, for example, the marvelous tailback who 
rushed for 3,212 yards in two seasons. Or quarterback Ken Lutz, who holds the 
school career passing record with 3,194 yards. Or perhaps Jamal Anderson, the 
Atlanta Falcon running back who had a distinguished career at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bittner opted for an uncompromising response to the question regarding 
great moments of his coaching career.  
</P>
<P>
 "The day we opened the stadium," Bittner said. "It was a dream for us to have 
a stadium. We did all kinds of things (fund-raisers) to build it and it took a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 10 seasons after Griffin Stadium officially opened, Bittner stands to 
reach a milestone in the place he envisioned. A victory Saturday night against 
Hancock will give Bittner 100 with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Western State Conference game also will have North Division championship 
implications for Moorpark (5-2, 5-1 in conference play) and Hancock (5-2, 4-2). 
Both are 2-0 in the division with three games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a difficult game for the Raiders, the two-time defending North 
champions who have struggled offensively the past few weeks. They depend on an 
impenetrable defense and seem to score just enough points to win despite 
mistakes made by the offense in virtually every game. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 21-14 victory over Glendale last week, for instance, Moorpark was 
penalized six times for illegal procedure and once for holding. The week 
before, in a 26-20 victory over Pierce, the Raider offense was penalized nine 
times. One game before that, in a 28-14 loss to Valley, it was eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been frustrating," Bittner said. "I've never had a team that has gone 
through this phase. It's one thing after another on offense. But somehow we've 
found a way to win and overcome the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Bittner, 59, has been doing that masterfully after rescuing a program that had 
only two winning seasons in 11 before he became head coach. His first few years 
were tough, with overmatched teams that won sparingly, but the Raiders turned 
the corner in 1985 when Griffin Stadium was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1984, when they moved to their partially completed stadium, the nomadic 
Raiders played home games at several high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on a September afternoon Bittner remembers well, the Raiders dedicated 
their new facility with a bang. Bittner decided to open that 1985 nonconference 
game against Harbor with a trick play designed to honor Paul E. Griffin Jr., 
the land developer who donated $40,000 for the stadium project. Much to 
Bittner's surprise, it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play from scrimmage, wide receiver Paul Davis connected with 
flanker Dan Russell on a 61-yard touchdown pass play that got the Raiders 
rolling on their way to a 31-3 victory. Moorpark won seven more games that 
season and played in its first bowl game, a 27-14 loss to Pierce in the Brahma 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a gimmick," said Bittner, who has taken his teams to eight bowl 
games. "Harbor always seemed to try something like that on us so we wanted to 
turn the table on them a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Bittner said the stadium gave his program more credibility. It was the first 
boost. Others, like attracting players from the San Fernando Valley when Pierce 
dropped its program in 1986 and 1987, and the construction of the Simi Valley 
Freeway also were instrumental. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is that stabilizing force called continuity. All prosperous 
teams have it. The Raiders, with four assistant coaches with six or more 
seasons in the program, are among the most fortunate in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one guy can coach a football team by himself," Bittner said. "At the 
junior college level, it's very hard to keep (assistant) coaches. I've been 
able to keep a solid staff and that has had a great impact on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a younger coach, I had a lot of trouble delegating duties. But in 
football, you have to do that. There are too many responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Bittner has handled them superbly. But there were times, before five 
consecutive nine-victory seasons from 1988 through 1992 and the 8-3 record last 
year, when he heard the inimical murmur of discontented fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had faith in my program," Bittner said. "I'm an optimist. Certainly, 
there were people who had doubts (in the beginning). It looked like some 
problems might not have answers." 
</P>
<P>
 They did, however, and Bittner found them. His 100th victory, whether it comes 
Saturday night in his favorite stadium or elsewhere later, will be proof 
enough.

DIGEST: JACOBSON WILL PLAY FOR NAVY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Blake Jacobson, a 6-foot-8 center at Crescenta Valley High, has accepted an 
appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., where he will 
play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson also took recruiting trips to the Air Force Academy and the U.S. 
Military Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (a military academy) can offer what no other school can offer," 
Jacobson said. "At a normal school you go four years and you play basketball 
and you are not even guaranteed a degree. At an academy, you get a great 
education and they pretty much guarantee you a degree, because they work with 
you so much. And then you have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson averaged 8.9 points and 10.0 rebounds last year for the Falcons, who 
were the Southern Section Division I-AA runners-up. JEFF FLETCHER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Antonio Arce of Palmdale High won his second consecutive individual title in 
leading the Falcons to their third consecutive championship in the Golden 
League cross-country finals on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, the runner-up in the 3,200 meters in the State track and field 
championships in June, timed a course record 15 minutes 49 seconds over three 
miles at Barrel Springs Hill in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce eclipsed his course best of 16:08 set earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Mario Arce, Antonio's brother, finished second in 16:47 as Palmdale 
placed five runners among the top six finishers for a 18-point total. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgecrest Burroughs was second with 68, followed by Littlerock with 91. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three teams automatically qualified for the Southern Section 
preliminaries on Nov. 12. So did the top three individuals among the top six 
finishers who are not on a qualifying team. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill, led by individual winner Danielle Day, won its fourth consecutive 
girls' title. 
</P>
<P>

GIRLS' POLE VAULT MAY BE SCORING EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Interscholastic Federation's State Executive Committee has 
recommended that the girls' pole vault be contested as a scoring event at the 
league, section and State championship level in the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation was made by the CIF's federal council last week. A final 
vote will be taken at a council meeting Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Although girls have participated in the pole vault during the past two 
seasons, the results did not count in team scoring.

IN CIRCULATION; DOZENS OF MAGAZINES -- INCLUDING ORANGE COUNTY'S LAVA -- ARE 
HOPING TO MAKE A MATCH WITH THE YOUNG GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH GLAZNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Content is something Michael McCullough takes for granted. As editor of the 
new Costa Mesa-based Lava magazine, he admits, "We never know which way we're 
gonna flow." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the contents of Lava's first few issues: a fashion spread of 
underwear and clogs; a review of some foreign liqueur affectionately called 
"Sammy" and critical reviews of "Speed Racer the Movie," a boxing nun toy and 
Gumby watches. The images float in a draft of white space, easily digestible by 
a generation that grew up biting the heads off their Flintstones chewables. 
</P>
<P>
 A lava lamp seemed the perfect iconoclastic symbol to launch this publication, 
aimed at the twentysomething generation, says McCullough. "It's unpredictable, 
it's kinda free-flowing, and all that kinda artsy stuff that goes along with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The door of his office is actually a bamboo curtain, through which bounds -- 
like an overzealous secretary -- a friendly yellow dog. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lobby, a sculptural fountain in the likeness of a volcano flows into a 
stagnant pond where some black fish live. 
</P>
<P>
 Lava is one of dozens of new magazines by and for the 40 million people 
between 18 and 30 years of age, who spend $125 billion a year on goods and 
services, say market researchers. It offers the standard fare -- alternative 
music, art, movies, food, fashion -- "stuff that's stylized and nice-looking. 
We want to be a real visual publication," says McCullough, who at 32, narrowly 
escaped being labeled part of this nebulous Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
 At his austere workstation, McCullough explains that he needs to capture the 
attention of an MTV youth used to being bombarded by overlapping images. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine is the pet project of Jack Martinez, 29, and Dan Flecky, 42, two 
surf dudes who started Black Flys Eyewear, sunglasses for the surf/skate/snow 
industry, in 1990. The wildly successful Fly Industries made it possible to 
launch the magazine, which is distributed mostly in Orange and L.A. counties' 
coffeehouses, video stores, art galleries and select stores, but also travels 
to Japan and Europe as a stowaway in Black Flys shipping crates. It has a 
circulation of 30,000 and a staff of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Such impressive backing is not typical of other youth publications operating 
on skeletal budgets while trying to attract big advertising dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Other titles include Might and bOING bOING from San Francisco, Hypno and 
Axcess from San Diego, Pure from Chicago, Slacker from New York, and others -- 
Warp, Baby Sue, The Nose and Ben Is Dead -- with unconventional mastheads that 
leave marketers scratching their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes them distinct is their averseness to distinction, their disgust at 
being marketed to by demographers trying to stuff this segment of society into 
a tangible niche. Say the three under-25-year-old editors of Might, "We're sick 
of everything that's aimed at us." 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the 'Generation X' label was created, a lot of magazines have been 
grouped into that category. But the best are those with an independent spirit 
not marketed for mass consumption," says Julie Jewels, 25, editor-in-chief of 
Project X, a magazine in New York City that chronicles underground culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewels began Project X when she was 19, as a 1,000 circulation, 16-page club 
handout. Two years ago, it went to a 30,000 national distribution. She admits 
there were no demographic studies conducted in the launching of Project X. 
</P>
<P>
 "We broke every publishing rule," says Jewels. "Though a lot of magazines are 
repositioning themselves in the marketplace to cater to (youth), this was just 
a side project we were doing. We were all involved in the club scene at the 
time, and we wanted a magazine to document what was happening." 
</P>
<P>
 The name Project X is not about a generation, but a reference to the secret 
Russian KGB files in a James Bond movie. "Not for everyone's eyes," says 
Jewels, adding the allusion could be lost on young people coming of age in a 
post Iron Curtain world. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely a more fun-oriented generation," says Tony Fellow, a 
professor of communications at Cal State Fullerton who teaches magazine 
writing. "They're not interested in politics at all . In the '60s, we went out 
and marched ." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he could not count an Abbie Hoffman among them, Fellow maintains those 
in the current youth culture are more creatively resourceful than their 
predecessors.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're very entrepreneurial," he says. "They believe they're probably not 
going to have the positions we did, because technology is taking over. So they 
better go out and make their own opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's been called 'slacker' at one time of their life," says Rex 
Edhlund, whose title is "the man of ultimate editorial responsibility" at Hypno 
magazine. "We're just getting a feel for the world. There's another generation 
of slackers coming up right behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Edhlund, 30, says Hypno aims to be "the best pop cultural guide to the planet. 
This is the age of oversaturation. Everything's been done -- we are trying to 
do it better." 
</P>
<P>
 It has a circulation of 55,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hypno wants to be politically aware. Along with reviews of music, art, fashion 
and other fare, it offers "The Activator Pages," a regular feature developed in 
conjunction with the national youth activist campaign Lead . . . or Leave, 
which works to educate and motivate young people on political issues. Plus, 
Hypno is printed entirely with soy ink on recycled paper, so it is absolutely 
politically correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this magazine will last forever," says Edhlund. "We'll grow with our 
readers." 
</P>
<P>
 bOING bOING is "Pop culture for the techno-savvy," says editor Carla Sinclair, 
who started the publication with her husband, Mark Frauenfelder, now an editor 
at Wired. "We cover the fringes of pop culture, those into computers and the 
digital era. We look at the fun side of technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Sinclair is tapping a market niche within a market niche -- twentysomethings 
who grew up with the computer and recognize its place in their future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their vision of the world is much smaller," says Sinclair, citing Marshall 
McLuhan's prophecy that computers would shrink the world to a global village. 
bOING bOING offers such features as "The Ignorant Human's Guide to the 
Internet" and "Neurotica," for the technologically neurotic. 
</P>
<P>
 "These magazines present a non-linear organization of articles and pages, and 
a style that replicates the way information comes through," says Carl Burrowes, 
associate professor of communications at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that much is made of the malaise of the MTV Generation, but much 
of what is passed off as characteristic of it could be said of earlier 
generations. I think of Hemingway, who was a part of the so-called Lost 
Generation. After the turn of the century, artists and writers suffered from a 
general inertia, a loss of direction. They lacked the certainty of the previous 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tension between representing the values of a generation and 
succeeding commercially and being able to survive," Burrowes asserts. "To the 
extent that a publication can do that, it risks rejection." 
</P>
<P>
 To his twentysomething students, Burrowes ascribes certain kinds of 
psychographic properties: a listlessness, lack of material drive, a 
self-conscious lack of flash. "The counterpoint to 'yuppie' is 'grunge,' " he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike the '60s, there have been few defining moments that have helped to 
shape the current, thus their values were acquired somewhat passively. There's 
a sense of resignation, a need to exit the rat race, and they're questioning 
the automatic course set for them. Their magazines are going to reflect this."  
</P>
<P>
 Consider the far-reaching contents of Might magazine's third issue: A 
citizen's guide to what happens if you don't pay your taxes; a consumer plan 
detailing the financial liability of unprotected intercourse; a glossary of 
bugs you can eat, and a synopsis of religions and pseudo-religions, including 
"weird quirks," celebrities involved and costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The cover reads: "Inside: All Your Questions Answered."

LATE, LATE SHOW; AT THE NEW AFTER-HOURS CLUBS, THE PARTY LASTS UNTIL LONG AFTER 
SUNRISE. BUT POLICE SAY SOME CLUB-GOERS KEEP THE BEAT WITH THE HELP OF DRUGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS ROMERO, LOS ANGELES TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only last year, the hours between bar closings and Sunday services in L.A. 
belonged to dance-till-you-drop "ravers." It was a new generation's late-night 
dance-party scene, envied by club-goers throughout the world and hyped in 
newspapers, newsmagazines and TV tabloid shows. Where else could thousands 
party in an amusement park till 5 a.m.? 
</P>
<P>
 But gangs, thugs and new drugs invaded all-night raves, scene watchers say. So 
a lot of the young people packed up and went back to the 'burbs. "I feel like 
I'm a minority now," says one raver-in-retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left of L.A.'s rave scene are about a dozen after-hours joints from 
Santa Monica to Downtown, serving several hundred die-hards. Some look classy, 
others look like drug dens, most cater to the 18-and-up crowd. Some rave 
veterans say after-hours clubs are too extreme even for them. "Everyone's on 
speed, violent and packing (guns)," says former rave organizer Lou Rittenhouse. 
"I don't go out anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "A majority of the places cater to young (people)," says Los Angeles Police 
Sgt. Marty Cotwright. "There's drugs and all kinds of other activities." 
</P>
<P>
 At Abyss, a dark-and-deep club in the rough-and-tumble Rampart district, some 
young club-goers make the bathroom their first stop. Scoring and snorting speed 
is their mission, say some club-goers. "The more you do," says 23-year-old 
Cindi (not her real name), "the more you stay up, the more you dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Saturday night starts happening at 1 a.m. Sunday with a $7 cover charge 
and a pat-down search in the shadowy storefront. Young women, backpacks in tow, 
enter the bathroom two at a time. Then it's on to the dance floor, where two 
black rooms rock to clockwork beats. "Concentrate/On the music," the track says 
in a hypnotizing loop. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody appears to be getting sleepy. Some are peaking on speed 
("tweaking," they call it), and soon they'll be coming down ("sketching"). When 
the night ends at 10 in the morning, they can always aim for Sketchpad, a 
Sunday after- after-hours dance club down the street. It's known to go as late 
as 3 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Abyss co-owner Louis Rincon acknowledges that drugs are used in his club, but 
he says he's trying the best he can. "We've been weeding them out," he says. 
"We catch people doing drugs and it's 86 -- they're out." 
</P>
<P>
 A few other spots are also trying to distance themselves from the drug 
culture. Does Your Mama Know, a 21-and-up affair on Sunset Boulevard, has a 
dress code, a hefty cover charge ($10) and a bar that opens at 6 a.m. The 
result is a "mature and positive" crowd, says resident DJ Tony Largo. "We 
constantly have to have our hands on the pulse," he says, "because if we don't, 
it could turn into a tweaker club in the matter of a week or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters at Hollywood's Public Space disallow dancing, showcase mellow music 
and close down at a conservative 4 a.m. It keeps the speeders at bay, they say. 
"We don't have a real tweaking crowd," one Public Space promoter says. 
</P>
<P>
 Abyss, housed in a funky hotel circa 1912, usually runs midnight to 10 a.m. on 
weekends and caters to those 18 and older. It's often open midnight to 7 a.m. 
Sunday through Thursday. Lately, though, the schedule has been off and on. The 
police recently shut the club down, seized sound equipment and cited owners for 
a lack of a dance hall permit. "There's been dancing and all other forms of 
entertainment, and they don't have proper permits," says Cotwright, who 
supervises area vice officers. 
</P>
<P>
 When informed this week that Abyss is open again, Cotwright said: "I guess 
we'll have to go back in there then." 
</P>
<P>
 Abyss owners say they have most of the needed permits except for the 
hard-to-get dance hall permit. "We're trying to do things the right way," Abyss 
co-owner Lee Ballenger says. Then he echoes partner Rincon: "We try to deter 
drugs as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 But club-goers John, 18, and Tina, 21 (not their real names), say they 
regularly sell speed there at $20 a pop. On a recent morning, young people line 
up for the white stuff. John says "Do it fast and don't get caught" is his 
motto. The 18-year-old says he can clear $400 in profit on a good night at some 
after-hours clubs. "It's a crazy life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed (formally methamphetamine, usually found in crystal form locally) has 
extended the hours of what started as a dance-till-dawn craze. The after-hours 
scene sometimes goes 24 hours straight, much longer than most raves. And the 
10- to 12-hour effects of speed can last much longer than rave drugs LSD and 
its psychedelic cousin MDMA (known as "ecstasy"). Those who take speed at 
after-hours clubs don't seem to drink alcohol, and most after-hours spots don't 
serve it. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA drug expert Ronald K. Siegel says the cocaine-like speed can make people 
irritable, paranoid and violent. "We can dispute the relationship between any 
drug and violent behavior," he says. "The one exception is methamphetamine." 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike LSD and MDMA, it's addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 Police confirm that speed costs $20 and up for one-sixteenth of a gram (called 
a "teen-ager" on the streets). It's made in labs around Southern California, 
much of it in San Diego, some in the desert, some in roving motor homes, says 
LAPD narcotics Detective Frank Lyga. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorcycle gangs distribute speed, Lyga says. Young people sell it in the 
clubs. People caught using it could spend a year in county lock-up. Yet the 
after-hours demand for speed evades police so far. "We don't enforce in a lot 
of after-hours clubs," Lyga says. "We don't have the manpower really." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, not everyone who parties till dawn is on speed. But Cohry Osborne, a 
night-life writer for L.A.'s Urb magazine, says: "It is a vital part of the 
underground." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always that way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During L.A. ravers' Summer of Love -- 1991 -- the drugs of choice, for those 
who were doing them, were LSD, MDMA and laughing gas. Illicit drugs -- 
particularly laughing gas -- contributed to a few deaths, but some ravers 
remember the time fondly. "Here I was trying to break away from my mother's 
generation," says a former raver who calls herself Miss Kitty. "I really feel 
happy that I was part of the summer of '91." 
</P>
<P>
 People barely past their teens put on all-night dance parties with mocking 
cartoon themes. (Mickey Mouse, whose face appeared on sheets of LSD, was a 
popular icon.) Several thousand teens and twentysomethings found an underground 
and often illegal play land in amusement parks, airport hangars and warehouses. 
After-hours clubs such as Flammable Liquid kept them dancing into the daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. scene got press from here to Europe. Some media trumpeted the trend 
as a new generation's counterculture. Meanwhile, a Belgian one-hit wonder group 
paid homage to the Southern California scene by calling itself L.A. Style. Gays 
and suburbanites, homeboys and hipsters shared the same dance space, and the 
buzzword was unity . Even competing rave promoters banded together to create a 
legal defense fund for those times when their events were shut down, one 
promoter says. But the crowd grew, and with it came gang types, scene-watchers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically," says Urb's Osborne, "it was an undesirable crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 The downfall may have been inevitable. Massive crowds, drug overdoses and 
crime hurt the rave scene in Manchester, England, in the late '80s. "It's very 
similar to what happened in England," says Brit Steve Levy, a record company 
owner who helped bring raves to Los Angeles. "It got huge and commercial, and 
then it went back into the much smaller clubs, the underground clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Many point to Grape Ape 3, held in September, 1993, as a turning point for the 
scene in Southern California. The Orange County rave got out of control, 
witnesses say. Fights broke out, a security guard had a gun pointed at his 
head, and a van was set afire. Police shut it down sometime after 3 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw the kids burning the car," says Gary Richards, a record company 
executive, "I knew the scene was done." Only nine months earlier, Richards 
helped put together America's largest rave, which pulled in 17,254 paying 
customers at Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the same time, "there were so many people who were like, 'Acid isn't 
doing it for me, I gotta stay up longer,' " one former raver recalls. They 
started doing speed, "then they started to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Other club-goers trace the demise of raves to the switch, by some, from MDMA 
to the more nerve-racking speed. "It used to be you came to dance and there 
happened to be drugs," says one club-goer. "Now you come for drugs and there 
happens to be music." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say after-hours clubs are better off without trendies who went to 
raves. The emergence of after-hours clubs "got rid of the people that follow 
what's hot and what's not," says a Sketchpad DJ. "They said these raves are 
not. And the people who were there for the music, they stayed." 
</P>
<P>
 The rave phenomenon is still alive in Orlando, Fla., and other mid-size 
cities. Europe is still home to a few mega-raves, too, although they're now 
called "one-offs" and "dos." 
</P>

 On a Sunday morning at Abyss, sexy women in boots and good-looking guys in 
polo shirts pump their arms under a street sign that says, "NO STOPPING." Off 
to the side, a dingy room nurses come-down sketchers with a flea-market 
mishmash of couches, chairs and tables. A dozen people crash, feet up, under a 
ceiling fan that's missing a blade and doesn't spin. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindi, 23, says she's tweaking. She's going so fast she can't dance, she says. 
"My mind's going so fast, the words don't come right -- I mean come out right," 
she says. "See what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 A man in an orange armchair a few feet away leans over a round dining table. 
"Watch that guy," a bystander says, "He's about to do a line!" The guy looks 
up, forewarned, but leans down and snorts anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindi talks the night away in that same orange chair. On weekends she likes to 
stick a straw in her little plastic bag and sniff a "bump" of speed, she says. 
(When the Northridge quake hit at 4:31 a.m. Jan. 17, she was just coming home 
-- and coming down off speed, she says. "I was sketchin' so hard," she 
recalls.) 
</P>
<P>
 The sun invades with an unwelcome brilliance. "If we didn't have the scene," 
Cindi says, "where would we be?"

THE SPRING COLLECTION / NEW YORK; CALIFORNIA DREAMIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventh Avenue's idea of a man-killer is a stiletto-heeled amazon in a bikini 
and a bathrobe who waves her cigarette and walks that walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like any cinema vixen you know? See if this helps: At Isaac Mizrahi's 
show Tuesday, an electronic ticker tape warned the audience to "Fasten Your 
Seat Belts . . . It's Going to Be a Bumpy Night." 
</P>
<P>
 And should anyone miss the reference to Bette Davis' saucy prediction in "All 
About Eve," Mizrahi named outfits for Hollywood divas Barbara Stanwyck, 
Claudette Colbert, Ingrid Bergman, Marlene Dietrich and Betty Grable. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not the only one captivated by '40s film imagery. In one of those group 
impulses that cynics love to cite as evidence of a sinister fashion conspiracy, 
every designer from Marc Jacobs to Geoffrey Beene has paid homage in their 
spring '95 collections this week to cinema glamour. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend dovetails nicely with the current nostalgia for all things '70s -- 
which, you may or may not recall, was also a time of a '40s revival. Why 
another one? Why not? There's a cheerful lady-likeness to many of the 
designers' lines, which hit home when a model at the Mizrahi show strode down 
the runway wearing a demure, white lace bra underneath a crisp, sheer white 
blouse. It looked so . . . new. As did Donna Karan's Sunday-go-to-church rayon 
dresses for her DKNY line. 
</P>
<P>
 Retro is a tricky thing, though. What saves it from looking like costume 
design is the execution. Richard Tyler's suits for Anne Klein, for example, 
won't be mistaken for vintage -- the geometric prints, weaves and textures 
could have been made only with today's technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will anything from Todd Oldham's "When Worlds Collide" collection. His 
seamed and piped cowgirl jackets with cabbage rose trim don't look like any 
cowgirl this side of a Hollywood rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 What also makes this particular backward-glancing trend look modern is a 
healthy dose of irreverence. With that in mind, the envelope, please: 
</P>
<P>
 Best Editing: Christian Francis Roth. His girlish collection was filled with 
charmingly appliqued jackets in colors favored by Gen Xers -- orange, yellow, 
green -- in childlike tableaux. Goofy flowers, lollipops, little duckies. He 
never digressed from his pre-pubescent vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Score: Nicole Miller opened her Halloween night show with "Monster Mash," 
followed by "I Put a Spell On You." Favorite single at the shows is "Girl, 
You'll Be a Woman Soon." The younger designers play the latest remake. Everyone 
else plays the Neil Diamond version. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Screenplay: The program at Badgley Mischka was in the form of a script. 
Let's hope the heroine has a place to wear those drop-dead beaded corsets. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Costume: Carolina Herrera's evening gowns gave new meaning to a tired but 
useful Hollywood phrase: "Over the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Best Actress: Model Tyra Banks is Jessica Rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Supporting Actress: At Todd Oldham's show on Tuesday night, the glamorous 
Nadja Auermann wore a sequined skirt with a T-shirt that proclaimed "Nadja." 
Just in case we didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Short Subject: Even though most skirts and dresses settled around the 
bottom of the knee, designers have not ruled out the mini as an option. The 
winner in this category? Oldham's six-inch swath of silvery metal mesh knotted 
sarong-style and perhaps destined to be worn by celebrity fans in the audience, 
like, say, Susan Sarandon or Rosie O'Donnell. On second thought. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Best Set Design: How to top the backstage silhouettes Mizrahi showed the 
audience through a scrim last time? Show everything up front. The first model 
at the show stood before an oversize mirror as dressers helped her on with her 
clothes. The next scene was a powder room, which was way more glamorous than 
anything the models see backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Director: Tracy Reese, whose clothes should have as much attitude as her 
models did. Acting out mini-scenarios with four handsome men, these gorgeous 
divas could give RuPaul a few lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Picture: See Monday's Life & Style.

BY DESIGN; CLOAK ENCOUNTERS; PARTY CLOTHES ARE TAKING WRAP FOR VERSATILE 
COVER-UPS THAT DRAPE DRAMATICALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Evening wear will be under wraps for the holiday season's upcoming round of 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 From sheer, fly-away chiffon shawls to faux mink stoles, wraps of all kinds 
are among the more versatile ways to top off party clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a coat, wraps don't cover up an outfit -- they complement it. Their 
unstructured shapes allow them to adapt to everything from cocktail suits to 
ball gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Often nothing more than a rectangular piece of material, wraps can be wound 
around the body in a myriad styles. They can be flung dramatically over one 
shoulder or draped simply around the neck so the ends flow down the back. They 
can tie around the shoulders or hips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evening wraps are very important this year. They're part of the new glamour," 
says Georgette Rubin, creative director and co-owner of Lillie Rubin in South 
Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. "They're popular because bare dresses are in." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Lillie Rubin's wraps for the holidays are fluffy marabou stoles in 
black, white or pastel hues ($190), a black faux beaver cape with a rhinestone 
clip closure ($185) and assorted chiffon scarves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chiffon scarves are large and sheer, so you can just layer them over any 
dress," Rubin says. "It's part of the (see-through) lingerie look." 
</P>
<P>
 Wraps are not for the fashion timid. Wearing one well requires a bit of 
fashion daring. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a sense of style to be able to just fling the wrap around 
your shoulders," Rubin says. "You have to throw caution to the wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Wraps range in style from the simple to the dramatic. Some have beaded accents 
all over; some have just a fringed border, and some are a plain swatch of 
material. A few have only a brushed gold ornament dangling from one of the four 
corners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most are very minimal this season," says Ramin Hadjipour, manager of Devon 
Becke in Fashion Island Newport Beach. "Often there will be just a single 
ornament versus overall glitz." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more understated wraps is Tadashi's simple black Lycra shawl with 
fringe around the edges ($118), available at Devon Becke in Fashion Island and 
Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lycra fabric drapes beautifully," Hadjipour says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrap fabrics run the gamut from lightweight sheer chiffons to the penne 
velvets and heavier knits used by Tadashi. 
</P>
<P>
 For dramatic entrances, there's A.J. Bari's black velvet wrap with a taffeta 
ruffle around the edges ($190) that can adorn the neck like a collar; a 
sleeveless black velvet cape by A.J. Bari with a satin hood ($390), and a black 
velvet shawl with gold tassel fringe by Tadashi ($118), all at Devon Becke. 
</P>
<P>
 "A wrap is more stylish and practical than a coat. You can still sit down and 
have dinner in a wrap, whereas a coat is rather copious," Hadjipour says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wraps also allow the wearer more creativity than coats. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can give a dress a totally different illusion depending on how you wear 
your wrap," Hadjipour says. "You can put the knot on the shoulder or in front, 
or you can accessorize a wrap with a brooch." 
</P>
<P>
 Wraps can change the entire look of an outfit, dressing up a plain suit or 
dress so that it can go from day to night. Ames carries elaborately beaded 
shawl collars that add sparkle to any garment. One comes in black silk with 
brushed matte gold beading, while another has jet beads sprinkled on sheer 
black silk (about $200-$250). 
</P>
<P>
 "They dress up the plainest of outfits," says Lainey Presson, manager of Ames 
in Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Other wrap styles at Ames include a black velvet stole ($58), tea-length black 
velvet cape ($148) and a crocheted black shawl with jet beads that seems to 
envelop the wearer in a sparkling net ($170). 
</P>
<P>
 "Wraps are good for keeping warm, but some people just wear them for coverage" 
when they don't want to bare too much skin, Presson says. "The chiffon ones are 
more decorative. They're like a security blanket." 
</P>
<P>
 Wraps can be worn day or night. Among the fashion-forward offerings at Mineral 
and Anastasia in Fashion Island are wraps of brushed cotton, faux fur and 
cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mixing textures is the story this season," says Ami Gharavi, owner of Mineral 
and Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
 A wrap such as Amy Chang's imitation mink stole ($275) can be paired with 
black leather or lace or the season's hot shiny metallics. Other textures 
include Russell Bennett's bolero-style wrap of ultra-soft wool with black 
feather trim ($469), which makes an excellent cover-up for a lace slip dress, 
and Myrene de Premonville's pure cashmere cape ($589) -- a perfect foil to a 
silver metallic miniskirt and vest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wraps are cozier than jackets," Gharavi says. "They feel better, lighter, and 
they go over everything."

BY DESIGN; PICTURE PERFECT; TIRED OF BAD PHOTOS? DIP YOUR CHIN AND HAVE A GOOD 
TIME -- BUT NOT TOO GOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a recent high-society gala, two men were about to be photographed. One 
quickly removed his glasses, explaining: "This is the real me." The other kept 
his spectacles on.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither will regret his choice, says Alan Berliner, the Los Angeles 
photographer who took the picture. He gives both men top marks for making 
themselves comfortable, exuding confidence and looking like happy campers, all 
essential to taking a great picture during the busy party season. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts agree that men tend to have fewer photo phobias than women. "But when 
they're bad, they're really bad," says Charles Bush, whose celebrity shots 
appear on magazine and book covers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore, however, is a polished pro. Photographed recently at 
UCLA with a flock of corporate chiefs, he knew what to do, Bush says. Aware of 
his most flattering side and body position, Gore "got into a position he had 
experience in and he didn't move around a lot. He stayed warm and friendly to 
the camera." 
</P>
<P>
 Some call that "romancing the camera," an art perfected by Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis as well as Princess Diana, who never takes a bad picture, says Anne 
Crawford, fashion director of Town & Country magazine. Di, it seems, has 
discovered her best angle. "In every picture, her chin is down and her eyes are 
up," Crawford says. 
</P>
<P>
 The chin dip is an excellent trick for a lot of women, but it can backfire. 
"Be careful to keep good posture. You don't want to get your chin down too 
far," cautions Crawford, who suggests working out photo hang-ups in private, in 
front of a video camera. "Set it up on a tripod. Talk to it, carry on a 
conversation with it."  
</P>
<P>
 Berliner suggests practicing in front of a mirror to find the best side, smile 
and stance that lurks in us all. A quarter turn of the body, for example, 
prevents the lens from accentuating the hips and shoulders, he says. Turning 
too far, however, may highlight profile flaws, such as "a little excess under 
the chin or a bump on your nose." Dropping the chin and lining up the eyes with 
the camera can downplay minor defects. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, look like you're having a good time, the experts say. But not too 
good: "An excessive smile brings up every line and gives you less eyes," 
Berliner explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Patricia Kennedy, former model and frequently photographed member of 
the Joffrey Ballet's executive committee, insists that "a terrific smile is a 
woman's greatest asset." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not the only one. "You don't look good by accident," adds Kennedy, 
who says she can get ready in one hour -- despite a detailed agenda. It 
includes spritzing her face with Evian water before applying foundation -- with 
a sponge -- followed by powder, to achieve the matte finish all photographers 
recommend. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy sticks to classic clothing shapes. And she strongly recommends 
last-minute revisions to prevent photo-album atrocities. "If the dress doesn't 
feel right, don't wear it. If the makeup doesn't look like you, take it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Very light makeup is always a mistake, the photographers say. "It's like 
shooting into a bin of flour," Berliner says. "You get a white face and red 
lips. It's not flattering."  
</P>
<P>
 And neither is a worried face. "If people are afraid of the camera, they 
tighten up," Bush says. "Fear is an adversary for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, remember to put your shoulders back and exhale, says 
Crawford, sounding like everyone's mother. "Holding your breath is one thing 
that kills a photo. You can see the stress. And you shouldn't be clutching 
anything to your chest -- unless, of course, it's an Oscar."

 The Carousel of Hope ball, dears, is one party where you don't want to be 
caught in a plain little cocktail dress and Grandma's graduated pearls. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Barbara Davis, chairwoman of Friday night's fund-raiser for 
diabetes charities, and her daughters Nancy, Dana and Patty didn't 
disappoint.Their full-skirted "Age of Innocence" gowns (Nancy's with a bustle) 
were made to order by Vera Wang, better known as a bridal-gown designer. 
Barbara's satin frock with re-embroidered lace, crystal and silver beads was 
the latest in a string of pinks. "I've worn pink to every Carousel Ball and 
this is the 11th one," she said. "It's lucky pink." 
</P>
<P>
 Other big-skirt moments were provided by Lisa Hoffman in a black satin gown 
with a train, Lesley Ann Warren in a meringue of plaid by Vivienne Westwood and 
Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson in puffy black taffeta by Rochas. 
</P>
<P>
 But, this being the workout capital, curves were also on display. Linda 
Bruckheimer showed hers in Richard Tyler's slim black velvet column, while 
Peggy Lipton and Goldie Hawn proved their muscle in clingy, floor-grazing slip 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights: The expectant Barbara Lazaroff ("You heard me -- I'm having 
contractions") in a Zandra Rhodes creation, to which she had sewn tiny gold 
baby bottles and cherubs. Lili Fini Zanuck in white Armani full trousers, 
jacket and "I Dream of Jeannie" braid trailing down her back. Liza Minnelli, 
who reached deep into her closet for an old, bias-cut Halston gown. And in the 
most off-color statement of the evening: Juliette Lewis flaunting a head of 
purple hair. BETTY GOODWIN

BEHIND THE SCENES: AVEDA ACTION IS MORE THAN SKIN-DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumers in the '90s seem to care as much about their appearance a s they 
care about helping the planet. They want products that are environmentally 
sound, and skin- and hair-care companies have jumped on a medicine-man 
bandwagon to promote their "natural" concoctions. But all too often these 
products are full of chemicals and synthetic ingredients and packaged without 
concern for the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 A company whose integrity -- and ingredient content -- doesn't fall under that 
category is Aveda. Its founder, Horst Rechelbacher, has achieved a sort of cult 
status among stylists and environmentalists who agree with his commitment to 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, he hosted a luncheon for environmentalists at the Westin South 
Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, then attended that evening's opening of the Aveda 
Esthetique in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 At the lunch, Rechelbacher talked of his company's practices, which include 
working with organic farmers and tribal shamans. Treaties are signed with 
indigenous tribes to cultivate native plants for use in his products. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not the perfect corporation," he told the luncheon audience. "I'm not 
saying we're here saving the world. I'm just trying to chip away at the 
problems and find solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Rechelbacher's company was among the first to promulgate the term 
"aromatherapy" when the company started in 1978. But the saturation of cosmetic 
companies bottling synthetic and mediocre natural ingredients and calling it 
"aromatherapy" has undercut the true meaning of the term. It originally 
described therapy using natural essences from plants, flowers, resins and 
woods. Aveda now uses the term "Pure fume," a copyrighted label that connotes 
the same concept without the tarnish. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening, about 300 salon owners, stylists and others in the industry 
celebrated the opening of the new store, which will carry the complete 
collection of Aveda products available -- 700 items at last count. 
</P>
<P>
 They brought Rechelbacher flowers and words of adoration. ROSE APODACA JONES

OFF THE CUFF; CLEANING UP AFTER HER CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 K athy Gomez works in a soiled world, a place of stains and more stains. It's 
Gomez's customers -- every day they air their dirty laundry right in front of 
her.  
</P>
<P>
 Gomez, a 20-year veteran of the cleaning business, is the general manager of 
Corporate Cleaners in Irvine. In a high-volume store such as hers, thousands of 
pieces are cleaned and laundered in a week. But, she assures, "everything is 
accounted for, so we don't lose any items."  
</P>
<P>
 Although 90% of the stains Gomez sees do surrender to her chemicals, she 
admits there are some that she can't remove. In the story that follows, Gomez 
explains why.  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allow people 
connected to the fashion industry to talk about their encounters.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Ink spots that have spread in brightly colored silks or rayons are difficult 
to remove without removing the dye as well. Egg white is also a difficult stain 
because it acts like a glue, and dried blood is always tough. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most difficult stains are the ones customers have tried to work out at 
home, and, instead of one stain, they now have two because of the stuff they 
put on it. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a stain out, the first thing to do is not to use hair spray or club 
soda or whatever it is they tell you to use on airplanes or in restaurants. 
Leave the stain alone and take it to the cleaners as soon as possible. Once you 
put moisture on it, the stain is set. 
</P>
<P>
 We have 20 chemicals to work with to take out a stain. If we know what caused 
it, we can go to a specific chemical and get it out. If we don't know what 
caused it, we go through a series of chemicals until we find the right one. 
</P>
<P>
 If we see that the dye or the fabric is weak, or if a stain has been there 
since Year One and has oxidized, we won't try to remove the stain. Removing the 
stain will pull the dye from the fabric and damage the garment more than it 
already is. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen tremendous changes in this industry since I started. The most 
significant change was about 15 years ago when the state declared that cleaners 
no longer needed to be licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, we needed special training, a year's hands-on experience and the 
passing of a test on our knowledge of chemicals. Now, it's a free market. 
Anyone can open a cleaners as long as they can fill out the EPA forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you see many "dry stores," what we call places where the cleaning isn't 
done on the premises and where the person taking your garment isn't 
knowledgeable about how to clean it. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's a simple garment, there shouldn't be a problem. But with wedding 
gowns, formals, some gabardine or something you really care about, dry stores 
may not accept them because they may not know how to handle these specialty 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a myth that if you don't clean a garment very often, it will last 
longer. So, if you don't see dirt, you should just get it pressed and not 
cleaned. But actually pressing is harder on it than cleaning. And moths and 
silverfish will eat on soiled areas that are invisible to us and create holes. 
Clean it especially if you're putting it away for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say women pay more for a shirt than men. That's not true here. If the 
shirt doesn't fit our "shirt unit" and it has to be processed by hand or if it 
has shoulder pads, pleats or appliques and it has to be hand done, then we 
charge more. But most shirts -- men and women's Size 12 or larger -- will go on 
our shirt unit and be charged the same. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one thing I think any dry cleaner would love to have, and that is a 
drive-through store. I worked for a drive-through cleaner in Long Beach years 
ago. It was a free-standing building, and it was great. People loved it. But 
now the price of a lease in Orange County makes it unfeasible, so dry cleaners 
are forced into strip malls where it's impossible to drive through.

ANN CONWAY: R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; NIJINSKY: SPECTRE AMONG THE ROSES; MUSEUM 
FOUNDER SEVERIN WUNDERMAN OPENS HIS GARDEN TO CULTIVATE SUPPORTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 S tay on the grass.  
</P>
<P>
 That was the mandate at Sunday's tea at the immense Italian villa in South 
Laguna Beach that belongs to Severin Wunderman, founder of the Severin 
Wunderman Museum in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests could sip water under the rose-smothered gazebo, on a patio perched 
above the roaring sea, but tours of the $10-million Mediterranean digs were 
forbidden. In fact, if guests even came close to a stairway leading to 
Wunderman's front door, security guards shooed them away. 
</P>
<P>
 "What? We don't get to tour the house? Well, that's two in a row for me," 
wailed Bowers Museum supporter Donna Karlen (the previous night she attended a 
Halloween bash in Long Beach where guests were permitted only in the home's art 
gallery). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is strictly a garden high tea," explained Mary Crost, a publicist for 
the Severin Wunderman Museum. "We are fortunate to have this tea at the home of 
our founder, and we need to respect his privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 What the preview party for the museum's upcoming Vaslav Nijinsky art exhibit 
lacked in intimacy, it made up for in style. 
</P>
<P>
 Tables draped in snow-white cloths were topped with moss and rose covered 
images of Nijinsky, "the most important dancer of the 20th-Century," 
rhapsodized William Emboden, the museum's research director. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was discovered by Diaghilev in the early 1900s," Emboden continued, "and 
people were so astonished by his dancing -- they'd never seen a dancer elevated 
to that degree -- they insisted on coming backstage to see the wires from which 
he was suspended." 
</P>
<P>
 After an Evian reception, guests were 
</P>
<P>
 seated for tea (with sweets and savories catered by Pascal) and a performance 
of some of Nijinsky's most celebrated works. 
</P>
<P>
 On a stage at the center of the garden, where flame-colored bougainvillea 
bloomed beside lavender roses, dancers who included museum director Tony Clark 
-- once a member of the Paris Opera -- performed excerpts from "Giselle," 
"Sheherezade," "Le Spectre de la Rose" and more. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity to step through Wunderman's verdi gris garden gates was a 
first for the Orange County society set, confided Crost. "We want to introduce 
new people to the museum. This event celebrates the Nijinsky art exhibit that 
the museum will begin to display on Nov. 7." 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the tea's rose theme ("Nijinsky actually became the embodiment 
of a rose," Emboden said), pink missives embellished with rose stickers sat 
atop each table. 
</P>
<P>
 When guests opened them, they found an invitation to join the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests: Christine Rhoades, Judy Fluor-Runels, Pauline Baker, Donna 
Peebles with fiance Peter Papke, Len and Mary Ann Miller and Brigitte Harper 
(who created the dance costumes).

Wolfgang Puck. For tickets ($75 for festival seating, $120 for reserved), call

 UCI Medal Awards: Receiving the UCI Medal -- UC Irvine's highest honor -- 
Tuesday night at the Newport Beach Marriott were Arlene Cheng, a music 
educator; Eric Nelson, founder of Nelson Research and Development Co.; Dorothy 
Strauss, a retired English instructor, and Michael Berns, director of UCI's 
Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "These four members of the UCI community embody the true spirit of 
cooperation, generosity and partnership with the university," said Chancellor 
Laurel L. Wilkening. "Their dedication and service are deserving of our highest 
recognition."

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: DEFINING THIS THING CALLED FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New Yorker pays the subject of fashion its highest honor in the Nov. 7 
issue -- not by devoting the entire magazine to the topic, but by assigning 
writers ordinarily occupied with weightier matters to figure out, as the title 
of Adam Gopnik's introductory essay puts it, "What It All Means." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for us, the subtitle has the answer: "Fashion? Well, here's the main 
thing; it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 But Anthony Lane, writing about sausage-chomping genius Karl Lagerfeld, is not 
so sanguine: "The fashion world is more rabid and self-involved than any other, 
because, in the end, none of it matters." 
</P>
<P>
 We suspect New Yorker Editor Tina Brown thinks fashion matters. But we're 
probably confusing the fashion world with fashion advertising, which, of 
course, matters very much. 
</P>
<P>
 The 248-page magazine was served up on silver platters at a party Friday 
night, on the eve of the New York spring collections. And fashion insiders from 
all over the world have been munching steadily on it ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read it twice," said Bloomingdale's fashion director Kal Ruttenstein of the 
profile on him. "I think I like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Karan and company fled the party early and drove to a restaurant to read 
a piece called "The Mega Mom-and-Pop Shop" aloud around the table. "It was so 
long. It was like being at a Seder," said Patti Cohen, senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing in the issue compares to S.J. Perelman's 1938 send-up of Diana 
Vreeland's celebrated Harper's Bazaar column, "Why Don't You?" In it, Vreeland 
asked her readers why they didn't rinse their blond child's hair in dead 
champagne, as they do in France?  
</P>
<P>
 "If a perfectly strange lady came up to you on the street and demanded, 'Why 
don't you travel with a little raspberry-colored cashmere blanket to throw over 
yourself in hotels and trains?' the chances are," Perelman wrote, "that you 
would turn on your heel with dignity and hit her with a bottle."  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, in 1994, the most dangerous thing most of us carry around is a 
plastic Evian bottle -- no match for a rabid, self-involved creature of 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Be Good: When Johnny Depp didn't show up to occupy his reserved seat at 
the Marc Jacobs show, a wise guy cracked, "He's busy tearing up a hotel room." 
(Depp slipped in when the lights went down.) The audience did not, however, 
lack for pouty boys -- one of whom we caught powdering his nose. The thing 
about waiting an hour for a show to start is, there's lots of time for people 
to relax and let loose with inane chatter. Guy photographer to girl 
photographer, whom he's clearly trying to impress: "I shot Isabel for Two." 
"Two?" "It's the YM of Latin America." 
</P>
<P>
 Scene Stealers: Mariah Carey's bodyguard shoved us aside to install the singer 
into the seat next to us at the Isaac Mizrahi show. "It's so hot in here," she 
said, peeling off her Corrine Cobson leather jacket, revealing a cropped, 
cherry-red mohair sweater. "Yessss," said the paparazzi in happy unison. Snap, 
snap, snap. "Keep flipping her hair forward," Carey's handler instructed 
someone sitting directly behind the singer, and voil a, the hair flipper began 
flicking Carey's curly brown hair forward. Snap, snap, snap. 
</P>
<P>
 Model Update: Former Mickey Rourke flame Carre Otis has barred the actor from 
any show in which she appears. Otis, clearly in the midst of the tattoo-removal 
process, is getting mixed reviews: "She's all over the runway," remarked a 
disapproving observer of Otis' wobbling gait . . . The frightening thing is 
that no model, no matter how beautiful, is above reproach from the 
less-than-perfect audience: Her butt's too big. Her butt's too flat. She's 
gained so much weight. She's so cold. She looks old. She looks like a cadav e 
r. Boob job -- look, they don't move. The consensus is that only Naomi Campbell 
is absolutely fabulous. And we're not talking about her writing . . . Tatiana 
Patitz, who played the dead girl in "Rising Sun," is alive and modeling . . . 
Kristen McMenamy's dark red hair is now strawberry blond, all the better to 
look like a movie goddess.  
</P>
<P>
 Labor Relations: Teri Agins reported in the Wall Street Journal this week that 
the Federal Trade Commission is investigating the fashion industry for possible 
price fixing of the fees paid to runway models. Last fall, the governing body 
of the New York shows asked models and designers to keep fees down to $750 an 
hour. Last week, Joseph Hunter, president of Ford Models, was asked for models' 
home phone numbers to get to the bottom of things. Yeah, sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Stylemakers' Style: As the shows pile up, the fashion crowd starts piling on 
what they see on the runway. Creeping up in the style vernacular that is 
already heavy with '70s footwear, black Prada backpacks and liquid eyeliner are 
glitter headbands and scarves tied cowgirl-style at the neck. Add to the list 
of must-haves for the women who actually keep lists of such things: sweater 
guards, rhinestone bobby pins, short gloves, tiny purses, ivory fishnet 
stockings, snoods, brooches, skinny snakeskin belts, bows, floppy safari hats, 
shapely fannies, seamed stockings, pasties, darts, cigarettes, real hairdos.

HOOP DAY AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 College basketball fans have nothing to worry about -- there's no chance of a 
strike here. In fact, you can come out and meet both the UCLA men's and women's 
teams at the annual Basketball Family Day on Sunday at 1 p.m. Coaches Kathy 
Olivier and Jim Harrick will introduce their teams in a day of slam-dunk 
contests, team drills and super-shot challenges.Some members of the audience 
will get a shot at winning prizes.  
</P>
<P>
 The first 3,000 into Pauley Pavilion will get freebies from corporate sponsors 
(including Haagen Dazs, Gatorade, PowerBars, Joico and others). Players will 
stick around to sign autographs after the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great family event," says Bill Bennett, UCLA sports information 
director. The event, he notes, is patterned after the "Midnight Madness" some 
schools hold the day when college practice can legally begin for the season -- 
but those late-night events mostly attract college students. "We feel we get 
everybody," Bennett says. "The college students, the moms and dads and the 
kids. It's just a fun event for the whole family."  
</P>
<P>
 The Varsity band and UCLA Spirit Squad will also join in. The event is free 
(tickets for regular season games average about $20). Pauley Pavilion, west end 
of UCLA campus, Westwood. (310) 206-4458. LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

 You may not need a college education to sell cars, but it didn't hurt a team

 Working with Southern California College business professor Greg Smith, the 
students' "Showcase '94" promotional campaign culminated in a daylong event on

<P>
 The spectrometer is used to analyze air, water and soil samples. The 
university already owns one such device. It is especially useful in the study 
of environmental science, university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such equipment has been used at CSUF to identify organic compounds in oil

 Sculptor's Art Turns to Stones 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a story in every stone? 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese sculptor Seiji Kunishima believes so, and an admission-free exhibit 
of his work at Golden West College through Nov. 11 gives the public a chance to 
see his interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kunishima believes that each stone holds its own story and therefore its own 
history," said Golden West College Fine Arts Gallery Director Donna Sandrock. 
"Each stone is personally selected by the artist, who then incorporates the 
natural stone within the lathed and highly polished granite." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Kunishima's commissioned sculptures are at San Francisco International 
Airport and in Brea. He has displayed his creations throughout Japan and the 
United States since 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit at the Golden West College Fine Arts Gallery will be open week 
days from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., with additional hours, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on 
Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

<P>
 A status report on the large-scale revitalization of the Town Center area will 
be given to residents Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 p.m., the city staff will discuss plans for Town Center, the commercial 
area between Pacific Coast Highway and Del Prado Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will touch on the partnership between businesses and the city in 
deciding what the redesign should look like. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the difficulties for Town Center is that a lot of the properties are 
smaller and fragmented," city planner Lance Schulte said. "The parking lots are 
not interrelated, and that means customers coming to shop here go from one 
parking lot to another." 
</P>
<P>
 Other subjects for discussion include creating business and public 
partnerships and establishing more resident workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be dealing with traffic circulation issues and street designs and 
laying the groundwork for step-by-step public workshops in the future," Schulte 
said.

UNOCAL TO CUT 630 CORPORATE STAFF POSITIONS; EMPLOYMENT: THE OIL COMPANY 
CONTINUES TO TRIM COSTS. SOUTHLAND OFFICES WILL FEEL THE AX OVER THE NEXT TWO 
YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Unocal Corp. announced Wednesday that it will reduce its corporate staff by 
about 40%, or 630 positions, during the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The job cuts, part of a restructuring begun four years ago, will be made in 
the accounting, administration, legal, planning, human resources, computer 
services and community affairs departments, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts, which should save about $50 million a year, will come at Unocal's 
headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles and its offices in Anaheim and Sugar Land, 
Tex., near Houston. Unocal said it will take a one-time charge of about $25 
million in the fourth quarter for costs incurred from the staff cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've downsized the company considerably over the past few years as we have 
focused on fewer operating businesses," Chief Executive Roger C. Beach said in 
a statement. "Now we are reorganizing the support groups. . . . We deeply 
regret that we have to eliminate jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 All U.S. oil companies have undergone sometimes dramatic contractions since 
the price of crude oil tumbled in the late 1980s. Low oil and gasoline prices 
have forced them to look for more efficient ways to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is cost cutting like crazy, and it's been quite effective," said 
Holly Gustafson, an analyst with NatWest Securities/Washington Analysis in 
Washington. Other oil companies announcing major staff cuts recently include 
Mobil, Atlantic Richfield and Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a series of unit reorganizations and asset sales, Unocal's worldwide 
employment by January had fallen to 13,613 people from 17,286 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the jobs have gone with the businesses the company sold. About 2,500 
positions have been eliminated through voluntary buyouts, early retirements and 
layoffs. The latest reduction represents a substantial portion of Unocal's 
corporate staff of 1,500, but many analysts were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's consistent not only with petroleum industry trends, but also with that 
of corporate America in reducing administrative and broader organizational 
costs," said Keith C. Klaver, partner at Price Waterhouse World Petroleum 
Industry Group in San Francisco. "U.S. corporations now have to be competitive 
not only locally, but globally." 
</P>
<P>
 The first 230 Unocal employees identified for the cuts -- divided about 
equally between offices in Los Angeles and Orange County -- learned Tuesday 
that their jobs would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Unocal also has about 600 workers at a research facility in 
Brea, and about 100 more employees scattered throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 400 workers will be notified Dec. 1, Unocal spokesman Barry Lane said. 
Most of the 630 employees to be let go will be laid off in stages through 1995 
and 1996, though some may be able to find jobs elsewhere in the firm, the 
company indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Some corporate functions will be eliminated as the work force shrinks, the 
company said, and other work will be farmed out to contractors -- including 
computer, communications and in-house medical service. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal will close down its company clinics next year and contract with outside 
firms for pre-employment physical examinations and similar services. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the services being eliminated will be evident to the customer," Lane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal shares slipped 12.5 cents to $28.875 on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Wednesday.

WHITEHALL STREET BUYS MOST OF HILLMAN ASSETS; REAL ESTATE: $450-MILLION SALE OF 
A MAJORITY OF THE O.C. FIRM CREATES A JOINT VENTURE WHOSE HOLDINGS INCLUDE 39 
PROPERTIES ENCOMPASSING 5.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE ACROSS THE NATION.

<P>
 A real estate partnership managed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. paid $450 million 
Wednesday for most of the assets of Hillman Properties, a management and 
development company in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehall Street Real Estate Ltd. Partnership has bought what amounts to most 
of the commercial real estate holdings of Pittsburgh billionaire Henry Hillman. 
The purchase creates a joint venture, WCB Properties, whose holdings now 
include 39 office and commercial properties encompassing 5.3 million square 
feet of space across the nation, plus tracts of undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a vote of confidence on the part of the Wall Street investment 
community in real estate, particularly Southern California real estate," said 
Sanford Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego. "Hillman's portfolio 
has concentrations in Orange and San Diego counties. And Hillman has always 
been known for quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillman, whose fortune is estimated at more than $2 billion, inherited his 
father's coal and chemical business, then built a real estate empire. The 
76-year-old mogul is reportedly selling his real estate holdings for estate 
planning purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not included in the purchase are two prime pieces of Hillman property in 
Southern California: a parcel along the Harbor Freeway in downtown Los Angeles 
where the company said it plans to develop a 20,000-seat sports arena and 
Unocal Corp.'s headquarters in downtown Los Angeles. Also excluded are about 
200 undeveloped acres in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael R. Chase, who has headed Hillman Properties since 1974, will be 
president and chief executive officer of WCB Properties. Coleman J. Benedict, 
head of Hillman's northeast operations, will also be a partner in WCB, which 
takes its name from the first letters of Whitehall, Chase and Benedict.  
</P>
<P>
 "This new venture responds to changes in the real estate industry over the 
past few years," Chase said in a statement Wednesday. "Hillman Co. has been 
able to realize the value of part of its extensive real estate portfolio, and 
the Goldman, Sachs partnership has met its goal of purchasing high-quality, 
income-producing real estate assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillman Properties was formed in 1974 as an affiliate of Hillman Co., a 
private investment company based in Pittsburgh. It will retain ownership of 
number of holdings that will be managed by WCB Properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehall, with more than $3 billion in assets, typically buys distressed real 
estate portfolios from financial institutions. The Hillman purchase is the 
highest-quality portfolio the fund has acquired, a Goldman, Sachs official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 WCB Properties is expected to acquire other properties for development and 
might eventually form a real estate investment trust to sell stakes to the 
public, the Goldman, Sachs official said.

UNIONS DO A U-TURN ON IMMIGRANT WORKER ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's labor unions have a history of stomping on Latino and Asian 
immigrants, blaming them along with exploitative employers for driving down 
American wages. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, even the revered labor leader Cesar Chavez called illegal 
immigrants from Mexico a "severe problem," and he routinely reported 
undocumented farm workers to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet today, the state's top labor leaders are among the most forceful opponents 
of Proposition 187, the ballot measure intended to crack down on illegal 
immigrants by denying them many public services. 
</P>
<P>
 What prompted organized labor to stop shunning undocumented workers and 
instead join immigrant rights activists in fighting the measure, even back when 
defeating it seemed nearly hopeless? 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons reflect a mix of idealism and self-interest and represent both the 
current political climate along with a gradual evolution in the California 
labor movement.  
</P>
<P>
 All told, blaming illegal immigrants for today's economic problems "is not the 
answer," said David Sickler, regional director of the AFL-CIO district 
encompassing California, Hawaii and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 An emerging generation of California labor leaders envisions poorly paid 
foreign-born workers -- regardless of their immigration status -- as becoming a 
booming new base of support for U.S. unions. They are heartened by major union 
organizing victories in recent years involving immigrant drywallers and 
janitors, among other workers. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, they are more or less following the path taken by Chavez, the late 
president of the United Farm Workers union, who eventually reversed his 
position on undocumented Mexican workers and came to regard them as part of the 
UFW's natural constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 But other factors also figure in organized labor's decision to fight 
Proposition 187, a step that has brought together the state's most conservative 
and liberal union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure passes and survives court challenges, such unionized workers as 
teachers and nurses could inherit the additional burden of enforcing 
immigration laws -- if cuts in federal funds stemming from the initiative don't 
eliminate their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, more traditional unionists are comfortable opposing Proposition 187 
because it is so closely associated with Gov. Pete Wilson, a politician they 
regard as blatantly anti-union. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the least likely members of the labor coalition are the state's 
building trades unions, which are opposing Proposition 187 even as they 
continue calling for tougher penalties for employing illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Cremins, a lobbyist with the state Building and Construction Trades 
Council, explained that the measure would do nothing to keep job-seeking 
illegal immigrants from coming to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Cremins acknowledged that many construction workers in California are angry 
about jobs in the industry being taken by illegal immigrants, but he said the 
frustration "shouldn't be taken out on innocent people and children" who would 
be denied non-emergency medical care and public education. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the pronouncements of labor leaders won't dictate how the rank and 
file vote. A Los Angeles Times Poll completed last week shows union members 
favoring Proposition 187 by a 47%-43% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most encouraging news from the poll for labor leaders was that the 
margin in favor had shrunk sharply from a Times Poll taken earlier in October. 
In addition, the gap among union members was narrower than among all likely 
voters, who favored the measure 51% to 41% in the latest poll. 
</P>
<P>
 While some observers call union leaders courageous for opposing the 
initiative, others say labor officials aren't truly risking antagonizing their 
members. "A tougher issue for us was gun control," said Cremins, referring to 
labor's campaign for Proposition 15, an unsuccessful state ballot measure in 
1982 that would have restricted handgun sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two or three decades, many rank-and-file union members have come 
to expect labor leaders to take positions more liberal than their own and feel 
no need to vote along union lines. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the case with Waymann C. Carlson, a professor of education at Southern 
California College in Costa Mesa and a member of an affiliate of the California 
Teachers Assn. He plans to vote for Proposition 187 because he believes it is 
wrong for illegal immigrants to receive public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the CTA, Carlson said, "represent a lot of positions that I don't 
hold. . . . I find myself at odds with them on political grounds more often 
than I'm with them." 
</P>
<P>
 For labor leaders seeking to strengthen the flagging U.S. labor movement, 
finding common ground with the nation's growing immigrant communities is a 
natural strategy. Union leaders "all understand that this is the work force out 
there, and these people aren't going back to Mexico, Latin America or wherever 
if this thing passes," said the AFL-CIO's Sickler. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning the membership of illegal immigrant workers themselves -- not just the 
legal immigrants and others who support their interests -- is a major goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are working on a job, it's not up to us to determine what their 
status is. But it is up to us to see that they're getting a decent wage, if 
there's anything we can do about it," Sickler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sickler maintains that the California labor movement's support of immigrant 
rights issues has been developing over the last two decades and is reflected in 
the number of Latinos and Asian Americans rising through the union leadership 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among others, he cited Maria Elena Durazo, president of the largely Latino 
immigrant Local 11 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. She 
is the daughter of Mexican immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Durazo, 41, still bitterly recalls how her local -- under another 
administration in the early 1980s -- spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
legal fees to fight members who wanted union meetings and newsletters to be 
translated into Spanish. Today the local conducts business in both Spanish and 
English, though membership meetings are conducted mainly in Spanish because of 
the preferences of the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 The local also accepts both legal and illegal immigrants as members. Durazo 
said the aim is to prevent employers from driving down wages by exploiting 
undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to play into those games of pitting workers against each 
other," she said.

SNAPPED UP; QUAKER TO BUY NEW AGE DRINK PIONEER FOR $1.7 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RESPERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Quaker Oats Co. said Wednesday that it will acquire Snapple Beverage Corp. for 
$1.7 billion in cash, creating the nation's third-largest nonalcoholic beverage 
company and giving it a commanding market share lead in the fast-growing, 
so-called New Age drinks segment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the deal would be good for Snapple and Quaker, both of 
which have been under pressure in recent months. For one, they said, Quaker 
Oats -- which owns the Gatorade sports drink brand -- would give Snapple a 
deep-pocketed parent to fight a growing number of competitors in the 
$3.5-billion-a-year New Age category. Snapple practically invented the segment. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors reacted negatively. In Nasdaq trading Wednesday, Snapple shares 
fell 50 cents to close at $13.75 -- below Quaker Oat's $14-a-share bid. At the 
same time, disgruntled Snapple shareholders filed a dozen lawsuits in Delaware 
seeking to block the deal. They claim that company directors failed to maximize 
shareholder value by agreeing to a per-share price well below Snapple's high of 
$32.25 reached earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Quaker Oats, which has itself been the subject of recent takeover 
speculation, skidded $7.375 to $67.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts 
said the fall reflected the belief that Quaker won't be bought out and that it 
will be less profitable as a result of merging with Snapple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snapple won't be generating a lot of profit now," said Robert Cummins, 
managing director of Wertheim Schroder. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago-based Quaker Oats, also a maker of oatmeal and other breakfast 
cereals, said last week that its profit slid 31% for the fiscal 1995 first 
quarter ended Sept. 30. In Wednesday's announcement, Quaker Oats also said it 
might sell its European pet foods and Mexican chocolate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 East Meadow, N.Y.-based Snapple said Wednesday that its third-quarter earnings 
plunged 74% to $7.1 million, or 6 cents a share, from $26.9 million, or 22 
cents a share in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded 22 years ago by three friends who started out selling all-natural 
fruit drinks to health food stores, Snapple became a phenomenon as it expanded 
into natural sodas and iced teas. Thomas H. Lee Co. bought Snapple from the 
original owners and took it public in 1992 at $5 per share, adjusted for 
splits. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has reached nearly $700 million in annual sales, but it has seen 
its market share slide as soft drink giants Coca Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. have 
joined the field of competitors in the New Age drink category, which includes 
sports drinks, teas, juices and flavored waters. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in the bottled and canned tea category, consumer spending 
increased 149% in the fiscal year ended in July, according to Information 
Resources Inc., a Chicago-based marketing research firm. Snapple tea's growth 
lagged, however, with only an 86.6% sales increase, while sales of Lipton and 
Nestea (marketed by Coke) more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 (In the total New Age category, Gatorade has a 21% market share, followed by 
Snapple, including Snapple Sport, at 14.5%.) 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Gatorade has had to struggle to retain 80% of the sports drink 
market against Cocoa-Cola's PowerAde and PepsiCo's All Sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name of the game in the New Age beverage industry is getting into the 
stores," said John Frank, editor in chief of Beverage Industry, a trade 
publication. "Pepsi and Coke have had a stronger connection with supermarkets 
and have been able to get their products out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The merger strengthens Quaker Oats' position in the New Age market, and 
"Snapple should get the muscle it needs to get more supermarket shelf space," 
Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaker Oats plans to strengthen Gatorade and Snapple sales in markets where 
they have been weak, said Quaker spokeswoman Patti Jo Sinopoli. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan on taking Snapple where Gatorade has been and taking Gatorade where 
Snapple has been," Sinopoli said, noting that Gatorade is popular in the South 
and Southeast, while Snapple has exhibited strong sales in the Northeast and on 
the West Coast. Putting the Snap Back Into Snapple 
</P>
<P>
 By acquiring Snapple, Quaker Oats will dominate the New Age beverage market, 
which includes sports beverages and ready-to-drink teas and coffees. But while 
the iced tea segment continues to show fast growth, Snapple has lost the market 
share lead in held in 1993, and its stock has taken a beating due in part to 
declining profit and increasing competition. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 market share of ready-to-drink teas* (preliminary results) Lipton: 24.9% 
Snapple: 23.2 Nestea: 14.0 AriZona: 12.4 Private label: 4.4 Other: 21.1 * Based 
on cases sold 
</P>
<P>
 Total sales of ready-to-drink teas (in millions of cases) 1994: 177.3 
</P>
<P>
 Snapple stock price (monthly closes, except latest) $13.75, down 50 cents

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: WHY SONIC THE HEDGEHOG NEEDS TO JUMP ONTO THE 
INFO HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column

 Sonic the Hedgehog doesn't have to worry much about becoming road kill on 
Japan's information superhighway: Sega won't even let him on. Nintendo's Street 
Fighters -- whose high-bandwidth blood lust makes even Japan's most violent 
manga comics seem mild -- aren't I-way cruising for a bruising either. We won't 
even talk about Super Mario. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If Japan looks back from the next century to review multimedia opportunities 
missed, the unwillingness of its top video game companies to get on the 
Internet will probably prove the biggest. Sega and Nintendo may be the world's 
most popular video game companies, but they refuse to play on-line. The network 
roads to Japanese multimedia are not being paved with joysticks and blaster 
buttons. Though roughly half the nation's households with children have video 
game consoles, the two companies are not about to use them as profitable 
platforms for on-line interaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no interest in the on-line market," says a Nintendo spokesman. "We're 
interested in on-line games, but we have no plans at this time," says the 
spokesman for Sega. As a result, Japan may be squandering the last, best chance 
it has to define digital pop culture entertainment for the world's teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 While American media companies are furiously trying to figure out how to put 
themselves on the Internet and the Baby Bells shell out the Big Bucks to 
Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael S. Ovitz to bring a bit of Hollywood 
to their networks, Japan's top two entertainment companies offer radically 
different ideas for bringing telecommunications to their consoles. For 
Nintendo, the answers orbit some 22,400 miles overhead; for Sega, the answers 
lie underground. For some reason, neither of the two seems willing to pick up 
the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Nintendo paid $8 million for a 20% stake in St. Giga, a troubled 
Japanese satellite broadcaster. In June, the company announced that it would 
collaborate with the Itochu Corp. trading company to satellite-transmit video 
games nationwide to the country's 14 million Nintendo game consoles. 
Downloading games from the sky is an interesting distribution concept but one 
that effectively eliminates any chance for network games where people play with 
or against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The same holds true for Sega. In July, Japan's No. 2 video game giant 
established Sega Digital Communications Ltd. to put its video games on cable. 
Only about 1.6 million Japanese homes now receive cable -- a 5% penetration 
rate, compared to the 60% penetration rate in the United States -- but the 
company is optimistic that its Sega video game channel will be a "killer app" 
that prompts an explosion in demand. The company is aiming for 100,000 
subscribers to its service by 1997. Sega will offer the service through 
regional cable operators for about $30 a month, nearly three times the cost of 
the comparable Sega Channel in the States. 
</P>
<P>
 But here, too, the fun only flows one way: Sega's Megadrive technology reads 
signals for local cable and displays the game on the TV set. It doesn't allow 
you to play other people. They only sell personal -- not interpersonal -- 
interactivity. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the entire concept of on-line interactivity and network community 
seems alien to the two companies so used to selling games as cartridges. 
Indeed, both companies view their cable and satellite links as just another way 
of distributing games rather than as new media for interactive entertainment. 
Technically, it would be a snap for Sega or Nintendo to sell inexpensive modem 
cartridges priced at less than $50 that would let people play games with each 
other over telephone lines. Just selling the modem cartridges alone could 
generate hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, both companies have played with the idea. However, neither company 
has come close to leveraging its installed game base and turning the networks 
of NTT, Japan's dominant telephone company, into the world's most profitable 
virtual video game community. For its part, NTT has done little to encourage 
this new way to boost network usage. Both Nintendo and Sega seem married to the 
notion that their games are entertainment products rather than launching pads 
for new kinds of services. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, on-line services have become one of the fastest-growing segments in 
the global media market. The Internet has been explosive; companies like 
America Online, CompuServe, Delphi and Prodigy have all enjoyed consistent 
double-digit growth. Microsoft plans to roll out its Marvel on-line service 
sometime next year. On-line services have also begun to boom in Japan. 
Niftyserve, an on-line service co-owned by electronics giant NEC, has seen its 
growth double to half a million subscribers in less than two years. Fujitsu's 
popular PC VAN is almost as big. Games are an important ingredient in all these 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, much to the dismay of the domestic industry, Sega and Nintendo are 
conspicuous by their absence. Apparently, media convergence doesn't mean 
bringing their brand of intense interaction to interactive networks. Perhaps 
they should become more familiar with "Doom," the ultra-violent, ultra-popular 
network game from ID Software that is redefining the business model of on-line 
entertainment. ID gives away the first installment of the search-and-destroy 
software and then charges people for successive installments. The company's 
revenue has taken off like a rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Nintendo and Sega may prove victims of their own success. They see 
the rise of on-line networks, but they decline to take advantage of the 
opportunities those present. They are taking the path of least resistance on 
the information superhighway. That's terrific news for American video games.

UNOCAL TO CUT 630 CORPORATE STAFF POSITIONS; EMPLOYMENT: THE OIL COMPANY 
CONTINUES TO TRIM COSTS. SOUTHLAND OFFICES WILL FEEL THE AX OVER THE NEXT TWO 
YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Unocal Corp. announced Wednesday that it will reduce its corporate staff by 
about 40%, or 630 positions, during the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The job cuts, part of a restructuring begun four years ago, will be made in 
the accounting, administration, legal, planning, human resources, computer 
services and community affairs departments, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts, which should save about $50 million a year, will come at Unocal's 
headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles and its offices in Anaheim and Sugar Land, 
Tex., near Houston. Unocal said it will take a one-time charge of about $25 
million in the fourth quarter for costs incurred from the staff cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've downsized the company considerably over the past few years as we have 
focused on fewer operating businesses," Chief Executive Roger C. Beach said in 
a statement. "Now we are reorganizing the support groups. . . . We deeply 
regret that we have to eliminate jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 All U.S. oil companies have undergone sometimes dramatic contractions since 
the price of crude oil tumbled in the late 1980s. Low oil and gasoline prices 
have forced them to look for more efficient ways to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is cost cutting like crazy, and it's been quite effective," said 
Holly Gustafson, an analyst with NatWest Securities/Washington Analysis in 
Washington. Other oil companies announcing major staff cuts recently include 
Mobil, Atlantic Richfield and Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a series of unit reorganizations and asset sales, Unocal's worldwide 
employment by January had fallen to 13,613 people from 17,286 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the jobs have gone with the businesses the company sold. About 2,500 
positions have been eliminated through voluntary buyouts, early retirements and 
layoffs. The latest reduction represents a substantial portion of Unocal's 
corporate staff of 1,500, but many analysts were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's consistent not only with petroleum industry trends, but also with that 
of corporate America in reducing administrative and broader organizational 
costs," said Keith C. Klaver, partner at Price Waterhouse World Petroleum 
Industry Group in San Francisco. "U.S. corporations now have to be competitive 
not only locally, but globally." 
</P>
<P>
 The first 230 Unocal employees identified for the cuts -- divided about 
equally between offices in Los Angeles and Orange County -- learned Tuesday 
that their jobs would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 400 workers will be notified Dec. 1, Unocal spokesman Barry Lane said. 
Most of the 630 employees to be let go will be laid off in stages through 1995 
and 1996, though some may be able to find jobs elsewhere in the firm, the 
company indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Some corporate functions will be eliminated as the work force shrinks, the 
company said, and other work will be farmed out to contractors -- including 
computer, communications and in-house medical service. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal will close down its company clinics next year and contract with outside 
firms for pre-employment physical examinations and similar services. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the services being eliminated will be evident to the customer," Lane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal shares slipped 12.5 cents to $28.875 on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Wednesday.

CAR DEALER: SPIEGEL USED S&L FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former owner of a Santa Barbara auto dealership testified Wednesday that 
Thomas Spiegel, the once-high-flying chief of Columbia Savings & Loan, 
personally tried to buy a half interest in his luxury-car business, but used 
more than $10 million of Columbia's money to complete the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Schneider -- who admitted to jurors that he had falsified his own 
application in order to get his original stake in Gregg Motors in 1983 -- said 
Spiegel approached him in 1987 and that the two hatched a plan to buy out 
Schneider's existing partners and give Spiegel a 50% stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Schneider said, Spiegel subsequently ran into "a liquidity problem" 
and instead told Schneider that Columbia would have to loan the auto dealer the 
money he needed to buy out his partners. The complicated agreement essentially 
gave Columbia, not Spiegel, the 50% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors have maintained from the outset of Spiegel's trial that 
Spiegel intended to illegally use Columbia's cash to get a piece of the auto 
business for himself. But Schneider's testimony did not directly affirm the 
government's theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel is in federal court in Los Angeles on 45 felony counts, ranging from 
bribery to fraud, stemming from his reign as chief executive of the Beverly 
Hills thrift, which was seized by regulators in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most damaging testimony Wednesday for Spiegel involved the 
financial statements and related documents Schneider said he was asked to 
provide when he applied for various loans from Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel encouraged Schneider to provide grossly inflated estimates of the auto 
dealer's net worth to ensure approval of several loans, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom had asked me to 'puff it up,' " Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government maintains that Gregg Motors' eventual failure cost Columbia 
more than $10 million. The cost to taxpayers of bailing out Columbia has been 
pegged at about $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense lawyers painted Schneider as a habitual liar. Under 
cross-examination, Schneider was made to recite several of his own illegal 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
 They included fraudulent loan applications he made on his own and lying to a 
grand jury that investigated the Gregg Motors deal after Columbia declared its 
insolvency in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider later pleaded guilty to two counts of loan fraud and agreed to 
cooperate with the government in its prosecution of Spiegel.

20TH CENTURY GIVEN DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Insurance Department on Wednesday gave 20th Century Insurance Co. a 
Nov. 14 deadline to pay -- in either a lump sum or the first of installments -- 
the $120-million rebate it owes policyholders under Proposition 103, the 1988 
rate-rollback initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is part of the department's effort to enforce the victory it won in 
August when the California Supreme Court unanimously rejected Woodland 
Hills-based 20th Century's challenge to a 1991 order by Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi that implemented the Proposition 103 rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court overturned a ruling by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge 
Dzintra Janavs and sent the case back to her for final disposition. Meanwhile, 
20th Century has asked Janavs to stay the California ruling until it can appeal 
the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Janavs has set a Nov. 10 hearing on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Insurance Department's "show cause order" Wednesday represents the first 
time it has spelled out exactly how much 20th Century must pay and on what 
timetable. The order gives the company the option of paying the full sum at 
once or $50 million now and the rest in three equal annual installments. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century Industries, the insurer's parent company, announced 
Wednesday that Chief Operating Officer William L. Mellick will take on the 
additional title of president, a position vacated by James O. Curley, who 
resigned last week. Mellick, 53, had been executive vice president.

$450 MILLION BUYS HILLMAN PROPERTIES PACKAGE; DEVELOPERS: THE DEAL IS HAILED AS 
A SIGN OF RISING REAL ESTATE VALUES. TWO KEY SITES IN LOS ANGELES WILL NOT 
CHANGE HANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A real estate partnership managed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. on Wednesday paid 
$450 million for most of the assets of Hillman Properties, a management and 
development company in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehall Street Real Estate Ltd. Partnership has bought what amounts to most 
of the commercial real estate holdings of Pittsburgh billionaire Henry Hillman. 
The purchase creates a joint venture, WCB Properties, whose holdings now 
include 39 office and commercial properties encompassing 5.3 million square 
feet of space across the nation, as well as tracts of undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a vote of confidence on the part of the Wall Street investment 
community in real estate, particularly Southern California real estate," said 
Sanford Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego. "Hillman's portfolio 
has concentrations in Orange and San Diego counties. And Hillman has always 
been known for quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillman, whose fortune is estimated at more than $2 billion, inherited his 
father's coal and chemical business, then built a real estate empire. The 
76-year-old mogul reportedly is selling his real estate holdings for estate 
planning purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluded from sale are two prime Hillman properties in Southern California: a 
parcel along the Harbor Freeway in Downtown Los Angeles where the company said 
it plans to develop a 20,000-seat sports arena, and the Unocal Corp. 
headquarters, also in Downtown Los Angeles. Also excluded are about 200 
undeveloped acres Hillman owns in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael R. Chase, who has headed Hillman Properties since 1974, will be 
president and chief executive officer of WCB Properties. Coleman J. Benedict, 
head of Hillman's Northeast operations, will also be a partner in WCB, which 
takes its name from the first letters of the names Whitehall, Chase and 
Benedict. 
</P>
<P>
 "This new venture responds to changes in the real estate industry over the 
past few years," Chase said in a statement Wednesday. "Hillman Co. has been 
able to realize the value of part of its extensive real estate portfolio, and 
the Goldman Sachs partnership has met its goal of purchasing high-quality, 
income-producing real estate assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillman Properties was formed in 1974 as an affiliate of Hillman Co., a 
private investment company based in Pittsburgh. It will retain ownership of a 
number of holdings that will be managed by WCB Properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehall, with more than $3 billion in assets, typically buys distressed real 
estate portfolios from financial institutions. The Hillman purchase is the 
highest-quality portfolio the fund has acquired, a Goldman Sachs official said 
Wednesday.

FHP INC. JOINS OTHER HMOS IN RATING ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FHP Inc., joining the growing number of medical companies supplying more 
information about the quality of health care, released a "report card" 
Wednesday grading itself on patient satisfaction, preventive care and other 
medical measurements. 
</P>
<P>
 The report from the nation's third-largest health maintenance organization 
comes amid a growing movement in the health care industry: releasing previously 
unavailable information about hospitals, doctors and insurers. Employer and 
consumer groups have been demanding such information to make it easier to 
compare the quality and costs of available medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP, based in Fountain Valley, is among the first HMOs in California to 
release what it calls a quality report. About a year ago, Kaiser Permanente, 
the nation's largest HMO, released a report card for its Northern California 
region that won plaudits within the industry for its comprehensive nature. 
PacifiCare HealthSystems, a big HMO based in Cypress, will release its report 
card within 60 days, a company official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, FHP said it surveyed 500,000 members in California and four 
other states and asked them to rate their doctors and the overall quality of 
the plan's services. It also conducted an extensive internal review of members' 
medical records to assess things such as prenatal care, childhood immunization 
rates and mammogram rates. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP said its survey found that 92% of its members were either "satisfied" or 
"extremely satisfied" with their FHP membership. The company also said its 
survey showed that the HMO's record on various preventive-care medical tests 
and procedures surpassed national averages. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, FHP said about 70% of members' children receive immunizations by 
age 2, compared to a national average of 37%. And 79% of women aged 21 to 64 
had received a Pap test to detect cervical cancer during the previous three 
years, compared to a U.S. average of 59%. 
</P>
<P>
 While health care observers said FHP's report is welcome, they said one 
weakness is that it could be perceived as self-serving because it was prepared 
by FHP staff rather than an independent outside organization. The California 
Public Employees Retirement System, which negotiates for health care for nearly 
1 million state employees and their dependents, has hired an independent 
company to prepare report cards on the nearly 20 health plans -- including FHP 
-- with which it has contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives a lot more credibility if the survey has been scrubbed and verified 
by an outside firm," said Tom Elkin, health care chief for CalPERS. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also raised questions about FHP's findings and said the data lacks 
sufficient detail to benefit consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine Dalek, executive director of the Center on Health Care Rights, a 
consumer advocacy group in Los Angeles, said studies have shown that patients 
in most types of health plans -- whether HMOs or traditional insurance plans -- 
say they are generally satisfied with their medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one question -- 'Are you satisfied?' -- doesn't tell you anything," Dalek 
said. To be valuable to consumers, she said, health plans need to ask members 
more detailed questions, such as: How long does it take to get referrals to 
specialists? How hard is it to get an appointment? Can you get a timely 
response when you have a problem? 
</P>
<P>
 "HMOs are great when you're healthy," Dalek said. "The issue is how satisfied 
are people when they are not healthy. How do disabled persons feel about the 
program?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the nationwide debate over health care reform, HMOs have come under attack 
from physicians' groups and others who have questioned whether the insurers' 
emphasis on cost containment is jeopardizing the quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
 Westcott W. Price, FHP's chief executive, said the survey results demonstrate 
that "FHP has proven that quality health care can be provided at an affordable 
cost."

 Settlement Reached in Towers Fraud Case: Steven Hoffenberg, who headed Towers 
Financial Corp., agreed to pay more than $516.5 million to settle fraud charges 
brought by securities regulators and a bankruptcy trustee.The Securities and 
Exchange Commission alleged that Hoffenberg cheated thousands of people out of 
about $500 million between 1987 and 1993 by misrepresenting the financial 
condition of the company. The SEC alleged the company sold bonds and notes 
based on receivables that had been greatly overvalued and, in some cases, were 
pure fiction. Hoffenberg is to pay the SEC about $60 million, half of it for 
the bankruptcy payout to investors. He has admitted no wrongdoing.

FARMERS MAINTAINS NEW-POLICY FREEZE IN BATTLE WITH STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of Farmers Insurance Group's British parent company said Wednesday 
that Farmers will not lift its current freeze on writing new homeowners and 
earthquake insurance in California "until we get our way" -- that is, until 
Farmers is allowed to raise its earthquake policy deductibles to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Broughton, chief executive of BAT Industries, made the remark in an 
interview with public television's "Nightly Business Report." 
</P>
<P>
 California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi opposes the deductible 
increase, which Farmers unilaterally began imposing on renewal customers last 
summer. The company contends it has the authority to raise the deductible under 
a rate filing approved years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 An Insurance Department administrative law judge held hearings on the issue in 
early September but has not issued a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the increase, Broughton said, "there's no way we're going to be 
writing any new business" in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing industrywide losses of $10 billion or more from the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake, nearly all of the state's largest insurers have restricted their 
writings of homeowners and earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Broughton, in a separate interview Wednesday with Dow Jones Investor Network, 
said he thinks Farmers' current quake loss estimate of $1.35 billion "is 
actually slightly optimistic because we are now seeing quite a few reopenings 
of what we thought were closed cases." 
</P>
<P>
 A Farmers spokesman said the estimate is being reviewed as claims are paid and 
that there is a chance it could be revised upward.

 Rockwell Profit Up 10% in 4th Quarter, 13% for Year: The conglomerate known 
for building B-1 bombers and space shuttles attributed the higher profit to 
strong sales of modems and automated assembly lines.During the July-September 
quarter, the Seal Beach firm posted net income of $165 million, or 75 cents a 
share, compared to $150 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales 
rose from $2.84 billion to $2.89 billion. For the 1994 fiscal year, Rockwell 
International Corp. reported net income of $634.1 million, or $2.87 a share, up 
13% from a 1993 profit of $561.9 million, or $2.55 a share. Sales rose from 
$10.84 billion to $11.12 billion for the year.

 Painkiller Quickly Gains Popularity: Three months after its introduction, 
Aleve has become the No. 3 over-the-counter painkiller with U.S. 
consumers.Aleve, which claims to give relief for as long as 12 hours, went on 
sale in June. By mid-September, it had surpassed Excedrin and Bayer in sales, 
according to marketing statistics. Aleve still has a way to go before it 
challenges Advil and Tylenol, but its distributor, Procter & Gamble, says it 
already has roughly twice the market share Advil had just after it went on the 
shelf 10 years ago. Aleve had roughly 6.8% of the $2.5-billion-a-year 
painkiller market in the four weeks ended Sept. 11, according to figures 
compiled by research firm Information Resources Inc.

 San Diego Investment Firm Settles SEC Complaint: Galleon Capital Management 
agreed to pay back most of approximately $286,000, the amount the Securities 
and Exchange Commission said was misappropriated from client accounts and 
securities brokers.Galleon, whose owner, Louis Acevedo, managed about $100 
million in customer funds, reportedly is one of the nation's largest 
minority-owned investment firms. Acevedo, who settled the charges without 
admitting or denying guilt, would not comment. His attorney said Galleon was in 
the process of "winding down" operations and transferring remaining customers 
to other companies. The SEC said it will continue its investigation.

 Fannie Mae to Ease Lending Requirements: The Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
unveiled two products to allow people with insufficient down payments or 
incomes to buy houses. With a "Fannie 97" mortgage, borrowers can put down just 
3% of the purchase price.If a borrower is short of cash, family members or 
nonprofit groups can help to pay the closing costs. Borrowers with more cash 
but not much income can choose the "Start-Up Mortgage." The 30-year, fixed-rate 
loan requires only interest payments in the first year, a feature that makes it 
easier to handle than conventional loans that require principal payments as 
well. The government-sponsored agency known as Fannie Mae aims to offer $5 
billion worth of the 3% down-payment loans through local mortgage lenders 
within a year.

 Santa Fe Rejects Sweetened Bid: Santa Fe Pacific Corp. said it turned down a 
$3.8-billion offer from Union Pacific Corp. and reiterated its desire to be 
acquired by Burlington Northern Inc. in a deal valued at $3.1 billion. Despite 
the higher bid, Santa Fe maintained that a merger with Union Pacific would not 
be approved by regulators because it would lessen rail competition in the West. 
A Union Pacific spokesman said the firm was disappointed at Santa Fe's 
decision, but will continue pursuing a merger.

FED WARNING ON INFLATION PRESSURES REINFORCES FEARS OF NEW RATE HIKE; ECONOMY: 
MEANWHILE, THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT REPORTS THAT LEADING INDICATORS ARE STABLE 
AND FACTORY ORDERS ARE OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Inflation pressures are building as the economy's quickening pace of expansion 
is starting to reach consumer prices, the Federal Reserve Board warned 
Wednesday in a report that reinforced economists' convictions that the central 
bank will soon boost interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 In another report, the Commerce Department announced that its index of leading 
economic indicators -- the government's chief forecasting gauge of future 
economic activity -- was unchanged in September after a strong advance the 
previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also reported that orders to U.S. factories fell 0.2% in 
September, the second decline in the last three months and a dramatic 
turnaround from a 4.7% jump in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's latest summary of national economic activity, in its so-called beige 
book compiled after interviews with businessmen from coast to coast, suggests 
it may be difficult to bottle prices up much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices of raw and intermediate materials continue to rise, and there are 
increasing reports that manufacturers are passing along these costs by raising 
prices," the summary says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most districts report no change in retail prices, although pressure is 
building in some districts," it says. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was based on interviews conducted before Oct. 25 in all 12 Fed 
districts, and it updates the last one issued in mid-September. It will be used 
by the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee when it meets Nov. 15 to 
consider again raising interest rates, as it is expected to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Fed survey says much more bluntly that prices are on the rise, 
specifically citing increases at the raw and intermediate level of processing 
for chemicals, plastic, paper, steel and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers are increasingly passing them on by raising their selling prices 
for finished goods, and that means retailers will probably do the same in a 
thriving economy if they calculate that consumers will keep buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic activity continues to expand in all Federal Reserve districts," the 
Fed said. "There are signs of acceleration in the Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis 
and Philadelphia districts, while growth has slowed somewhat in the New York 
district." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco district reported that it is increasingly apparent that the 
California economy is growing modestly and that in the remainder of the 
district, economic conditions generally remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Though prices are rising, the Fed said there are still only a few reports of 
increasing wages, even though it is becoming difficult to find enough employees 
in some regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer spending, which fuels two-thirds of national economic activity, was 
generally strong and auto sales were very strong. But some districts, including 
Atlanta, Cleveland, New York and Richmond, Va., said retail sales were not 
meeting their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 One of relatively few signs of national weakening discovered by the Fed was in 
construction of single-family homes. Building activity was declining from 
fairly high levels earlier in the year in the face of higher mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, demand for bank loans was growing at a healthy pace across the 
country, the Fed said. Commercial and industrial lending was up solidly, though 
applications for home mortgages and refinancing continued to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The index of leading indicators has advanced in 11 of the past 14 months. 
Index components that had a positive impact on the gauge in September included 
increased building permits, rising consumer expectations and fewer weekly 
initial claims for unemployment insurance. Stock prices also rose; there were 
slower business delivery times -- usually a sign of rising orders -- and 
business orders for plants and equipment were higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Four components pulled the index downward: declining factory orders for 
consumer goods, a lower money supply, the first decline in raw material prices 
in a year and fewer unfilled orders for durable goods. Leading Indicators

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; PLANE CRASH IN INDIANA CALLS ATTENTION TO LIFE INSURANCE; 
PROTECTION: SOMETIMES COMPENSATION IS A CREDIT CARD PURCHASE AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disasters such as this week's plane crash in Indiana and the one near 
Pittsburgh in September leave many business travelers dealing with a fear 
they'd like to keep packed away. 
</P>
<P>
 It also focuses attention on a closely related issue: life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some travelers may not realize or may have forgotten that they already have an 
extra layer of insurance protection -- in some cases amounting to hundreds of 
thousands of dollars -- triggered automatically when certain credit cards are 
used to buy airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express, for example, provides $100,000 of in-flight accidental death 
and dismemberment coverage at no extra cost on personal green and gold cards 
and on corporate cards used by smaller companies -- provided the airline ticket 
was charged on the card. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount goes up to $200,000 on corporate cards used by mid-size and large 
companies, again when the ticket is charged. A spokeswoman said the larger 
corporate accounts also get 24-hour protection in the air and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you slipped on the ice on your front steps en route to the airport, that's 
still covered," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diners Club, which has more than 6.4 million cards in circulation worldwide, 
says its insurance coverage -- also automatic when the card is used to pay for 
a ticket -- is broader. 
</P>
<P>
 Diners Club offers high insurance: $350,000. President Robert Rosseau said the 
company is aware when a victim of a disaster was a cardholder and that in such 
cases, "we typically won't wait for (families or estates of the victims) to 
contact us about it." 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we're absolutely sure there's not a mix-up of names, we would go 
out . . . to try to get people the money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is entirely different from the industry. Like most insurance companies, 
people tend to wait to see if you're going to make a claim, or if someone even 
knows that there's a claim in this area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diners Club casualty insurance coverage is also in effect when members are 
using frequent-flier awards to fly free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Discover card offers some of the highest in-flight protection in the 
industry, paying out $500,000 for death occurring due to a plane accident. The 
insurance also covers dismemberment; benefits vary with the severity of the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with credit card and employer-provided life insurance plans, there is 
always the option of buying even more coverage from the card companies and 
elsewhere, including at airport booths. 
</P>
<P>
 Some consumer groups have suggested that per-trip insurance plans covering 
only in-flight accidents may be a more expensive way to go compared to, say, a 
basic term-insurance policy that would offer year-round protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But spur-of-the-moment add-on insurance protection remains popular. Tele-Trip 
Inc., a subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha and the largest provider of insurance in 
airports, says 50,000 of its policies are sold at self-service airport units in 
the United States every year.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; THIS IS YOUR MILEAGE GURU SPEAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Petersen has more frequent-flier miles than most people will accumulate 
in a lifetime -- about 5 million so far. But he doesn't use them for free 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Petersen, 43, has used the miles to build a small publishing empire 
and to establish himself as the nation's preeminent guru of frequent-flier 
programs. Petersen and his company, Frequent Flyer Services in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., publish InsideFlyer magazine, and he is widely quoted on most 
facets of the travel incentives industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent editorial, for example, Petersen took on Kevin Mitchell, president 
of the Business Travel Contractors Corp., a coalition of large businesses that 
are trying to get airlines to give corporate discounts to business passengers 
in lieu of frequent-flier miles. Mitchell has said he believes that employees 
who travel frequently for corporations would be understanding about giving up 
their mileage awards.  
</P>
<P>
 In the September issue of InsideFlyer, Petersen wrote: "Let's be honest here. 
It's one thing to completely and blatantly ignore the opinions and importance 
of frequent flyers; it is quite another story to make generalizing comments 
with the intent to reflect the thoughts of thousands and thousands of frequent 
flyers. Thanks, Kevin, but I prefer to speak for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, Petersen is himself a voice for thousands of frequent fliers, who 
contact his organization with their pet peeves and desires regarding 
frequent-traveler programs. Hotels and airlines also consult him for 
suggestions on how to improve or change their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "His credibility factor is strong," said Gordon Lambourne, a spokesman for 
Marriott Hotels Corp. "He is considered unbiased. He's not a slick marketing 
person."  
</P>
<P>
 Petersen describes himself as "just one of those goofy guys who always read 
the fine print at the bottom of the ticket."  
</P>
<P>
 Such reading paid off in the early 1980s, when he wound up with a free 
vacation in Hawaii at a time when many people were still unfamiliar with 
frequent-flier miles. Friends and co-workers starting asking questions about 
flying for free.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got this reputation," Petersen said. Whenever the topic of free travel or 
frequent-flier miles came up, people would say, "Go ask Randy."  
</P>
<P>
 So many people asked him, in fact, that in 1985 he quit his job as a sales 
manager for a large menswear firm to start InsideFlyer.  
</P>
<P>
 "In 1985, there was still some debate as to whether frequent-flier programs 
were a fad or gimmick," Petersen said. He was convinced they had a future.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, in addition to publishing the magazine, Petersen consults for hotels 
and airlines, offers frequent-flier insurance to protect travelers from 
carriers going out of business, and is diversifying into on-line information 
services. His 40-employee company also offers programs for businesses and 
individuals to help them capture the most free mileage from their travels. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen has a loyal following of "mileage junkies," said Laurie Berger, 
editor of Frequent Traveler, a monthly magazine published by Official Airline 
Guides in Secaucus, N.J., that provides a wide range of information for 
business travelers. It too recognizes Petersen's expertise, and has tapped him 
as a monthly guest columnist beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's anyone's name that is synonymous with frequent-flier programs, 
it's Randy's," Berger said. "He's been around a long time, and he really knows 
what he's talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 When Petersen started InsideFlyer, there were only about 20 programs to track, 
he said. Now he monitors about 75 frequent-flier and frequent-stay programs.  
</P>
<P>
 He tries to fly the fine line between consumer and industry. The magazine 
accepts advertising, but Petersen often criticizes policies and program 
changes.  
</P>
<P>
 And though he gets offers of free travel all the time, he spends about 
$100,000 a year on trips. He pays his way so he can get the same experiences as 
his readers, he said. "I need to see for myself how the programs work."  
</P>
<P>
 He also spreads his travel dollars around, said Ken Heldt, a business 
associate from Petersen's days in menswear who is now managing director of 
Frequent Flyer Services. "If he goes somewhere for four nights, he stays in a 
different hotel each night." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for the miles he accumulates himself, he rarely uses them. Instead he gives 
them to employees as incentives or donates them to nonprofit organizations for 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Petersen is not in the air racking up miles, he can usually be found on 
the phone. "I talk to 12 programs and about 200 readers a week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this near obsession with being up to date on what is happening in the 
industry that has garnered him a reputation for being both thorough and fair.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's constantly calling and checking on things," Marriott Hotels' Lambourne 
said, adding that Petersen isn't shy about pointing out gimmicks that don't 
serve travelers well. "You could credit Randy for helping keep the industry 
honest. He's helped give programs meaningful value."  
</P>
<P>
 For example, in what has become an industry tradition, Petersen publishes his 
annual "Freddie Awards," which are tantamount to the Tony awards for 
frequent-use programs.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons Petersen has such a strong reputation is that he's been at 
the game longer than anyone else, said Chris McGinnis, a travel consultant in 
Atlanta and author of "202 Tips Even the Best Business Travelers May Not Know." 
</P>
<P>
 "He got in before there was an objective voice out there and just snatched up 
the market," McGinnis said.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a market he helped create, but it's also one he expects will endure. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say frequent-flier miles are like Green Stamps -- that eventually 
they'll go away," Petersen said. "I don't think so. The day you can earn 
frequent-flier miles buying flowers and eating at restaurants, you know they're 
here to stay."

 Smoking: The United States, Canada and Australia signed an agreement this week 
to ban smoking on flights operated by their airlines among the three countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Transportation Department, which announced the accord at a meeting of 
the International Civil Aviation Organization, said the ban applies to nonstop 
flights and takes effect in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said that "this significant agreement 
will reduce a health hazard to passengers and enhance safety on many 
international flights." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We expect this action to encourage other countries to ban smoking 
on international flights." 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said the accord is an important first step toward the organization's goal 
of banning smoking on international flights by July 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agreement does not apply to flights operated via an intermediate point 
in a country not a signatory to the pact or to flights chartered by a person, 
company or organization that are not operated for paying passengers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 KLM fares: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said this week that it will offer reduced 
business-class fares on most of its intercontinental routes. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer, which expires April 1, features a 20% to 35% discount on the normal 
business fare and is available only through travel agencies in the Netherlands. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The reduced fares do not apply to existing travel agreements between the 
airline and its corporate clients, which account for about 80% of KLM's 
business-class travel.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; U.S. FIRMS, CUBA TURN AN EYE TO ENDING 30-YEAR TRADE 
FREEZE; COMMERCE: BUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S INSISTENCE ON REFORM MAKES 
IMMINENT CHANGE UNLIKELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca was here recently. So were executives 
from major U.S. pharmaceutical companies. And when Cuban officials hosted a 
reception in New York for U.S. businesses last month, about 100 firms showed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than three decades in which Cuba has been virtually off-limits to 
American business, there is a sense among many U.S. firms that change may be in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 This mood blends nicely with the hope among government officials and ordinary 
citizens here that U.S. business people may be coming back, helping to lift the 
struggling country from its prolonged depression. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration is insisting on democratic reform in Cuba 
before any moves toward lifting the embargo begin. Under that criterion, the 
prospects for change seem dim at the moment, because political repression has 
been on the increase, according to human rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizardo Sanchez, leader of the Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National 
Reconciliation, said dozens of dissidents have been detained and given stern 
warnings in recent weeks. He himself received death threats from state security 
agents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, the government's second-ranking official, Raul Castro, the 
president's brother, said recently that if a second party were allowed to 
compete here, it would be an "imperialist party," meaning pro-American. That, 
he said, "we will never permit." 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the embargo remains intact, many of the most attractive investments 
here are being gobbled up by America's competitors. Raul Taladrid, vice 
minister in the Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation, said 
about 650 joint ventures already operate in Cuba, and a similar number are on 
the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 With Spanish firms taking the lead, tourism has become the country's most 
dynamic sector. Taladrid said in an interview last week that 700,000 tourists 
are expected to visit the island this year, spending $700 million. He expects a 
30% increase in both categories next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Carlson, executive vice president of Minneapolis-based Carlson Co., said 
700,000 tourists is "a small number compared to the potential" for Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson, with its hotel, restaurant and travel agency chains, is poised with 
other firms to leap into Cuba once ground rules permit. Some business people 
are coming here for a firsthand look. Iacocca, now involved in the 
entertainment business, visited Cuba in July and met with President Fidel 
Castro. Neither side will say what was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most active foreign investors are from Mexico and Canada, the two 
partners of the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadians have made a large investment in Cuban nickel, while Mexicans are 
into oil refining, telecommunications and cement. The citrus industry is 
attracting Israeli investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommunications is one of the few areas legally open to American firms, and 
a number of carriers are hoping to make a profit off U.S.-Cuban phone service, 
now being modernized for the first time in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Other American firms, though still barred from doing business, have signed 
letters of intent with Cuban enterprises, giving them an inside track if the 
two countries somehow find a way to be more neighborly after three decades of 
hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 Internationally, the U.S. embargo has scant support -- a fact reinforced last 
week when the U.N. General Assembly voted 101 to 2, with 48 abstentions, to 
oppose the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The embargo against the Communist nation seems to many here and in the United 
States to be an anomaly. Just this year, the White House reopened trade with 
Vietnam, dropped a threat to cut back on trade with China and is talking about 
opening trade with Communist North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic political considerations are at the heart of hard-line policy toward 
Cuba. So far, the Administration is still ardently courting the south Florida 
Cuban exile vote, much of which strongly supports the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Many influential figures in the United States, including some conservatives, 
question Clinton's policy. Former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski 
favors negotiations with Cuba on political issues, contending that the current 
policy is too rigid and is intensifying social and political tensions on the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Democrat, a publication of moderate Democrats, said in an editorial in 
its current edition that the Administration should lift some restrictions on 
dealing with Cuba in return for moves toward capitalist reform.

 Foreign Currency in Russia Curbed Again: The country's central bank is further 
restricting use of foreign currency in an attempt to defend the ruble, which 
crashed last month. A special commission blamed the crisis on the government 
and commercial banks.The central bank has begun to tighten enforcement of a 
regulation forbidding the deposit or withdrawal of foreign currencies from 
Russian banks unless account holders can prove they are exporting or importing 
the bank notes, a spokesman said. The ruble fell 27% on Oct. 11, but recovered 
most of its losses two days later. The fall triggered the departure of the 
finance minister and the central bank governor and led to a doubling in the 
monthly inflation rate. The Russian Security Council reported to President 
Boris Yeltsin that the finance ministry, the central bank and "certain" 
commercial banks engineered the fall of the ruble for their own profit.

 Canadian Leader to Head Trade Mission to China: Prime Minister Jean Chretien 
will lead his nation's largest-ever trade delegation to China on Friday in 
search of billions of dollars worth of business and a market for Canadian 
nuclear reactors. But the delegation of about 250 members -- scheduled to visit 
Beijing and Shanghai over five days -- has come under fire from human rights 
groups that say the Liberal government has sacrificed principle in the pursuit 
of commercial gain. Chretien is expected to sign a nuclear cooperation treaty 
in Beijing that will open the door to the sale of Canadian heavy-water 
reactors.

DANISH CORPORATION AGREES TO BUY MAJORITY OF LASER PRECISION STOCK; 
ACQUISITIONS: OFFER BUMPS UP PRICE OF SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO FIRM'S STOCK BY 94 
CENTS. DEAL TO CLOSE DEC. 2.

<P>
 Laser Precision Corp. said Wednesday it has agreed to sell a majority of its 
outstanding stock to a Danish corporation for $8 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Laser Precision, a San Juan Capistrano manufacturer of equipment for the 
installation, testing and repair of fiber-optic cables, said its board has 
accepted an offer from GN Great Nordic Ltd. and will recommend that investors 
approve the bid. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two-thirds of Laser Precision's outstanding shares must be tendered 
by Dec. 2 for the deal to be finalized. GN Great Nordic would eventually 
acquire all of Laser Precision's shares, putting the total value of the 
purchase at more than $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the agreement boosted Laser Precision's stock in Wednesday's Nasdaq 
trading. It closed at $7.81 a share, up 94 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock hit a high of $16.50 in 1991 but has performed erratically since 
then. It has fallen from $9.86 a share in November, 1993, to a low of $3.63 a 
share in July. It rebounded in late October amid speculation that an offer for 
the company was pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Laser Precision maintains its headquarters in San Juan Capistrano, it 
has only five employees there. It sold its Orange County manufacturing 
operation three years ago and now has most of its 155 employees in Utica, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1993, the company reported a loss of $500,000 on revenue of $24.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 GN Great Nordic, a manufacturer and supplier of telecommunications equipment, 
reported 1993 revenue of about $240 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase of Laser Precision would be "a complementary acquisition" for GN 
Great Nordic, said a spokesman for investment bank S.G. Warburg & Co., which is 
managing the transaction. "They think it will help them build . . . their 
telecommunications business." 
</P>
<P>
 If the offer is approved by Laser Precision's shareholders, the company would 
become a subsidiary of GN Great Nordic, and its stock would no longer be 
publicly traded. Laser Precision at a Glance

INFOTEC LANDS HIGH-TECH RUSSIAN DEAL; PROJECT: THE SANTA ANA FIRM WILL HELP SET 
UP A COMPUTERIZED PROPERTY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM LINKING ALL REPUBLICS 
AND REGIONS IN THE FEDERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Waxing philosophical about a property information system might seem unlikely, 
but Daniel Abraham maintains that the future of the Russian Federation might 
depend on having one. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham is vice president of Infotec Development Inc., the Santa Ana high-tech 
computer systems developer that has just won a contract to help the Russian 
government set up a private land management system, along with the 
record-keeping required to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 Infotec heads a team of U.S. companies conducting a $610,000 feasibility study 
for the Russian Federation. If the preliminary results are promising, the 
federation -- which encompasses nine time zones, 150 million people and an 
eighth of the world's land -- would spend almost $2 billion to develop a 
comprehensive record-keeping system incorporating computers for a region where 
the terms "private" and "property" haven't been linked for more than seven 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 For Infotec, which has about 500 employees and $100 million a year in sales, 
landing the lead role in developing the Russian Land Cadastre Program would 
nearly double its revenue and create several hundred jobs in the United States 
and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would redefine what this company is," Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would help the Russian Federation define what it will become. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian officials heading the project "firmly believe it is essential for 
overall reform," Abraham said. "If the people can have private home and 
property ownership, then they have a reason to make the country work" without 
reverting to communism, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting up the system would be a huge undertaking. The program is a 
complicated linking of the financial, legal and physical aspects of property 
ownership, and never before has there been an attempt to create a unified 
system for an area as large as the Russian Federation. (The 89 republics and 
regions that make up the federation cover nearly 6.6 million square miles -- 
more than 8,000 times the size of Orange County and just under twice the size 
of the United States.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians want a system that would enable a citizen in a central registry 
in Moscow, for example, to pull up records for a single-family home 4,000 miles 
away on the Kamchatka peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for the program, Abraham said, came from the Russian Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were looking for ways to apply some of their former military technology 
to (federation President Boris N.) Yeltsin's land reforms" and asked a U.S. 
businessman with ties to Eastern and Central Europe for advice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The businessman was Larry Nelson, a principal of Dallas-based Texas 
International Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started looking in the U.S. for companies that could do this type of 
thing," Abraham said, "and through contacts in Washington he heard of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Infotec, founded in Santa Ana in 1979 by computer systems specialists Fernando 
Niebla and Joseph Soulia, specializes in design and installation of 
sophisticated information management networks. The company also does data 
collection and management work for private and government agencies, including 
the FBI, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the Air Force and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas International and Infotec joined forces in 1992 to market their services 
to the Russians and earlier this year won the feasibility study contract, 
Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Infotec heads the team, which also includes Keith Cos., a Costa Mesa 
engineering and land mapping firm; Geonex, a Florida mapping company, and 
Jenkins & Gilchrist, a Dallas law firm that is advising the Russians on real 
estate-related laws that would have to be enacted to create a basis for the 
land record system. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas International, Abraham said, is responsible for securing financing for 
the program. The first phase is being funded by the U.S. Trade and Development 
Agency, which sees the feasibility study as a foot in the door for other U.S. 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Bank, Abraham said, has committed $80 million for an initial phase 
of the program if the federation decides to move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the feasibility study, the Infotec team is staging a monthlong 
exhibit in Moscow next month. More than 40 U.S. companies involved in computer 
hardware and software development, computer-assisted drafting and mapping, 
surveying and other related fields will be able to display their products and 
services, Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several European companies also have said they will attend in the hope of 
landing part of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Federation has also issued an open invitation for companies to 
build prototypes for individual "counties" within the 89 republics and regions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Canadians are spending about $3 million to do one," Abraham said. "And 
there are others being done by companies backed by Sweden, Denmark, Germany and 
Australia. But there are no U.S. pilot projects, and that makes it difficult 
for us as the American leaders of the feasibility study to push for American 
technology. The other governments are outspending the U.S. government" to 
promote their own corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 To help counter that, Infotec is hosting a delegation of Russian land program 
officials on an eight-day trip to Southern California in mid-November. In 
addition to visiting Infotec, the delegates will review land record systems in 
Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also want to see how all stages of the program work, so they will see 
how we sell land and do escrows and make mortgages and issue title insurance 
and development plans -- all things that are new to them," said Boris Gurevich, 
Infotec's marketing director for the Russian program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that seeing U.S. equipment and systems in action will help show 
them the advantages of using U.S. companies," Gurevich said.

ROCKWELL POSTS PROFIT, ANALYSTS CITE DIVERSIFICATION; EARNINGS: COMPANY MAKES 
$634.1 MILLION IN LATEST FISCAL YEAR, UP FROM $561.9 MILLION. GROWTH IS 
ATTRIBUTED TO COMMERCIAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEALINGS.

<P>
 Continuing its successful expansion beyond the defense and aerospace 
industries, Rockwell International Corp. Wednesday reported a profit of $634.1 
million for its latest fiscal year, up 13% from earnings of $561.9 million for 
the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual revenue rose from $10.84 billion to $11.12 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The results reflect the "continuing significant shift of Rockwell's business 
to higher-growth commercial and international markets," said Donald R. Beall, 
the company's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gains were strongest in the company's automation and telecommunications 
business units, Beall said, which together posted an annual sales increase of 
23%. Those units make products such as modems for personal computers and 
vehicle components. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Rockwell's results were in line with their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, they were on track," said Cai Von Rumohr, who follows the company 
for the brokerage Cowen & Co. in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, based in Seal Beach, has been among the most successful of the large 
aerospace companies, analysts said, in making the transition into civilian and 
international markets as U.S. defense spending shrinks. With commercial and 
international customers accounting for about 65% of its sales, Rockwell now 
describes itself as "a diversified high-technology company." 
</P>
<P>
 "All these guys are trying to restructure and keep their costs in line," Von 
Rumohr said. "I think Rockwell saw it coming sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with BT Securities in New York, said Rockwell has 
excelled at reinvesting its profits from the military buildup of the 1980s as 
well as work for NASA on the space shuttle program. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have run a careful, conservative ship," Demisch said of Rockwell's 
executives. "They decided back when the B1 (strategic bomber program) was going 
strong that they'd take their money and invest it in more industrial-market 
applications." 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell said its annual results were boosted by a strong fourth quarter. For 
the three months ended Sept. 30, the company reported a profit of $165 million, 
or 75 cents a share, up 10% from earnings of $150 million, or 68 cents a share, 
for the same period a year earlier. Three-month revenue was $2.9 billion, up 
from $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings per share for the fiscal year were $2.87, up from $2.55 for the 
previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Rockwell's stock 
dropped 37.5 cents a share to close at $35. Rockwell on a Roll

A LOOK AT WHAT IT TAKES TO CREATE A LAND CADASTRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County company is helping Russia set up a system so esoteric that 
few outside the fields of land planning and property taxation have ever heard 
of it: a land cadastre. 
</P>
<P>
 The "land" part is self-evident; it's "cadastre" that throws people.The word 
was coined by Napoleon Bonaparte in the early 1800s to describe a systematic 
classification and valuation of all French lands under control of the 
government. The word comes from the Greek term katastichon, meaning "line by 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 The modern cadastre is a system in which all of the tax, financial and legal 
records pertaining to a piece of land are linked together, said Daniel Abraham, 
vice president of Infotec Development Inc., the Santa Ana company heading a 
study of the feasibility of creating a cadastre that would keep track of every 
parcel of property in the Russian Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like linking together everything that the tax assessor, the county 
recorder and the county surveyor do," Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Russia, the first step will be to enact laws that recognize private 
property. Next, the federation will have to set tax rates and establish zoning 
and planning codes and surveying standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the cadastre team can file each parcel in a computer log that will 
contain a map, a legal description of the boundaries, and other details such as 
its legal title, physical description, improvements on the land, the zoning 
classification, tax rates and liens, if any, against the title. The files, 
Abraham said, might even include copies of plans for buildings and building 
additions. 
</P>

 The last time an entire nation put together such a land program, Abraham said, 
was in the early 1900s, when Australia did so. The United States and most other 
countries, by contrast, have developed and maintained their property record 
systems locally.

 'Megadealer' in Irvine: When Auto Age/Dealer Business magazine listed the 
nation's 100 largest "megadealers" earlier this month, it listed Webb 
Automotive Group as being in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 26th-largest group in the country, with eight dealerships and $379.2 
million in 1993 sales, actually has considered Irvine its home for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Lewis Webb bought a trio of franchises in the Irvine Auto Center in 
October, 1989, and moved his favorite desk and chair from the Cerritos Auto 
Center to Irvine shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company didn't make much of the move -- its corporate stationery still 
lists a Cerritos address. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Webb Automotive -- omitted from a Times Orange County listing 
earlier this month -- becomes the third of the nation's 100 largest megadealers 
to call Orange County home. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth major operation, Fletcher Jones Management Group, has a big presence 
here, with affiliates Fletcher Jones Motor Cars -- the Newport Beach Mercedes 
Benz dealership -- and Ted Jones Ford in Buena Park. But the corporate 
headquarters remains in Las Vegas.

 Hyundai's Big Push: Hyundai Motor America Inc. is getting ready to unveil the 
Accent, which replaces the Korean car maker's workhorse Excel for the 1995 
model year.  
</P>
<P>
 But executives at the company's Fountain Valley headquarters are looking far 
beyond the new subcompact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean parent company, Hyundai Motor Co., has launched a $5-billion plant 
expansion program in South Korea and intends to join the list of the world's 10 
largest car makers by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the push, Hyundai Motor America's Fountain Valley design studio has 
been working hard on several vehicles for the U.S. market, reportedly including 
a sports utility vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 Kia Motors Corp., which trails Hyundai in auto production but is South Korea's 
biggest truck maker, is introducing its sports utility -- the Sportage -- in 
North America next month through its Irvine-based U.S. arm, Kia Motors America.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In their book "Dealing With People You Can't Stand," Rick Brinkman and Rick 
Kirschner list 10 specific personality traits that represent people at their 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tank: Confrontational, pointed and angry, the ultimate in pushy and 
aggressive behavior. Solution: Command respect. Hold your ground, interrupt the 
attack, state your point in a non-threatening way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sniper: This covert operator identifies your weaknesses and uses them 
against you behind your back or in put-downs in front of others. Solution: To 
bring the sniper out of hiding, stop what you are saying, repeat what the 
individual has just said. Ask how that is relevant and perhaps confront them 
alone later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grenade: Explodes suddenly into unfocused ranting and raving about things 
that have nothing to do with the circumstances. Solution: Take control. Get 
their attention, reduce intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Know-It-All: Seldom in doubt, this person has a low tolerance for 
correction and contradiction but if something goes wrong you will be to blame. 
Solution: Open their mind to new ideas. Backtrack respectfully, blend their 
comments with yours, present your views indirectly, turn know-it-alls into 
mentors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Think-They-Know-It-All: This person doesn't know much but doesn't let that 
get in the way. Exaggerating, bragging, misleading and distracting, they pull 
you off track. Solution: Give their bad ideas the hook. Give them a little 
attention, ask them to clarify, give an account of the real situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yes Person: Quick to agree, slow to deliver, the Yes Person leaves a trail 
of unkept commitments and broken promises in an attempt to please. Solution: 
Make it safe for them to talk honestly, help them plan, ensure commitment, 
strengthen the relationship with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maybe Person: Puts off crucial decisions until it's too late and the 
decisions make themselves. Solution: Establish a comfort zone, clarify their 
options, then ensure their follow-through. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nothing Person: This person provides no verbal or nonverbal feedback. They 
often act as if you're not there. Solution: Plan enough time, ask open-ended 
questions expectantly, lighten the conversation, try to guess what they're 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The No Person: Deadly to morale, able to defeat big ideas with a single 
syllable. Doleful and discouraging, they drive others to despair. Solution: Use 
them as a resource, leave the door open, acknowledge their good intent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whiner: They feel overwhelmed by an unfair world. Their standard is 
perfection and no one measures up. Solution: Listen for the main points, 
interrupt, shift the focus to solutions, draw the line.

ABOUT THOSE DIFFICULT COLLEAGUES: THERE ARE WAYS OF DEALING WITH THEM;

<P>
 You just started a new job and your boss comes storming over to set you 
straight: There's no room for slackers in his outfit . . . don't even consider 
wasting time . . . there's plenty of other people around who need your job! 
</P>
<P>
 The barrage goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 You've been targeted by a Tank. At least, that's how physicians Rick Kirschner 
and Rick Brinkman, who have studied and written about difficult people, 
identify such a personality. 
</P>
<P>
 But your career isn't doomed even if your boss is a Tank, Kirschner and 
Brinkman say. You can succeed with impossible people by understanding their 
personalities and handling them appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirschner and Brinkman have written a book, "Dealing With People You Can't 
Stand," that outlines 10 types of difficult personalities and how to address 
the idiosyncrasies of each. Besides the Tank, the list includes the Sniper, the 
Grenade, the Know-It-All, the Whiner and the Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of a Tank, "people's normal reaction is to do exactly what will 
make the situation worse," Brinkman said in a recent interview. "If someone's 
throwing a tantrum, the wrong answer would be to blast them back or withdraw." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Kirschner said, the goal is to re-establish your self-respect and 
control -- perhaps a tall order when someone's going after your self-esteem 
with a 10-gauge shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 One way that can be achieved is to hold your ground, calmly interrupting the 
tirade by repeating the person's name, quickly backtracking from their main 
point, then stating yours briefly and in a non-threatening way. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Luckey has used the Kirschner-Brinkman advice. Luckey, who helped create 
a program for troubled teens in Grants Pass, Ore., recently renegotiated her 
group's contract with state officials. During her presentation, one man 
repeatedly interrupted with hostile comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was invalidating what I was saying. It was a power struggle," Luckey said. 
"Normally, I would have been quiet and let my ideas die at the table." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, she waited for the official to finish and calmly began 
again with, "As I was saying. . . ." After several such attempts to cut her 
off, the man realized she wasn't about to abandon her position and let her 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sniper, another of the personalities on the Kirschner-Brinkman hit parade, 
learns your weak spots and uses them against you. The Grenade explodes suddenly 
into unfocused ranting and raving. The Nothing person refuses to communicate, 
while the Know-It-All is closed to new ideas. The Whiner complains and 
complains. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain types of organizational structures breed such difficult personalities, 
and that can hurt corporate productivity, Brinkman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bureaucratic environment, for example, employees whine because they feel 
helpless, he said. Such an atmosphere also leads to negativism: Workers know 
how things could be done better, but they are embittered because they know 
change isn't a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a company, Brinkman said, the chairman or president usually sets the 
tone. At a Seattle software company Brinkman has worked with, the 
environmentally conscious owners frown on conflict. Anyone who tries to push 
projects forward with a bulldozer approach is quickly shoved aside. There's no 
conflict, but little gets done, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrie S. Grieff, a Harvard University psychiatrist, has another approach to 
working with difficult people: Look at the source of the problem. Grieff said 
there are three reasons why you may not be getting along with someone: You are 
too similar, you have different values or you are not communicating adequately. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so now you know what the problems are. What are the solutions? 
</P>
<P>
 Brinkman and Kirschner list four approaches to dealing with unpleasantness: 
</P>
<P>
 * Suffer in silence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for a new job. Not all situations are resolvable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Change your attitude about a difficult person. Decide, for example, that you 
may not like the individual but you work well together and that's the most 
important aspect of your relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 * Change your behavior, which means the difficult person must learn new ways 
to deal with you. How is that achieved? Often, using simple techniques that 
involve reducing the differences between you, or just listening. 
</P>
<P>
 A technique that Kirschner and Brinkman identify as "blending" can involve 
repeating what the colleague has just said to you. That often throws them off 
balance by forcing them to listen to what you -- and they -- are saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieff emphasizes communication -- asking others for opinions about the 
situation and then confronting the person in a friendly manner armed with your 
new information. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, that is an option few people choose, preferring to bluff their 
way through difficult situations. They feel intimidated, uncomfortable with the 
idea of a confrontation or are afraid to take risks. 
</P>
<P>
 The downsizing and layoffs at many companies have made people less likely to 
take chances, and problems often escalate, Grieff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate mergers have also created fertile breeding ground for conflict, 
forcing people to work with a whole new group of colleagues, said Mitchell 
Marks, an organizational psychologist with Delta Consulting Group. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are not happy about the person you are working with, you will hold 
back information, and that breeds distrust," Grieff said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a person who deals with unpleasantness and conflict is usually more 
effective as a leader, Brinkman and Kirschner say. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo, who are holistic physicians, also believe dealing constructively with 
conflict is a key to good health. Stress from the workplace caused by a 
difficult co-worker or boss takes an enormous toll on the body, Kirschner said. 
Indeed, Kirschner and Brinkman say that, with a little practice, handling a 
difficult personality should be fun, rather than a chore.

NO ONE IS GIVING UP THE QUEST; RAMS: BALTIMORE AND ANAHEIM OFFICIALS SAY THEY 
ARE NOT DISCOURAGED BY SHAW'S FOCUS ON ST. LOUIS NEGOTIATIONS.

 Officials in Baltimore and Anaheim weren't making any concession speeches 
Wednesday in response to reports that indicate St. Louis has taken the lead in 
the race for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're out of the hunt," said Baltimore Oriole owner Peter 
Angelos, who is attempting to purchase a minority interest in the Rams and move 
them to Maryland. "Baltimore is the best football town in America, and St. 
Louis isn't even close." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Wedin, chairman of the Orange County Economic Development Consortium and 
a member of the Save the Rams task force, was hardly discouraged by news that 
Ram President John Shaw is giving St. Louis every opportunity to complete a 
deal to have the team play there in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a death blow," Wedin said. "It's just another step in the process. 
It doesn't dissuade us from what we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Angelos was perplexed by Shaw's comments. A sticking point in 
Baltimore's negotiations has been Angelos' insistence on obtaining majority 
ownership in the team at some point. Ram owner Georgia Frontiere has been 
adamant about maintaining her controlling interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said if Angelos changes his stance, then Baltimore will be measured 
equally with St. Louis. But Angelos, who will meet with Shaw in Los Angeles on 
Friday, does not appear willing to back off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I'm not prepared to relinquish any position we hold," Angelos 
said. "I don't want to jump to any position without reasonable discussion. I 
don't know why (Shaw) said that. It sounds like he's negotiating in the paper, 
and that's not like John." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos said he wants "eventual control of an NFL franchise if it comes to 
Baltimore -- that will prevent any repetitions of past history." Baltimore was 
spurned by the Colts, who moved to Indianapolis after the 1984 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Control can take many forms," Angelos said. "It does not mean those who are 
not Marylanders can't own a portion of the team or even a majority of the team. 
What I mean by control is a guarantee that once a franchise locates here in a 
new stadium, we need to know that no one will remove that franchise from 
Baltimore." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos also couldn't understand why Shaw questioned the solidity of a 
$160-million bond that Maryland politicians set aside for construction of a 
football stadium in Camden Yards. "It looks like the bonding is in place, but 
there's always a risk," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an effort to reallocate those funds last winter, but Maryland Gov. 
William Donald Schaefer successfully fought to keep the bond in place. Schaefer 
leaves office in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may concern John because he's in California and doesn't understand the 
local political picture," Angelos said. "But I predict confidently that the 
bond will remain intact until we have secured an NFL franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis, which is constructing a 70,000-seat domed stadium, is trying to 
raise at least $60 million through a seat licensing program to pay for $30 
million the Rams owe for Anaheim Stadium improvements, $15 million in expected 
NFL relocation costs and $15 million for a new practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos said Baltimore can match St. Louis' offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our proposal covers the need for paying those obligations," he said. "And our 
proposal does not include selling license fees to prospective purchasers of 
season tickets. If necessary, that would be included, and our people would 
support it. I have substantial doubt that St. Louis would." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Save the Rams officials have been bombarding the NFL 
commissioner's office and other league owners with letters showing the area's 
support for the Rams. They have remained in constant contact with Shaw about 
their plans to renovate Anaheim Stadium, build a practice facility and 
guarantee season ticket and luxury suite sales, but little negotiation has 
taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave him two different proposals, but he's never come back to us and said, 
'Here's what you're offering, here's what we'd like to see,' " said Frank 
Bryant, Rams' booster club president and task force member. "It's like bidding 
against yourself at an auction. It's very difficult to respond when you have 
nothing to respond to." 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams also continues to press for a meeting with Frontiere to discuss 
the emotional issues that could make it difficult for her to move the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to eventually be relegated to finding out where Georgia is, 
renting a helicopter and dropping a bunch of leaflets on her," Bryant said. "I 
think we at least deserve a few minutes to meet with her."SPORTS FRANCH

EIGHT-MAN STAR HAS POTENTIAL FOR BIG TIME; DIVISION I SCHOOLS GIVING ST. 
MARGARET'S MASTERS A LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even guys on the outskirts of high school football can dream. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Margaret's quarterback Bobby Masters doesn't play for a powerhouse, not 
even by eight-man football standards. But his future has possibilities. Some 
that are on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, a small-school player took center stage in a big-time college 
football game. Heisman Trophy-candidate Rashaan Salaam, who leads the NCAA in 
yards rushing per game, led Colorado into its nationally televised clash with 
Nebraska Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Salaam was playing eight-man football at La Jolla Country Day 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although he played eight-man, when I saw Salaam in high school there was no 
doubt that he was a Division I prospect," said Dick Lascola, who owns the 
Fallbrook-based Scouting Evaluation Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 And now, some Division I recruiters are knocking at Masters' door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earlier in high school, I wasn't even remotely considering playing football 
in college," said Masters, a 6-foot-3 1/2, 185-pound senior. "I'm just out 
there to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I visited Southern Methodist and Baylor, and just thinking that I 
could have the chance to play there maybe . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 8, Masters saw SMU play at Baylor during an unofficial visit, and there 
he met some of the players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to go into the locker rooms and watch the game from the field," Masters 
said. "It was neat to see some of those guys that you see on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Baylor and SMU feel Masters could be one of those players. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters has modest numbers this season, completing 48% of his passes for 872 
yards with nine touchdowns and nine interceptions in seven games. He also has 
rushed for 419 yards and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't have the eye-popping numbers that Salaam amassed in high school. In 
Salaam's career, he rushed for more than 4,900 yards, scored 105 touchdowns, 
averaged 11.5 yards per carry, and led his team to three consecutive section 
championship games. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other things that recruiters and talent evaluators covet in 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby is a unique athlete," said Jim Walsh, a sports consultant based in 
Laguna Hills. "I've seen him play nose guard, linebacker, free safety, 
cornerback, tailback and quarterback, in one game. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a quarterback, I saw him one time where he rolled out to his right, and 
fired the ball 66 or 68 yards upfield to his left. He's a hard worker who has 
shown talent, speed, flexibility, and courage, all things that coaches look 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton saw those qualities when Masters attended 
the Cougars' summer football camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only saw him a few times, but he has potential," Patton said. "Raw would be 
a good way to describe him. He's big, has a great arm and he throws the deep 
ball well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have started if he had transferred to Capo. He's coachable, 
intelligent and a he's a good kid. I like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Transferring to a big high school football program had some appeal to Masters, 
but he liked his current surroundings too much to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to stay at St. Margaret's and graduate with my friends," Masters 
said. "If fate has it that I'm supposed to play football in college, then I 
should be able to get a scholarship wherever I'm at." 
</P>
<P>
 Masters hopes Walsh will help him find his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh was an assistant football coach at Stanford from 1984-'87 and he was a 
running back with the Seattle Seahawks in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he helps hundreds of athletes, on a one-to-one basis, with strength and 
conditioning programs. He also advises them about the misconceptions and 
pitfalls of the recruiting process. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters has dominated the playing field at St. Margaret's, where he also 
starts for the basketball team and plays varsity baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have seen Bobby for the first time come up and tell me, 'Wow, he's 
a great player,' " St. Margaret's football Coach Brady Lock said. "I guess I've 
gotten used to having him around all the time. He plays everywhere for us." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 41-34 victory over Claremont Webb Oct. 22, Masters completed 14 of 18 
passes for 240 yards, rushed for 71 yards, and made 12 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week in a 46-40 loss to Palos Verdes Chadwick, Masters led the team 
with 17 tackles. He also rushed for 166 yards, filling in for the Tartans' 
injured starting tailback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tartans (3-4, 1-3), who play their final Prep League game Friday at 
Arcadia Rio Hondo Prep, aren't mathematically eliminated from the playoffs. 
Even if St. Margaret's wins Friday, they could finish in a three-way tie for 
third. So Lock isn't holding his breath waiting for a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters is doing the same waiting for potential scholarship offers. Patton 
said if the offers don't come rolling in, Masters could still benefit from 
playing at the community college level. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a lot of hard work, he could really develop," Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters is not the only small-school player in the area being recruited. 
Lascola said he has received numerous inquiries for game film and information 
about Judd Granzow of Canoga Park Faith Baptist. Granzow, a 6-3, 190-pound 
quarterback who was an All-Southern Section selection last season, also is a 
top-flight baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Patton said some Division I schools would consider it a gamble to 
spend a scholarship on unpolished talent, he's rooting for Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could potentially play at the Division I level," Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walsh is sold on Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may not know about Bobby, but he's definitely a diamond in the rough," 
Walsh said. "One thing that really struck me is his tremendous loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminded me of when I worked with Junior Seau. Junior could have gone to 
Vista High, where they had a strong football program, but he lived by Oceanside 
High and he chose to stay there. He's done pretty well, I'd say, making it to 
USC and with the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That type of character is hard to find." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh hopes the right college finds Masters.

PREP WATER POLO; FRESHMAN SPARKS FOOTHILL TO THIRD LEAGUE TITLE IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robby Arroyo is a newcomer to the fierce Century League water polo rivalry 
between Villa Park and Foothill, but Wednesday the freshman played like a 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo scored five goals and added two assists to lead the third-ranked 
Knights to a 14-5 victory over No. 6 Villa Park and give Foothill its third 
consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was virtually decided after one quarter when Foothill (19-5, 5-0) 
took a 5-0 lead behind Arroyo's play. 
</P>
<P>
 He fed Kevin Brantley with a perfect pass for the Knights' first score, then 
took a pass from Brantley and scored the next with only a minute gone in the 
quarter. Arroyo added two steals and another goal before the opening quarter 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out with lots of intensity," Foothill Coach Jim Brumm said. "That was 
our best first quarter of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans (19-7, 4-1), who won three league championships in a row before 
Foothill's streak, did not score until the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foothill defense was so tight that on several occasions Villa Park 
goalkeeper Jon Pharris could not find an open teammate for an outlet pass until 
most of the 35-second shot clock had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharris was eventually removed in the third quarter with his team trailing, 
9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans briefly rallied and cut the lead to 10-4 after three quarters, 
but Arroyo scored three of Foothill's last four goals in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park Coach Jeff Ehrlich said before the game that his team needed to 
take 24 shots and make 40% of them to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans made better than 50% of their attempts but were outshot 23 to 9.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; HAWAII SWEEPS LONG BEACH STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This probably won't make the morning after any easier for Long Beach State, 
but Hawaii women's volleyball Coach Dave Shoji said no opponent could have 
stopped his team Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 And you know what? He's probably right. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially considering the Wahine hadn't accomplished such a feat against Long 
Beach State in five years. Wednesday night, Hawaii swept Long Beach State, the 
defending national champion, 15-10, 15-5, 16-14, in a Big West Conference match 
before 1,326 at The Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time Long Beach State, ranked eighth in the nation, had been 
swept by Hawaii since Sept. 9, 1989. Hawaii, sixth-ranked, also is the last 
team to sweep Long Beach State at home, earning that distinction on Oct. 4, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the best volleyball we played all year," Shoji said. "We played at a 
high level throughout the match." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii's Therese Crawford had a team-high 18 kills, followed by Angelica 
Ljungquist's 17, including the match-ending kill in the third game. Traci Dahl 
led Long Beach State with 18 kills and Nichelle Burton contributed 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii's victory also ended an 11-game losing streak against the 49ers. 
Moreover, Hawaii (21-3, 14-2 in conference play) regained the conference lead 
over Long Beach State (18-4, 13-2). The Wahine have two conference matches left 
with Santa Barbara and the 49ers have three, against Irvine, San Jose State and 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 If tied at the season's conclusion, Long Beach State and Hawaii would share 
the conference championship because they split the season series. Long Beach 
State defeated Hawaii on Tuesday in five games, 15-10, 15-7, 10-15, 7-15, 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State appeared overwhelmed in the opening game Wednesday, trailing 
the Wahine, 11-0, at one point. But then the 49ers went on an equally 
impressive run. 
</P>
<P>
 A kill by Burton capped a 10-0 run and cut Hawaii's previously commanding lead 
to one, 11-10. But the rally seemed to take a lot out of Long Beach State, and 
the Wahine closed strong, ending the game on Joselyn Robins' kill.  
</P>
<P>
 In Golden State Athletic Conference men's soccer: 
</P>
<P>
 Point Loma Nazarene 4, Concordia 0 -- Former Irvine Valley and Capistrano 
Valley High's Jason Faulk knocked in two goals for Point Loma Nazarene (6-8-2, 
4-5-1). Bonner Rinn had 20 saves for Concordia (4-14-1, 0-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Westmont 3, Southern California College 0 -- Jeremy Tyger scored two goals to 
lead visiting Westmont. Brent Rogers recorded eight saves for Southern 
California College (5-13-2, 3-7). 
</P>
<P>
 In men's tennis: 
</P>
<P>
 ITA Southern California Regional -- UC Irvine's Lars Mohn, Joey Cabrera and 
Max Schlutz each lost qualifying matches in the first round at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters' Chris Tontz, ranked 67th in the nation, is seeded seventh. 
Other UCI qualifiers include Julian Foxon, David Chang, Kenny Cruz, Marc-Andre 
Tardif and Carmen Lindee. Main draw play begins today.

Kemp was fourth in 21:51. The Wildcats had five runners in the top 10.

KEEPING TRACK / JASON REID: MITCHELL ISN'T BUFFALOED BY LACK OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Erik Mitchell didn't think much of the conversation at the time, but maturity 
has an interesting way of illuminating things. 
</P>
<P>
 College football was the subject; Los Alamitos football Coach John Barnes the 
speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk occurred shortly after Mitchell and several Griffin teammates signed 
letters of intent in 1990. He turned down more than a dozen schools to accept a 
scholarship from Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Mitchell and his buddies were full of optimism -- and, admittedly, 
a little full of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told us that guys can get lost in big schools," Mitchell said. "He told 
us that sometimes coaches won't even know your name. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, I think I got lost. I didn't think it would happen to me, but 
now I know it can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell left the county with the credentials of a certifiable high school 
star. But after five mostly frustrating years as a Buffalo, Mitchell now knows 
about one of life's cruel realities: You don't always get what you want. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been disappointing," said Mitchell, 23. "When I was being recruited, 
(Colorado) Coach (Bill McCartney) said he would use me like Notre Dame used 
Rocket (Ismail). 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really looking for that, but it never happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem? 
</P>
<P>
 As with much in football, it's mostly a question of numbers not adding up. 
Mitchell is 5 feet 9 and 160 pounds -- after a big meal. 
</P>
<P>
 He started out at Colorado as a running back, the way he ended his Los 
Alamitos career. As a senior, Mitchell rushed for 1,038 yards and 20 
touchdowns, and caught 16 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But Big Eight linebackers are a tad bigger than the guys Mitchell faced in the 
Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to block," Mitchell said, "and that really didn't work out too well." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he won't receive any Heisman Trophy votes, Mitchell is far from a 
bust. He's the team's fastest player, covering 40 yards in 4.27 seconds, 
according to the Colorado media guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, a fifth-year senior, is a second-string cornerback and plays some 
when Colorado uses more than four defensive backs. He also is a key member of 
Colorado's kickoff and punt return teams. A communications major, Mitchell said 
he will graduate in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's coaching staff knows his name forward and backward. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore in 1992, he started the first four games at wide receiver and 
played in all 11. Mitchell finished with 10 catches for 125 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But last season, McCartney scrapped Colorado's three-receiver offense in favor 
of a two-receiver, two-tight end set. With receiving stars Charles Johnson and 
Michael Westbrook on campus, well, the math was simple: Mitchell was the odd 
man out. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't catch a pass last season. The coaching staff switched Mitchell to 
defense the week before Colorado's 41-30 victory over Fresno State in the Aloha 
Bowl, and Mitchell was impressive in 20 plays at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were always after him to play defense because he does have such commanding 
speed," said former Colorado defensive backs coach Greg Brown, now the Atlanta 
Falcons' secondary coach. "The problem for Erik was that he never really 
settled into one position. Everyone wanted a piece of him because of his 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Mitchell played in Colorado's 24-7 loss to Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the seniors really wanted that game," Mitchell said. "It hurt, but it's 
in the past and you have to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell seems to have learned a lot. 
</P>

 Former Brethren Christian running back Frank Brady scored his first touchdown 
for San Diego State in its 38-23 Western Athletic Conference victory over 
Hawaii on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A junior walk-on tailback, Brady is listed second on the Aztecs' depth chart. 
Brady (5-11, 190) has rushed for 119 yards in 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady had a career-high 84 yards rushing in 14 carries during the Aztecs' 
20-13 victory over New Mexico Oct. 15. Selected All-Olympic League as a senior, 
Brady led Brethren Christian in rushing that season with 1,000 yards and 15 
touchdowns.

 Senior defensive tackle Oscar Wilson (Santa Ana High and Rancho Santiago 
College) is a preseason Division I-AA All-American selection. Wilson (6-3, 282) 
-- The Times Orange County lineman of the year in 1988 and '89 -- shares the 
Matadors' team lead in sacks with five. His co-leader is freshman lineman Jeff 
Bodholdt (6-3, 255), formerly of Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior fullback Shaun Coleman (5-10, 225) played for Dana Hills High and 
Saddleback College. He is second on the team in rushing with 275 yards and four 
touchdowns in 50 carries.

 Ashleigh Cross is providing one of the few bright spots for Whitman College 
women's volleyball Coach Eddie Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross, a freshman outside hitter from University High, leads Whitman, an NAIA 
Division II school in Walla Walla, Wash., in several categories. She is first 
in kills (140) and digs (169), and is tied for the Missionaries' lead in aces 
with 20. Whitman is 3-20. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ashleigh has emerged as a true team leader," said Matthews, who starts five 
freshmen and a sophomore. "She's stepped in and filled a giant hole for us."

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: SCC VOLLEYBALL BLOODIED, NOT READY TO 
BOW OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given all that has gone wrong for the Southern California College women's 
volleyball team this season, you'd think Coach Eric Boyles would already be 
planning for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 15 players on SCC's opening-day roster, only five are entirely healthy 
and only one of those was a starter at the beginning of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative sample: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Middle blocker Genevie Wright is playing despite having a chronic case of 
mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outside hitter Celeste Young is playing despite a strained quadriceps. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outside hitter Simone Burgesmeir is out for the season with biceps 
tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Middle blocker Tiffany Worthy, who seriously sprained her ankle early in 
the season, finally got back to full strength in practice last week. But before 
she was able to play in a match, she aggravated a knee injury and will probably 
miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the ice-bag team," Boyles said. "After matches you think you're 
watching a football team -- all these people with ice bags on their shoulders; 
it looks like they're wearing shoulder pads." 
</P>
<P>
 But Boyles isn't packing it in. Somehow the Vanguards have survived the Golden 
State Athletic Conference, one of the toughest in the NAIA. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the eight conference teams been ranked in the top 25 at some point 
during the season. SCC spent one week at No. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards (17-9, 6-7 in the GSAC) finish the regular season by playing 
host to Cal Baptist (13-13, 6-7) on Saturday. The winner will finish fifth and 
avoid playing the first-place team in the first round of the conference 
playoffs Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno Pacific (20-7, 10-3) and Azusa Pacific (20-8, 10-3) are tied for first. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the Vanguards came close to upsetting Fresno and Azusa on 
consecutive nights, each time winning the first two games before losing the 
final three. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are forcing teams to play well to beat us and that's all I can ask of 
them," Boyles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Tonavanik, SCC's only healthy starter, had an outstanding match in a 
five-game victory over Biola Saturday. Tonavanik, a junior from Costa Mesa 
High, had 18 kills, second on the team to Janine Katter's 21. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 GSAC cross-country: The Southern California College men's team has a good 
chance to become the first team from the school to qualify for the NAIA 
national meet, Coach Bryan Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific, ranked fifth in the nation, and No. 9 Westmont are expected to 
finish first and second at the conference meet Saturday at Balboa Park in San 
Diego, but Wilkins says a strong third from the No. 15 Vanguards should earn 
them an at-large bid to the nationals, Nov. 19 in Kenosha, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC is paced by Jason Schaefer, a junior who qualified for the nationals as an 
individual last season, juniors Tim Hardin and Wes Hinson and freshman Jon 
Bischop. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's race, No. 11 Westmont and No. 14 Azusa Pacific should battle 
for the title. Wilkins said SCC will probably finish third, fourth or fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguard women were hurt when Nikee Pool, who qualified as an individual 
the last two seasons, was sidelined for the season because of a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Caren Anderson, a freshman from Mission Viejo High, is SCC's best hope to 
extend a six-year streak of qualifying at least one woman. She ran a personal 
best 19 minutes 31 seconds for five kilometers to finish 30th at the Bronco 
Invitational last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia's Donna Proia, a junior transfer from Irvine Valley, is another 
strong local runner. Proia, who helped Irvine Valley to the State community 
college title last year, wasn't able to train much in the summer, but is 
gaining ground. She ran a season best at the Bronco Invitational, finishing one 
place and one second behind Anderson. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bonus innings: It's college baseball's off-season, but Southern California 
College pitcher Ila Borders still had a busy weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday and Saturday, Borders, the first women to win a collegiate baseball 
game, filmed two 30-second commercials for a Japanese sporting goods firm. 
Sunday, she pitched in a charity baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 In two innings against minor league and major league players, Borders gave up 
two hits and an unearned run, struck out two and didn't walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of NAIA eligibility rules, Borders wasn't paid for the commercials, 
which were filmed at Orange Coast College, but the SCC baseball program is 
receiving a $5,000 donation that will help defray the costs for trips to San 
Francisco and Seattle this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Two Pacific Christian teams are playing in national championship tournaments 
this week. The women's volleyball team will start defense of its National 
Christian College Athletic Assn. Division II title today in Springfield, Mo. 
The Royals (20-9) are seeded second. The men's soccer team, third in Division 
II last season, is seeded third in the NCCAA Division II tournament in 
Lakeland, Fla., which starts today. The Royals are 12-2-2. . . . Chapman 
women's volleyball Coach Mary Cahill says she thinks the Panthers wrapped up an 
NCAA Division III playoff spot with a victory over La Verne Tuesday. The 
Panthers (23-7), ranked No. 4 in the western region, finish the regular season 
at No. 1 UC San Diego Friday, but Cahill said her team should still be picked 
even if it loses. Pairings will be announced Sunday. . . . The Chapman women's 
swimming team started its second season at the Occidental Relays Saturday and 
set three school records. Erin Nowak finished 50 yards in 31.27, 0.08 seconds 
better than the record Diane Werner set last year. Nowak, Werner, Eileen Shelly 
and Rachel Katz broke the 200-medley relay record by eight seconds, finishing 
in 2 minutes 22.11 seconds, and Werner, Katz, Jane Kramer and Robyn Garinger 
finished the 200 freestyle relay in 2:02.5, nearly eight seconds faster than 
the previous record. Chapman is at Loyola Marymount Friday and the 
Pomona-Pitzer Invitational Saturday. . . . Jamie Gardiner, a forward for the 
SCC women's soccer team, led the GSAC in scoring with 40 points. Gardiner, a 
sophomore from Sunny Hills High, had 17 goals and six assists. Joy Pelletier, a 
freshman from Brethren Christian, was fourth in the conference with 33 points 
(13 goals and seven assists). After a winless inaugural season in 1993, the 
Vanguards finished 6-11-2 this season.

MADDOX IS STILL WAITING FOR HIS CHANCE TO START; RAMS: AFTER THREE SEASONS IN 
THE NFL, FORMER BRONCO QUARTERBACK REMAINS A FRUSTRATED UNDERSTUDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1992, the Denver Broncos risked a first-round draft pick on UCLA sophomore 
Tommy Maddox, made him an understudy to John Elway and tagged him as their 
quarterback of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 But three seasons later, Maddox is still waiting . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Except now Maddox wears a Ram helmet and only plays Elway's role on the scout 
squad in practice as they prepare for Sunday's game against the Broncos at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, 34, remains one of the best quarterbacks in the game while Maddox, 23, 
languishes on the bench behind Chris Chandler and Chris Miller. Maddox, whom 
the Rams acquired for a fourth-round draft pick, has played in only one game, 
completing seven of 15 passes for 86 yards with two interceptions in an 8-5 
loss to Atlanta, a game he barely had any preparation for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody in this locker room who is not playing is going to be frustrated," 
Maddox said. "At least at Denver, if something happened to John, I had a shot 
at playing. That's the most frustrating thing going on right now. You just have 
to wait it out and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the NFL's new salary cap forced Denver to trade Maddox after he 
refused to take a pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams then restructured his contract, decreasing his salary to $550,000 but 
waiving the fourth and final season of his Denver deal. The new Rams' deal 
allows him to become a restricted free agent at the end of the season, giving 
the team right of first refusal and draft-pick compensation if he signs 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough situation for him here," Elway said Wednesday in a conference 
call from Denver. "Tommy has a lot of ability, and his expectations coming out 
of college were that he wanted to play right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it is about this town and their quarterbacks, but as a 
backup he took a lot of pressure because he never got the time to play. It was 
pretty hard on him. I think in the long run, a change of scenery is going to 
help him." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure of playing in Denver can be rough on young quarterbacks, as Elway 
can attest. His battles with former Bronco Coach Dan Reeves were 
well-documented. 
</P>
<P>
 And so were his struggles, particularly early in his career, with his 
celebrity status in a city that's nuts about football. Every move he made, on 
or off the field, was tomorrow's headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no middle of the road here," Elway said. "When times are good, 
there's no better place to be, but when times are rough, I don't know if 
there's a worse place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They live and breathe football there," Maddox said. "You're under the 
microscope when you play in the NFL, but you are really under the microscope 
when you're in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't expect you to miss a couple passes in a row. As great as John has 
played there, and as many things as he has done for the city, they'll still boo 
him if he goes out and plays crappy. They'll boo anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox backed up Elway for two seasons, starting four games as a rookie when 
Elway was injured. But Maddox rarely played last season, attempting only one 
pass, which he completed for a one-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy had an idea how long I was going to be here," Elway said. "I just told 
him to be patient and to learn as much as he can now. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just 20 when he first got here, and we couldn't even go out and have a 
beer together because he wasn't 21 yet. He's young and he has two years of 
experience in the league, and I think that will help him when he does become a 
starter." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver Coach Wade Phillips thought the deal worked out well for both teams. He 
thinks Maddox has a chance to play eventually with the Rams, and the Broncos 
got a fourth-round pick for him instead of losing him to free agency after the 
1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't going to have him after next year, so we wanted whatever we could 
get for him," Phillips said. "We traded with the Rams because we thought he 
would have an opportunity with them. We didn't want to send him just anywhere 
to get anything. We have some compassion for our players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have lost him to the Rams or somebody in a year. You can't keep 
backup people now that they've become free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "And John is going to play a few more years, so there wasn't much we could do. 
We were in a corner, and that was all we could do."

A PROG-ROCK RENAISSANCE?; POP BEAT: PROGFEST '94 WILL SHOWCASE THE GRANDIOSE 
GENRE'S NEW GENERATION. THE STANTON-BASED CO-DIRECTOR SAYS THE REVIVED STYLE 
THAT THE 2-DAY EVENT WILL FEATURE IS 'FRESH AND EXCITING.' 
</P>

<P>
 With punk albums now selling in the millions, it's obvious that anything is 
possible in the music business. Maybe even a comeback for progressive rock. 
</P>
<P>
 One prog-rock partisan who is pushing hard for a renaissance of the form is 
Greg Walker, the Stanton-based co-director of Progfest '94, a two-day event 
that will showcase the state of the grandiose art with concert marathons at the 
Variety Arts Center in Los Angeles on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing will be bands from Australia, Sweden, France, Utah, Pennsylvania, 
Los Angeles and Northern California. Except for Sebastian Hardie, a 
'70s-vintage Aussie band that has regrouped to make its first U.S. appearance 
at the festival, the lineup is made up of a contemporary wave of musicians who 
haven't given up on a style that most music pundits would say collapsed under 
its own considerable weight somewhere around the time that punk rock became a 
force in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker says that prog-rock never went away and that new bands have formed 
continuously since the early- to mid-'70s heyday, when British bands like Yes, 
Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Gentle Giant, King Crimson and Pink Floyd gave 
progressive rock its shining moment of critical esteem and commercial 
mass-appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more (progressive) groups now than in history," Walker said. "There 
has always been a huge underground demand; there's this whole network. One 
Italian label, Mellow, has put out more than 250 albums in the last two years. 
It's huge in Japan, monstrous in Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And pretty mastodonic at Walker's house, where, he says, his collection of 
progressive-rock albums now numbers about 5,000 titles. Walker, 29, was too 
young to catch what most rock fans consider the golden age of progressive rock, 
but he fell hard for it when he was in his mid-teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "My older brother had a few Genesis albums. Believe it or not, the first thing 
I heard was 'Duke,' " he said, referring to a 1980 Genesis album that signaled 
the band's turn away from ambitious prog-rock constructs in favor of the more 
pop-oriented style that propelled it to wider popularity. "Then I heard 
'Foxtrot' (a marvelous Genesis album from 1972) and I was knocked over." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker has since started his own label, Syn-Phonic Records, putting out 21 
titles that include albums by new prog-rock bands as well as reissues and 
excavations of obscure '70s stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Walker and David Overstreet, a Gardena-based prog-rock fanatic and 
label owner, organized the first annual Progfest, a single-day event that sold 
out UCLA's Royce Hall. Now they have expanded to two days of music at the 
1,000-capacity Variety Arts Center. The festival also includes a free 
convention/merchandise market from noon until 10 p.m. on Monday at the 
Hollywood Metropolitan Hotel, 5825 Sunset Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker says that Progfest is the only such event he knows of in the United 
States and that it will attract an international crowd of aficionados, with the 
festival-goers' average age in the late 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup on Saturday is Halloween (France), Kalaban (Utah), Echolyn 
(Pennsylvania) and Anglagard (Sweden). On Sunday, the bands are Episode 
(Northern California), Anekdoten (Sweden), Minimum Vital (France), Sebastian 
Hardie (Australia)and Giraffe (Los Angeles). Giraffe, led by Kevin Gilbert of 
Toy Matinee, will devote its set to an hourlong presentation of music from 
Genesis' 1974 opus, "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, for the record, rates "The Lamb" as one of his three all-time favorite 
prog-rock albums, along with Anglagard's "Hybris" (1992)and "YS," a 
1972-vintage release by the Italian band Il Balletto di Bronzo. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the classic progressive bands that have soldiered on into the '80s and 
'90s, he said, "Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull retained a level of respectability. 
But (the latter-day efforts by) Genesis, Yes and E.L.P. are just god-awful 
albums, compared to what they used to be and to some of the great things that 
are out now." 
</P>
<P>
 In this era of chaotic thrash 'n' grunge, Walker thinks the pendulum could 
swing back toward the progressive style, with its elegant, stately song 
structures and meticulous performance ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a younger generation coming up, looking for new things," he said. 
"If people want to discover something new, fresh and exciting, this is it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Progfest '94 takes place Saturday and Sunday from 3 p.m. to midnight at the 
Variety Arts Center, 940 S. Figueroa St., Los Angeles. $30 for both days; $20 
for one day. (310) 329-7254 (festival information ), or (714) 740-2000 
(Ticketmaster).

<P>
 ANOTHER OPENING, ANOTHER CLUB: As curtain-raisers go, the one for the Kurtain, 
the latest of Orange County's weekly rock soirees catering to a grass-roots 
alternative crowd, wasn't that auspicious. Despite a solid lineup of bands last 
Thursday, including Primitive Painters, Battery Acid, Psychic Rain and Her Own 
Hands, the draw at the all-ages, no-alcohol venue was just 80 fans, according 
to promoter Kevin Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Kurtain, which is hosted by the Tunnel dance club (formerly Club 
Remixx) in Orange, has the potential to be a significant room for both local 
and touring bands. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a broad, spacious place, located in a row of warehouses just off the 
Orange Freeway, and its ceiling and stage are good and high. The interior is 
bat-cave black and is equipped with the booming sound system and dazzling 
lighting effects that dance clubs want. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it seemed like a less chilly, less trend-oriented version of Club 
Postnuclear, the defunct Laguna Beach dance club that made an unsuccessful stab 
at booking national rock attractions five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The room's bare surfaces made for a somewhat glaring sound, a problem that 
might be helped with more people in it to absorb the decibels. A metal support 
pole near the middle of the club could be death to moshers, but the Tunnel's 
owner, Jason Brooks, plans to cover it with safety padding. (Better yet, cover 
the moshers with safety padding and let them slam against the walls instead of 
taking up their usual prime viewing space directly in front of the stage.) 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem for the Kurtain on opening night was the overzealous 
tactics of the door security attendants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the gang-ridden '90s, we've come to expect pat-downs at the entrance to 
youth-oriented shows. But what the Tunnel's guardians administered was a 
heavy-handed, full-body rubdown, carried out with the searchee's legs spread 
and hands outstretched against the building, like a felony suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The guards were polite, at least, even as I voiced my irritation with their 
procedures. Knight said he had other complaints about overly aggressive body 
searches (which were conducted only on males, giving an opening to any would-be 
Ma Barkers or Squeaky Frommes). 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to be doing it anymore," Knight said. "We had a nice, long 
talk about that, and it won't happen again." Brooks, the club owner, said he 
plans to equip security crews with metal-detector wands by this weekend to make 
searches less obtrusive. 
</P>
<P>
 With a show tonight headlined by Pansy Division, an avowedly gay Bay Area punk 
band championed by Green Day, and a Nov. 10 concert by the Skeletones, a 
well-established ska attraction, the Kurtain figures to get more exposure in 
coming weeks. Also booked is a Nov. 17 bill with Mean Season, Hed and Brother 
Vibe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pansy Division, Armistice and Controlled Chaos and play tonight at 8:30 p.m. 
at the Kurtain, 612 N. Eckhoff St., Orange. $7. (714) 630-6128 (taped 
information).  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 TROUBLE RETURNS: After six months of idleness following the defection of 
members Michael Bay and Mark Soden, Trouble Dolls is back on the circuit. The 
revamped lineup's first show is tonight at 10 at Fair City, 2020 Wilshire 
Blvd., Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble Dolls' founders -- singer John Surge and drummer Ron Cambra -- have 
recruited former Cactus Jack member Jeff Donahue on guitar, and Rick Thompson 
on bass. Also scheduled are shows Nov. 16 at Linda's Doll Hut in Anaheim, and 
Dec. 8 at Roxbury South in Santa Ana (with National People's Gang). Surge says 
the new lineup is aiming for a spring release of the follow-up to Trouble 
Dolls' strong 1993 debut album, "Cement."

JON AVNET: ON THE BRINK OF 'WAR'; THE DIRECTOR'S LATEST ONCE AGAIN SHOWS HE 
STANDS UP FOR WHAT HE BELIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE LACHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a forerunner of "The War" you will never see. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget for the moment the real film starring Elijah Wood and Kevin Costner 
that will open Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrow back into director Jon Avnet's brain to a less chummy Los Angeles, one 
that wasn't toasting him for the sleeper success of his first feature film, 
"Fried Green Tomatoes." This was a whole other city that was braking for that 
ubiquitous animal -- the aggressive, ambitious New York transplant trying to 
break into the film business. And while said animal, Jon Avnet, awaited the 
chance to pour his fantasies onto the big screen, he cultivated them in his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 And this one wasn't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had this fantasy, because it's very hard to get started in the film 
business, this movie where you drop 10,000 yellow cabs on the freeway on a 
rainy day, just to watch the battles break out and the Angelenos die of fright 
from horn hogs and cabbies hitting them and pushing and going on the wrong side 
of the road and rioting through the dividers, because it was like this placid 
culture, and all these people who speak a different brand of English. What a 
great movie it would have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Avnet, 44, is still in fine fighting form. He is slouched in a leather 
chair in his Culver City office in his hot, newish director's best -- black 
leather jacket, slicked-back hair, jeans and gym shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A constant surge of high energy will keep a leg in motion for the next 2 1/2 
hours. He is talking about his flourishing aggressive side that has, at least 
in some regard, served him well. The charm of bulldozing through obstacles 
propelled him along the difficult five-year path to making "Fried Green 
Tomatoes."  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm said 'no' to all the time and I'm excited when people say 'no' to me," 
says Avnet. "It gets me up on Monday even." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more useful, it got him down the last official stretch of his 
rocky road from producer to director. And now comes his latest film, "The War," 
a prose poem on aggression and a heart-tugging morality tale of its pitfalls. 
The duality is there because Avnet, the Brooklyn boy who resurrected the 
Southern film genre, is the Janus of directors -- with every hard-edged Avnet 
yang, there is a tender, emotional yin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jon, when you don't know him, can come off as being a little arrogant and a 
little bit of a know-it-all and a little insensitive," says longtime friend and 
former producing partner Steve Tisch. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that is a very thin surface, and beneath that surface there's a very 
deeply sensitive man who has found a venue to express his deep, deep feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 "The War" traces the early 1970s aftermath of Vietnam in the fractured life of 
a returning war veteran played by Costner. There's also a parallel and 
metaphorical war between his kids, played by Elijah Wood and Lexi Randall, and 
the Lipnickis, a poverty-stricken family who battle them for a junk-filled 
treehouse nestled in an 800-year-old palace of an angel oak. Ultimately, the 
only battle won is the Costner character's lesson that all of it is futile. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daddy said, 'Instead of fighting, we were meant for better things, you and 
I,' " says Randall, who narrates the film. "No matter how much people 
understand war, war don't understand people." 
</P>
<P>
 As in "Fried Green Tomatoes," the Deep South is virtually a character in "The 
War." The $13-million "Tomatoes," despite generally lackluster reviews, 
benefited from tasty word of mouth. It lingered for months in theaters, 
grossing $82 million in the U.S. And Avnet was catapulted onto the A-list of 
directors who could attract sterling talent, not only Costner for "The War," 
but also Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer for his next film, "Up Close and 
Personal," which begins shooting in March. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the title of "The War," which would seem to hold commercial 
promise as an action film, the $18-million movie, in fact, trades little on 
that Hollywood commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of it as similar to 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' " Avnet says. "One of 
the things that attracted me to this movie was it seemed idyllic, this world of 
dirt-poor people. The town this was based on in 1970 had a population of 
approximately 25,000 people, and 22,000 of them earned less than $3,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what they were fighting over seems idyllic compared to what we see every 
day on television or read in the papers, which is carnage -- carnage far in 
excess to what happened in Vietnam. . . . I just wonder whether the child has 
been taken out of childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Avnet says that casting and directing the baker's dozen of children was the 
most challenging part of making "The War." What's more, only the two leads, 
Wood and Randall, were professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have a problem with kids who do commercials," Avnet says, "because 
they look like they're selling a product. They have these shiny little faces." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, directing untrained child actors posed other problems as well, but 
Avnet found a handy tool in stunt camp -- or rather, the threat of no stunt 
camp. The camp was called to get the kids in shape for the battles around the 
treehouse and a water tower. (The trickiest stunts were performed by grown-up 
professionals -- really short ones.) 
</P>
<P>
 Wood says that Avnet, who lives in Topanga Canyon with his artist wife, 
Barbara Brody, and three children, was deft in dealing with his young cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's excellent with kids because he's got kids of his own," Wood 
says. "We all treat him like a dad, that's how cool it was. At the end of the 
film, he was like, 'If you ever need help in acting, I can help you,' or 'If 
you need help in regular life, I can help you also.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Universal was equally pleased with the top-billed Wood -- enough to fashion an 
Oscar campaign around him which would, if successful, make the 13-year-old the 
youngest best actor ever. Costner reportedly agreed to be submitted as a best 
supporting contender to boost Wood's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 And Avnet soft-pedaled buzz that Costner butted heads with him over the 
actor's limited profile in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin looked at the movie in an early version and looked at it in a later 
version, and his ideas had to do with the movie, not just with himself," Avnet 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 What is not in dispute is that working with the sometimes obstreperous kids of 
"The War" touched on something that persists in Avnet's own psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the first person in the principal's office, and actually somebody said 
that kids are punished for the exact qualities that adults are rewarded for, 
and I was thinking, 'That's my autobiography.' I'm stubborn. I come up with 
things that no one else would think to do. These are the qualities that 
hopefully infuse the films I've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Avnet was born "in Gil Hodges' mitt," as his mother liked to say, declining 
credit for the job in favor of the erstwhile first baseman for the Brooklyn 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 5, the family moved to Great Neck, Long Island, where his father, 
Lester, and grandfather built an electronics distribution company. But Lester's 
heart lay in the arts, and family lore has it that he turned down a job playing 
violin in the Warner Bros. orchestra in Los Angeles in the early '40s because 
he couldn't afford to relocate Avnet's mother, Joan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm playing the violin for him to some extent," Avnet says. 
</P>
<P>
 Avnet attended Sarah Lawrence College as one of the first men to integrate the 
women's school, gaining a ringside opportunity to explore his empathy with the 
other sex. And that trait later formed the foundation of his "Fried Green 
Tomatoes," which celebrates women's friendships, and "The Burning Bed," the 
award-winning TV movie on spouse abuse that netted Farrah Fawcett stripes as a 
serious actress.  
</P>
<P>
 Avnet got a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater and film, where he made an 
expressionistic film with an unknown actor named Richard Gere. It got him into 
the directing program at the American Film Institute in 1972. Avnet never 
finished, though, leaving in disillusionment after his protests of a dean's 
firing led to naught. 
</P>
<P>
 Avnet's early jobs in the business weren't any more gratifying. He worked for 
a while as an assistant to producers Fred Weintraub and Paul Heller, but ended 
up being fired. He says he was hired "ostensibly to direct films, but after 2 
1/2 years of bondage, it wasn't going to happen and I was pissed off." 
</P>
<P>
 But Avnet, then only in his mid-20s, had learned something useful about his 
temperament and his calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I imitated Vivien Leigh from 'Gone With the Wind' when she said she was never 
going to be poor again. I didn't want to be at the mercy of anybody for my 
directing, because it just meant too much to me. And I was headstrong and too 
sensitive and too vulnerable and just generally ridiculously immature, but very 
energetic." 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to enter the field as a producer, and when he had substantial 
control, move over into directing. In late 1977, Avnet hooked up with family 
friend Steve Tisch. They had worked together on '77's "Outlaw Blues" for Warner 
Bros. when Avnet was still with Weintraub-Heller Productions. Soon after, they 
launched a seven-year partnership that produced a spate of work for television 
and theatrical release that included "The Burning Bed."  
</P>
<P>
 "I think Jon had a tendency with most of the directors he worked with of 
co-directing," says his current producing partner, Jordan Kerner. "For him it 
was sometimes frustrating if he knew he could get this or that performance, and 
ultimately there was that imperative creatively as an artist" to move into 
directing. 
</P>
<P>
 When Avnet decided he needed to pull back from producing and pour his energies 
into directing, he and Tisch ended their seven-year partnership. But they 
remain close -- they still work down the hall from each other in a jointly 
owned office building and they share stakes in real estate deals and the Hard 
Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Avnet joined forces with Kerner. Over the years, their company has 
had a critically uneven but mostly commercially successful track record with 
such films as "Less Than Zero" (1987), "Men Don't Leave" (1990), "The Mighty 
Ducks" (1992), "Three Musketeers" (1993) and "When a Man Loves a Woman" (1994). 
A new Avnet/Kerner romantic comedy opens in January, "Miami Rhapsody," directed 
by David Frankel and starring Sarah Jessica Parker, Mia Farrow and Antonio 
Banderas. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Fried Green Tomatoes" (1991), Avnet finally left most of the producing 
at Avnet/Kerner to Kerner. Helping Avnet make the shift from producing to 
directing were his longtime mentor, Universal chairman Tom Pollock, and Norman 
Lear, who executive produced "Tomatoes" and shared a background in television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was inclined to support him because he had such a passion for making that 
story," Lear says. "And his background in TV suggested that between he and 
Jordan, they knew how to make a film and bring it in on budget." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomatoes" did have its worms, however. After press kits and posters had gone 
out naming Avnet and "Tomatoes" novelist Fannie Flagg as the screenwriters, the 
Writers Guild stripped Avnet of his credit and gave it to Carol Sobieski, who 
had died at 51 after writing earlier drafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Avnet still bristles at the mention of that arbitration. "I think (the Writers 
Guild is) changing the bias against directors and producers, which came about 
for a very good reason. And I'm not arguing against it, but there's something 
categorically absurd when you write the vast majority of something to say to 
someone they don't have a credit writing it. It's just bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 The other controversy turned on a charge by gay organizations and some critics 
that Avnet had whitewashed the book's implied lesbian relationship between the 
characters played by Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I actually wanted to explore was a very intimate relationship between 
two women. And I found it just fascinating that the feelings were so vehement 
that it had to be one way or another, as if they owned it: 'How dare you?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of this (politically correct) world we're in is you've got to fit some 
mold or you're a bad boy. You know I ain't going to take that from them any 
more than I'm going to take it from the stupid far right people who tell you 
you can't have an abortion." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, social concerns lace many of Avnet's projects, from "The Burning Bed" 
to the "The War," which maintains Avnet's youthful despair over the futility of 
Vietnam, but reflects a sympathy for its veterans that surfaced as Avnet 
matured. 
</P>
<P>
 Avnet is also in pre-production on a miniseries for Turner Broadcasting and 
ABC about Nelson Mandela's life and the rise and fall of South African 
apartheid, which will star Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte. The project was 
so hard to sell that it has taken seven years to get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 While Avnet has managed the tricky feat of melding social issues with 
commercial clout, he knows it's a delicate balancing act. And on this blazingly 
perfect day in Los Angeles, he is wondering whether "The War" will attract the 
sort of audiences and numbers that have allowed him to pursue his sometimes 
unlikely projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it has enough so that the people who spend money on movies will want 
to make another one like it, whether it be mine or Quentin Tarantino's or 
someone who does something that's different . . . from just genre films, that 
are only entertaining or exploitative, films that are violent for the purpose 
of making money, which I find repugnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have voices that don't get an opportunity to make movies, that may 
have something that would be affecting and help us laugh and understand 
differences and come to understanding. That would be a great thing, I think. So 
I hope that it hits a chord in people."

BIG NAMES, BIG FILMS: SO WHAT WENT WRONG?; MOVIES: REDFORD'S 'QUIZ SHOW' AND 
BEATTY'S 'LOVE AFFAIR' FIND LIMITS AT THE BOX OFFICE. WHY DIDN'T AUDIENCES 
RESPOND TO THE PROMINENT FILMMAKERS' EFFORTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD NATALE and ROBERT W. WELKOS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were two of the most highly anticipated films of the fall season, each 
made by veteran movie stars and Oscar-winning filmmakers: "Quiz Show," directed 
by Robert Redford, and "Love Affair," co-written and produced by the film's 
star, Warren Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
 Both movies were backed by powerful studio marketing and distribution 
machines, and both were hyped to the hilt by their high-powered creators. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the movies failed to ignite the box office. Was "Quiz Show" too high-brow 
for middle America? Does Beatty no longer have the drawing power to open a 
film, or is the country too cynical to accept an old-fashioned romantic 
melodrama? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's risky to ask the audience to think," says Redford. "I don't know whether 
they're in that mode or not." 
</P>
<P>
 A circumspect Beatty said he hopes his film will still "find its audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two, Disney's "Quiz Show" had all the advantages. According to Redford, 
he received his best directing notices to date. In addition, "Quiz Show" 
provoked news stories and editorial columns aplenty about the actual '50s 
scandal and what it says about America -- both now and then. From the start, 
the film has been consistently mentioned on the short list for best picture and 
best director nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 To date "Quiz Show" has grossed about $20 million, which, according to 
Entertainment Data Inc.'s Tom Borys, is not particularly low given the film's 
"reality drama" genre. In the last year, the only films of a similar nature to 
do better were "Philadelphia" ($77 million) and "The Piano" ($44 million).  
</P>
<P>
 Box office for the movie, which stars Ralph Fiennes, started strong in big 
markets. The movie then slowly unfolded around the country. Too slowly, 
according to critics of Disney's release strategy. "They left money on the 
table by not expanding more quickly," says one rival studio executive. "That 
may have cost them as much as $10 million." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge from the start, says Dick Cook, Disney's distribution head, was 
to spread the bounty outward from the core urban audience. "We did well in 
every major city downtown theater," he said. "But in suburban theaters we had 
only limited success." 
</P>
<P>
 The play-out was similar to 1992's "A River Runs Through It," Redford's last 
directing effort, a film that was thought to have little commercial potential 
but wound up grossing $43.4 million. The difference, says Redford, is that 
"River" was "rural and went deeper into the culture. 'Quiz Show' is more 
sophisticated in nature and more urban. . . . Maybe it's reached the audience 
it was meant to reach." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Borys, he may be right. The film should, with Oscar nominations, 
achieve numbers comparable to last year's "Remains of the Day," "In the Name of 
the Father" and "Shadowlands" -- all of which grossed $20 million to $30 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another irony is that all the media attention "Quiz Show" received may 
actually have backfired. "It made it sound like the film was a documentary, 
that it was good for you rather than entertainment," says Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "The presentation of moral ambiguity in all the characters may also have been 
a detriment," adds Eammon Bowles, head of distribution for the Samuel Goldwyn 
Co. "Ultimately, the subject matter may have been limiting. People like good 
guys and bad guys to root for. It's playing very much like a specialty film." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, not at specialty prices. "Quiz Show" reportedly cost in the 
mid-$20-million range, before marketing. And, while Redford says that the media 
places too much emphasis on box office, he does admit that today's average cost 
of a studio movie (about $30 million before marketing) makes such assessments 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were the days," he sighs, about a time when films like "Quiz Show" 
could be made inexpensively and not have to gross $50 million in order to show 
a profit.  
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Warner Bros.' "Love Affair," some Hollywood observers believe 
its modest performance (just under $11 million through its first two weekends) 
derives from several factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty was reluctant to discuss the movie's performance in detail, except to 
say, "I like the movie very much. It's doing OK, and it will be nice if it 
continues to hang in there and find its audience." 
</P>
<P>
 A Warner Bros. official said the studio knew going in that "Love Affair" could 
be a tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, this was an old-fashioned concept and an old-fashioned movie," said 
studio spokesman Rob Friedman. "There were no special effects. It had no 
violence, no sex. . . ." Sadly, he added, perhaps today's audiences are just 
not drawn in large numbers to movies about "starry-eyed romance." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the generational factor. Friedman said that "younger people did 
not come" to "Love Affair" but that the studio is not sure why. Some believe 
younger audiences do not readily identify with the 57-year-old Beatty as a 
romantic lead and question whether the actor is losing some of his drawing 
power. While a bona fide star, he is usually not considered in the same league 
with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner or Tom Cruise, although 
they too have had box-office duds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're seeing in the marketplace that actors of the Keanu Reeves 
generation are pulling moviegoers into theaters, not the Warren Beatty 
romantic-lead generation," said one official at a rival studio. "With 'Speed' 
and 'Interview With the Vampire,' you have young, sexy casts." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, TriStar's current romantic comedy, "Only You," with young 
stars Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr., is struggling to find an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say audiences may not feel the same attachment to Beatty as they did a 
similar character, Tom Hanks in "Sleepless in Seattle." Directed by Glenn 
Gordon Caron, "Love Affair" is a remake of the 1957 classic "An Affair to 
Remember" and the 1939 original "Love Affair." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One agent suggested that "thematically, ('Love Affair') is the story of a guy 
who is a womanizer who comes to grips with his life after finding his true 
love. I don't know if that is enough to be drawn to a movie. In 'Sleepless in 
Seattle,' Hanks was a sympathetic character who was still in mourning for his 
wife. You felt for him. At the climax of the movie, at the top of the Empire 
State Building, you were rooting for this guy, who you just loved. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 'Love Affair,' in real life, everybody knows Beatty was a womanizer. 
Everybody knows his history. And, everybody knows he's married to Annette 
Bening," he said, referring to Beatty's co-star. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe the marriage may have turned off filmgoers. 
</P>
<P>
 'You already know, in the back of your head, that they're together so you 
don't believe the tension," said one studio official. "It takes the fantasy 
away," said another. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Beatty had been cast with Demi Moore or someone else, even though you know 
they'll get together, it's more suspense," said another industry source. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said if their marriage was to blame, it never appeared in the exit 
polls taken of test audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 One real problem with the movie, some say, was that it lacks sufficient 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no love in it, no spark in it -- none of those things you go to a 
romantic film for," said one studio executive." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources say that Warner Bros. stands to lose a lot of money on "Love 
Affair," which is estimated to have cost more than $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One high-profile agent suggested: "Assuming that it cost $40 million to $50 
million to make and they spent another $15 million to open it, you're chasing a 
lot of money . . . maybe it will gross $20 million (domestically)." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said the $40-million production figure is "high" and estimated that 
the film will top out at $30 million domestically and have a good afterlife in 
overseas release.

GALAXY EMERGES ON CLUB SCENE; POP MUSIC: THE SANTA ANA VENUE, SET TO OPEN DEC. 
10, WILL BE SLIGHTLY MORE UPSCALE THAN ITS SISTER FACILITY, THE COACH HOUSE, 
THE OWNER SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Coach House's new sister club in Santa Ana will be called the Galaxy 
Concert Theatre and is scheduled to open Dec. 10, owner Gary Folgner said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Galaxy, which will seat 550 to 600 concert-goers, becomes the fourth 
concert club in Folgner's growing Southern California network, joining the 
480-capacity Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, the 850-capacity Ventura 
Theatre, and the Coach House-San Diego, a 450-capacity club that Folgner was 
scheduled to open Wednesday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Folgner also is negotiating with officials in Fresno in hopes of launching a 
concert club there next year. All of Folgner's venues offer the all-ages, 
concert and dinner-service format he ushered in at the original Coach House in 
1986 with the help of Ken Phebus, the concert director who continues to be the 
lead booker for all of Folgner's clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Folgner said his girlfriend's mother was the first to suggest the name Galaxy 
for his new club. He settled on it Wednesday after polling employees, concert 
industry contacts, and "people who just walked in the door" as to which of 
three contending names they preferred: the Galaxy, the Mercury, or the 
Moonstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows announced Wednesday are: Strunz & Farah, Dec. 10; Huey Lewis & the News, 
Dec. 18; Great White, Dec. 22; Norman Brown and Boney James, Dec. 23; Gregg 
Allman Band, Dec. 28; Dixie Dregs, Dec. 30; and Richard Jeni, Feb. 4. The 
Galaxy's information number is (714) 957-0600. Lewis and Allman also are 
playing the original Coach House, on Dec. 16 and 27, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Folgner expects to offer 15 to 18 shows per month at the Coach House and 12 to 
15 at the Galaxy. About one quarter of the acts will play both clubs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Galaxy, at 3503 S. Harbor Blvd., is the same venue that was known as the 
Rhythm Cafe, which, under different owners, in 1992-93 mounted a brief, 
unsuccessful challenge to the Coach House for dominance in the Orange County 
club-level concert market. 
</P>
<P>
 Folgner said that his acquisition of the well-appointed, multitiered Santa Ana 
club is partly a preemptive move to prevent future competitive challenges: "To 
leave this room in the marketplace would have been foolish, because somebody 
(else) could have made it a hit." 
</P>
<P>
 But Folgner also sees opportunities to succeed at the Galaxy with events 
thathaven't gone over well in south Orange County, especially concerts by black 
and Latino acts. Vietnamese shows, in conjunction with established promoters in 
the field, are also a possibility. Folgner expects additional earnings from 
catered private parties and corporate events, something he has been able to do 
at the Ventura Theatre, but not at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down at the Coach House it's always going to be a little funkier than here. 
(The Galaxy) is going to be a little more formal, but not so formal that it 
can't be relaxed," Folgner said. "I don't want to be quite as upscale" as the 
pricey Rhythm Cafe was. Unlike at the Coach House, Galaxy waiters will wear 
black and white uniforms with ties. But the Galaxy won't have valet parking, as 
the Rhythm Cafe did. 
</P>
<P>
 Folgner's San Diego expansion comes with a takeover of an established club, 
the Flash Cafe. At the newly renamed Coach House-San Diego he is booking many 
of the bands that play the original Coach House or the Galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 450-capacity San Diego club doesn't quite fulfill his dream of opening a 
larger showcase club in California's second-biggest city. After a long and 
fruitless search for an ideal San Diego venue, Folgner said, he decided to 
acquire the Flash Cafe to establish a presence in the market. "It's just going 
to be a real quaint small club," Folgner said of the venue at 10475 S. Mission 
Road. The ceilings are "a lot lower" than in San Juan Capistrano, he said, and 
the smallish stage isn't up to the standard set by the original Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
 Folgner said the new club "gives me exposure in the market right now. It's not 
exactly what I would like to have representing the Coach House, but it will 
work for the short term." By doing business in San Diego, he said, "the city 
(government) will know what we do, and (that) will help us acquire a site, and 
get approval for a site" for a bigger club. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coach House-San Diego was scheduled to debut Wednesday with a show by .38 
Special. Also scheduled are Alvin Lee tonight and Friday, Craig Chaquico and 
Warren Hill on Saturday.

SNOOP DOGGY DOGG'S STILL TOPS WITH ALBUM BUYERS; POP MUSIC: HIS 'MURDER WAS THE 
CASE,' THE SOUNDTRACK TO A SHORT FILM THAT PREMIERES TONIGHT, REMAINS ATOP THE 
CHARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Murder Was the Case," the latest album by Long Beach rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg 
continues its reign at No. 1 on the nation's pop chart -- despite stiff 
competition from pop icons such as Madonna, R.E.M. and Gloria Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder" is the soundtrack to an 18-minute film, starring Snoop Doggy Dogg and 
directed by gangsta rap impresario Dr. Dre, that makes its Los Angeles premiere 
at 8 p.m. tonight at downtown's Variety Arts Center. Several theater chains and 
independent movie houses, including the State Theater downtown, opted not to 
show "Murder," fearing a repeat of the violence that accompanied the premieres 
of "Boyz N the Hood" and "New Jack City," sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is also scheduled to be screened in a New York Greenwich Village 
theater Nov. 17 and will air as a pay-per-view special on Super Bowl Sunday in 
January before being released on video in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder" is based on lyrics to a song by Snoop Doggy Dogg, recorded before he 
was charged with murder in the shooting death of Philip Woldemariam at a Palms 
area park Aug. 25, 1993. The 23-year-old rapper, whose real name is Calvin 
Broadus, is accused of driving the vehicle from which his bodyguard, McKinley 
Lee, allegedly shot and killed Woldemariam. Both men and their companion, Shawn 
Abrams, claimed self-defense and have pleaded not guilty. They are scheduled to 
be tried Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is the first film from Death Row, an entertainment company founded 
three years ago by Dr. Dre that has generated more than $100 million in sales 
from such hit albums as Dre's "The Chronic," Snoop Doggy Dogg's "Doggystyle" 
and the "Above the Rim" soundtrack. Death Row is distributed by Interscope, a 
subsidiary of Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, is one of pop music's hottest 
producers. He has also directed many of his label's videos and has begun 
writing a screenplay for a full-length feature he plans to release before 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Murder" soundtrack collection includes new tracks by Snoop Doggy Dogg, 
Jodeci and D.J. Quick, as well as the reunion of Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, former 
members of the influential L.A. rap group N.W.A. The Dre/Cube song, "Natural 
Born Killaz," has also spawned its own controversial video. Although not due to 
be released until December, the video has already enraged media watchdogs 
because it pokes fun at the gruesome stabbings of Nicole Brown Simpson and 
Ronald Goldman, as well as the shotgun ambush of Jose and Kitty Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Murder" soundtrack sold an estimated 198,000 copies -- nearly 43,000 more 
than Madonna's new "Bedtime Stories," which will enter the chart at No. 3 
during its first week in the stores. R.E.M's "Monster" and Estefan's "Hold Me, 
Thrill Me, Kiss Me" will rank No. 5 and No. 9 respectively with sales of 92,000 
and 74,000 when Billboard magazine hits newsstands Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tickets for tonight's screening of "Murder Was the Case" are only available 
at Fortune Records in Inglewood; Compact Disc N'More in Pasadena; Groovetime 
Records in San Bernardino; and V.I.P. Records in Long Beach. Tickets will not 
be available at the Variety Arts Center.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; DANZIG'S HEAVY METAL IS A LITTLE TOO 'LITE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Danzig has wondered in print lately why he isn't a first-magnitude star 
in the heavy metal firmament. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing to about 10,000 believers on Monday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 
the would-be dark lord, whose band goes by his last name, answered his own 
question with an inconsistent performance that had its persuasive moments but 
lacked vocal power and the aura of diabolical, titanic potency that he hopes to 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig's singing reconstitutes Jim Morrison's style in much the same way that 
Dr. Frankenstein reanimated used body parts: It breathes new life into the dead 
but leaves the revived entity shambling about rather awkwardly, scars and 
stitch marks showing. Danzig's collection of Morrisonian moans, bellows and 
bluesy howls often wavered or fell flat under the Black Sabbath-influenced 
stampede of his three concise and emphatic bandmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The show offered plenty of catchy, shout-along choruses in a traditional metal 
mode, and they came with a good mix of tempos and moods. But Danzig's inflated, 
cosmic-scale depictions of rebellion, destruction and erotic unions require a 
stage Prometheus if the writer's ideas are to be amplified along with his 
music. Energetic as it was, the muscular bandleader's performance fell far 
short of Promethean. MIKE BOEHM

BIG STAR'S HARMONIES LOOK, SOUND BETTER FOR THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How big an event, to the cognoscenti, was the first L.A. Big Star show in two 
decades? 
</P>
<P>
 So big that Hollywood insiders otherwise busy posting rumors about record 
company firings on computer on-line services took time out from the gossip to 
type up their excitement about the long-dormant band's return Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 So big that, if the proverbial bomb had gone off at the House of Blues, some 
folks would have got their wish for a nearly critic-free, and largely 
weasel-lessened, city. 
</P>
<P>
 So big that even Alex Chilton seemed in a pretty good mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilton, of course, is the mercurial figure who headed up Big Star, a Memphis 
group together for only three turbulent years (1971-74). In the history of 
rock, only the Velvet Underground has claimed such pervasive influence while 
selling virtually zero records. R.E.M., among many others, cites Big Star as a 
touchstone; the Replacements named their most popular song after Chilton. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's original sound was British Invasion-infected power pop, but with 
far darker and more ragged undercurrents that explain why Chilton's legend is 
bigger than, say, Eric Carmen's. That dark side extended to the way Chilton has 
sometimes seemed intent on sabotaging his own post-B.S. career with erratic 
genre-crossing, claiming the pop thing was never his bag anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 His ornery refusal to kowtow to virtually any demands of the music business 
has made him all the more revered in alternative circles, but also made the 
prospect of a Big Star "reunion" about as likely as the Eagles' royalties 
freezing over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a year and a half ago Chilton and drummer Jody Stephens were persuaded to 
re-team for a single gig; replacing the late Chris Bell and retired Andy Hummel 
were the young frontmen of the Posies, Jonathan Auer and Ken Stringfellow. A 
terrific live album resulted, as has now, finally, a tour, with the first of 
Big Star's two House of Blues shows a near-instant sellout. 
</P>
<P>
 Worth the wait? Durn near, even if the old band's genius may have been 
overstated in the service of legend. Truth be told, much of this material 
sounds better now , Posie power having been the ticket for bringing Big Star's 
harmonies and proto-power chords into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilton traded his bluesier or jazzier solos with Stringfellow's 
Kinks-cum-Badfinger leads, and handed over several lead vocals to both Posies 
-- but as that band always played tunes like "Feel" as if their own, Chilton 
wasn't unduly sloughing off duties. His own voice, if anything, sounds more 
adolescent now, not a bad tone to bring to vintage material that expresses such 
pre-post-modern sentiments as "I loved you, well, never mind" (from "September 
Gurls"). 
</P>
<P>
 Though hardly overly accommodating in the face of worship, Chilton looked to 
be having a good time in spite of himself, cracking the occasional smile while 
copping bossa nova licks in his "Big Black Car" solo or just wondering aloud 
what, at 43, he was doing singing songs about 12-year-olds. What was he doing? 
Much as he might hate the idea, fulfilling destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Encore.

AND ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST . . .; RADIO: KNAC, THE 'OFFICIAL' OUTLET FOR 
THE METAL SCENE, IS BEING SOLD. A DWINDLING AUDIENCE WILL MISS IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There's the old joke about banging your head against the wall just because it 
feels good when you stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Local head-bangers aren't feeling good at all about the news that KNAC-FM 
(105.5) is going to stop playing their favored heavy-metal music. The station 
is being sold and probably will switch to an all-Spanish format in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a piece of my past is leaving," says Lonn Friend, former editor 
of the hard-rock magazine Rip and now the West Coast vice president of artists 
and repertoire for Arista Records. "From traveling around the country, I can 
tell you there aren't many stations like KNAC, and to lose the one in L.A. is 
sad," says Bruce Duff, publicist for L.A.-based Triple X Records and a veteran 
hard-rock and punk musician. 
</P>
<P>
 But even they acknowledge that KNAC's place in the music community had slipped 
in recent years, as the popularity of such hard-edged "grunge" bands as Pearl 
Jam and Nirvana supplanted that of such past hard-rock staples as Motley Crue 
and Ozzy Osbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 "The L.A. hard-rock community has been virtually nonexistent for the last 
several years," Friend says. "What KNAC was doing was keeping alive some of the 
music that was prevalent here for a while, but the culture has so changed 
around hard-rock music that not even a special-interest, small-but-important 
station can survive the social and musical upheaval." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a dramatic change from the recent past. It didn't take KNAC long after 
switching to a heavy-metal format in 1986 to become an unavoidable presence in 
L.A. as the official outlet for the then-strong metal scene -- despite a 
relatively weak signal. Balancing classic metal-heads like Black Sabbath with a 
newer generation led by Metallica and Megadeth, KNAC led the charge of 
hard-rock into the pop chart mainstream.  
</P>
<P>
 Bumper stickers and T-shirts with the stations' logo were ubiquitous symbols 
of rock rebelliousness as the station withstood a challenge from a similarly 
toned Pirate Radio that failed to encroach on its market a few years ago. "KNAC 
was recognized throughout the world as the premiere hard-rock station," says 
Greg Sorrels, hard-rock editor for the music industry trade magazine Album 
Network. "You could see looking in magazines and on TV all the stars that used 
to wear their shirts. I was still in Oklahoma six years ago and I knew what 
KNAC was." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as two years ago, KNAC still seemed ahead of the competition in 
terms of grabbing on to new, hard-edged bands, including Alice in Chains and 
Soundgarden. But with the alternative-rock explosion, more powerful KROQ-FM 
(106.7) took the lead in that realm, making those and other adventurous, 
hard-edged acts like Nine Inch Nails central to its playlist. KNAC, meanwhile, 
seemed slow to program such upstarts as Green Day and the Offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 Many KNAC regulars do not get played on KROQ, though, and the metal station's 
demise will leave a void, fans fear. "In the entire region you won't be able to 
hear Pantera, Corrosion of Conformity, Biohazard," Friend says. "No one's going 
to play that music, and with no support from MTV for those heavier acts, it's 
going to become harder to get that music to people." 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate impact may be on the concert circuit, where promoters often 
rely on radio exposure and co-promotions to help sell tickets. "It's going to 
be real tough now," says John Reese of BFD Management, whose clients include 
KNAC regulars Guns 'N Roses and Danzig. "There's really no other hard-rock 
forum for somebody to get the word out, play the music and promote the shows." 
</P>
<P>
 Metal mongers are hoping that another station will pick up the slack. One 
possibility is KLOS-FM (95.5), which has favored a more pop-oriented end of 
rock, but has recently added newer, harder bands to its programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "About three months ago, we started to pick up the tempo and pace of the music 
and made a noticeable increase in the current records we're playing," says KLOS 
program director Carey Curlop. "We stand to pick up a good portion of ex-KNAC 
listeners. . . . And there will be more concert promotion opportunities for us 
and a need for us to help support some of those bands." 
</P>
<P>
 And, some believe that KNAC's demise could actually help revitalize the local 
hard-rock scene, where a new, core fan-base can be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the only access to music is in performance, that's the only place for the 
kids to go out and be exposed to it," Friend says. "This could spur a 
revitalization of the hard-rock clubs in Southern California and could really 
help the unsigned bands -- kids will go see them because it's a cheap ticket."

'NYPD' RATINGS SOAR AS CARUSO BIDS ADIEU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Caruso's final appearance on "NYPD Blue" Tuesday night helped generate 
the highest ratings in the show's history, ABC reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The police drama was seen by about 28.8 million people, ABC said, representing 
34% of the available audience. The episode ended with Caruso's character, Det. 
John Kelly, being transferred to a desk job in another precinct -- a move 
necessitated by Caruso's decision to leave the series to pursue a movie career.

 Outcasts only a few years ago because of network fears that they would 
alienate advertisers, gay television characters have made a resurgence in prime 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 That point was made emphatically this season with the arrival of "Daddy's 
Girls," a CBS comedy co-starring the flamboyant Harvey Fierstein, a gay actor 
portraying a gay designer at the fashion firm owned by Dudley Moore's 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 And although "Daddy's Girls" has been put on hiatus because of low ratings, 
there are plenty of other gay characters to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Series that feature gays on a weekly basis include "Melrose Place" (Fox), "My 
So-Called Life" (ABC), "Sisters" (NBC), "Roseanne" (ABC) and "The Real World" 
(MTV). Shows that intermittently feature gay characters include "The Simpsons" 
(Fox), "The Commish" (ABC), "Frasier" (NBC), "Friends" (NBC), "Northern 
Exposure" (CBS), "Murphy Brown" (CBS), "Dream On" (HBO) and "The John 
Larroquette Show" (NBC). 
</P>
<P>
 Although recurring gay characters were relatively commonplace on network 
series during the late 1970s and 1980s -- on programs such as "Dynasty" and 
"Soap" -- opposition from fundamentalists who complained to advertisers helped 
reduce their ranks to zero in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Junger Witt, one of the executive producers of "Daddy's Girls," calls 
television's "rediscovery" of gays part of its attempt to be more relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole gay issue is one you have to put on blinders to avoid," Witt said, 
calling efforts to keep gays off the tube "an intentional distortion of truth 
-- one of those truths being that our culture is influenced by the large number 
of gays." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to have included a gay character on "Daddy's Girls," which centers on the 
fashion industry, would have left it "without a reality base," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Executive producer Darren Star similarly attributes "Melrose Place's" strong 
ratings among the 18-49 age group that advertisers prize to his show's "reality 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 "Depicting real characters is something we have to do to retain our audience," 
he explained. "We don't want them to roll their eyes while they watch, asking 
if this is all they're allowed to see." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Jennings, executive director of Hollywood Supports, a group promoting 
positive gay portrayals in film and television, believes the resurgence of gay 
characters is due to the public's heightened consciousness about gay political 
issues. As gays have increasingly "come out," many viewers have become aware of 
gay brothers, sisters and friends. Together with gay viewers, they are 
increasingly asking for sympathetic gay portrayals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most advertisers also seem to have become more accepting -- at least up to a 
point. When Star wanted to show his gay character kissing another man on the 
season finale of "Melrose Place" last spring, Fox balked and asked them not to, 
afraid that advertisers would withdraw their commercials -- just as they did 
for a 1989 episode of ABC's "thirtysomething" that showed two gay men in bed 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no such reservations at MTV, however, where Thursday's episode of 
the pseudo-documentary "The Real World" -- about a group of young adults living 
together in San Francisco -- featured regular Pedro Zamora exchanging rings 
with his boyfriend in a "gay marriage" ceremony. The two men -- who are not 
actors -- hold hands and kiss no fewer than seven times in the half-hour cine 
ma ve rite program. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora's romance, which began spontaneously after the show had set up its 
seven principals in a San Francisco house, "is probably the deepest we've ever 
gotten into a relationship in our three seasons," said producer John Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone applauds the trend. The Rev. Louis Sheldon, head of the Orange 
County-based Traditional Values Coalition, said, "Homosexuals should not be 
portrayed at all on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Sympathetic gay role models confuse viewers, he argues. "If young males need 
to identify with someone, they should identify with Clint Eastwood," Sheldon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Star said that "Melrose Place" viewers had been rolling their collective 
eyes at gay social worker Matt Fielding's stunted development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received hundreds of letters, the writers asking why all the other 
characters are allowed to have a love life, but not Matt," he said. "Straight 
viewers identify with him as well as gay viewers. They feel he's part of their 
lives, and they want to know more about him." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, said Star, Matt will have a "greater presence on the show" when 
Jeffrey, the closeted gay sailor he had met -- and lost -- returns. Jeffrey's 
military affiliation will heighten the tensions when he "comes out," 
dramatizing the debate over gays in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the producers' belief that the upsurge in gay characters is here to 
stay, network officials are still skittish about going public on the matter. 
Although CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox all made their producers available for this 
story, each cited a different reason for not having a network official discuss 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Only MTV's executive vice president of programming, Doug Herzog, would go on 
the record. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given the relative lack of homophobia by MTV's mostly teen-aged and 
twentysomething viewers and the cable network's independence from FCC 
regulation, Herzog said that MTV has been able to treat gay and straight 
subject matters "alike. There is no stigma here. . . . We have a secret weapon: 
Our audience trusts us. They think we understand them." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief area in which Herzog sees MTV lagging is its rock videos. Although 
his network has aired videos featuring "straight" love stories and gay or 
lesbian fantasy sequences, no music company has yet provided MTV with a 
commercially viable gay or lesbian love story, he said. Should one come in 
meeting MTV's requirements, he pledged to air it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't spend a lot of time worrying about what the fundamentalists think," 
he said. "We prefer to think about how we can best serve our viewers."

RESIDENTS ANGERED BY COTO DE CAZA MOB ATTACK; INQUIRY: SHERIFF'S OFFICERS WILL 
INTERVIEW 5 TEENS ABOUT ASSAULTS ON 2 MEN. NEIGHBORS MEET TO DEMAND ARRESTS AND 
POLICE PROTECTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Incensed by the brutal Halloween night attack by a mob of teen-agers on two of 
their neighbors, more than 100 residents of this exclusive, gated community 
gathered Wednesday to demand better police protection and the arrests of the 
attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in a cold rage," Ron Greek, co-chairman of the Coto Citizens Advisory 
Council, a residents' group, told the standing-room-only crowd at the Coto 
Valley Country Club. "We've played ostrich out here too long, thinking that we 
had a pristine community free of urban problems. We're going to pursue this 
until the perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law; we're 
going to make an example of them so that this will never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting had been called in response to separate attacks Monday night on 
race car driver Rocky Moran, 44, and attorney Bernard Moran (no relation), 45, 
who live in the gated community. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Moran sustained a dislocated shoulder, while Bernard Moran is nursing a 
broken rib, broken ankle, two battered knees, bruised hips and a black eye. The 
two men, both over 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, confronted the youths who were 
blocking their cars as the men tried to ferry their own children home from 
trick-or-treating. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for the Orange County Sheriff's Department, Lt. Bob NeSmith told the 
residents Wednesday that six investigators and a sergeant had been assigned to 
the case full time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a serious situation," he said. "This community is running amok with 
people doing whatever they want to be doing. The Sheriff's Department takes 
this very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday night, he said, sheriff's investigators had identified five 
teen-agers they plan to question about the violence. Those deemed responsible, 
he said, could be charged with felony assault or assault with a deadly weapon. 
Eventually, NeSmith said, investigators plan to talk to as many members of the 
teen-age mob, which he estimated at 100, as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are kids who live here," he said. "A hundred kids just didn't jump over 
the fence." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents said Wednesday that teen-age belligerence is a longstanding 
problem in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we're held hostage in here," said one, who did not want to be 
identified for fear of retribution. "I feel like I'm living in Cuba or Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another, who also did not want to be identified: "My reaction was one of 
horror, but not surprise. . . . The kids who live here have done damage to this 
golf course many, many times."  
</P>
<P>
 Resident Marsha Lassen, 48, said she believed that many of the youths who 
participated in the attack lived in the community, where houses sell for up to 
$10 million, or opened the gates to those who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reaction is one of grave disappointment," Lassen said. "But you know, I 
thought it was bound to happen sooner or later. Here we are, living in this 
community that we moved to because we longed to be safe, and now, we aren't. 
You know what can be done about this? Nothing. Because none of these parents 
will do anything about it."  
</P>
<P>
 Karen Barkovitz, who does not live in the community but plays golf at its 
course, said earlier Wednesday: "You know what the problem is now? These kids 
are too rich and too spoiled to know better, and that's their parents' fault. 
Had my son attacked an adult, he never would have heard the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Moran was still angry almost 48 hours after the attack as he sat in 
his living room Wednesday afternoon nursing a wounded body and numerous swollen 
joints. Getting up from his chair, he could barely walk. A broken rib didn't 
make it easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing they could do now would be to come after me or my family. I 
want them to know: That will not be a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Moran said his memory of the attack is hazy. But he remembers being 
attacked by at least nine rock-wielding teen-agers, who took offense to Moran 
confronting them for blocking the street and then "smashed me with a 
combination of fists and rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 "If these kids want to play in an adult world, they're going to have to take 
adult responsibility," said Moran, who has not ruled out taking legal action 
against the parents of the teens. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the attack lasted about a minute "that felt like four hours" and was 
witnessed by "dozens" of other residents, most of whom were "terrified mothers 
taking their little ones home from trick-or-treating." He said the mob was 
composed of males and females but that he was attacked only by males. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his 13-year-old daughter had heard students at the Santa Margarita 
intermediate school brag about the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Moran, who along with Bernard Moran recounted his ordeal for the rapt 
audience Wednesday night with one arm in a sling, said, "It was a melee. They 
just pummeled me."

WOMAN WHO SHOT DAUGHTERS LEAVING HOSPITAL; RELEASE: KRISTINE CUSHING OF LAGUNA 
NIGUEL, WHO WAS DECLARED INSANE DURING 1991 KILLINGS, WILL BE MOVED FROM STATE 
FACILITY TO A LOCAL HALFWAY HOUSE, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 A Laguna Niguel woman who was declared insane when she shot and killed her two 
daughters in 1991 is making the transition from a state mental hospital to a 
halfway house in Orange County, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But state authorities still were searching for a suitable home for Kristine 
Marie Cushing after a Costa Mesa facility this week refused to accept the 
former Sunday school teacher because of the nature of her crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighborhood became alarmed and it was a matter of NIMBY -- not in my 
back yard," said Thomas G. Najdowski, coordinator of the Conditional Release 
Program in Orange County. "But she is very stable and is not considered a 
threat, or we wouldn't be doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors opposed the move to a halfway house as a premature step for 
Cushing, who previously was released to an outpatient program in Ventura 
County, but was sent back to a state mental hospital after she began suffering 
delusions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County Superior Court Judge James A. Jackman on Friday agreed to 
let Cushing try once again to take a closer step toward freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Cushing, 42, was at the Orange County Central Women's Jail 
awaiting placement. Najdowski said there is a possibility Cushing may be sent 
back to Patton State Hospital unless a new facility can be quickly located. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Michael J. Cassidy stressed that Cushing should begin working 
toward becoming a productive citizen instead of spending her life in a state 
mental hospital, where an extended stay in such a restrictive environment may 
strip her of any ability to be self-reliant. 
</P>
<P>
 A halfway house environment will be less restrictive, but Cushing will remain 
on medication and under watch and must continue to participate in therapy 
programs, Najdowski and Cassidy said. They also said Cushing's prompt return to 
the state mental hospital after her lapse proves the system is working. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as they realized she was having some difficulties, she was sent back, 
and that's because she was under such close watch," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Glazier declined to discuss the case, but noted that a 
psychiatrist who evaluated Cushing for the prosecution felt the move was 
"premature." But Najdowski and another therapist disagreed, saying Cushing was 
ready for the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say it is rare for someone who killed two people to be moved back 
into the community. But they say the move underscores the belief that the 
killings were an isolated incident and note that Cushing has made progress 
toward a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Cushing was a Brownie troop leader, a Sunday school teacher and a seemingly 
devoted mother when she "snapped" in October, 1991, under the stress of a 
severe heart condition, depression and a pending divorce from her husband of 17 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare concurrence, prosecuting and defense attorneys agreed that Cushing 
was not guilty by reason of insanity when she killed her daughters, ages 8 and 
4. She was sent to Patton State Hospital in February, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 She was released to an outpatient program in Ventura County in July, 1993, and 
was doing well until she began suffering delusions around Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are thousands of mentally ill people around and they are not hurting 
anyone else," Najdowski said. "I think Kristine will do really well."

UNCERTAIN TOUR OF DUTY; NAVY CHIEF PRAISES SEAL BEACH STATION, SIDESTEPS FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Navy Secretary John H. Dalton had nothing but praise for the Seal Beach Naval 
Weapons Station during a 50th anniversary celebration at the base Wednesday, 
but he was noncommittal about its future in comments after the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking under cloudy skies to an audience of 300 community leaders, veterans 
and base employees, Dalton called the military facility "the most 
cost-effective weapons station in the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the secretary appears this morning at a Base Realignment and Closure 
conference in Long Beach, he will not advocate either closing the base or 
keeping it open. All military installations are under review by Defense 
Department officials, who are expected to recommend cutbacks to a federal base 
closure commission in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're evaluating each facility, and we'll make recommendations to the 
secretary of defense shortly after the first of the year," Dalton said at a 
news conference after the ceremony. "We still have a lot more work to do before 
we make those decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The anniversary celebration marked Dalton's first visit to the Naval Weapons 
Station, where about 700 civilian employees are nervously awaiting the 
elimination of 100 more jobs by mid-November. There has been a 50% cut in the 
civilian work force during the past six months. There are no immediate cuts 
planned for the 175 military personnel on duty, according to base officials. 
But in the post-Cold War world, military downsizing is a way of life, Dalton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the right thing to do for us to get smaller, but it's important that we 
do it in the right way," Dalton said. "In order for us to be able to afford the 
new ships and the new aircraft -- plus take care of our people . . . we have to 
reduce infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach residents fear rampant development on the 5,000-acre base if the 
weapons station is closed as the federal government reduces the size of the 
military. And environmentalists worry about the future of the 1,000-acre Seal 
Beach National Wildlife Refuge on base grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 After Seal Beach Mayor George Brown presented base commander Joel F. Steadley 
with a congratulatory proclamation, he told the audience that in 50 years, he 
hoped the mayor of Seal Beach would be celebrating the centennial of the 
weapons base. 
</P>
<P>
 After the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Seal Beach was one of four West 
Coast sites selected by the Navy for ammunition depots. But the opening of the 
Seal Beach station was delayed by the difficulty of securing land from myriad 
private owners, according to Capt. John C. Devlin, commander of the Pacific 
Division Naval Ordnance Center, which is headquartered here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here at Seal Beach, there were more than 1,000 landowners to work with, to 
acquire the property rights for the federal government," Devlin said during the 
ceremony. "Even though America had suddenly been pushed into the second World 
War, the Navy exercised due caution in protecting the rights of the Seal Beach 
landowners." 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons base opened Nov. 2, 1944, as the Seal Beach Naval Ammunition and 
Net Depot, charged with the primary mission of storing ammunition and repairing 
steel anti-submarine nets used to block enemy submarines from entering American 
ports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, the base adapted to missile maintenance duties, becoming a 
full-fledged weapons station in the 1960s. During that period, part of the 
Saturn 5 rocket system used in the Apollo and Skylab space missions was 
assembled at the weapons station. 
</P>
<P>
 During his speech, Dalton pointed out the critical role the weapons station 
now plays in supplying most of the Navy's surface-to-air missiles to the 
Pacific Fleet, which is based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Likewise, it is here that the Tomahawk missile -- potent weapon of the Gulf 
War and deterrent for such future wars -- is readied for the fleet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton, 52, served on two submarines during a stint in the Navy from 1964 to 
1969. He was nominated to the Federal Home Loan Bank board by President Jimmy 
Carter in 1979 after a career in investment banking. He became the 70th 
secretary of the Navy in July, 1993.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / HUNTINGTON BEACH CITY COUNCIL; 22 CANDIDATES CROWD THE FIELD 
IN RACE FOR FOUR SEATS; MAIN ISSUES INCLUDE FUTURE OF BOLSA CHICA WETLANDS, 
BALANCING THE CITY BUDGET AS RESOURCES DWINDLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A near-record 22 candidates are running in Tuesday's election for four City 
Council seats in a battle that promises to change the makeup of the city's 
leadership and determine how it will deal with a range of issues, from the 
future of the Bolsa Chica wetlands to balancing the budget with dwindling 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since 1966, when 27 candidates were on the ballot, have so many sought 
election to the seven-member council, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very important election with that many seats open and the potential 
of that many seats changing," said Joyce Riddell, president of the Huntington 
Beach Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The four seats up for election belong to Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, who is 
running for the 2nd District Board of Supervisors seat; Councilman Earle 
Robitaille, who decided not to seek reelection; Councilwoman Grace Winchell, 
who has served two consecutive four-year terms and is not eligible to seek 
reelection, and Councilman Ralph Bauer, who was appointed two years ago to 
complete the term of the late Councilman Jack Kelly and is seeking election. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth seat could become available if Councilman Jim Silva, who is also 
running for the Board of Supervisors, should win election. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Gail Hutton, who has served for 16 years, is running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates say the primary issues the city will have to grapple with 
during the next four years include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Balancing the budget with diminishing resources and raising enough revenue 
to provide the services that residents expect. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reducing crime and providing adequate police, fire and marine safety 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Attracting new businesses and retaining existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major issue is the future of the Bolsa Chica wetlands and the impact 
on the city if the county approves the building of up to 4,300 homes on the 
property. Some candidates favor a compromise plan to allow some home 
development in exchange for restoration of the wetlands; others want the Bolsa 
Chica area to remain undeveloped and the wetlands to be preserved as an 
ecological reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the candidates: 
</P>
<P>
 * George E. Arnold, 65, who is self-employed and a native of Huntington Beach. 
He wants to prevent the destruction of the wetlands and to preserve beaches. He 
supports programs to bring in new businesses and favors more activities and 
programs for senior citizens and youth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bauer, 64, a businessman and 30-year resident who is vying to keep his 
council seat for another four years. He favors more resources to fight crime 
and a city budget in which the delivery of services is cost-effective. He 
supports preservation of Bolsa Chica wetlands via a land swap with the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jonothon M. Cone, computer professional and entrepreneur, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shirley S. Dettloff, 59, a 30-year resident, owner of a publishing business 
and chairwoman of the city Planning Commission. She wants to ensure financial 
stability so the city can provide services residents expect. She supports 
increased public safety and community-oriented policing, and favors a quality 
restoration program for Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thom Doney, 32, a school vice principal and a seven-year resident. He favors 
increased public safety and more police officers on the streets, and wants to 
boost sales tax revenue by keeping and attracting businesses. He charges that 
the majority of the current council is unresponsive to the needs of residents 
and business. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dave Garofalo, 49, a newspaper publisher and 25-year resident. He favors 
attracting new businesses to increase tax revenue for adequate public safety 
services, supports a youth sports complex and wants a solution to the Bolsa 
Chica to achieve restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peter Green, 68, a college professor and 24-year resident who served on the 
council from 1984 to 1992. He believes the top issue is finding ways to balance 
the budget with diminishing resources, favors revitalizing the business 
community and supports more senior citizen and youth activities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Henderson, 35, business owner, transportation engineer and 
eight-year resident. He believes the city faces out-of-control spending and 
payroll costs. He supports tougher anti-gang measures and law enforcement, and 
wants to attract new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paul Horgan, 50, a mediator, businessman and 10-year resident. He favors 
preserving the entire Bolsa Chica wetlands area from development and wants to 
ensure that pension "spiking" by city employees never occurs again. He wants to 
reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ed Kerins, who declined to give his age, a management information 
specialist, city planning commissioner and 26-year resident. He wants to expand 
the city's tax base to prevent increases in fees and taxes. He wants to promote 
business and job growth and favors preservation of the environment and open 
spaces, including the entire Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vida Louise Martin, 44, a homemaker, chief executive officer of Orange 
County Headstart Inc. and seven-year resident. She favors balancing the budget

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BOARD DELAYS VOTE ON NEW RADIO SYSTEM 
</P>

<P>
 Concerned about the financing for a new countywide communications system, the 
Board of Supervisors has postponed a vote on a resolution that would allow the 
county to recover costs associated with finalizing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed resolution drew criticism from board members because it states 
that the $80-million system would be financed by a $150-million bond. 
</P>
<P>
 County staff, however, assured the board that they routinely allow themselves 
a financial "cushion" as a matter of policy and that the final dollar figure 
will be close to the original bid presented by Motorola Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, county supervisors said Tuesday they preferred waiting another 
two weeks until the costs of the project are more accurately determined before 
agreeing to the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do understand that this is not an appropriation, but rather a resolution to 
allow us to recover costs, but I do have a problem with the $150-million 
figure," Supervisor William G. Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Randall L. Erickson, who represented the losing bidder for the 
project. -- Harris Corp. of Melbourne, Fla. -- sent a letter to the board this 
week questioning the resolution's bond figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson has obtained a subpoena seeking information from the county about the 
negotiations with Motorola. He also has sued a consultant who advised the 
county during the bidding process, contending that the consultant's 
recommendations were unfairly biased against Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Erickson said he thought the board's postponement showed "a great 
deal of wisdom." MATT LAIT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY OKS ORDINANCE TO LIMIT DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to an ordinance that 
would increase the city's power to prevent waste dumping and punish the 
dumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members were concerned that the ordinance may create an 
unnecessary burden on local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see business owners required to obtain multiple permits and 
be subject to multiple inspections for the same thing," Councilman Greg Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance is required by the federal Clean Water Act to help reduce 
pollution caused by the discharge of waste into storm drains. The federal 
government wants cities to crack down on businesses that illegally dump waste 
materials into storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board has subsequently issued 
waste discharge regulations for all Orange County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tightening of hazardous waste regulations could require business 
owners to obtain permits from city, county and state officials, according to 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved a first reading of the ordinance, which would 
require a city permit for "allowable" discharges into storm drains. The council 
also called for a report from the Public Works Department on the effect of the 
ordinance on business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said businesses that generate hazardous waste are already required to 
comply with state and county regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would seem like a redundancy to have businesses subjected to city permits 
and inspections," Smith said. RUSS LOAR

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of UC Irvine's most well-known scholars has been selected to an elite 
national health organization, a UCI spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
 F. Sherwood Rowland, professor of chemistry, is one of five researchers across 
the nation honored this year by selection to the Institute of Medicine, based 
in Washington.Members are chosen for their contributions to health and medicine 
or related fields in the sciences, law, administration and economics, UCI 
spokeswoman Cynthia Morris said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Institute of Medicine was created in 1970s as a component of the National 
Academy of Sciences. Institute members, who are not paid, meet to discuss 
issues of national health policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland was selected for his acclaimed work in atmospheric chemistry. In 1974, 
he and then-postdoctoral student Mario Molina first explored the danger that 
chlorofluorocarbon gases posed to the atmosphere. Their work led to a ban on 
certain aerosol propellants in the United States two years later.  
</P>
<P>
 Rowland also is foreign secretary of the National Academy of Sciences and 
keeps in touch with science academies in other countries. He also is chairman 
of the Office of International Affairs of the National Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired from the UCI faculty in June through the University of California's 
early retirement program but recently signed a five-year contract to continue 
research and teaching, Morris said.ALICIA DI RADO

 Need a business license or a building permit? Just put it on the plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week approved a plan to accept Visa and MasterCard 
credit cards for all city permit and licensing fees.City officials estimate 
that it will take 60 days to get the program running. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to increase our business-friendly service," said Bob 
Storchheim, city building and safety administrator. "People come in and they 
don't have enough money in their checking accounts -- this way, we'll save them 
a trip to the bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Storchheim said that Irvine is one of the first cities in the county to accept 
credit cards for fees. But only Visa and MasterCard will be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will charge credit card users a small fee to cover the amount charged 
to the city for credit card transactions. But city officials are negotiating 
with the bank for lower fees for the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members also approved a plan that will allow fax machine applications 
for city permits. A onetime $25 fee will be charged to cover the cost of 
establishing a computer file for the applicant. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; WEST POINT IS GOAL FOR NATIVE 
AMERICAN TEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When April Ramos Baraconi was 6, she wore fatigues and played army in the 
fields near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Lask week, Baraconi, a high school senior -- and an 11th-generation Juaneno 
Mission Indian -- was in Washington for a Young Leaders National Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 And next, she hopes to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County admissions coordinator for the academy said Wednesday that 
Baraconi is probably one of the first Native Americans from Orange County to 
seek admission at West Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition is formidable. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, about 150 students a year seek admission to West Point, said 
Edgar Johnson, county admissions coordinator, and about 14 or 15 make it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, about 14,000 apply, and roughly 1,000 will be accepted, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baraconi must pass muster with the academy and then be nominated by either 
local U.S. Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside), U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein or U.S. 
Sen. Barbara Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 Baraconi is a student at Santa Margarita Catholic High School. She has also 
been a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Baraconi is a descendant of Spanish soldiers who settled in San Juan 
Capistrano.  
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 11 generations of her family has ties to the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really been amazing to me the support I've had from the community, my 
friends, family and their friends," she said. JEFF BEAN

<P>
 A visit to vocational learning classes at Rancho Alamitos High School doesn't 
turn up a room cluttered with vises, power tools and grease. The days of metal 
shop are over. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, students tackle hands-on experiments in a high-technology lab 
crammed with lasers, wind tunnels, satellite navigation equipment and other 
advanced computers and electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, about 120 students have been taking a new course called 
"Introduction to Technology." The class offers students a chance to work on 
state-of-the-art equipment such as computer-assisted drafting hardware, plastic 
molding machines and structural stress monitors, said Alan Trudell, spokesman 
for the Garden Grove Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The district spent $80,000 of federal vocational funds to outfit the lab, and 
spent an equal amount to equip a second lab at La Quinta High School, which 
offers a similar program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, students spend 10 days with each of 16 kinds of advanced 
technological equipment. Students must read manuals to learn how to operate the 
equipment and perform experiments, said Robert Smith, who teaches the class. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to get them to teach themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a break from studying aerodynamic principles with the help of a wind 
tunnel, Kevin Lea, 16, said the class was exciting, impressive and unlike any 
that he has taken before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really interesting to come in here and work with all this stuff. It's 
awesome. I feel kind of lucky to be in here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos previously offered metal shop, but replaced it because it was 
outdated and offered students less variety than the new laboratory. Vocational 
education now requires more familiarity with computerized hardware, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole new era is moving into technology and we feel that's where the jobs 
are," he said.JON NALICK

 The City Council has appointed Heidi Holzinger and Jim Ashcraft to fill two 
seats on the city's Fine Arts and Cultural Affairs Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Holzinger and Ashcraft will serve until Jan. 31, but are likely to be 
reappointed for three more years. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Donna Velin said that the council normally reappoints committee and 
commission members who have served out unexpired terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member Fine Arts and Cultural Affairs Commission is responsible for 
holding the city's annual photo contest, an art show and other cultural events. 
The panel meets on the third Wednesday of each month at 7 p.m. in the council 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 One seat is still vacant, Velin said. Former commission members Kathi Volzke 
and Donna Overby have moved out of the city, and Althea Miller has been 
appointed director of Los Alamitos Television. 
</P>
<P>
 City policy prohibits residents from serving on two committees or commissions.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In spite of a funding shortfall, the City Council moved ahead this week with 
plans to build a $6.3-million police substation in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3-0 Tuesday to authorize architectural designs for the 
facility on a city-owned parcel at Dream Street and Monte Vista Road.Design 
plans for the 33,000-square-foot facility are expected to be completed within 
eight months, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The substation would include police locker rooms, underground parking and a 
temporary detention facility. Construction is expected to take about 13 months 
once a contractor is selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents near the substation recently voted to appropriate $2.8 million in 
funds from an assessment district toward the project. But the city is still 
about $2 million short of the estimated cost of the facility, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials assured concerned Anaheim Hills residents that the substation 
is a "high priority," and that the facility will be built, either by finding 
more money or reducing its cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dream Street site, which is next to Fire Station No. 10, was selected from 
among 16 potential sites last year. MARTIN MILLER

 Ocean View school board candidate Eugene Mulcahy said this week that while he 
once intended to back out of the race, he is still running as a serious 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview early last month, Mulcahy, 38, said he planned to leave his 
name on the ballot but not seriously campaign at the request of a teachers 
union that endorsed another candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulcahy, a high school adaptive physical education teacher, said he changed 
his mind days later after receiving supportive calls from several dozen voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates for three seats on the Ocean View elementary school 
district board are incumbents Carol Kanode and Tracy Pellman, science 
consultant Bryan Bridges, businessman Gordon Busch, business consultant Jim 
Peters, homemaker Pam Walker and certified public accountant Daniel T. 
Villella. LYNN FRANEY

 A study of all arrests made in the city over a nine-month period this year 
shows that more than 60% of those taken into custody were non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
 During the study period, the Brea Police Department, which provides police 
service to Yorba Linda, made 946 arrests, 155 of them on felony charges.Yorba 
Linda residents accounted for 370 of the arrests, 55 of them for felonies. 
Suspects who lived outside the county were involved in 234 arrests, and those 
with addresses in other county cities accounted for 329 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was requested by the City Council after a council member raised the 
issue of annexing several unincorporated "islands" into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John M. Gullixson wants to annex the land so that the Brea Police 
Department, rather than the Orange County Sheriff's Department, will patrol 
those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are (criminal) elements from outside the city that congregate where 
they won't feel hassled" by police, Gullixson said. "Those unincorporated 
areas, which aren't patrolled as well as the rest of our city, are appealing to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, residents in the unincorporated areas within the city 
boundaries accounted for 13 arrests, none for felonies. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; DOCENTS' AIM: LURE LIMBAUGH TO LIBRARY

<P>
 Among the famous names in the guest book at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace, one that two docents consider important is missing: Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Docents Chris Naughton and Callie Jones have spent weeks preparing a package 
that they hope will lure the controversial radio and television talk-show host 
to visit the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have too much time on our hands, but we have really gone all out on 
this," Naughton said.  
</P>
<P>
 After failed attempts by library officials to schedule Limbaugh for a speaking 
engagement, Naughton and Jones decided to take on the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really like him, but aside from that it would be a real economic boon to 
the library to have him here," Naughton said.  
</P>
<P>
 The two have faxed cryptic messages to Limbaugh, telling him to watch for a 
big announcement from the Nixon Library. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Limbaugh, Naughton and Jones offer a variety of incentives, 
including transportation from the airport to the museum in a helicopter; 
lodging at the hotel where the Nixons were married and a personal tour of the 
library, with them as tour guides. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't come to the Library, we'll be the laughing stock of the town. 
We'll have to resign as docents so (library officials) won't have us to kick 
around anymore," the letter ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he doesn't accept, we'll send him this letter every week until he does," 
Naughton said. "I don't know if this will work, but I can't imagine what more 
we can do." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 A public hearing on the proposed widening of Imperial Highway has been 
rescheduled for Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council canceled tonight's hearing after representatives from the 
Orange County Transportation Authority said they would not be able to attend. 
OCTA was scheduled to present proposed plans for the project, which is opposed 
by some residents and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council called for the public hearing after repeated complaints from 
two local business owners that residents and merchants had not had adequate 
opportunities to voice concerns about the project.  
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing is now set for 7 p.m. Dec. 6 in council chambers, during 
the regular City Council meeting. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 Mayor Charles V. Smith recently was installed as president of the Orange 
County Division of the League of California Cities. He will serve for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 61, said he plans to form special task forces to address issues such as 
immigration and the state's continued efforts to balance its budget on the 
backs of cities. 
</P>
<P>
 He said cities must lobby for change in state government, which he said is 
incapable of solving its financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who is running unopposed in the mayoral election Tuesday, was chairman 
of the Orange County Division's selection committee, which appoints city 
representatives to various commissions and committees, including the Orange 
County Transportation Authority, the Air Quality Management District, the Local 
Agency Formation Commission and the Harbors, Beaches and Parks Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's Orange County Division is composed of 156 council members from 30 
Orange County cities. The organization works on countywide and regional issues 
and provides legislative advocacy, legal information and municipal training 
services.BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fire Department has taken over code enforcement duties in a move that city 
officials said might save taxpayers about $80,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural extension of what we're doing," said Fire Marshal Don Tully, 
head of the Fire Prevention Division, which last month took over duties usually 
handled by employees from the Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the system also will make code enforcement more efficient 
because more people will be placed on the job. Tully said four officers in his 
department now constitute the code enforcement team, and each will be 
responsible for a particular area in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 For years, the city had only two employees to check on abandoned vehicles and 
poorly maintained properties, and to investigate other code violations such as 
building overcrowding, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Bill Smith said the Fire Department took over after the city's 
remaining code enforcement employee quit in August. BERT ELJERA

 A collection of World War II memorabilia will be on display at the Los 
Alamitos Museum beginning Friday and continuing until next September, according 
to museum director Margrit Kendricks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Project Remembrance" will feature war photos, weapons and other souvenirs 
sent to loved ones by residents who fought in Europe and in the Pacific, 
Kendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the exhibit will include mementos of those who did not fight in 
the war, such as helmets and gas masks of those who served on the home front's 
civil defense, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Poignant pieces, such as telegrams informing mothers and wives about the death 
of a son or a husband and flags used to drape coffins, will also be on display, 
Kendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are painful memories that we have put aside through the years," 
Kendricks said. "But part of the healing is remembering." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she got the idea for the exhibit while watching televised observances 
of the 50th anniversary of the landing of Allied forces in Normandy. Kendricks 
said that an open house starting at 7 p.m. Friday will launch the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hendricks, a U.S. officer during the war, will talk about the 
surrender of a town in Italy and the role of the B-17 "Flying Fortress" bombers 
during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 A B-17 model constructed by a Rossmoor resident is part of the exhibit, 
Kendricks said. Other items to be displayed include French knives, a German 
pilot's leather jacket and uniforms of U.S. soldiers and nurses. BERT ELJERA

WAIT IS ALMOST OVER FOR KIDNEY TRANSPLANT FROM WIFE TO HUSBAND; MEDICINE: 
MISSION VIEJO COUPLE'S ONCE-THREATENED OPERATION IS SCHEDULED FOR NEXT 
WEDNESDAY IN SAN DIEGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The tale of a kidney transplant involving two Mission Viejo newlyweds, which 
captured national attention, took another turn Wednesday as the couple learned 
that the operation jeopardized three weeks ago by a medical mishap can go 
forward after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring unforeseen complications, Victoria Ingram-Curlee, 45, will donate one 
of her kidneys to her new husband, Randall Curlee, 46, next Wednesday at Sharp 
Memorial Hospital in San Diego, the couple and the surgeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to wait any longer," an ebullient Ingram-Curlee said, two 
hours after getting the go-ahead from Sharp's renal transplantation director 
Robert Mendez. "Everything looks fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram-Curlee said the news came "almost in the nick of time" for her husband, 
a diabetic who became so ill over the weekend with insulin shock that 
paramedics had to be summoned to their home.  
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, he had become lethargic and almost incoherent, Ingram-Curlee 
said, but was revived after she gave him three large glasses of concentrated 
orange juice. He did not need to be hospitalized. Randall Curlee's health was 
deteriorating to the point that he risked being placed on kidney dialysis soon. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an appointment next Wednesday with the renal doctor to examine him," 
she said. "Obviously we're not going to get to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Curlee said the couple had been told the transplant had an only 50-50 chance 
of proceeding after a radiologist nicked an artery in Ingram-Curlee's left 
kidney during a routine medical test Oct. 12, one day after they were married. 
The nick caused the blood flow through the artery to the lower area of the 
kidney to become partially blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez said Wednesday that medical tests in the past two weeks, including 
another Tuesday, showed both kidneys functioning normally. The surgeon said the 
blood supply in one of the three arteries in Ingram-Curlee's left kidney is 
"slightly diminished," but that may be corrected during next week's surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgeon said it has not been decided which kidney Ingram-Curlee will 
donate, but that it most likely will be the left one. The transplant team 
initially leaned toward taking the right kidney, but now don't want to take a 
chance of leaving Ingram-Curlee with a kidney that might become compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always want to do what's best for donors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just fine with Randall Curlee, who said that during the past three 
weeks his main concern has been for the health of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she had been in any danger, I never would have let it proceed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving the left kidney, even if the obstruction cannot be repaired, would 
in any case mean a major improvement in his own health, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he felt so grateful to his wife that he was at a loss for words. 
Against enormous odds, she turned out to be a near-perfect organ donor for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you say to someone who's saving your life?" he said. "If you don't 
say they're the most wonderful person in the world, you're a chump -- and if 
you do, they think you're just saying it. She knows how I feel about her." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ingram-Curlee, the good news came after a day of apprehension. On Tuesday, 
she underwent the same test that three weeks ago imperiled the transplant. The 
same radiologist, Dr. Harold Coons, a respected physician who colleagues and 
the Curlees say was not to blame for the extremely rare complication, performed 
the second test. 
</P>
<P>
 But everything went smoothly and, after returning home from a night in the 
hospital, she got the news she dreamed of and finally felt free to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy," she said. "I'm actually putting together some Christmas 
stuff, garlands on the banisters . . . dressing up the house a little bit." She 
hoped to surprise her husband when he came home from work.

MAN GETS 4 MONTHS FOR TRAFFICKING IN BEAR PARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim man was sentenced Wednesday to four months in County Jail for 
trafficking in bear gall bladders that can bring up to $1,000 an ounce on the 
black market. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence, which attorneys agreed was stiff, should send a message to 
anyone who sells wild animals or wild animal parts that they will be punished, 
prosecutor Valerie Griswold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trafficking in bear parts, she said, has become a particular problem in the 
past two decades. Gall bladders are especially popular in some Asian 
communities, she said, where they are considered an aphrodisiac and medicinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Charles Schulte, 32, pleaded guilty to the trafficking charge 
Wednesday in Municipal Court in Santa Ana. He was also ordered to serve three 
years on probation. Schulte faced a maximum of three years in a state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Robert Knox had argued Schulte should serve no jail 
time, and said the sentence was too stiff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a harsh, high sentence for a person like Mr. Schulte, who 
has no prior record and never did anything wrong in his life," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold said the bladders apparently came from bears that were lawfully 
hunted in Canada. They were shipped to Wyoming, where shipment within the state 
is not a crime, then brought to California.  
</P>
<P>
 Schulte told investigators he planned to sell 12 bladders in Little Saigon and 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Possession of two or more bear bladders in this state violates California's 
Fish and Game Code, and is a felony. State wildlife officials were tipped about 
the shipment by their counterparts in Wyoming.

ARREST SHOCKS FAMILY OF SLAYING SUSPECT 
</P>

 Stunned relatives of Eric Wayne Bennett said Wednesday that the 23-year-old 
carpet installer they described as "mellow" could never have sodomized and 
bludgeoned to death a Laguna Hills woman, the crime for which he was arrested 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, arrested at his parents' home in Fallbrook late Monday, was taken to 
Orange County Jail in Santa Ana and will be arraigned today in Orange County 
Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel on a charge of murder with special 
circumstances, which could bring the death penalty if he is convicted, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Carolyn Kirkwood said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkwood declined further comment on the case. Bennett's relatives say they 
are standing behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Bennett, the suspect's mother, said her son "is the most mellow person 
you could talk to. If there is any confrontation, he walks away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said that before her son's arrest, he had been cooperating fully with 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department investigation into the killing of Marie 
Evans Powell, 50, whose body was found in her Laguna Hills townhouse on Oct. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Bennett did not think it was unusual that investigators had taken his 
fingerprints, since he had installed linoleum flooring at Powell's home before 
her murder. "He said he had to be fingerprinted because his prints were in the 
house," the mother said. According to a sheriff's spokesman, Bennett made two 
visits to her residence in the 22400 block of Caminito Tecate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Bennett said her son also gave a sample of his blood to the homicide 
investigators and he and his wife, Karen, allowed authorities to search the 
house where they lived in Costa Mesa with their two sons, ages 4 and 9 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said she believes her son was arrested in part because he spent the 
night of the murder visiting bars in Newport Beach, while his wife was home 
watching their children, so it would be difficult to account for his 
whereabouts at all times. "It does not look good," she said. "He was just out." 
</P>
<P>
 Leah Bennett, 20, the suspect's sister who spoke with him Wednesday on the 
telephone, said he told her he went to three bars near the Newport Pier on the 
night of Oct. 13, the last night Powell was seen alive. She said her brother 
told her because he had just moved to Orange County a month before, he "wanted 
to check out the new scene."  
</P>
<P>
 His sister said he told her he left home about 6:30 p.m. and returned about 1 
a.m., during which time he said his wife dropped by the bars three times to 
visit him. However, she said he told her the investigators said that his "story 
didn't wash." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Bennett said she went to see her husband in the bars because she was 
frightened to be at home alone. "A lady next door had been raped a few days 
earlier, and I kept saying, 'Please come home,' " Karen Bennett recalled. She 
described her husband as "a super hard worker" and "a good guy."

FARBER FILES COUNTERSUIT AGAINST DORNAN OVER MAILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what has proven to be the nastiest local race in this year's election, 
Democratic congressional candidate Mike Farber on Wednesday filed a 
counter-lawsuit against his Republican rival, Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden 
Grove, contending a new Dornan campaign mailer is defamatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber's lawsuit comes a week after the incumbent and his wife, Sallie, filed 
a libel suit against Farber, which alleged that the Democrat maliciously 
distributed false information about the Dornans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dornans' suit referred to a Farber campaign mailer, which used excerpts 
from court records in which Sallie Dornan accused her husband of abuse. Sallie 
Dornan has since recanted those charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit against Dornan was prompted by a mailer sent this week to voters 
in the 46th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer contains a letter signed by Democrat Robert J. Banuelos, who lost 
to Dornan two years ago and then lost this year's Democratic primary to Farber. 
Banuelos, who recently endorsed Dornan, signed the letter attacking Farber. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, Banuelos calls Farber an "unethical liar seeking personal 
gain." It also states that local Democratic Party leaders supported Farber 
because they wanted "anyone but an American of Hispanic heritage" to run 
against Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber's lawsuit alleges, "This statement implies through innuendo that Mike 
Farber is anti-Hispanic. The statement is untrue. . . . (It) ignores the fact 
that there were three other non-Hispanic candidates in the Democratic primary." 
</P>
<P>
 Banuelos, arguing that Farber moved to the district for political gain, also 
contended in the letter that Farber's wife, Gail, works in San Diego and that 
the couple has a home in Oceanside. The Farber lawsuit states that these 
assertions are untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The letter was defamatory and exposed (the Farbers) to contempt, ridicule and 
obloquy, and impugned their reputation among the residents of the 46th 
Congressional District," the lawsuit states.  
</P>
<P>
 Sallie Dornan, who is running her husband's reelection campaign, called the 
Farber lawsuit "stupid." She said she trusts Banuelos' word, even though they 
were once political rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very, very family oriented. He adores his parents. I have his word, and 
I believe him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Farber has refused Dornan's challenge to debate him one last time 
before Tuesday's election because of a scheduling conflict. The debate -- 
requested by Dornan but sponsored by United We Stand -- will be held tonight at 
the Walnut Manor, 891 Walnut Manor Road, in Anaheim, between Dornan and 
Libertarian candidate Richard G. Newhouse.

SUSPECT IN OFFICER'S DEATH SAYS HE DOESN'T RECALL CRASH; ACCIDENT: THE ACCUSED 
DRUNK DRIVER IS EXPECTED TO BE CHARGED TODAY IN LA HABRA POLICEMAN'S KILLING, 
AUTHORITIES SAY.

 The suspected drunk driver accused of killing police Officer Michael Anthony 
Osornio has told investigators he does not remember the fatal car crash Monday 
night or events leading up to it, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my understanding he didn't recall any of the incident," said Capt. Terry 
M. Rammell, who is supervising investigators probing the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Villegas Ramirez, 51, whose blood-alcohol level of .18 was more than 
twice the legal limit at the time of the Monday night collision, is expected to 
be formally charged today, Rammell said. Police will recommend that the 
district attorney's office charge Ramirez with murder, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, who suffered facial injuries, remained in stable condition Wednesday 
at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Osornio's family and colleagues worked on scheduling weekend funeral services 
for the officer, even as flowers and sympathy cards continued to flow into the 
La Habra Police Department.  
</P>
<P>
 La Habra police announced that memorial services for Osornio on Saturday will 
include a procession of police vehicles, an honor accorded officers killed in 
the line of duty. Osornio joined the La Habra Police Department 14 months ago 
and became engaged to his high school sweetheart two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A public viewing is scheduled for Friday from 5:30 to 9 p.m. at Rose Hills 
Memorial Park in Whittier. A memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday 
at Calvary Chapel-Golden Springs in Diamond Bar, with burial to follow at Rose 
Hills Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Osornio is the first officer to be killed on duty since the city incorporated 
in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still, rightfully so, extremely upset," Rammell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery remains how Ramirez -- a man who friends and relatives said seldom 
drank alcohol and warned against drunk driving -- came to be allegedly 
intoxicated at the wheel of a car that witnesses said was traveling at least 60 
m.p.h. when it broadsided Osornio's cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Rammell said police have not determined where Ramirez had been before the 
crash at the intersection of Beach and La Habra boulevards. Investigators found 
no empty cans or bottles in Ramirez's Buick station wagon, or in an office at 
his La Mirada workplace, where Ramirez has lived the past six months, Rammell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Lindblade, the owner of the metalwork firm where Ramirez was employed, 
speculated that he may have been on his way to a favorite restaurant on La 
Habra Boulevard at the time.  
</P>
<P>
 One of Ramirez's sons, who moved from Monterey Park to Hidalgo, Mexico, last 
fall, on Wednesday backed accounts by friends who said Ramirez was not a 
drinking man. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't drink to excess or to get drunk," said Mario Villegas, 25. He said 
he was unaware of any personal problems that co-workers said were bothering his 
father in recent months. Villegas said he spoke to his father by telephone 
Saturday and "everything was fine." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Ramirez discussed plans to visit his wife and two grown sons in 
Hidalgo over the Christmas holidays. "We need to talk to him. We're not sure of 
the truth," Villegas said.

2 TO BE CHARGED WITH HATE CRIME IN KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they plan to file hate-crime charges today against a 
suspected skinhead accused of killing a black man during a Huntington Beach 
dispute and attempting to kill two Latino men in an assault a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional hate-crime charges will also be lodged against a 17-year-old who is 
charged in the Huntington Beach murder, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Tanizaki. 
</P>
<P>
 Both defendants are scheduled to be arraigned on the new charges this morning 
in Municipal Court in Westminster. The charges -- that the crimes were racially 
motivated -- make them eligible for longer sentences if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that Jonathan Kennedy, 19, of Huntington Beach and 
Robert Wofford, 17, of Laguna Niguel are involved with white-supremacist 
groups, although their level of involvement remains under investigation, 
Tanizaki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanizaki alleged that the September killing of Vernon Windell Flournoy, 44, of 
Huntington Beach and the August attack on Angel Campos Silia and Juan Vergara, 
both 22, were racially motivated. Flournoy was shot after an apparent dispute 
with both suspects. Authorities alleged that Kennedy shot Silia and Vergara 
without provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the evidence definitely shows the crimes alleged in the complaints 
were hate crimes against all three of the victims," Tanizaki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys for Kennedy and Wofford could not be reached for comment 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The case marks the latest in a recent series of violent attacks against Orange 
County minorities and gays that some activists say is part of a countywide 
escalation of hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy and Wofford -- who is being prosecuted as an adult -- are each charged 
with one count of murder and using a weapon. Kennedy is additionally charged 
with two counts of attempted murder, weapons counts and causing severe injury 
to Silia and Vergara, who are recovering from their gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair face at least 15 years to life in prison if convicted of 
second-degree murder in the case. The hate-crime allegations would add up to 
four more years in prison, Tanizaki said. Kennedy faces an additional six years 
in prison if convicted of the hate-crime allegations relating to the attempted 
murders, Tanizaki said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tanizaki said he has not ruled out the possibility that prosecutors will 
seek first-degree murder convictions and file the hate crime as a so-called 
special circumstance allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Upgrading the charges could make Kennedy eligible for the death penalty and 
send Wofford, if convicted, to prison for life without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanizaki said the Huntington Beach Police Department has been methodically 
investigating the case and noted that proving a hate crime makes the job doubly 
difficult.

NEW YORKER WRITER CLEARED OF LIBELING PSYCHOANALYST; COURTS: JURY RULES JANET 
MALCOLM DID NOT INTENTIONALLY ERR IN USING TWO FALSE QUOTES. DECISION ENDS 
10-YEAR CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury here cleared New Yorker writer Janet Malcolm of libeling a 
controversial psychoanalyst Wednesday after a protracted legal battle that 
rocked the psychoanalytic community and put journalistic ethics on trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury of seven women and one man found that two of five quotations 
challenged by psychoanalyst Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson were false, but decided 
that the writer had not intentionally erred in her 1983 New Yorker profile. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old case ended in a mistrial last year after a different jury 
found that Malcolm had committed libel but deadlocked on the amount of damages 
to award Masson. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm interviewed Masson repeatedly after his renegade views about Sigmund 
Freud cost the former Sanskrit scholar his prestigious job as curator of the 
Freud Archives in London, where Freud's research, letters and other documents 
are stored. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm's 48,500-word article portrayed Masson as an egomaniac obsessed with 
sex. Among other things, he had claimed that he had sex with more than 1,000 
women, a statement he did not contest. 
</P>
<P>
 During both trials Malcolm testified that she had compressed quotations taken 
from different times and settings into a single monologue, a controversial 
practice criticized by many journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Masson sued Malcolm and the New Yorker for $7.5 million, contending that her 
portrait had made him a laughingstock in the academic community. The magazine 
was dropped from the case after the first jury found that Malcolm was an 
independent contractor, not an employee, when she wrote the article. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm said she was pleased that the trial had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am glad this is over," said Malcolm, 59, who has continued to write for the 
New Yorker, "and now I can go back to do what I love doing best, which is 
writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the legal fight has changed her journalistic practices, she 
said, "Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O. Morgan Jr., Masson's lawyer, described his client as "very 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought I was going to win it," said Morgan, a renowned libel 
lawyer, "but I have been trying cases too long not to know that anything could 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said he has not decided whether to appeal the verdict. Because of its 
seemingly interminable nature, the long-running libel case has been compared to 
Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce from Charles Dickens' novel "Bleak House," in which a 
family legal dispute spanned generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Leyva, 44, a juror in the second trial, said the panel, after 
reviewing the writer's taped interviews with Masson, believed that he "just dug 
a hole for himself" and could have been portrayed even more negatively. "If she 
really wanted to make him look bad," said Leyva, a telephone company systems 
analyst, "she had the direct quotes to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Leyva said, the panel was suspicious about whether Malcolm had 
invented some of the challenged quotations because they were not on tape and 
she had lost her original notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, three were contained in a four-page section of typed 
material that Malcolm said she had taken from her handwritten notes. Malcolm 
said she had used another quote from memory. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating 3 1/2 days, the jury decided to believe Malcolm because 
there was no evidence to prove she made up the quotations, Leyva said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors faulted Malcolm on two points: for using a quotation from Masson 
they believed wrongly reflected his views on a speech he gave about the 
sterility of psychoanalysis, and for taking another quotation out of context. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyva said Masson had contradicted himself during the more than 40 hours of 
taped interviews with Malcolm, but the writer should have used the quotation 
that most accurately reflected the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Masson is a public figure, he had to prove that Malcolm intentionally 
distorted his comments or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyva said the jury did not feel she had acted maliciously, in part because 
she did not include more damaging material she had on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 He said at least one juror seemed inclined to doubt Masson because she was so 
disgusted with his sexual exploits. The first jury that found Masson had been 
libeled also had seven women and one man. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary L. Bostwick, an attorney for Malcolm, said he believed the second jury 
reached a different conclusion because Malcolm prepared more carefully for her 
testimony in the retrial, and he spent more time explaining the legal 
requirements for a libel verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he argued more extensively during the retrial that Malcolm had 
not believed that any of the quotations were wrong when she wrote the profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm's technique of stringing together quotations from different times and 
places without using ellipses apparently did not bother the jury. The writer 
used this technique in describing a lunch with Masson at Berkeley's famed Chez 
Panisse restaurant, where Masson complained that the writer even fabricated 
what he ate for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire jury felt that a journalist should be able to make an article 
presentable," Leyva said, as long as the writer does not distort the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom Goldstein, dean of the graduate school of journalism at UC Berkeley, 
called this practice "regrettable." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you read the New Yorker you assume that the quote you are reading was 
uttered by the person who is supposed to have uttered it at the place where the 
author said," said Goldstein, a friend of both Masson and Malcolm's editor at 
the New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Malcolm's compression of quotations into a single monologue goes 
"against what I consider to be good journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, Masson's attorney, said he found it disturbing that Malcolm continued 
to defend her journalistic technique of compressing quotations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more that becomes known," he said, "the less people will rely upon what 
is written." 
</P>
<P>
 Masson, 53, who lives in Half Moon Bay and writes books for a living, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Yorker issued a statement in response to the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted by the jury's verdict with respect to Janet Malcolm," it 
said. "She is one of the best writers working today and we're extremely happy 
with the result."

10,000 STUDENTS PROTEST PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: WALKOUTS AROUND LOS ANGELES ARE 
LARGEST YET SHOWING CAMPUS OPPOSITION TO INITIATIVE. THE TEEN-AGERS ARE MOSTLY 
PEACEFUL, WITH ONLY 12 ARRESTS REPORTED.

 Defying calls from campaign leaders and principals to stay in school and 
ignoring the unwelcoming weather, more than 10,000 young people walked off 
campuses around Los Angeles Wednesday in the largest showing yet of student 
opposition to Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 From the lawn at the Federal Building in Westwood to a side street in 
South-Central and the steps of City Hall, the teen-agers were mostly peaceful 
as they marched in rivers of plaid, T-shirts and jeans under the watchful eyes 
of Los Angeles police, who called a citywide tactical alert. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one report of significant unruliness -- in Compton, where 12 
arrests were made -- and in many cases police asked school officials to furnish 
buses and successfully persuaded weary students to return to their campuses, 
often miles away. But sometimes the officers underestimated adolescent stamina 
and found themselves tracking roving bands of students through neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was fine until they . . . got unruly and started running in front 
of cars," Officer Matthew Klein said as he held curious neighbors back from a 
corralled group of middle-school students on East 48th Street in South-Central 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchers from more than 30 Los Angeles Unified schools participated. Most left 
campus before noon and many were back at school, or at home, before the 
dismissal bell. Most of the demonstrators were Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not fair to take education away from the kids," said Henry Romero, a 
10th-grade Belmont High student, in remarks to the City Council. He was invited 
to speak after Belmont students walked more than a mile to City Hall. "We could 
be the future leaders. We could be the ones sitting right where you are 
someday. You've got to give everyone a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 As with previous student protests, there was no indication that the widespread 
walkouts had been organized by the formal anti-187 campaigns. Most of the 
official groups had joined teachers and parents in urging students to stay in 
school and stage sit-ins or political forums. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Wednesday's walkout appeared to be the result of a variety of efforts 
to coordinate the sporadic school protests that have flared up in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 On radio talk shows, activists with the One Stop Immigration and Educational 
Center, who organized a major Downtown march last month, had called for a 
countywide walkout on Nov. 2. At the behest of worried parents the center 
rescinded its call. 
</P>
<P>
 But, fueled by media reports and continued support for walkouts by a new 
statewide anti-187 student coalition, individual campus leaders pushed forward 
with their preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that nobody else should speak for the students and tell us not to do 
it," said Angel Cervantes, organizer of the statewide student group and a 
Claremont Graduate School student. 
</P>
<P>
 Student organizers at San Pedro High School said Wednesday they lured 150 
classmates out of school by passing out flyers earlier this week. They and 
other student leaders said they will ask fellow students to walk out again 
before Election Day on Tuesday in a bid to defeat Proposition 187, which would 
bar illegal immigrants from schools and other public services. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's protests it became clear that some officials and more 
established groups have jumped on the student-enthusiasm bandwagon: 
</P>
<P>
 * At Los Angeles City Hall, council members Richard Alarcon and Jackie 
Goldberg left a meeting to address the students milling outside. At a protest 
rally in Long Beach, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti compared Proposition 187 to the 
internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 * When an estimated 700 University High School students reached the Federal 
Building around 10 a.m., the Peace and Freedom party candidate for governor, 
Gloria La Riva, greeted them with sound equipment and a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 * Literature passed out at City Hall, where about 1,000 teen-agers from nearby 
Belmont High and the Downtown Business High School joined forces, included 
flyers from organized labor and from the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade 
encouraging walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the Van Nuys Civic Center, where about 500 students from Birmingham, 
Grant and Van Nuys high schools and Sepulveda Middle School converged, students 
were given anti-187 signs produced by Californians United Against Prop. 187, 
and listing a 900 number for more information at a cost of $5 a call. Grant 
student Felix Jimenez, 19, said he photocopied the signs on his own and handed 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Accompanying 200 Jordan High School students on their trek through Southeast 
Los Angeles were five members of the Latin American Truckers Assn., who passed 
out flyers demanding the right of the United Transport Workers Union of America 
to organize and bargain with the Santa Fe Railway Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The rowdiest and longest demonstration took place in Compton, where at least 
three groups from several schools -- each containing 300 to 400 students and 
others -- marched through the city beginning at 8 a.m., some of them throwing 
rocks, eggs and bottles at police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the six-hour march, the groups converged in the parking lot of a Vons 
supermarket and launched a sit-down demonstration that blocked store and 
parking lot entrances, according to Compton police Capt. Steven Roller. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators broke store windows, frightened store employees, threw trash and 
vandalized police cars before 80 Compton officers, assisted by 50 sheriff's 
deputies, dispersed the crowd, Roller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve people -- all but one of them juveniles -- were arrested and there was 
an unconfirmed report of one injury. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the widespread student walkouts, the LAPD went on a tactical 
alert at 11 a.m. Wednesday, allowing commanders greater flexibility in keeping 
officers on duty beyond their shifts and redeploying police to areas where 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you have large groups of people out -- I don't care whether it's a 
protest like this or some kind of celebration on the beach -- experience tells 
us the potential for some kind of a disturbance is always there, and we should 
be prepared for it," said Lt. John Dunkin, an LAPD spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina plans to go on Spanish-language 
television today to urge students to remain calm, an aide said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whichever way the vote on 187 goes, we want people to put their energies into 
more constructive types of things," said Robert Alaniz, spokesman for Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests drew onlookers out to their porch stoops and office foyers and 
reactions were varied, as the opinion polls showing great disagreement among 
voters would predict. 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central Los Angeles, several hundred youngsters from Carver Middle 
School walked out in mid-morning and refused to board buses provided by school 
officials to return to campus. Police followed as the students broke into 
smaller groups and ran down side streets. Most were fenced in near East 48th 
Street and Avalon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what the suburban people who support this proposition don't 
understand, that this is what's going to happen if it passes," said Alfred 
Rowe, heading home after watching the students finally leave on buses. "We 
already had one riot down here. We don't need another," 
</P>
<P>
 In suburban Santa Clarita, a late-morning march by about 200 William S. Hart 
High School students drew scorn from some residents who watched the mostly 
Latino group chant Spanish slogans and carry Mexican flags. Many of the 
onlookers said they had planned to vote for Proposition 187 anyway, but the 
demonstration strengthened their resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is ridiculous to let a Mexican flag go down (the street)," said Marylee 
Silvius, 67. "It just makes me angry. I don't like protesters in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita protesters did influence at least one person toward their 
way of thinking. Stacy Hobbs, 19, a community college student, said she had 
favored the proposition, but seeing the demonstration "makes me more 
sympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 Protests also were reported Wednesday in Orange County, where more than 1,000 
students from several schools peacefully demonstrated. There were no arrests. 
The largest and most organized protest took place at Fullerton College, where 
more than 500 students from at least nine high schools listened to speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, both sides of the Proposition 187 campaign began throwing their 
limited financial resources into advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers Against 187, a coalition of statewide organizations opposed to the 
measure, hit the airwaves in Los Angeles on Wednesday with its first TV ad. The 
30-second spot is running on seven TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the pro-187 side, two radio ad campaigns have started to supplement Gov. 
Pete Wilson's TV ads that urge a "yes" vote. Also, the Federation for American 
Immigration Reform, a Washington, D.C., lobbying group, has begun running radio 
spots statewide charging that special interest groups are seeking to defeat the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich attacked the measure 
as "the wrong remedy." He said illegal immigration could be halted more 
effectively by going after employers who hire undocumented workers.

SIMPSON PANEL GETS BOTH SIDES' VIEWS ON TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In comments that could preview opening statements in the O.J. Simpson murder 
trial, prosecutors and defense lawyers urged prospective jurors Wednesday to 
set aside issues such as race and celebrity in weighing the evidence against 
the football Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
 Each side was given 75 minutes to address 41 people who have undergone weeks 
of questioning about their suitability to serve on the jury, and the lawyers 
made the most of it, mixing philosophical lectures with more pointed remarks 
addressed to specific panelists. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers took the opportunity to again raise the theory that more 
than one killer committed the June 12 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and 
Ronald Lyle Goldman -- and that Simpson has been tragically and falsely accused 
of those crimes. Prosecutors, meanwhile, called on jurors to trust their common 
sense and not be misled by conspiracy theories or wild speculation about how 
the killings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will not be a sign outside the jury room that says: 'Check your common 
sense at the door,' " said Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman, one of the lead 
prosecutors in the case. Hodgman repeatedly emphasized that jurors should rely 
on their common sense, advice that several pledged to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments from the lawyers came as both sides prepared to begin exercising 
peremptory challenges, those used to excuse jurors without having to state a 
reason. Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito and the lawyers had hoped to embark 
on that phase Wednesday, but delays forced them to wait a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they are scheduled to begin this morning, resuming a jury selection 
process that has bogged down repeatedly as the two sides have winnowed out jury 
candidates with biases or other obstacles to their service. On Wednesday, Ito 
said it is likely that some of the estimated 200 prospective jurors who are on 
call for possible service in the case will be brought in and questioned as 
well. That could take almost a month, and may force opening statements to be 
postponed until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Before starting to exercise their peremptory challenges, the lawyers were 
given the opportunity to question the panelists one more time and to address 
all 41 at once -- one prospective juror called in sick, leaving the group short 
of its full complement of 42. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a rare chance to address the people who may decide the case, and the 
lawyers took full advantage. Attorneys on both sides approached the prospective 
jurors graciously, effusively thanking them for their efforts so far and gently 
pitching the defense and prosecution versions of the murder case under the 
guise of questioning panelists about their preconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 First up was Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of Simpson's lead attorneys and one 
of Los Angeles' most experienced trial lawyers. Cochran reminded prospective 
jurors that the Los Angeles County district attorney's office has lost a number 
of high-profile cases in recent years and that law enforcement officials, like 
other people, sometimes lie under oath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here is an adult," Cochran said. "Everybody here lives in the real 
world. . . . We know that people will sometimes swear to tell the truth and 
then absolutely lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran's gentle lecture, in which he suggested that several people may have 
been responsible for the June 12 murders but that Simpson was not one of them, 
was in contrast to the more pointed questions of his colleague, Robert L. 
Shapiro. Shapiro questioned jurors one at a time, challenging two who seemed to 
indicate that they would hold Simpson responsible for establishing his own 
innocence, rather than forcing prosecutors to prove his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what keeps me up at night," Shapiro told the panelists. "It's (the 
prosecution's) burden. It never switches." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers and prosecutors met later with Ito outside the presence of 
the jury panel. The two prospective jurors who expressed confusion about 
whether it was Simpson's responsibility to prove his innocence were excused by 
Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I would be an excellent juror," said Abe Englander, a 77-year-old 
World War II veteran who had lobbied hard for a spot on the jury. "It was 
something of a letdown." 
</P>
<P>
 In his questioning, Shapiro also touched on a key strategic decision that 
awaits Simpson's attorneys by asking prospective jurors whether they would hold 
it against Simpson if he chose not to testify. That decision, Shapiro said, 
would be made by Simpson and his lawyers -- and was one that jurors were not to 
second-guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Shapiro and Cochran used their time to insist that jurors see Simpson as 
a human being, not merely as someone charged with a horrible crime. Pointing to 
Simpson, Cochran reminded prospective jurors that he is not just a "defendant," 
as prosecutors typically refer to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Mr. O.J. Simpson over there," Cochran said. "This is about human 
beings." 
</P>
<P>
 During the questioning, Simpson looked as though he were a working member of 
the defense team, studying the list of jury prospects, talking with his jury 
consultant, establishing eye contact with the panelists. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came her turn to address the panel, Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark 
said there was nothing wrong with calling Simpson the defendant and added that 
she has never sought to dehumanize him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the defendant, right?" she said, speaking softly but occasionally 
jabbing the lectern for emphasis. "He is Mr. Simpson, and he is the defendant." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Clark said, when she looked at Simpson she could not help but think 
of "the man I saw in 'Naked Gun' and made me laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such a famous guy," Clark said. "He's such a popular guy that there's 
going to be a real pull to do something different from what the law requires." 
</P>
<P>
 But she reminded members of the jury panel that Nicole Simpson and Goldman 
were human beings, too, and that while O.J. Simpson is in the courtroom to 
defend himself, they are not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nicole and Ron will be referred to as victims," Clark said. "They lived and 
they breathed and they walked and they were human and they had a right to live. 
They were people, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a number of issues that loom in the background of the case -- such 
volatile topics as interracial marriage, spousal abuse and fame -- Clark asked: 
"Does everyone agree that this is not the time to even the score on any of 
those issues?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some jurors nodded. None disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides broached the issue of race in the case directly, with Cochran 
saying the defense did not want to make an issue of Simpson's race but adding 
that "if you live in America, you would be foolhardy to say that race does not 
play a role" in the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant's race will not count for him or against him -- can I have your 
assurance of that?" Cochran asked the prospective jurors. They mumbled 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark echoed that theme in her remarks. "Race is not a reason to acquit," she 
said. "Race is not a reason to convict." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor peppered her comments about race with observations about the 
trouble it can cause when the issue surfaces in trials, citing the trial in 
Simi Valley of four Los Angeles police officers charged with beating Rodney G. 
King. That case, she said, "looked like a slam-dunker for guilt" until it was 
sent to a predominantly white community where it was heard by a jury that 
included no blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 She condemned those verdicts, prompting defense attorneys to object later, out 
of the earshot of potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you think these jurors will think?" Cochran told reporters, 
explaining the defense objection. "They will think they'll be attacked." 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Ito joined in criticizing Clark's remarks about the Simi Valley 
case, and when prospective jurors reassembled in the afternoon, she apologized 
to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I didn't offend you by my comments," she said. Several of the 
potential jurors shook their heads, signifying that they had not been bothered 
by the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking jurors for the case has been laborious, and Ito predicted that the 
current group of panelists, which stands at 40 after the dismissal of two 
prospective jurors Wednesday, will not be large enough to yield a jury of 12 
along with 15 alternates -- an expanded group that lawyers said is intended to 
ensure that even if some become exposed to publicity in the coming weeks, 
enough will remain to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling in more prospective jurors will prolong the process, however, and Ito 
said Wednesday that he no longer expects to begin a DNA hearing in 
mid-November, as scheduled. Instead, he is hoping to begin that hearing by Dec. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 Because that hearing is expected to last three to five weeks -- and because 
Ito intends to recess the trial around Christmas -- it appears increasingly 
unlikely that opening statements in the trial will begin before January. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Ito had said he wanted to select 12 jurors and eight alternates, 
but he expanded the number of alternates to deal with any possible attrition 
during the time that the lawyers are arguing over the admissibility of DNA 
evidence and other pretrial questions. Although jurors will certainly be asked 
to avoid any coverage of those hearings, a number of panelists have reported 
difficulties in steering clear of the media, and the extra alternates may help 
prevent the need to start the process over again if too many are disqualified 
in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased number of jury alternates made it highly unlikely that a full 
panel can be chosen from the 40 people who remain eligible for service after 
undergoing several weeks of sometimes-grueling questioning. Each side is 
allowed to exercise 20 peremptory challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial undercurrents of the case have persuaded some legal experts that 
Simpson's attorneys may seek to have as many blacks as possible on the jury. At 
the same time, experts say that allegations of spousal battery against Simpson 
may make prosecutors inclined to seek as many women as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 As they exercise their challenges, however, both sides must be mindful of 
Supreme Court rulings that prohibit them from intentionally seeking to keep out 
jurors because of their race or sex.

DISNEY HALL WORK HALTED, STUDY TO CUT COSTS STARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON and DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a $50-million funding shortage, officials said Wednesday that they 
have halted all construction-related work on the proposed Walt Disney Concert 
Hall and launched a study to cut costs of the Downtown project that is to be 
the new home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 All aspects of the building, including its avant-garde design by architect 
Frank O. Gehry, are to be reviewed over the next three months by Hines 
Interests, a nationally respected builder and construction management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The study and implementation of its suggestions could delay construction of 
the hall, which was scheduled to start next month, by a year or so, according 
to Frederick M. Nicholas, volunteer chairman of the Walt Disney Hall Committee. 
County-financed construction of the nearly completed underground garage will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated price tag of the 2,380-seat concert hall escalated by last 
summer to $260 million, which was $50 million more than planned. That increase 
was partly because of a procedural gamble known as fast-tracking -- starting 
construction of the garage before detailed drawings and contracts for the hall 
were finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hines review is intended to provide donors with a firm cost estimate and 
to assure them that the hall can be built at or below $260 million, Nicholas 
and others explained. According to a county mandate, work cannot proceed until 
funds are pledged for 95% of the hall's costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that this is an important step that we've taken, because we want 
to ensure that this project is not going to proceed out of control," Nicholas 
said during an interview at his Beverly Hills office Wednesday. "That is 
crucial particularly in light of the fact that we have to raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to end up with a package that we could sell to the public as well 
as to our supporters," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 All engineering work and material bidding for the concert hall will cease for 
several months, officials said. During that period, the Hines firm will review 
such matters as Gehry's design, the detailed architectural drawings done by 
Dworsky Associates, construction materials, mechanical systems, contract 
bidding procedures and what those involved concede is the awkward management 
structure of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they do not expect major changes in the building's exterior 
shape, which has been compared to a sailing ship or a many-petaled flower. The 
top priority, they stressed, is to preserve the fine acoustical conditions and 
warm, wood-lined environment planned for the interior. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the consultants will consider replacing the Italian limestone 
exterior with plaster, eliminating some skylights and changing lobbies and 
reception areas. "Things that are in there to add comfort and value to the 
design but might not be necessary," Nicholas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney Hall committee said it has stopped the practice of fast-tracking. 
The Hines firm recently has warned that to proceed without completed drawings 
and guaranteed contracts has "the risk of encountering significant cost 
increases." 
</P>
<P>
 James Glymph, Gehry's partner who is managing the concert hall project for the 
Santa Monica-based firm, said he and Gehry welcomed the Hines review, which is 
to cost up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very, very happy to see Hines brought to the job because it represents 
a continued commitment to make this thing work," Glymph said. "Hundreds of 
decisions have been made over the course of many years and a fresh look may 
yield new ideas of saving money." 
</P>
<P>
 Glymph said Gehry is flexible about possible design changes, but does not 
expect any radical reworkings. "We are willing to stay with anything that 
rationally accomplishes the mission to get a quality concert hall built," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lillian B. Disney, Walt Disney's widow, who gave the founding $50 million to 
the project, agrees with the decision to conduct a review, her representative 
said. Through accrued interest and additional gifts, the Disney family's total 
contributions have grown to $93 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney family attorney Ron Gother said the family will consider all 
cost-cutting suggestions, but wants the hall's interior to be built as planned. 
"It's been tested, it's expected to be a superior-sounding hall, it looks 
great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gother said it is premature to talk about the family possibly boosting its 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas said he had a number of other major private donors in mind who might 
help make up the $50-million gap, but he declined to identify them and stressed 
that the Hines study must come before more fund raising. Nicholas also said he 
has been talking to city, county, state and federal government entities for 
financial support, possibly in the form of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have full confidence in the numbers to be able to fund-raise," 
said Shelton g. Stanfill, president of the Music Center, a fund-raising arm of 
the Bunker Hill performing arts complex that the concert hall would join. "The 
idea was to have greater confidence in the numbers and greater confidence in 
the completion of the hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Another source, who asked not to be identified, said the Hines review is aimed 
at calming public fears that the project might be abandoned. "If the perception 
out there is that this is an increasing crisis, then fund raising is impossible 
and the project dies," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colin Shepherd, a Los Angeles-based senior vice president of Hines Interests, 
said he is optimistic that his firm's review will help get construction work 
back on track. "I personally think this is a landmark design that will be an 
incredible benefit to the citizens of Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the overall project's $260-million estimate includes $110 million in 
county bonds for the garage, the projected $50-million overruns were in the 
hall. Richard Volpert, the attorney who has been representing the county in 
concert hall negotiations, said the Hines study was very much needed. The 
county has donated the land for the project.

226 KILLED AS FLOODS, FIRE RAVAGE EGYPTIAN TOWNS; DISASTER: STORM WATERS 
COLLAPSE BRIDGE ONTO FUEL TANKS; CONTENTS ARE SET ABLAZE. DEATH TOLL IS 
EXPECTED TO CLIMB. 
</P>

<P>
 A hellish flood of burning fuel and storm waters swept through a small town in 
southern Egypt on Wednesday, engulfing houses in a watery inferno that with 
other flash flooding left at least 226 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and rescue officials worked late into the night picking bodies from 
flood-washed streets and burned-out houses after two fuel storage tanks in the 
southern village of Durunka were crushed by a collapsing bridge and set ablaze, 
sending a fiery flood sweeping through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 An entire village near the southern city of Asyut, not far from Durunka, was 
destroyed and six others badly damaged as the heaviest rains in half a century 
pounded the Egyptian desert and the Nile Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the capital, motorists were stranded on flood-swollen streets and spent 
hours trying to negotiate their way across the teeming city, many abandoning 
their cars and coming to blows with other drivers in the paralyzed 
intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, the situation is very bad," said Col. Ahmed Kamel, a spokesman at 
security headquarters in Asyut, about 200 miles south of Cairo, which was 
overseeing the oil fire disaster in Durunka. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamel, speaking by telephone, said the official death toll from the fire and 
flooding in surrounding villages had reached 226 people shortly before 
midnight, with at least 27 others injured. A total of 407 houses in seven 
southern Egyptian villages were destroyed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals reported hundreds of corpses and indicated that the death toll could 
go much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian meteorologists reported that an inch of rain fell on Cairo during a 
two-hour period Wednesday morning in the worst rainstorm since November, 1957, 
when three-quarters of an inch fell during a 24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy rainstorms are rare in most of Egypt, which draws its water from the 
Nile River that threads through a vast desert. Storm drains are virtually 
nonexistent in the capital and other large cities, and streets quickly became 
torrents of mud and rushing water up to 1 1/2 feet deep in places. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest hit were the crowded alleyways of old Cairo, where at least nine 
houses collapsed in the district of Gamaliya, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearby marketplace of Muski in central Cairo, packed with stalls of 
cheap goods, an electrical short circuit sparked by the rain touched off a fire 
that destroyed 230 stalls, causing damage estimated at nearly $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Egyptian Development Authority and the Ministry of International 
Cooperation were both inundated, and most schools, universities and other 
government offices were closed when students and employees found it impossible 
to traverse the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Asyut Gov. Samih Saeed declared a state of emergency; the governorate of Asyut 
is one of Egypt's most sensitive areas because it is the stronghold of Islamic 
fundamentalist militants who have been seeking to bring down the government of 
President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of residents displaced from their homes surrounded the governorate 
headquarters Wednesday, demanding lodging and assistance, according to news 
reports from southern Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 Saeed said he had ordered immediate cash assistance for the affected villages, 
as well as the distribution of tents and blankets. He added that the government 
had called in all available security forces and physicians to help in the 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports on Egyptian television and in the semiofficial daily newspaper, 
Al Ahram, said the Durunka fire was touched off when floodwaters built up 
against the ridge of mountains on the west side of the Nile Valley at Durunka 
and swept into a bridge, causing the bridge to collapse onto two fuel storage 
tanks at the Public Fuel Cooperative in Durunka. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huge amounts of water that were collected on the western mountain went down 
in terrible force toward the storage tanks, causing an electrical short that 
also caused a huge explosion in one of the tanks at 5:55 a.m.," Al Ahram 
reported in its early edition today. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting fires apparently ignited fuel in a nearby pipeline, and 
floodwaters swept the burning fuel down into the village, igniting hundreds of 
homes along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they awoke to the sound of a large explosion and waves of smoke 
that began to descend on the town of about 22,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Raging floodwaters dragged bodies in their path, dumping some of them into a 
nearby irrigation canal and leaving others trapped in the smoking wreckage of 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The thousands of people fleeing their homes blocked the entry of emergency 
vehicles into the disaster scene, preventing an early assault against the fire, 
which eventually burned for more than 12 hours, according to Egyptian news 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, firefighters turned off the fuel taps, but not before much of the 
village was in ruins. Authorities said the Salam Food Factory burned to the 
ground, with damages estimated at $23.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, flooding in the village of Menshaat el Arab destroyed every house in 
the village, along with the primary school and the village mosque. Five bodies 
were found in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 As statements of sympathy poured in to Mubarak from Arab leaders, there were 
already recriminations about the oil fire disaster, with at least one member of 
the president's ruling National Democratic Party criticizing the government for 
building the oil storage facility so close to a populated area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government failed us when it put up this depot close to where people 
live," Mohammed Abdel Mohsen Saleh, a Durunka resident and NDP member, told 
reporters on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine oil tanks in Durunka held about 15,000 tons of petroleum as strategic 
reserves for the army.

COLUMN ONE; THE PIRATES OF THE INTERNET; AS THE GLOBAL COMPUTER NETWORK GROWS 
SO DO THE RINGS OF THIEVES WHO USE IT TO STEAL SOFTWARE. FRUSTRATED SECURITY 
EXPERTS SAY THEY MAY HAVE TO RESORT TO BOUNTY HUNTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 In the early hours of July 6, Jenny, head of a software piracy ring based in 
the Pacific Northwest, paced impatiently in front of a rack of high-speed 
personal computers, waiting for the phone call that would make her a superstar 
in the pirate underground. 
</P>
<P>
 It would come from an employee of LucasArts Entertainment Co. in San Rafael, 
who for $300 would supply Jenny's pirate group with one of the most anticipated 
games of summer: "TIE Fighter," based on the "Star Wars" movie trilogy and 
priced at about $60 per copy. 
</P>
<P>
 At LucasArts, the employee attached a small cellular modem to the back of his 
PC -- a technique that would keep any record of the call off the company 
telephone bill -- and dialed. Within a few minutes, the program had arrived in 
Jenny's computer, lacking only the code keys that would make it possible to 
play the game without an owner's manual. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny then dialed into the Internet, the global computer network, and after 
taking several deliberate electronic detours she connected with a small 
computer in Moscow. There, a programming whiz who goes by the name "Skipjack" 
quickly cracked the codes and sent the program back across the Internet to 
"Waves of Warez," a Seattle bulletin board popular with software pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 24 hours, "TIE Fighter" would be available to thousands of software 
pirates in major cities around the world -- days before its official release 
date of July 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the underside of the Internet, where stealing software has become 
highly sophisticated and hotly competitive -- pursued more for thrills than for 
money. It's a world where pirate groups build alliances, undertake mergers and 
sometimes launch all-out battles against rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 And, contrary to common stereotypes, it is populated not only by nerdy 
teen-age misfits, but by a curious cross-section of computer enthusiasts 
looking for some dangerous fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny, for example, is a woman whose hobbies include motorcycles and 
collecting rare birds. The head of a big East Coast-based ring is a commercial 
airline pilot. Another group leader is a junior studying chemical engineering 
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa. Yet another is a grandmother, 
leader of an elite group called Nokturnal Trading Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Their activities are, of course, illegal, potential felonies in many cases. 
And to most denizens of cyberspace, who use the Internet for scientific 
research, legitimate commerce and legal forms of entertainment, the pirates are 
common vandals at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a number of pirates agreed to allow a reporter to observe their 
operations -- both in person and via computer techniques that make it possible 
to monitor computer activities remotely -- on the condition that their real 
names not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic impact of the pirates' activities is difficult to measure. 
Electronic software theft via the Internet and other on-line services accounts 
for about one-third of the $2.2 billion lost in the United States last year as 
a result of piracy, according to the Business Software Alliance, a trade group. 
Pirates who mass-produce CD-ROM and floppy disks with stolen software pose a 
much bigger problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But Internet software theft is growing rapidly, along with the global network 
itself. Even major, mainstream software programs -- like the new version of 
IBM's OS/2 operating system -- are now routinely obtainable for free on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 And the pirates' activities have other consequences as well. They sometimes 
invade and effectively disable computers being used for scientific research, 
for example. And many in the information technology industries fear that 
software theft and other illegal activities are giving the Internet a bad name 
just when it is gaining unprecedented popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet stopping the pirates turns out to be a very difficult task. Law 
enforcement agencies, software companies and even indignant individuals are 
stepping up efforts to hunt down electronic lawbreakers, but new methods of 
stealing and distributing stolen software are developed every day. 
</P>
<P>
 By design, the Internet lacks any central administrative authority, and 
security procedures aimed at thwarting pirates could interfere with the 
philosophy of free and open communications that is integral to the network. 
Some suggest the thievery won't be stopped until "bounty hunters" are recruited 
from the pirates' ranks and paid to hunt their former cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be small comfort to the victims, but most of the pirates interviewed 
for this story insisted they were not in it for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just for the thrill of getting free software or logging onto pirate 
bulletin boards that normal people don't know about," said Mike from Seattle, 
who says he has never earned a dime in his role as a "courier" for a pirate 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interview, conducted in a tidy suburban home that he shares with 
friends, Mike uploaded a new program -- "Lode Runner for Windows" by Sierra 
Games -- to the Internet from his custom-built computer. He then typed e-mail 
messages to other couriers notifying them of the new game and instructing them 
to copy it to various pirate sites around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 There appear to be about 20 major groups dedicated to software piracy, a 
lengthy Times investigation has found, with names such as Razor 1911, Tristar 
Red Sector Inc. (TRSi), Pirates With Attitude (PWA), Revolutionizing 
International Piracy (RIP), Legend, Malice and Anti Lamers Foundation (ALF). 
The groups vary in size from 20 to 100 members, and most have a similar 
hierarchy: group leaders, senior staff, regional coordinators, couriers and 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups divide into two broad types: releasing groups, which arrange for 
software to be supplied and transferred to local computer bulletin board 
systems, and courier groups, which have a worldwide network of members who 
quickly transfer software from local bulletin boards to the Internet for 
instantaneous worldwide distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators generally pay a pirate group a "donation" of $50 to $200 per month 
to carry that group's software on their bulletin boards. The more successful 
groups boast as many as several dozen affiliated bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The logistics of coordinating these far-flung networks are daunting, but the 
pirates are resourceful. One crucial communications method is the Internet 
Relay Chat (IRC) system, a kind of citizens' band of cyberspace that connects 
thousands of computer users in 21 countries. A particular series of channels, 
known as "warez" channels, are used both for conversation between software 
pirates and the on-line trading of freshly stolen software. 
</P>
<P>
 But the IRC has its limits, and even computer hackers sometimes need to talk 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 One method they have developed involves a "beige box," or custom-built 
telephone. The pirate travels a distance from his or her home and taps into the 
exterior wiring of an apartment building or house to arrange a conference call, 
possibly involving 20 people or more in several countries, via an AT&T Alliance 
Teleconference operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The pirate controls the conference call from a pay phone. But at the end of 
the month, the person whose line was tapped receives the bill -- which can run 
well into five figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Several leaders of software pirating groups also described a method to avoid 
charges that involves a special computer program, a pay phone and a recordable 
Hallmark greeting card that contains a small computer memory. The electronic 
sounds a quarter makes when dropped in a pay phone are recorded on the memory 
chip, then are played back into the phone in lieu of depositing money. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the seeming ease with which many pirates stay one step ahead of law 
enforcement, there are plenty of risks -- especially for those who work in the 
computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 3, Cupertino-based Symantec Corp., best known for its line of Norton 
Utility software backup and security products, discovered an employee in its 
Baton Rouge, La., facility running a pirate site on a company computer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Symantec source says the company took the unusual step of packing the 
offending computer inside a chilled and shielded container and flying it to 
corporate headquarters in Cupertino for laboratory analysis. The employee -- 
who the source said was motivated by "the thrill of being a part of the pirate 
scene" -- was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Dr. William L. Sebok, an astronomer at the University of Maryland, 
announced he had shut down a large pirate site that contained more than 500 
megabytes of stolen software -- enough to fill half a dozen personal computer 
hard disks. The site had been running on a laboratory computer used for 
processing images from the recent collision of Jupiter and the Shoemaker-Levy 
comet. The illegal use was detected three weeks ago when processing on the 
computer inexplicably slowed to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland officials tried to trace the thieves back through the Internet, but 
met with little success: Many of the pirates were found to have used computer 
accounts belonging to university students in Switzerland, Spain and Slovenia 
who were unaware their accounts were being used for illicit purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sebok says the time he spent tracking the pirates was well justified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured by shutting their site down, I would create a stir for (the 
pirates) that would be worth it for me. I didn't want to see the cockroaches 
tunneling through our computer system any more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials have grown more vigilant about computer crime of all 
types. A group of special FBI agents now cruises the Internet, and many local 
and state law enforcement agencies have been training investigators to root out 
computer crime. But software piracy -- especially involving games -- takes a 
back seat to credit card theft and other more destructive crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gene Spafford, an associate professor at Purdue University and a computer 
security expert, says software manufacturers and trade groups like the Software 
Publishers Assn. may have to resort to frontier justice to stem the tide of 
illicit software being transferred over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these same guys who are out pirating right now could very easily turn 
in the rival groups for a buck or more, and they'll be very willing to do so," 
Spafford said. He expects to see bounty hunters who get paid based on damages 
recovered or convictions of software pirating groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are already seeing private detective agencies investigating computer 
break-ins, because the local law enforcement agencies aren't equipped," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Roden, general counsel at LucasArts, said the growth of the Internet 
has made it much easier for people to steal and distribute games around the 
world. Usually a company sends out cease and desist letters to pirates if it 
can find them, but that has become harder, Roden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're stealing 'TIE Fighter' because they love the game, the irony in 
all of it is that they're harming the thing they love," Roden added. "They're 
making it more difficult for software companies to make these products and 
survive in the market." 
</P>
<P>
 But the pirates aren't much impressed with that argument. On July 14, a 
20-year-old pirate nicknamed Drizzit took a morning drive from his home in the 
San Fernando Valley to the Babbage's computer retail store at the Glendale 
Galleria. He wanted to check if Lucas-Arts' "TIE Fighter" game had come in yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Glancing inside, Drizzit could see the game had not arrived. On a shelf near 
the front of the store stood empty "TIE Fighter" boxes, gaily decorated with 
ribbons that said "coming soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Drizzit recalls laughing at the sight of those empty boxes. "The funny thing 
was," he later told a reporter, "I'd been playing that game for the last seven 
days. I'd downloaded it off the Internet, I didn't have to pay for it, I was up 
to the sixth mission and it worked great." Internet Guide

TALE OF DEADLY IRANIAN NETWORK WOVEN IN PARIS; TERRORISM: AN ASSASSINATION 
TRIAL'S THREADS LEAD AS FAR AS CALIFORNIA, UNCOVERING A WEALTH OF SPY DATA 
ALONG THE WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was almost a perfect crime. Three well-dressed men walked into the suburban 
compound of Iranian exile Shahpour Bakhtiar in broad daylight, passed through 
X-rays and metal detectors manned by 24-hour police guards, slit his throat and 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it appeared to be a brilliantly plotted conspiracy, aided by luck. 
Then came the mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, three years later, those mistakes have not only led to the capture of key 
suspects in the case but have produced a windfall of Iranian spy data for 
Western intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a trial that opened here Wednesday under massive security, three suspects 
share the defense dock with the shadow of the state of Iran -- all accused by 
French investigators of playing a direct role in planning and carrying out the 
political assassination of Bakhtiar, a former Iranian prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 What began as a murder case has unveiled the shape of what investigators 
regard as a surprisingly sophisticated Iranian intelligence and terrorism 
network that stretches from Europe to California. French authorities report: 
</P>
<P>
 * That Southern California, a region with an Iranian community of more than 
500,000 people by several estimates, "is an operational base" of VEVAK, the 
state intelligence and security agency of Iran that monitors opponents of the 
regime worldwide. The California community is dominated by Iranians who fled 
the Islamic revolution and includes many leading critics of the regime. 
Consequently, says one of Europe's leading anti-terrorism authorities, "the 
most important base of Iran's secret service is in California;" 
</P>
<P>
 * That Iran's young, KGB-model spy network is now able to carry out its own 
assassination missions, rather than farming out such assignments to less 
disciplined terrorist groups; 
</P>
<P>
 * That secret agents of the Iran government have infiltrated opposition and 
exile groups in Europe, the Middle East and California, often targeting their 
leaders for assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Iran seems to regard political assassination as its national right, even on 
foreign soil. Any country that enforces its laws against murder is seen 
interfering in the sovereign affairs of Iran," said one high-ranking French 
justice official. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran strongly denies the allegations. In an interview, Iranian ambassador to 
France Hamid Reza Asefi said that Bakhtiar posed no threat to the security of 
Iran and that Iran had no role in his death. "Moreover, we deplore any such act 
of violence against any resistance group," Asefi added. 
</P>
<P>
 In unraveling the mystery of who killed Bakhtiar and pursuing the primary 
suspects in a network of perhaps 100 major and minor accomplices, French 
investigators were led on detective hunts to Switzerland, Turkey, Britain and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of that search are contained in a 185-page report obtained by The 
Times. It lays out a case that French journalists call "an autopsy of Iran's 
terror network." That network, French investigators say, includes operatives in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I fear Washington is not sufficiently concerned," said one French 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 In January of 1993, a team of French police investigators followed their trail 
of conspiracy leads to Los Angeles as they looked for possible suspects in the 
logistic support of the killers. They took testimony from one Iranian exile who 
denied any involvement but said he had been solicited to kill Bakhtiar by Iran 
intelligence agents two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the French team was frustrated in part because the U.S. attorney's 
office in Los Angeles, citing inadequate probable cause, refused to issue an 
arrest warrant requested by the investigators and turned down another request 
for a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Justice Department spokesman would not comment on the case except to 
say: "We cooperate and assist foreign law enforcement investigations in the 
United States aggressively and to the fullest extent permitted by our laws and 
procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 But one French investigator said: "We told them (U.S. officials) there is a 
network of terrorists operating in your country. The Americans seemed to resent 
being told." Ironically, a month later terrorists attacked the World Trade 
Center in New York. The French had no advance knowledge of that plot. "But we 
delivered the earlier wake-up call," the French investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegations of official Iranian involvement with terrorists are not new to the 
United States. Last year Iran was linked indirectly to the World Trade Center 
bombers when it was claimed that Tehran provided financial assistance to 
related radical groups in Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. State Department, in its most recent report on global terrorism, 
implicated Iran in a series of murders in Italy, Pakistan and Turkey that were 
"carried out by professional assassins" who eluded arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The same State Department report claims that "acts of terrorism are approved 
at the highest levels of the Iranian government" and that Iranian intelligence 
agents "stalk members of the Iranian opposition in the United States" and 
throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris over the past 10 years alone, six Iranians have been killed in 
attacks attributed to their political activities. FBI officials say that more 
than five years ago an Iranian dissident was killed in California in a murder 
that remains unsolved. And Iranian opposition leaders in Europe say 50 have 
been murdered worldwide since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason all these assassinations have continued is because the Iran 
government has had to pay no price," said Shaul Bakhash, a historian and 
Iranian expert at George Mason University. "That is one reason the French case 
is so important." 
</P>
<P>
 On trial this week are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ali Vakili Rad, 35, suspected of being one of the killers and a VEVAK secret 
agent; 
</P>
<P>
 * Massoud Hendi, 47, a grandnephew of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and 
former Paris correspondent for Iran's government-run radio and television 
service, who is accused of helping the killers obtain false documents to enter 
France; 
</P>
<P>
 * Zeyal (Zia) Sarhadi, 28, a nephew of President Hashemi Rafsanjani and a 
member of the Iranian foreign service attached to Tehran's embassy in 
Switzerland. He is accused of aiding the killers' escape through Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 All three deny involvement in the alleged conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 France will try six others in absentia. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mohammad Azadi, 34, believed to be an agent of Iran's intelligence service, 
and Farydoun Boyerahmadi, 41. Both are accused with Vakili Rad of killing 
Bakhtiar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hossein Sheikhattar, 44, a top adviser to Iran's minister of 
telecommunications; Mesut Edipsoy, 34, an Iranian-born Turkish citizen; Gholam 
Shoorideh, 34, an Iranian businessman with interests in Southern California and 
Chicago; and Nasser Ghasmi, 44, also an Iranian businessman. All four are 
accused of conspiring to aid the assassins. Prelude to Murder 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews and access to French investigative files, this is the 
prosecutors' account of the Bakhtiar assassination and what its investigation 
reveals about Iranian intelligence operations around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Shahpour Bakhtiar, 76, lived in comfortable surroundings on the River Seine in 
the west Paris suburb of Suresnes. But he could never be completely 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 A detachment of French state police occupied posts at his front door, in his 
back yard and in the ground floor entry to his trilevel home -- a constant 
reminder of his jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a longtime champion of a democratic Iran, he had been imprisoned by Shah 
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. When the shah saw his rule slipping, he named Bakhtiar 
as prime minister. Bakhtiar's tenure lasted barely a month before the Islamic 
revolution of 1979 swept him away. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakhtiar fled to Paris, where he issued tapes and tracts seeking to moderate 
and unite some of the more extreme opposition factions. He was declared a 
target of Islamic punishment by Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhali for "making a 
campaign against Imam Khomeini." 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1980, he escaped a botched assassination attempt that left a 
policeman and a neighbor dead. A second policeman was crippled by a gunshot 
wound. Investigators said the would-be assassins were hired guns. A Palestinian 
was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tehran has improved its quality control since those days," said a French 
official familiar with the latest Bakhtiar case. 
</P>
<P>
 Police beefed up their protection, but anti-Bakhtiar plots continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Fariborz Karimi, an Iranian exile living in Southern California, told French 
investigators that in 1989, while on a trip to Frankfurt, he had been asked by 
an Iranian secret service agent to "execute Shahpour Bakhtiar." 
</P>
<P>
 According to his account, which is included in the French investigative 
report, he was later contacted by Ali Falahian -- then assistant to the chief 
of VEVAK (today he heads the intelligence agency) -- demanding to know why 
Karimi had not already assassinated Bakhtiar when he was a guest in the former 
prime minister's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Another assassination occurred in April, 1991. Bakhtiar's chief assistant in 
the National Movement of the Iranian Resistance was stabbed to death in Paris 
by assailants who escaped undetected. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakhtiar called a meeting in July to select a successor. A member of the 
resistance movement attending that meeting was Farydoun Boyerahmadi. He placed 
flowers on an empty chair reserved for their lost colleague. After the meeting 
he placed a call to Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, Iranian secret agents had set up a clandestine dispatch center 
in two Istanbul apartments. French authorities now believe that Boyerahmadi was 
checking in with the agents there, who were the operations managers of the 
assassination plot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Istanbul dispatch center was provided by Mesut Edipsoy, an Iranian-Turk 
who allegedly had ties to the Turkish underworld. He owned or rented the two 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Edipsoy, also known as Edybnia in the United States, traveled frequently to 
Orange County and Los Angeles, investigators said. The nature of his business 
dealings was not clear, but French officials believe he was in regular contact 
with VEVAK agents. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, French authorities suspect that Edipsoy may have acted as a courier 
serving Iran's spy network in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the assassination plot from its inception were two Iranian secret 
agents -- subsequently identified by the French as Vakili Rad and Azadi -- who 
would be sent to France to rendezvous with Boyerahmadi. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the killers into France, investigators contend, officials of various 
government ministries in Tehran conspired to help the assassination team obtain 
false travel documents. It was a pattern of conduct, they allege, that Iran 
uses around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Ministry of Telecommunications and the Islamic Republic of Iran 
Broadcasting offices, for example, French visas were sought falsely claiming 
that the two Iranian secret agents were actually businessmen on an electronics 
shopping trip. 
</P>
<P>
 While the phony visas were being sought, the Iran Foreign Affairs Ministry 
separately issued false Iranian passports to the secret agents and later 
dispatched one of its own employees to Geneva to help bring the agents home, 
French investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Istanbul other final arrangements were being made. A master 
forger was employed to create counterfeit Turkish passports and additional 
phony Swiss visas. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Paris, Boyerahmadi secretly notified the Iranian agents that the 
housekeeper and gardener of his friend Bakhtiar were leaving on extended 
vacations, French officials say. The Last Visitors 
</P>
<P>
 Through the month of August, apart from a private secretary and all the police 
guards surrounding his house, Bakhtiar would be alone. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 6, 1991, Boyerahmadi drove his red, older-model BMW 
to the Bakhtiar home, where he often did odd jobs, escorting Vakili Rad and 
Azadi. The men wore suits. Boyerahmadi had both men change into black ties, a 
gesture of respect for Bakhtiar, who was still in mourning over the death of 
his close friend and executive assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakhtiar was expecting them and they had no trouble with the guards or metal 
detectors. They were unarmed. Based on autopsies and other forensic evidence, 
police investigators believe this is what happened next: 
</P>
<P>
 The younger men joined Bakhtiar in his living room, presenting him with a 
painting, a gift. Bakhtiar's private secretary served tea, then retired to the 
terrace off the kitchen. Police guards noticed Boyerahmadi sitting with the 
assistant shortly after 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 That left Vakili Rad and Azadi, a large and powerfully built man, alone with 
Bakhtiar. Police say one of the two men struck Bakhtiar with a paralyzing blow 
to the throat, possibly with a forearm chop, crushing the older man's larynx. 
He could neither cry for help nor breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with a butcher knife and bread knife retrieved from Bakhtiar's kitchen, 
they stabbed him 13 times in the neck and shoulders -- then cut his throat. 
They also cut his wrists and removed Bakhtiar's Rolex watch as "a trophy," 
police said, to prove they had accomplished their mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakhtiar was dead when his secretary returned from the terrace and was 
similarly slain. Calmly and efficiently, exhibiting uncommon discipline and 
professional skill, the assailants cleaned up the most visible signs of blood 
on their clothing. The knives were returned to the sink. The phone was taken 
off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 A wastebasket was placed between a window and the fallen body of the secretary 
as camouflage. Bakhtiar's body was left on the sofa where he had been slain, a 
tablecloth draped over him like a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 p.m., as scheduled, the three visitors left the house. Police noticed 
nothing unusual. They drove away in the BMW, passing through the Bois de 
Boulogne, a large wooded park in western Paris. The two secret agents changed 
into fresh clothes and dumped their bloody suits and shirts in a curbside trash 
bin at the edge of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Discarded as well were their shredded Iranian passports. They had now assumed 
the identities of Turkish citizens named Musa Kocer and Ali Haydar Kaya. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyerahmadi dropped Vakili Rad and Azadi at a subway station then abandoned 
his car with its bloodstained upholstery in a predominantly Iranian 
neighborhood, known locally as Tehran on the Seine. It would not be noticed for 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, everything had gone according to the carefully laid plans that French 
investigators say were devised in the offices of Tehran government ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the Bakhtiar house all was quiet. Police guards making their 
regular rounds of the compound grounds every 15 minutes dutifully entered in 
their logs the initials: "RAS" for rien a signaler , meaning "nothing to 
report." Errors of a Mission 
</P>
<P>
 The Istanbul dispatch center was set up to handle emergencies. But in the 
aftermath of a perfectly executed assassination, the phones were silent until 
almost midnight. That's when the secret agents made their first mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Vakili Rad nor Azadi spoke French. Traveling without Boyerahmadi for 
the first time since arriving in France, they were bound for the small 
Savoy-region resort town of Annecy, near the Swiss border. It required a train 
change in Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lyon has two train stations -- and they got off at the wrong one. They 
missed their connection to Annecy and called Istanbul for help. Days later a 
taxi driver would recall for police investigators that "the big one," Azadi, 
had used the pay phone outside the rail station. 
</P>
<P>
 The Istanbul center was compromised and, with it, all the contacts made by its 
agents believing they were beyond surveillance in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at Bakhtiar's home no one noticed that the private secretary failed 
to make his regular morning visit to deliver the day's agenda. Sacks of 
groceries, dropped off at the door as usual, were not retrieved all that day. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone was constantly busy, not unusual given Bakhtiar's heavy phone use. 
Police failure to discover the crime was giving the fleeing killers a 
considerable head start. But such unexpected good fortune was making other 
Iranian agents anxious. There were no press bulletins to confirm the 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Istanbul agents made a costly blunder the next morning. Even though Vakili Rad 
and Azadi had already checked in, they phoned an Iranian woman in Paris whose 
role as an undercover intelligence agent for Tehran had been unknown to French 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any news of Bakhtiar?" the Istanbul caller asked. No, but she agreed to 
inquire. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, armed with phone records, French police would raid the woman's home and 
discover encoding devices, a pen with disappearing ink and other evidence 
identifying the woman as "an Iranian mole." She would not be the only covert 
agent compromised by the phone links. 
</P>
<P>
 Another was an Iran Air official at Orly Airport who was believed to be 
involved in counterfeiting runway access badges based on evidence found in his 
office safe. He also was holding the long-lost wallet and passport of a French 
businessman, raising suspicion that they might be used to create fake 
identities for Iranian agents. 
</P>
<P>
 In England, an Iranian interior decorator near Birmingham was linked to the 
Istanbul operation. French officials believed he was a "dormant mole" for Iran 
intelligence. British officials arrested him for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Southern California, French investigators believed they had found more 
Iranian moles but were unable to persuade U.S. authorities to detain them, as 
was possible under French and British laws. One French official complained that 
it prevented exposure of more Iranian agents operating in California and 
elsewhere in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dave Tubbs, chief of the FBI's counterterrorism section in Washington, 
said: "We cooperated within the bounds of the U.S. Constitution and laws. . . . 
Nothing was held back." 
</P>
<P>
 Tubbs acknowledged that Iranian intelligence is active in the United States, 
keeping track of dissidents and keeping its thumb on students. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Southern California figures to be a hotbed of such activity since the 
size of its Iranian community is the largest anywhere in the world outside of 
Iran. California also has a high concentration of the wealthiest Iranian 
exiles, according to experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen hours after the assassination, Vakili Rad and Azadi arrived at the 
Swiss border. But they had made another mistake -- they stuck their phony Swiss 
visa stamps into their phony Turkish passports so late that the visa stamp was 
still moist, arousing the suspicion of a Swiss officer. On closer examination 
the guard determined that the visas, supposedly issued in Tehran, bore serial 
numbers of Swiss consulates in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss entry was promptly denied and the Iranians were turned over to French 
border guards -- who just as promptly released them. The men were not yet 
wanted by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Their difficulties getting out of France, which would continue for several 
more days, forced the Istanbul dispatch center to send out repeated calls to 
Iran to Paris to London to Los Angeles and to other cities, each call 
compromising another intelligence asset and revealing more of the VEVAK 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 What the agents had failed to count on was the relative technological ease 
with which investigators could reconstruct records of their telephone traffic 
-- this, despite the fact that the fleeing assassins had used only pay phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinpointing which pay phone records to analyze was made somewhat easier by 
another error of the fleeing secret agents. One left his wallet behind in an 
Annecy phone booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the silence at Bakhtiar's home raised suspicions. About noon on 
Thursday, Aug. 8 -- nearly 42 hours after the killings, long enough for mold to 
form on the unfinished cups of tea -- police found the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Too late, pictures of the last three visitors would be distributed to news 
outlets throughout Europe. Azadi and Vakili Rad finally made it across the 
border to Geneva. But that is where their last round of costly mistakes 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Splitting up to make it appear each man was traveling alone, the secret agents 
checked into separate Geneva Hotels. They were to meet their contacts outside 
the Iran Air offices. Azadi made his appointments. Vakili Rad got lost and 
arrived 10 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
 Azadi was apparently whisked off to Iran. Vakili Rad was left wandering the 
banks of Lake Geneva, trying to avoid Swiss police and waiting to be rescued. 
Clues and Accomplices 
</P>
<P>
 French law enforcement had suffered a string of embarrassments. It had failed 
in the first instance to protect Bakhtiar, then failed to discover the murder 
in a timely fashion -- providing protection, as it turned out, for two corpses 
for nearly two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Its border police had two of the suspected killers in custody for a time and 
released them without so much as a routine investigation of their phony 
passports. In fact, it was Swiss border police who first alerted anti-terrorism 
investigators that the Iranian agents had tried to enter Switzerland a day 
after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The French began to make up for lost time. Investigators found cabdrivers and 
hotel clerks who reported seeing the men, and Investigating Magistrate 
Jean-Louis Bruguiere could narrow his survey of public phone records. With 
that, the case against Iran began to form, and the dimensions of Iran's 
worldwide network of operatives would start to take shape. 
</P>
<P>
 A call from a Bois de Boulogne prostitute proved especially fortuitous. She 
had found the bloody clothes left behind in the Paris park. Although she had 
cleaned them to present to a boyfriend, investigators said lab tests were still 
able to link the clothes to the suspects and to the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 The first big break in the case came before dawn on Aug. 21. Vakili Rad was 
arrested on the lake shore by Swiss police and promptly extradited to France. 
Bruguiere finally had a murder suspect, a man he also believed to be an Iranian 
secret agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, with Vakili Rad captured, the clandestine dispatch center shut 
down in Istanbul. The last agent monitoring the phones left for Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the lingering mysteries is what happened to Boyerahmadi, accused of 
complicity in the murder by vouching for the suspected killers. He made a 
separate exit from France at least 10 days after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 French investigators say he has relatives near Washington, D.C., and in 
Germany. While hiding in Paris he told one witness that he was awaiting 
documents for a trip to the United States. Investigators speculate that he may 
have changed identity to enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 As the trial gets under way, French investigators are confident their case 
will show that four Iranian government ministries -- Foreign Affairs, 
Intelligence, Telecommunications and Interior -- played key roles in ordering 
and carrying out a Bakhtiar conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruguiere, who directed the investigation, calls the legal fight against 
terrorism vital for the defense of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrorism is trying to destroy our society. It's like a war, " he said in an 
interview. "Organized crime has an understandable goal, to make profits for its 
members. But terrorism seeks to destroy our values, our democratic systems. We 
must fight it with the arm of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the country braces for possible terrorist attacks similar to what 
accompanied the trial of the Palestinian gunman accused of trying to kill 
Bakhtiar back in 1980. Police have bolstered security around train stations and 
major department stores. Sharpshooters man the rooftop of the Palais de 
Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to defuse prospects of terrorist actions and help minimize the tensions 
between Iran and France, one French Justice Ministry spokesman insisted: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a murder trial, not a trial of Khomeini or Rafsanjani. The issue will 
be simply this: Who is the murderer and who is the accomplice?" 
</P>
<P>
 For the remnants of the Bakhtiar resistance group, the trial has much broader 
implications. Ali Chakeri, 57, who replaced the fallen president, accuses Iran 
of mounting an international campaign to exterminate dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't care so much if the accused suspects are convicted," Chakeri said in 
a discreetly arranged interview. "What is most important to us, the victims of 
this violence, is that Iran is convicted."

ARE MOSTLY PEACEFUL, WITH 12 ARRESTS REPORTED.

 Defying calls from campaign leaders and principals to stay in school and 
ignoring the unwelcoming weather, more than 10,000 teen-agers walked off middle 
and high school campuses around Los Angeles on Wednesday in the largest showing 
yet of student opposition to Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 From the lawn at the Federal Building in Westwood to a side street in 
South-Central, from the Van Nuys Civic Center to the steps of City Hall, the 
teen-agers were mostly peaceful as they marched in rivers of plaid, T-shirts 
and jeans under the watchful eyes of Los Angeles police, who called a citywide 
tactical alert. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest of a series of such demonstrations that have been growing for 
two weeks, there was only one report of significant trouble -- in Compton, 
where 12 arrests were made after reports of rock-throwing, window-breaking and 
vandalism on police cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was fine until they . . . got unruly and started running in front 
of cars," LAPD Traffic Officer Matthew Klein said as he held curious neighbors 
back from a corralled group of middle-school students on East 48th Street in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Most marchers, who came from more than 30 Los Angeles Unified School District 
campuses, left their school grounds before noon and many were back at school, 
or at home, before the dismissal bell. Most of the demonstrators appeared to be 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, more than 2,000 students from 14 schools took to 
the streets, scaling fences to escape from closed campuses and join marchers 
from other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the students might not have been organized, almost everyone else was. 
Los Angeles police were deployed throughout the Valley and escorted the 
marchers -- some drenched from the morning rain -- through busy intersections. 
School district administrators used cellular phones to dispatch school buses to 
pick up students after the demonstrations, and some administrators cut short 
break periods so that students would spend more time inside classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to tell people to vote against 187," said Felix Jimenez, a Grant 
High student who organized a Van Nuys protest and urged his classmates to be 
peaceful. "Grant High School students, remember, we made a promise that we were 
going to behave. Let's show everyone that we are proud of who we are." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Van Nuys Civic Center, where about 500 students from Birmingham, Grant 
and Van Nuys high schools and Sepulveda Middle School converged, students were 
given anti-187 signs produced by Californians United Against Prop. 187, and 
listing a 900 number for information that costs $5 a call. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez, 19, said he photocopied the signs on his own and handed them out. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 students from Taft High in Woodland Hills walked off campus after a 
mid-morning break -- the first protest by Taft students -- and marched for 
several miles before ending up back in class by mid-afternoon. Police and 
school administrators, escorting the students back to school, said they did not 
want a repeat of last week when thousands of youths marched through Van Nuys 
streets, leading to scattered fighting and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators from San Fernando to Van Nuys tried to keep students on 
campus by locking gates, but many students scaled fences or cut holes in 
chain-link fences. Other administrators were unable to block the large number 
of students leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went one way, they went another," said Wayne Tyra, principal at Fulton 
Middle School in Van Nuys, where about 30 students left campus. "They jumped 
over a fence and disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 At Sun Valley Middle School, about 1,700 students gathered on the playing 
field to form a pattern that read "No on 187," much like a marching band in 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Taft teachers said they were proud of the students for caring about 
the issue and making a public statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "One student . . . someone who never talks in class, came to me after the 
walkout and said: "Mr. Jacobs, did you come to the rally? I was a speaker!" 
said Errol Jacobs, a Taft English teacher. "I was amazed. I told him I was very 
proud of him and I was." 
</P>
<P>
 As with previous student protests, there was no indication that the widespread 
walkouts had been organized by the formal anti-187 campaigns. Most of the 
official groups had joined teachers and parents in urging students to stay in 
school and stage sit-ins or political forums. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's walkouts appeared to be the result of a variety of efforts to 
coordinate the sporadic school protests that have flared up in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 On radio talk shows, activists with the One Stop Immigration and Educational 
Center, who organized a major Downtown march last month, had called for a 
countywide school walkout Wednesday. At the behest of worried parents, the 
center rescinded its call. 
</P>
<P>
 But, fueled by media reports and continued support for walkouts by a new 
statewide anti-187 student coalition, individual campus leaders pushed forward 
with their preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's protests, it became clear that some officials and more 
established groups have jumped on the student-enthusiasm bandwagon: 
</P>
<P>
 * At Los Angeles City Hall, council members Richard Alarcon and Jackie 
Goldberg left a meeting to address the students milling outside. At a protest 
rally in Long Beach, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti compared Proposition 187 to the 
internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 * When an estimated 700 University High School students reached the Federal 
Building around 10 a.m., the Peace and Freedom Party candidate for governor, 
Gloria La Riva, greeted them with sound equipment and a ready speech. 
</P>
<P>
 * Literature passed out at City Hall, where about 1,000 teen-agers from nearby 
Belmont High and the Downtown Business High School joined forces, included 
flyers from organized labor and the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade 
encouraging walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 * And, accompanying 200 Jordan High School students on their trek through 
Southeast Los Angeles were five members of the Latin American Truckers Assn., 
who passed out flyers demanding the right of the United Transport Workers Union 
of America to organize and bargain with the Santa Fe Railway Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The rowdiest and longest demonstration took place in Compton, where at least 
three groups from several schools -- each containing 300 to 400 students and 
others -- marched through the city beginning at 8 a.m., some of them throwing 
rocks, eggs and bottles at police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators broke store windows, frightened store employees, threw trash and 
vandalized police cars before 80 Compton officers, assisted by 50 sheriff's 
deputies, dispersed the crowd, Compton Police Capt. Steven Roller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve people -- all but one of them juveniles -- were arrested, and there was 
an unconfirmed report of one injury. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the widespread student walkouts, the LAPD went on a tactical 
alert at 11 a.m. Wednesday, allowing commanders greater flexibility in keeping 
officers on duty beyond their shifts and redeploying police to areas where 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Clarita, a march by more than 200 William S. Hart High and Placerita 
Junior High students was met with scorn by some residents as they watched the 
mostly Latino group chant Spanish slogans and carry Mexican flags. Many of the 
onlookers said they had planned to vote for Proposition 187 anyway, but the 
demonstration only strengthened their resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is ridiculous to let a Mexican flag go down (the street)," Marylee 
Silvius, 67, said as she watched the students shouting as they passed a grocery 
store. "It just makes me angry. I don't like protesters in the first place. I 
can feel for them, but illegal is illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want our support, they should be waving an American flag," said 
another shopper, who refused to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita protesters did influence at least one person toward their 
way of thinking. Stacy Hobbs, 19, a community college student, said she had 
favored the proposition, but seeing the demonstration "makes me more 
sympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 "It really does, because they're humans," Hobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central Los Angeles, several hundred youngsters from Carver Middle 
School walked out in mid-morning and refused to board buses provided by school 
officials to return to campus. Police followed as the students broke into 
smaller groups and ran down side streets, finally fencing in most of the 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what the suburban people who support this proposition don't 
understand, that this is what's going to happen if it passes," said Alfred 
Rowe, heading home after watching the students finally leave on buses. "We 
already had one riot down here. We don't need another." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, both sides of the Prop osition 187 campaign began throwing their 
limited financial resources into advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers Against 187, a coalition of statewide organizations opposed to the 
measure, hit the airwaves in Los Angeles on Wednesday with its first TV ad. The 
30-second spot is running on seven TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the pro-187 side, two radio ad campaigns have started to supplement Gov. 
Pete Wilson's TV ads that urge a "yes" vote. Also, the Federation for American 
Immigration Reform, a Washington lobbying group, has begun running radio spots 
statewide charging that special interest groups are seeking to defeat the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, U. S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich attacked the 
measure as "the wrong remedy." He said illegal immigration could be halted more 
effectively by going after employers who hire undocumented workers.

 Defying calls from campaign leaders and principals to stay in school and 
ignoring the unwelcoming weather, more than 10,000 young people walked off 
campuses around Los Angeles and Orange counties Wednesday in the largest 
showing yet of student opposition to Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 From the quad of Fullerton College to a side street in South-Central Los 
Angeles, the teen-agers were mostly peaceful as they marched in rivers of 
plaid, T-shirts and jeans under the watchful eyes of law enforcement officials 
in both counties. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one report of significant unruliness -- in Compton, where 12 
arrests were made -- and in many cases police asked school officials to furnish 
buses and successfully persuaded weary students to return to their campuses, 
often miles away. But sometimes the officers underestimated adolescent stamina 
and found themselves tracking roving bands of students through neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, students marched off campuses or demonstrated in Fullerton, 
San Juan Capistrano, Santa Ana, Anaheim, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the largest demonstration in the county took place at Fullerton 
College, where more than 500 students from at least nine high schools gathered 
for more than four hours to march and hear speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Under police escort, the group marched from the college campus down Harbor 
Boulevard into neighboring Anaheim chanting "No on 187!" and "La Raza Unida! 
Jamas Sera Vencida!" which means, "Latinos United! Will never be defeated!" 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a worthy cause," said 15-year-old Pablo Salcedo, a sophomore from 
Loara High School in Anaheim. "Prop. 187 is like a death penalty; may as well 
just have a big war and throw the bomb on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Added 15-year-old J.J. Zazueta from Brea-Olinda High: "It's not the kids' 
fault the parents brought them here. Why should they be kicked into the 
streets?" 
</P>
<P>
 As with previous student protests, there was no indication that the widespread 
walkouts had been organized by the formal anti-187 campaigns. Most of the 
official groups had joined teachers and parents in urging students to stay in 
school and stage sit-ins or political forums. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Wednesday's walkout appeared to be the result of a variety of efforts 
to coordinate the sporadic school protests that have flared up in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 On radio talk shows, activists with the One Stop Immigration and Educational 
Center, who organized a major march in Downtown Los Angeles last month, had 
called for a widespread walkout on Nov. 2. At the behest of worried parents the 
center rescinded its call. 
</P>
<P>
 But, fueled by media reports and continued support for walkouts by a new 
statewide anti-187 student coalition, individual campus leaders pushed forward 
with their preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that nobody else should speak for the students and tell us not to do 
it," said Angel Cervantes, organizer of the statewide student group and a 
Claremont Graduate School student. 
</P>
<P>
 Student organizers at San Pedro High School said Wednesday they lured 150 
classmates out of school by passing out flyers earlier this week. They and 
other student leaders said they will ask fellow students to walk out again 
before Election Day on Tuesday in a bid to defeat Proposition 187, which would 
bar illegal immigrants from schools and other public services. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Juan Capistrano, about 200 students from South County campuses rallied 
Wednesday outside school district headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 As a handful of sheriff's deputies watched, the students cheered and chanted 
for about 15 minutes. Some held signs, while a few waved Mexican flags. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentin Mendoza, a 19-year-old Saddleback College student, said the protest 
was supported by some parents. Students had skipped classes at Dana Hills High 
School, Capistrano Valley High School and Marco F. Forster Middle School, he 
said, some of them with parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, about 150 students marched the four miles between Ocean 
View and Huntington Beach high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Anaheim, about 200 seventh- and eighth-graders from South Junior High 
walked out of class, "wandered around a little, got tired and went home," said 
Anaheim Sgt. Richard Zschoche. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana school officials, moving to prevent rumored walkouts at their four 
high schools, organized on-campus discussions at lunchtime Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a hot political issue, but we didn't want them to break the rules," 
said geography teacher George Aguirre, who organized a forum at Century High 
School. "It's encouraging that they are politically involved with the 
democratic process, but we don't want them out there ditching class and sending 
the wrong message." 
</P>
<P>
 The discussions were attended by about 500 students at Santa Ana High and 350 
at Century High, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these efforts, more than 200 students from Century and Saddleback high 
schools decided to risk suspension by walking out. The students converged at 
Main Street and Edinger Avenue about 11:30 a.m., said Police Lt. Dave Petko. 
</P>
<P>
 "They walked out of class and walked around a bit," Petko said. "It was more 
like an organized ditch day." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 students at Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach were allowed 
to demonstrate in front of the school during their lunch break. The boisterous 
group held up signs asking passing motorists to honk if they were opposed to 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal Lee Gaeta, who monitored the demonstration, said, "These 
are great kids. They are just expressing their opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's protests it became clear that some officials and more 
established groups have jumped on the student-enthusiasm bandwagon: 
</P>
<P>
 * At Los Angeles City Hall, council members Richard Alarcon and Jackie 
Goldberg left a meeting to address the students milling outside. At a protest 
rally in Long Beach, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti compared Proposition 187 to the 
internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 * When an estimated 700 University High School students reached the Federal 
Building around 10 a.m., the Peace and Freedom party candidate for governor, 
Gloria La Riva, greeted them with sound equipment and a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 * Literature passed out at City Hall, where about 1,000 teen-agers from nearby 
Belmont High and the Downtown Business High School joined forces, included 
flyers from organized labor and from the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade 
encouraging walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the Van Nuys Civic Center, where about 600 students from Birmingham, 
Grant and Van Nuys high schools and Sepulveda Middle School converged, students 
were given anti-187 signs produced by Californians United Against Prop. 187, 
and listing a 900 number for more information at a cost of $5 a call. Grant 
student Felix Jimenez, 19, said he photocopied the signs on his own and handed 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Accompanying 200 Jordan High School students on their trek through Southeast 
Los Angeles were five members of the Latin American Truckers Assn., who passed 
out flyers demanding the right of the United Transport Workers Union of America 
to organize and bargain with the Santa Fe Railway Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The rowdiest and longest demonstration took place in Compton, where at least 
three groups from several schools -- each containing 300 to 400 students and 
others -- marched through the city beginning at 8 a.m., some of them throwing 
rocks, eggs and bottles at police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the six-hour march, the groups converged in the parking lot of a Vons 
supermarket and launched a sit-down demonstration that blocked store and 
parking lot entrances, according to Compton police Capt. Steven Roller. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators broke store windows, frightened store employees, threw trash and 
vandalized police cars before 80 Compton officers, assisted by 50 sheriff's 
deputies, dispersed the crowd, Roller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve people -- all but one of them juveniles -- were arrested and there was 
an unconfirmed report of one injury. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the widespread student walkouts, the LAPD went on a tactical 
alert at 11 a.m. Wednesday, allowing commanders greater flexibility in keeping 
officers on duty beyond their shifts and redeploying police to areas where 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you have large groups of people out -- I don't care whether it's a 
protest like this or some kind of celebration on the beach -- experience tells 
us the potential for some kind of a disturbance is always there, and we should 
be prepared for it," said Lt. John Dunkin, an LAPD spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina plans to go on Spanish-language 
television today to urge students to remain calm, an aide said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whichever way the vote on 187 goes, we want people to put their energies into 
more constructive types of things," said Robert Alaniz, spokesman for Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests drew onlookers out to their porch stoops and office foyers and 
reactions were varied, as the opinion polls showing great disagreement among 
voters would predict. 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central Los Angeles, several hundred youngsters from Carver Middle 
School walked out in mid-morning and refused to board buses provided by school 
officials to return to campus. Police followed as the students broke into 
smaller groups and ran down side streets. Most were fenced in near East 48th 
Street and Avalon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what the suburban people who support this proposition don't 
understand, that this is what's going to happen if it passes," said Alfred 
Rowe, heading home after watching the students finally leave on buses. "We 
already had one riot down here. We don't need another," 
</P>

 In a county where Election Day poll guards in Latino voting precincts six 
years ago still haunt the memories of political activists and election 
officials, a member of the Proposition 187 campaign committee has touched a 
nerve with plans to post "Only citizens can vote" flyers outside polling places 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although campaign instructions call for the flyers to be posted 100 feet from 
where voting is being conducted -- in accordance with state electioneering laws 
-- Orange County Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney said he is not sure the 
signs will pass legal muster. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of the flyers is fueling anxiety over possible Election Day 
tactics, as various political factions on both sides of the volatile 
Proposition 187 debate set up their own monitoring systems in Orange County to 
ensure that no dirty tricks are played Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 And election officials are taking their own precautions, instructing precinct 
workers on the finer points of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 During his training classes for precinct workers, Tanney warned that it is 
illegal for anyone other than an election official to ask a voter for proof of 
citizenship. The law is strict in this regard, Tanney said. An election 
official can only challenge a voter if documentation is produced casting doubt 
on a voter's eligibility, such as paperwork showing that the voter is on parole 
for a felony conviction, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 If political activists are going to approach voters, "we are going to have 
1988 all over again," Tanney said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County's 69th Assembly District -- ground zero for the 1988 poll 
guard incident -- the campaign consultant for Republican Assembly nominee Jim 
Morrissey has contacted the Save Our State campaign committee, backers of 
Proposition 187, to make sure that the "Only citizens can vote" flyers do not 
appear in the district Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Proposition 187 leaders say the flyers are not part of their official 
Election Day strategy, although they are being distributed by a member of the 
campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before the anti-illegal immigration measure captured the political 
spotlight this election season, Orange County Republicans, led by Assemblyman 
Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), were vowing to monitor possible voter fraud in the 
69th District, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by 22 points -- 56% to 
34%. Democrats complained that such moves would result in voter intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanney has urged political activists that poll watching be done within the 
parameters of state law, which was tightened up after the 1988 poll guard 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, Republicans posted uniformed guards at 20 polling places in 
predominantly Latino areas of Santa Ana, and the guards carried signs in 
English and Spanish warning that non-citizens could not vote. the Republican 
candidate, Curt Pringle, narrowly defeated Democrat Christian (Rick) Thierbach 
to win the Assembly seat. The Republican Party later paid $400,000 to settle a 
lawsuit brought by Democrats over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's campaign to post flyers is sponsored by Barbara A. Coe, a member 
of the pro-187 campaign committee and head of the California Coalition for 
Immigration Reform. The flyers were handed out last week during a meeting of 
her group in Garden Grove. Save Our State campaign co-chairman Ronald S. Prince 
attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers read: "Only citizens can vote! Violators will be prosecuted!" In an 
accompanying newsletter, Coe instructed volunteers to post the flyers 100 feet 
from the entrance of the polling place, as well as "on as many telephone poles 
as you can surrounding the voting place." 
</P>
<P>
 The newsletter also stated, "Since there are no safeguards (to) insure 
citizenship (of voters), this is our greatest fear -- that illegal aliens will 
'stuff' the ballot boxes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Another widely circulated newsletter from Coe's group stated: "In conjunction 
with the SOS campaign, CCIR will engage in an intensive effort to require proof 
of citizenship prior to voting in any election! We will not stand idly by" and 
let illegal immigrants "take over" cities "as was the case in Bell Gardens," 
where the Latino population exceeds 80% and where four white members of the 
City Council were ousted from office in a 1991 special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince and Coe were unavailable for comment, and it is unknown how widely Coe 
has distributed the flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, pro-187 campaign manager Robert R. Kiley credited Coe's 
effective information network but said she was mistaken in her description of 
the volunteer effort planned for Election Day. "It's not a poll-watching 
event," Kiley said, adding that volunteers would focus on getting out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pro-187 campaign co-chairman, Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy 
(R-Arcadia), said Coe "probably" took it upon herself to distribute the flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not part of any campaign that I know of," Mountjoy said. "It's probably 
just something (Coe) is doing. Otherwise they would have discussed it at some 
meeting that I was at." 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that the flyers might trip up GOP efforts to take the 69th Assembly 
District seat away from the Democrats, the campaign for Morrissey, the 
Republican nominee, said he called Prince to make sure the flyers do not show 
up in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to be in my district," Morrissey campaign consultant Mark 
Q. Thompson said. "It's nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanney said he has reviewed the materials distributed by Coe. He said that 
while she "might be trying to get a very technical defense" by suggesting that 
the flyers be posted beyond 100 feet from the polling place, it is possible 
that someone will complain that the signs intimidate voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something like this gets done in certain precincts in these high Hispanic 
or Vietnamese communities, my suspicion is it's going to be sensitive to some 
people even if it's done 100 feet, 2 inches," Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see a scenario where there is going to be some potential plaintiff out 
there who says, 'I don't care. It may have been 200 feet, but I was intimidated 
when you handed me that thing.' I can imagine that having gone through the 
whole court case six years ago," Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the flyers do show up Tuesday in minority voting precincts, the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund will probably challenge them, said 
John Palacio, the group's local director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any attempt to put those notices out like that would be no different than 
what happened in 1988 because they intend to intimidate voters," Palacio said. 
</P>
<P>
 With no decision yet on whether the U.S. Justice Department will send federal 
monitors to Southern California, Latino activists and Democrats in Orange 
County are planning to fan out Tuesday across central Orange County -- in the 
largely-ethnic area of the county -- with "quick response" teams to report any 
problems, should they occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Assemblyman Conroy, who initially led other Republicans on a 
campaign to stop what they described as possible voter fraud by Democrats, will 
have volunteers "with a heightened sensitivity" monitoring for anyone who tries 
to vote twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's aide, Jim Bieber, said there will be no attempt to intimidate voters. 
"Nobody will be challenged or confronted, but there will be investigative work 
done later on," after the election, Bieber said. 
</P>

 Times staff writer Patrick McDonnell contributed to this report. Voters' 
Rights 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of Election Day tactics by various political groups who plan 
to monitor polling places, election officials are reminding voters of their 
rights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Voters may refuse any flyers being distributed outside a polling place. 
(Electioneering is not allowed within 100 feet of a polling place.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Voters need not provide proof of citizenship to anyone outside the polling 
place. Only a member of the precinct board can challenge the eligibility of a 
voter after he or she has signed the roster, but before the ballot is issued. 
The election officer must have "sufficient probable cause" based on factual 
knowledge that the voter may be ineligible to vote before a challenge can be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 * No one may interfere with a voter's right to cast a secret ballot.

DOOMED PLANE ROLLED BEFORE INDIANA CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A commuter plane rolled rapidly to the right, corrected momentarily and then 
rolled over on its back before plunging 9,000 feet to the ground, killing all 
68 people on board, federal investigators said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall said Monday's 
disastrous plunge was preceded by some unusual -- and thus far unexplained -- 
maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new developments intensified concerns that the plane involved in the 
crash, a European-built ATR72, is especially susceptible to icing and that ice 
building up on the wings may have crippled flight control surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall told a news conference that American Eagle Flight 4184 from Indianapolis 
was holding at 10,000 feet and a speed of approximately 201 m.p.h. over 
Roselawn because of stormy weather at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport 
when air traffic controllers asked the plane's crew to descend to 8,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said voice and flight-data recordings recovered from the wreckage showed 
that as the airliner descended, its speed increased to approximately 213 m.p.h. 
and an alarm went off in the cockpit, warning that damage to the plane's flaps 
could occur at that speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The recordings showed that the flaps -- flat metal slabs that can be extended 
back from the wings to increase their lift -- were deployed at a 15-degree 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Such deployments usually are made only at low speed, when the plane is taking 
off or landing, and veteran pilots said deployment at such a high speed is 
uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said that as the flaps began to retract, either automatically or through 
controls moved by the pilot, "the onset of an abnormal descent occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 The ATR72 prop-jet rolled to the right, recovered briefly, then rolled right 
again, over onto its back, "and a recovery was not accomplished," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Feith, the investigator in charge, said both rolls resulted from movement 
of the plane's ailerons -- hinged plates beside the flaps that move up and down 
to make a plane bank and turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the pilot used the control wheels to move the ailerons deliberately, 
or whether they moved on their own through some control malfunction is not yet 
clear, Feith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know exactly what this (cockpit) crew was doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another ATR72 encountered similar control problems in December, 1988, over 
central Wisconsin. The officials said that plane's ailerons malfunctioned when 
ice built up on the wing, but the pilot recovered and the plane did not crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said the pilot of still another ATR72 approaching Chicago on Monday 
reported that his plane picked up 1/8 of an inch of ice while holding near 
Flight 4184. 
</P>
<P>
 That plane suffered an engine flameout, but the engine was restarted and the 
plane landed without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional information shed new light on the mystery of what caused 
Monday's crash. Until Wednesday, most of the attention focused on the 
possibility that icing overburdened the airliner and that the plane may have 
broken up in the air before slamming nose down into a soybean field. 
</P>
<P>
 But evidence was still fragmentary, and the NTSB said it probably will be 
months before the cause of the crash is determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The airliner -- a state-of-the-art aircraft fabricated largely of modern 
composite materials -- shattered like glass on impact, scattering fragments of 
debris over a square mile of muddy farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 Each fragment is part of the puzzle that the NTSB must reassemble before its 
investigators can say definitively why Flight 4184 plunged to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 investigators and support personnel fanned out across the field 
Wednesday morning, marking the crash site into carefully measured grids. 
</P>
<P>
 Their survey work completed, they began retrieving body parts. The human 
remains were placed in plastic body bags and transported to a local armory, 
which is serving as a temporary morgue. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said some of the remains are so fragmented that positive 
identification may never be possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight 4184 took off from Indianapolis International Airport at 3:10 p.m. CST 
Monday and headed for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the controls were pilot Orlando Agular, 29, and co-pilot Jeffrey Gagliano, 
30. Both men were experienced aviators with more than 1,500 hours apiece in 
ATR72s. Agular's family resides in Palm Desert, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Stormy weather -- which had delayed their takeoff by about an hour -- 
continued to harass the plane as it headed northwest, and weather delays at 
O'Hare forced the plane into the holding pattern over Roselawn at 3:25 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The holding pattern is an oval loop about 10 miles long that planes circle at 
different altitudes while awaiting clearance to land. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight 4184 was circling at 10,000 feet while rain was continuing to fall and 
temperatures had dropped to below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 These conditions are conducive to a buildup of ice that can overburden a plane 
with added weight and distort the shape of the wings and tail surfaces, 
reducing their ability to provide lift. The plane's anti-ice devices were on, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to be in an ATR under those conditions," one veteran pilot 
said. "They don't handle ice well at all." 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:56 p.m., a controller told Flight 4184 to descend to 8,000 feet, 
remaining in the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men in the cockpit acknowledged the call, ending his transmission 
with a courteous, "Thank you." Those are the last words the controllers heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, the plane hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The wide dispersal of the wreckage is seen as evidence that the plane may have 
broken up on the way down.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; TENSIONS RISE ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL; ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANT HIRING REMAINS AN ISSUE FOR HUFFINGTON, BUT A NEW STATEWIDE POLL 
SHOWS HIM AHEAD. SOME ORANGE COUNTY REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS ENDORSE FEINSTEIN. 
</P>

<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington campaigned Wednesday in Los 
Angeles and fueled a stubborn controversy over illegal immigration by charging 
rival Sen. Dianne Feinstein with forgery, bribery and the same federal crime he 
has admitted -- hiring an illegal immigrant as domestic help. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaigned Wednesday in traditionally Republican areas of Orange 
County and Riverside, where she was endorsed by several city and county 
leaders, including Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder and 
businesswoman Kathryn Thompson, both Republicans who broke party ranks. Asked 
about Huffington's allegations, the senator fired back that her opponent was 
committing "distortions, outright lies, about me, my family, my record." 
</P>
<P>
 Tension in the Senate race rose another notch Wednesday with news of the first 
public poll to show Huffington ahead of Feinstein. KCBS-TV in Los Angeles 
reported Wednesday night that a statewide survey found the Republican nominee 
supported by 42% of the state's voters compared to 40% for Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The new poll contrasted with two previous surveys this week that showed 
Feinstein leading by as much as 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington tried Wednesday to distance his campaign from the issue that has 
shadowed him for nearly a week -- the admission that he employed an illegal 
immigrant as a nanny for more than four years. In Los Angeles, he gave a 
luncheon speech to about 130 members of the Town Hall about the priorities he 
would have as a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout the day, the candidate was forced to defend his statements on 
the controversy and his positions on illegal immigration, particularly his 
support for Proposition 187, the ballot measure that would cut most health and 
education benefits to illegal immigrants. As part of his defense, the candidate 
lashed out at Feinstein and the "liberal media" that he said is helping her 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the day's developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * In a morning interview on Los Angeles television station KTLA, Huffington 
seemed to say that employers could hire illegal immigrants as long as they paid 
for costs that might otherwise be borne by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now if people are going to employ them, they should pay for them with private 
funds," the candidate said. "And if they're not, then the people will have to 
go back to their own countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked specifically if he was suggesting that illegal immigrants should be 
employed, Huffington said he supported a guest worker program for jobs that 
cannot be filled by American citizens. But later at a news conference, 
Huffington said he did not believe it was appropriate for illegal immigrants to 
be employed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Huffington, asked in the television interview when he would provide proof of 
his accusation that Feinstein has employed illegal immigrants at her home, 
said, "Thursday or Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 But later at a news conference, the candidate said his announcement may not be 
until Sunday. He also said the announcement might not be proof about illegal 
immigrants at Feinstein's home. "You'll have to wait," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein rejected the accusation again Wednesday, saying she has never 
employed an illegal immigrant. The senator said she has had one housekeeper for 
more than 10 years who was born in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I do? . . . I have said it is false," Feinstein told reporters. "You 
know this is someone who doesn't tell the truth. I mean, we have been through 
it over and over and over again. . . . And now, when his hand is caught in the 
cookie jar, he says, 'Oh well, she has done it too.' And yet he has not 
submitted one iota of proof." 
</P>
<P>
 * Huffington said that Feinstein was guilty of "forgery" in connection with 
her accusation last month that his home included a racially restrictive clause 
prohibiting its sale to nonwhite owners. The candidate said in the television 
interview that he did not have such a clause on his property and that Feinstein 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington acknowledged at the time that at least one of the two 
properties he owned in Houston included the clause. Asked about the contention 
of forgery, Huffington's campaign produced a Feinstein press handout in which 
the Republican candidate's name was placed adjacent to the racially 
discriminatory language. Huffington's campaign contended that the document was 
a forgery because it indicated that the candidate's signature was on the same 
page as the controversial language. 
</P>
<P>
 * Huffington also charged the senator with bribery, saying that a Santa 
Barbara newspaper reporter was acting as an agent for her campaign last week 
when he approached the illegal immigrant who worked as the Huffingtons' nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign has issued a two-page notarized statement from the 
former nanny's husband saying that the reporter offered them green cards and 
jobs if they talked about their experience in the Huffington household. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Feinstein and the newspaper reporter rejected the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal election records released Wednesday in Washington show that 
Feinstein loaned her campaign $812,000 during the last 10 days of October. This 
brings the total the California Democrat has contributed to her reelection 
effort to $2.35 million. Huffington has given his campaign $27.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, according to the reports, collected $228,000 in $1,000 
contributions from individuals and $82,750 from political action committees 
between Oct. 20 and 29. The recent contributions mean that Feinstein has raised 
at least $12.5 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech Wednesday, Huffington sought to outline three priorities if he 
is elected to the U.S. Senate -- economic reform, welfare reform and "breaking 
the grip of the special interests." 
</P>
<P>
 "Six days from now, I am asking the people of California for a mandate to get 
government out of their lives and off their backs; a mandate to dismantle the 
federal welfare state that is sapping our nation's resources and a mandate to 
take on the Establishment in Washington," he said. "If the people elect me, 
they won't get just another senator who will join the club, slice the pork and 
bring home the bacon -- they'll be sending a bull into the congressional china 
shop." 
</P>
<P>
 On economic reform, Huffington said he would seek to repeal the tax increases 
passed in Clinton's 1993 economic package -- which included a gas tax and other 
increases targeted at the wealthy. To limit the power of special interests, 
Huffington also proposed that candidates be offered free time on television for 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein began her day talking about campaign reform as well. In an interview 
on ABC TV's "Good Morning America," she said, "I am running against someone who 
has unlimited money. And if any race shows need for campaign spending reform . 
. . this one does." 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging Huffington's self-proclaimed description of political outsider, 
Feinstein said the Republican congressman -- a former Ronald Reagan 
Administration appointee -- has spent more time in federal government than she 
has. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the race is really about is someone who has no record, who has actually 
been in Washington a year longer than I . . . and has done absolutely nothing 
but bought a House seat and turned around and is determined to buy a Senate 
seat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County elected officials who endorsed Feinstein on Wednesday were 
Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, Stanton Mayor Sal Sapien, 
Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly and Irvine Police Chief Charles S. Brobeck. Feinstein 
also won endorsements from Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno, Laguna Beach 
Councilwoman Lida Lenney, Dana Point Councilwoman Karen Lloreda, Anaheim 
Councilman Irv Pickler and Stanton Councilman William C. Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has won endorsements from Orange County Reps. Robert K. Dornan, Ed 
Royce, Dana Rohrabacher, Christopher Cox, Ron Packard and Jay C. Kim. He also 
has support from Assembly members Ross Johnson, Doris Allen, Gil Ferguson, Curt 
Pringle, Bill Morrow and Mickey Conroy. State senators for Huffington include 
John R. Lewis and Rob Hurtt. 
</P>
<P>
 At a rally at the Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach on Wednesday, Wieder told 
about 80 Feinstein supporters that her own endorsement was "not courageous. 
It's the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Wieder angered some Orange County Republicans when she endorsed Bill 
Clinton for President, which resulted in an unsuccessful recall attempt against 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Wednesday's rally, five Huffington supporters carried signs that said, 
"Wieder is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time for Harriett to be honest with the voters about her political 
loyalties," said Jo Ellen Allen, vice chairwoman of the Orange County 
Republican Central Committee, "and sign on the dotted line where it says 
Democrat."

JUDGE ADMITS HIS ROLE IN '3 STRIKES' LAW; COURTS: JAMES A. ARDAIZ OF FRESNO 
STATE APPELLATE PANEL SAYS HE HELPED AUTHOR THE LEGISLATION. HE HAD PLANNED TO 
RECUSE HIMSELF FROM 'SUBSTANTIVE' LEGAL QUESTIONS INVOLVING THE ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A high-ranking state appellate court justice acknowledged that he helped draft 
the tough "three strikes" sentencing law, bringing criticism from some jurists 
who say he overstepped his role as a disinterested arbiter of law. 
</P>
<P>
 James A. Ardaiz, presiding justice of the Fresno-based 5th District Court of 
Appeal, kept his role quiet until after The Times reported this month that Mike 
Reynolds, sponsor of the "three strikes" Proposition 184 on Tuesday's ballot, 
stated that three judges helped write it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Reynolds refused to name the judges, saying they had asked to 
remain anonymous because they might have to rule on "three strikes" cases. 
Ardaiz and two Fresno Municipal Court judges came forward after the article 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Ardaiz said he had always intended to recuse himself from 
appeals involving "substantive" legal questions about "three strikes." 
Defending his decision to help write the measure, Ardaiz said: "My motivation 
is very simple. I want to see (California) be a better place to live. I want it 
to be a safer place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 A former deputy district attorney in Fresno and a judge since 1981, Ardaiz, 
46, is seen as a judge on the move. If anything, his role may help his ascent, 
particularly if Gov. Pete Wilson, a backer of Proposition 184, wins reelection 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some colleagues criticize his involvement in the highly charged 
issue, saying he has lost the appearance of neutrality on criminal law. They 
attacked Ardaiz for keeping his role quiet, and say his actions may affect the 
state Supreme Court, where his brother-in-law, Justice Marvin Baxter, sits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a guy who still thinks he's in the D.A.'s office," said a veteran 
Court of Appeal justice, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge was one of 10 current and former appellate judges called by The 
Times. Like the others, the justice spoke on the condition that he not be 
named. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is getting into the area of being very pro-law enforcement," said a 
retired Republican Court of Appeal justice. "Judges give that up, and adopt a 
neutral role." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate is not clear-cut over whether judges should write laws, or merely 
interpret them. Some judges, lawyers and academics say judges should become 
more active in drafting legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The canons of judicial conduct permit judges to become involved in 
improvements regarding administration of justice," said Jerome Falk, head of 
the California Academy of Appellate Attorneys. "I don't see how you can 
differentiate between issues that are mundane and are controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Baxter did not comment. But Ardaiz said his actions will not affect 
Baxter, noting he "voted before to reverse me and I'm sure he has done that 
without the slightest pang of conscience." 
</P>
<P>
 But some believe Ardaiz's role in "three strikes" places Baxter in a difficult 
position when "three strikes" cases reach the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were Baxter, I would recuse myself," said the appellate court justice 
who is a Democrat. "It is an area that is gray. But I would recuse myself, and 
most judges would." 
</P>
<P>
 Ardaiz said he met with Reynolds, a family acquaintance, shortly after 
Reynolds' daughter, Kimber, was slain in June, 1992. Over time, Reynolds asked 
Ardaiz and two other judges to write a measure aimed at imprisoning repeat 
offenders. The judges obliged, producing what Ardaiz calls a "core framework." 
</P>
<P>
 The first "three strikes" bill stalled in the Legislature in 1993. But 
Reynolds persisted, pursuing the initiative, as well as legislation. "Three 
strikes" became law in March. Proposition 184 on next week's ballot mimics that 
statute, a sweeping measure certain to result in longer prison terms for 
thousands of felons. Ardaiz said provisions of the current measure were part of 
the initial "outline." 
</P>
<P>
 Judges expect many challenges to "three strikes," and say the bulk of the 
issues will be decided by state courts of appeal such as Ardaiz's. With Ardaiz 
stepping aside in "three strikes" cases, there would be nine other judges on 
the district's court to decide such questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ardaiz helped write the measure, he stops short of endorsing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not want a judicial title attached to a piece of legislation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds has shown no such inhibition. He has tried to assure voters that the 
measure was solidly written by saying judges were involved in drafting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ardaiz insists that his involvement was known by a "large number of 
people," it was not evident to organizers of a May forum in Fresno on "three 
strikes," at which Ardaiz was a panelist. When lawyer Catherine Campbell, who 
helped organize the event, learned of Ardaiz's involvement, she said her 
reaction was "total shock." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an outright advocate," Campbell said. "It was a dishonesty by 
omission." 
</P>
<P>
 Ardaiz maintained that nothing he said amounted to an endorsement.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN BEGINS MARATHON TOUR OF STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE and CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaping aboard a mode of transportation that candidates have increasingly used 
to prove they are one with the common folk, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown 
began a 29-hour barrage of campaigning Wednesday by suggesting that Gov. Pete 
Wilson has a "secret deportation plan" to implement Proposition 187 if it is 
approved next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic gubernatorial nominee, traveling from site to site aboard a 
bus, and later a plane, continued to hammer Wilson on his support of the 
controversial anti-illegal immigration proposition. Wilson, for his part, sent 
a none too subtle signal that he embraces minorities and legal immigrants by 
speaking to Asian American business leaders in San Francisco's Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, his campaign released two new television ads that portray 
him as a strong advocate for tough crime laws, stopping illegal immigration and 
spurring California jobs -- and characterize Brown in unflattering terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown supports continuing state services to illegals even though it 
costs taxpayers over $2 billion a year," one ad states. "Another reason we need 
Pete Wilson for governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, Brown's criticism of Wilson was unstinting. While the 
locations changed, her criticism of the governor's position did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor either has not thought this through, doesn't have a plan or has 
a secret plan or perhaps a secret deportation plan that will make this law 
work," she told reporters outside John F. Kennedy High School in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is their plan? Who is going to pay for it? How will it be implemented? 
When children are denied an education, what will happen to those children? Who 
will take care of them on the streets? And if they are on the streets, will 
they have a deportation plan? We don't know the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign responded angrily, with press spokesman Dan Schnur calling 
the Democrat's suggestion preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has made it very clear that after Proposition 187 passes, 
assuming that it passes, that he will work with the federal government and with 
the courts to see that it is implemented," Schnur said. "It's ironic that the 
charge comes from a candidate who has refused to say if she would implement 187 
at all if she is elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's tour took her and her entourage from Sacramento to Emeryville to 
Hayward to San Jose to San Diego (by plane) and to Los Angeles. And that was 
before midnight. By the time the trip was to end this morning, Brown was 
scheduled to make 12 stops in 11 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur, Wilson's chief spokesman, met reporters at the Brown campaign bus 
Wednesday morning before the tour kicked off. Each reporter was given a manila 
envelope labeled "Kathleen Brown Bataan Death March Bus Trip Survival Kit." The 
kits included, among other things, earplugs, a tiny bottle of vodka, pseudo 
sleeping pills and a map of California for reporters who bail out before the 
29-hour trip is over. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Hayward, where 1,000 enthusiastic students turned out for a noon 
Brown rally, the treasurer reeled off a campaign staple of hers, a mock-David 
Letterman Top 10 List that gives her reasons why Wilson should be tossed out of 
office. (Sample: "Number 8: When Wilson promised longer graduation lines and 
shorter unemployment lines, we didn't know he was dyslexic.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Help me take California out of the darkness," she asked the enthusiastic 
crowd. "Turn on the lights in California. Turn on the lights and let hope back 
in, let the promise back in. Let the people back in. Help me rebuild this great 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 At San Jose's Touche Manufacturing Co., a minority-owned business that employs 
many first-, second- and third-generation immigrants, Brown pledged to build a 
partnership between workers, business and government. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at a news conference outside, she passed out a Dallas Morning News 
clipping that suggested Wilson had played a role in trying to delay, until 
after the election, the announcement that McDonnell Douglas has decided to 
moved an aircraft assembly plant that employs 3,000 workers to Dallas. The 
article reports that Wilson has had at least two discussions with McDonnell 
Douglas officials, who are currently based in Long Beach, within the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern of our Republican governor is that the announcement will hurt his 
reelection chances," she said. "The governor's job is to fight plant closures 
and not to fight announcements of plant closures." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Administration and campaign officials flatly denied the governor had 
tried to influence the timing of the announcement, and said that Wilson was 
seeking to keep the jobs in California. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Brown, "I don't believe she's ever shown any interest in weighing in 
and entering the discussions" to keep McDonnell Douglas in California, said 
Bill George, assistant secretary for marketing and communications at the state 
Department of Trade and Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's new advertisements focus on the major issues of the campaign. While 
one ad targets Brown's immigration stance, the other -- a 30-second commercial 
-- hits on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 It reminds voters that the governor backs the recently enacted "three strikes" 
crime bill and the death penalty. It accuses Brown of planning to appoint "more 
lenient" judges and notes her personal opposition to capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 It concludes that the governor has sought to keep jobs in California and says 
that Brown would "increase taxes and drive jobs out of California" -- 
accusations which Brown flatly denies. 
</P>
<P>
 In his San Francisco address, Wilson returned to those themes, saying Brown 
has "played no part" in efforts to increase jobs or public safety. He also 
criticized her opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which 
opened up trade between the United States and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has endorsed flawed protectionism," he said. Income Tax Filings 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and his Democratic challenger, Treasurer Kathleen Brown, have 
made their income tax filings available to reporters. The following shows 
adjusted gross income for the candidates and their spouses as well as the 
combined state and federal income taxes they paid for each of the past five 
years.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; RIORDAN, LUNGREN AMONG NEUTRAL 
OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the hottest political issue to hit California in years. 
</P>
<P>
 But less than a week before the votes are counted, Los Angeles Mayor Richard 
Riordan and some of the state's most prominent elected officials have yet to 
take a stand on Proposition 187, the emotion-packed ballot measure that would 
bar illegal immigrants from most government services and require local health, 
educational and police officials to report suspects to state and federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of lingering fence-sitters includes state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren; 
Matt Fong, Republican candidate for state treasurer; state Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi; Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, and San 
Diego Mayor Susan Golding. 
</P>
<P>
 Also failing to weigh in has been the state's senior public official emeritus 
-- former President and two-term Gov. Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers say there is a natural inclination among cautious 
officials to gauge which way the wind is blowing before stepping into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you guess wrong and you get burned," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of 
the Center for Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the sweeping anti-illegal immigrant measure, the wind's 
direction has become less clear as Election Day approaches. Once boasting a 
runaway lead in the polls, the measure's support has narrowed in recent weeks 
and its passage no longer appears certain. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the measure's volatility and divisive nature have also led both sides 
to thinly veil their distaste for politicians refusing to make their preference 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no hiding in the dark on this subject -- we have made this an issue 
of national attention now," said Robert Kiley, political strategist for the 
pro-187 campaign committee. "Some of them are trying to duck it. Some of them 
have taken a long time to come around. But it is the obligation of every 
elected official to tell their constituency how they stand on Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 For once, opponents of the ballot measure agree with their foes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you show leadership by saying 'this is how I'm going to vote,' " said 
Scott Macdonald, spokesman for Taxpayers Against 187. "These are people asking 
the voters to follow them or put them in a position of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Riordan, who drew national news coverage last weekend for his 
endorsement of Democratic Senate incumbent Dianne Feinstein's reelection bid, 
has decided to stay neutral precisely because the issue is so rancorous, says 
mayoral press secretary Noelia Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not planning to take a position," Rodriguez said. "He has said . . . it 
would be divisive for the city if he took a position on it, recognizing the 
fact it is such an emotional issue." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the mayor of the nation's second-largest city has made some 
cryptic comments indicating he has problems with key provisions of the measure, 
which would bar illegal immigrants from virtually all government services 
except emergency health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has said he doesn't believe that any person, especially children, should 
be denied basic services such as health, education and nutrition," said 
Rodriguez. "He also believes that local governments should be compensated by 
the federal government, because it is not enforcing immigration laws adequately 
and local governments have to incur the expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan may be caught in the middle of his ongoing relationships with leaders 
on both ends of the Proposition 187 spectrum, observers say. For years, the 
first-term mayor and prominent businessman has been close to Cardinal Roger M. 
Mahony, one of the most outspoken opponents of Proposition 187. On the other 
hand, Riordan also has close ties to Gov. Pete Wilson, who has employed the 
get-tough ballot measure as a cornerstone of his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffe terms the mayor "a real puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got political cover from (conservative former Republican Cabinet 
secretaries) Jack F. Kemp and William J. Bennett. He himself has criticized the 
initiative and has endorsed one highly visible candidate. Perhaps he's holding 
back so as not to embarrass Pete Wilson, who he has also endorsed." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, also a Republican, has been attacked repeatedly by Democratic 
election foe Tom Umberg for failing to take a stand on Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, who has said recently that he is still studying the measure, said 
Monday that he intends to take a position prior to Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioning why Lungren would still be studying the issue at this late date, 
Umberg says he came to his own conclusion to oppose the measure by reading the 
attorney general's own brief summary of the initiative in the state's official 
ballot pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference Monday, Lungren said he would defend the initiative 
against expected lawsuits if it is approved by state voters. But he also made 
clear that he would not prosecute educators, health administrators and others 
for failing to report suspected illegal immigrants to state and federal 
authorities, since the measure makes no specific provisions for enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 To those seeking his position on Proposition 187, treasurer candidate Fong has 
sent out letters saying that there are good arguments on both sides -- and that 
he is remaining neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have a problem with illegal immigration. And, our state Legislature and 
the federal government are unwilling to address this problem," writes Fong, who 
serves on the State Board of Equalization. "However, the unintended 
consequences of Proposition 187 concern me. 
</P>
<P>
 Also not publicly announcing a position has been Garamendi, who was defeated 
by Kathleen Brown in the June Democratic gubernatorial primary. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Mayor Golding has also declined to take a position on Proposition 
187, despite being a staunch supporter of Wilson and one of the first public 
officials to express concern about illegal immigrants and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 While a county supervisor in the late 1980s, Golding caused a furor by blaming 
illegal immigrants for a large portion of the crime wave plaguing the county's 
affluent suburban areas. She was forced to back down when her statistics proved 
faulty. 
</P>
<P>
 Golding is not alone among San Diego officials in sitting out the Proposition 
187 debate. Neither the San Diego City Council nor the San Diego County Board 
of Supervisors, which has sued the federal government to recover millions of 
dollars spent on providing services for illegal immigrants, has taken a 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the birthplace of the Proposition 187 movement, Supervisor 
Vasquez, the county's highest-ranking elected Latino official, has drawn fire 
for his refusal to take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't taken a conclusive position," Vasquez said last week. "I don't 
intend to get involved in the campaign for either side." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the measure, including William S. King, executive vice president 
of Americans Against Illegal Immigration, say Vasquez is acting out of fear of 
losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every official should show his colors on it," said King. "I don't 
think he has shown much courage. These people should be standing up one way or 
the other. This is not the time to be hiding around the skirts of 'no comment.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montez, a spokesman for the League of United Latin American Citizens, 
has also attacked Vasquez, who was appointed to the board by Gov. George 
Deukmejian in 1987 and elected to a four-year term in a predominantly 
non-Latino district in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gaddi Vasquez is the highest-ranking Latino in the county and he's used it to 
propel his political career here and on the national level," Montez said. "But 
obviously he feels he is on the right side of the street, the safe side, and he 
wishes to become a spectator just like the good Germans did when they watched 
other Germans being marched to the ovens." 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Reagan, whose endorsement or opposition would be seen as 
valuable, could not be reached for comment. Repeated calls to his Century City 
office were not returned by his press spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Reagan insider Lyn Nofziger, contacted in Washington, said, "It's 
hard to get a (public) statement from him on anything anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Tony Perry and Matt Lait contributed to this story.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; TENSIONS RISE ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL; ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANT HIRING REMAINS AN ISSUE FOR HUFFINGTON, BUT A NEW STATEWIDE POLL 
SHOWS HIM AHEAD. SOME ORANGE COUNTY REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS ENDORSE FEINSTEIN. 
</P>

<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington campaigned Wednesday in Los 
Angeles and fueled a stubborn controversy over illegal immigration by charging 
rival Sen. Dianne Feinstein with forgery, bribery and the same federal crime he 
has admitted -- hiring an illegal immigrant as domestic help. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaigned Wednesday in traditionally Republican areas of Orange 
County and Riverside, where she was endorsed by several city and county 
leaders, including some GOP officials. Asked about Huffington's allegations, 
the senator fired back that her opponent was committing "distortions, outright 
lies, about me, my family, my record." 
</P>
<P>
 Tension in the Senate race rose another notch Wednesday with news of the first 
public poll to show Huffington ahead of Feinstein. KCBS-TV in Los Angeles 
reported Wednesday night that a statewide survey found the Republican nominee 
supported by 42% of the state's voters compared to 40% for Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The new poll contrasted with two previous surveys this week that showed 
Feinstein leading by as much as 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington tried Wednesday to distance his campaign from the issue that has 
shadowed him for nearly a week -- the admission that he employed an illegal 
immigrant as a nanny for more than four years. In Los Angeles, he gave a 
luncheon speech to about 130 members of the Town Hall about the priorities he 
would have as a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout the day, the candidate was forced to defend his statements on 
the controversy and his positions on illegal immigration, particularly his 
support for Proposition 187, the ballot measure that would cut most health and 
education benefits to illegal immigrants. As part of his defense, the candidate 
lashed out at Feinstein and the "liberal media" that he said is helping her 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the day's developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * In a morning interview on Los Angeles television station KTLA, Huffington 
seemed to say that employers could hire illegal immigrants as long as they paid 
for costs that might otherwise be borne by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now if people are going to employ them, they should pay for them with private 
funds," the candidate said. "And if they're not, then the people will have to 
go back to their own countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked specifically if he was suggesting that illegal immigrants should be 
employed, Huffington said he supported a guest worker program for jobs that 
cannot be filled by American citizens. But later at a news conference, 
Huffington said he did not believe it was appropriate for illegal immigrants to 
be employed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Huffington, asked in the television interview when he would provide proof of 
his accusation that Feinstein has employed illegal immigrants at her home, 
said, "Thursday or Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 But later at a news conference, the candidate said his announcement may not be 
until Sunday. He also said the announcement might not be proof about illegal 
immigrants at Feinstein's home. "You'll have to wait," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein rejected the accusation again Wednesday, saying she has never 
employed an illegal immigrant. The senator said she has had one housekeeper for 
more than 10 years who was born in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I do? . . . I have said it is false," Feinstein told reporters. "You 
know this is someone who doesn't tell the truth. I mean, we have been through 
it over and over and over again. . . . And now, when his hand is caught in the 
cookie jar, he says, 'Oh well, she has done it too.' And yet he has not 
submitted one iota of proof." 
</P>
<P>
 * Huffington said that Feinstein was guilty of "forgery" in connection with 
her accusation last month that his home included a racially restrictive clause 
prohibiting its sale to nonwhite owners. The candidate said in the television 
interview that he did not have such a clause on his property and that Feinstein 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington acknowledged at the time that at least one of the two 
properties he owned in Houston included the clause. Asked about the contention 
of forgery, Huffington's campaign produced a Feinstein press handout in which 
the Republican candidate's name was placed adjacent to the racially 
discriminatory language. Huffington's campaign contended that the document was 
a forgery because it indicated that the candidate's signature was on the same 
page as the controversial language. 
</P>
<P>
 * Huffington also charged the senator with bribery, saying that a Santa 
Barbara newspaper reporter was acting as an agent for her campaign last week 
when he approached the illegal immigrant who worked as the Huffingtons' nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign has issued a two-page notarized statement from the 
former nanny's husband saying that the reporter offered them green cards and 
jobs if they talked about their experience in the Huffington household. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out that she (sent) . . . this reporter to our nanny, or former 
nanny, and tried to bribe the nanny and the husband by giving them a green 
card," Huffington said. "It's an outrage." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Feinstein and the newspaper reporter rejected the charge. "I have had 
nothing to do with any member of the press with respect to this story," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal election records released Wednesday in Washington show that 
Feinstein loaned her campaign $812,000 during the last 10 days of October. This 
brings the total the California Democrat has contributed to her reelection 
effort to $2.35 million. Huffington has given his campaign $27.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, according to the reports, collected $228,000 in $1,000 
contributions from individuals and $82,750 from political action committees 
between Oct. 20 and 29. The recent contributions mean that Feinstein has raised 
at least $12.5 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech Wednesday, Huffington sought to outline three priorities if he 
is elected to the U.S. Senate -- economic reform, welfare reform and "breaking 
the grip of the special interests." 
</P>
<P>
 "Six days from now, I am asking the people of California for a mandate to get 
government out of their lives and off their backs; a mandate to dismantle the 
federal welfare state that is sapping our nation's resources and a mandate to 
take on the Establishment in Washington," he said. "If the people elect me, 
they won't get just another senator who will join the club, slice the pork and 
bring home the bacon -- they'll be sending a bull into the congressional china 
shop." 
</P>
<P>
 On economic reform, Huffington said he would seek to repeal the tax increases 
passed in Clinton's 1993 economic package -- which included a gas tax and other 
increases targeted at the wealthy. To limit the power of special interests, 
Huffington also proposed that candidates be offered free time on television for 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein began her day talking about campaign reform as well. In an interview 
on ABC TV's "Good Morning America," she said, "I am running against someone who 
has unlimited money. And if any race shows need for campaign spending reform . 
. . this one does." 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging Huffington's self-proclaimed description of political outsider, 
Feinstein said the Republican congressman -- a former Ronald Reagan 
Administration appointee -- has spent more time in federal government than she 
has. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the race is really about is someone who has no record, who has actually 
been in Washington a year longer than I . . . and has done absolutely nothing 
but bought a House seat and turned around and is determined to buy a Senate 
seat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein hammered a similar theme throughout the day, contrasting her 
experience in navigating the federal bureaucracy with her opponent's expensive 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "A United States Senate seat should be earned by somebody who cares about this 
state," Feinstein told supporters in Newport Beach. "It is too important to let 
it be bought." 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigning in conservative strongholds such as Orange County and the Inland 
Empire, Feinstein continued to draw bipartisan support from local legislators 
and law enforcement officials -- among them Orange County Supervisor Harriett 
Wieder, and Mayors Tom Minor of San Bernardino, Swen Larson of Redlands and Mal 
Wessel of Barstow, all Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a Californian, she knows what it takes to deliver for California and she 
has delivered for California. Her opponent has ignored the only elective office 
he has ever held," Republican businesswoman Kathryn Thompson said. Huffington

INS RAIDS FIRM OF FARMER IN KANGAROO RAT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ARAX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Chinese bamboo farmer, whose arrest in February for killing five kangaroo 
rats galvanized conservatives nationwide, has been busted by the federal 
government again. 
</P>
<P>
 Taung Ming-Lin's newest run-in with the law has nothing to do with violating 
the federal Endangered Species Act on his 723-acre farm outside Bakersfield, 
which made him a cause celebre among private property rights advocates from 
Rush Limbaugh to Mike Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Taiwanese immigrant has aroused the long arm of the INS for 
allegedly employing undocumented workers from Mexico at his bookbinding shop in 
South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 And authorities are investigating whether Lin, his wife and three children, 
ages 19 to 23, are also here illegally and subject to deportation. "I have a 
little feeling the government is trying to pressure me," Lin said through a 
translator. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, as Lin drove to Fresno to meet with an attorney about his upcoming 
trial on charges of destroying sensitive habitat, immigration agents raided his 
Lippo Binding shop and arrested his 22-year-old daughter and 10 workers from 
Mexico, Taiwan and Indonesia. The daughter, Sulin Lin, was released eight hours 
later from a holding facility in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin, a small man who wears a lucky jade dragon on his belt and speaks no 
English, was never a likely hero. Now his plight is sure to cause heartburn in 
this election season for those who vilify environmental law but hold dear the 
notion of an inviolable border. 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials refused to comment on the case, saying the investigation was 
continuing. Daniel Rudnick, one of two attorneys representing Lin in the 
kangaroo rat case, called the family's immigration problems a "minor deal over 
paperwork." He accused the federal government of ganging up on "a new American 
hero, a Chinese Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. government cannot stand the fact that Mr. Lin has been lionized by 
the American public and talk show radio hosts," Rudnick said. "So they want to 
dirty him and soil him in the public eye before his trial. That's what this 
piling on is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Lin brought his family to America in 1990, abandoning a lucrative career in 
Taiwan as an importer of U.S.-made products to open the bookbinding company in 
South El Monte, where the family lives. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't stop dreaming about the life of a farmer, he said, recalling his 
84-year-old father still tilling eight acres of peanuts and rice on an island 
west of Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 A Monterey Park real estate agent told him about the fertile San Joaquin 
Valley on the other side of the Tehachapis. After a few trips, he handed over 
$310,000 to Tenneco Inc. for 723 acres near Interstate 5 about 100 miles north 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A more bereft piece of earth -- tumbleweeds and snakes and salt-encrusted 
desert -- would be hard to imagine. Neither the real estate agent nor Tenneco 
told Lin it would take years of irrigation to leach out the deadly salts and 
turn the 723 acres into marginal cropland at best, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the escrow papers never mentioned a word about the Tipton kangaroo rat and 
blunt-nosed leopard lizard and San Joaquin kit fox -- endangered species that 
roamed the land. 
</P>
<P>
 In early February, after Lin paid $150,000 for a new well and tractor, and 
planted five acres of bamboo, state agents informed him that he was tilling 
endangered species habitat. A few days later, his farm manager proceeded to 
plow under another swath of scrubland. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that state and federal agents swooped down on the farm, seizing 
the tractor and charging Lin with three violations of the Endangered Species 
Act. His trial is set for early December. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been a darling of conservative commentators ever since, an example of 
the federal environmental bureaucracy gone mad. Lin has been honored at tractor 
parades by farmers and roughnecks and sought out by politicians of all stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest news about the raid of his bookbinding company and investigation 
into his immigration status does not go down easy, especially for those who 
have taken up his banner and that of Proposition 187, the so-called Save Our 
State initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first I've heard of it," said E.G. Berchtold, a Kern County 
farmer and tractor salesman who strongly supported Lin. "Forget that you called 
me. Anything I say without thinking won't help the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Loron Hodge, head of the Kern County Farm Bureau and a member of the private 
property group that honored Lin at the tractor parade this summer, was also 
stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we looked at him as a hero or not," he said. "He was a 
example of what could happen to any of us who own land. The issue doesn't 
change just because Mr. Lin now has these (immigration) problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Lin, who has invested more than $1 million in the country he wants to call 
home, is clearly confounded. Three weeks before the raid, he said, INS agents 
came to his shop demanding employee tax forms. He complied. Three of the men 
arrested last week weren't even his employees but drivers of another company, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to run my business in America with no problems," he said.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: CLINTON VISIT MAY CUT BOTH WAYS FOR PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here comes President Clinton. Hail to the Chief. Banners, bunting, balloons, 
squeals and barricaded streets. Wide eyes and glowing faces. Glowering Clint 
Eastwood look-alikes mumbling into their sleeves. God Bless the U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 It's exciting if you're there, excruciating if your freeway on-ramp is 
blocked. It makes for good TV film. But is it good politics? 
</P>
<P>
 Not always, but Clinton's two-day visit to California on the final weekend 
before the election should provide a slight lift for the state Democratic 
ticket and also, perhaps, for the battle against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is more popular in California -- or less unpopular -- than he is in 
the nation as a whole. And his image here has been improving. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statewide poll by The Times last week, the President's job performance 
was approved by 49% of registered voters and disapproved by 45%. That was 
virtually the opposite of a September state survey. A nationwide Times poll two 
weeks ago found Clinton with a negative rating, 45%-51%. His numbers were 
slightly worse in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's political value in California, however, is not his power to 
persuade but his ability to motivate -- not just Democrats to vote, but also to 
coax their neighbors to the polls. Anybody who would blindly follow Bill 
Clinton's political advice already is committed to voting for Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein and gubernatorial nominee Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 What Feinstein and Brown need are volunteers to help generate big turnouts in 
Democratic precincts -- during a year when low turnouts are expected and 
Republican activists have been more enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will try to inject some warm nostalgia: Remember the glory days of 
'92, when California Democrats mounted their biggest grass-roots effort ever. 
The party's presidential candidate carried the state, breaking a six-election 
losing streak. Democrats won both Senate seats. Remember the hatred for George 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the demand for change. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, remember. Change really didn't happen, not as promised. So the mood of 
many voters has changed, from hope to anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "The less Bill Clinton is seen in the Central Valley, the better off 
Democratic candidates are going to be," says veteran consultant Darry Sragow, 
who is managing the tough reelection campaign of U.S. Rep. Richard H. Lehman 
(D-North Fork). In this congressional district, where party registration is 
closely divided but voters lean Republican, the President's poll numbers are 
very negative. Lehman's opponent has promised to "wrap Clinton around his 
neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow understands Clinton's personal agenda: It is to use his current 
cross-country swing to polish his image and begin campaigning for reelection in 
1996. "In the longer term, it's imperative for Democrats that the President 
regain his strength," Sragow says. "Nevertheless, for those of us trying to 
live through the next week, there's an argument to be made that the President 
ought to begin repairing his California base on or after Nov. 9." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven A. Merksamer, a sometimes GOP strategist, points out the risk for 
Democratic candidates in Clinton's visit: "He symbolizes a Washington, D.C., 
that is viewed as rotten and unresponsive and increasingly corrupt. Voters are 
looking for candidates to stand up to Bill Clinton, not to kowtow to Bill 
Clinton. If he could just do fund-raisers with the Hollywood glitterati and 
stay away from the rest of the state, that would be a net plus. But he can't. 
He's the President of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Clinton's overt politicking is confined to just two big rallies -- one 
on the Los Angeles City Hall steps Friday afternoon and the other in Oakland 
Saturday -- he will be highlighted all over the state on TV news. He can 
campaign in the two regions where he is most popular -- L.A. County and the Bay 
Area -- but the entire state will be watching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and Brown, however, will be happy to see Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very nervous about voter turnout," concedes Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's 
campaign manager. Polls show the incumbent with only a small lead over Rep. 
Mike Huffington, who continues to pour his own millions into saturation TV 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Any chance underdog Brown has of upsetting Gov. Pete Wilson depends on a big 
turnout of minority and female Democrats, perhaps motivated to oppose 
Proposition 187, the illegal immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Democratic party will use Clinton's pep rallies to reward its 
precinct captains -- they'll get reserved seats up front -- and to recruit more 
Election Day volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Clinton, he probably figures Feinstein will win and he can claim 
partial credit. And if Brown loses, that was expected anyway and nobody will 
blame him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman just hopes nobody in his district watches the TV news.

SUSPECT IN WHITE HOUSE ATTACK RULED COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Francisco Martin Duran is mentally 
competent to stand trial for allegedly firing 27 shots at the exterior of the 
White House on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Magistrate Deborah Robinson issued the ruling on the recommendation of 
prosecutors even though Duran cut short his one-day psychiatric exam by 
refusing to answer all the doctor's questions. He did so after his 
court-provided lawyer, Leigh Kenny, filed motions -- later denied by the court 
-- to halt the examination. 
</P>
<P>
 The competency evaluation was intended to determine whether Duran is capable 
of understanding the charges against him and assisting in his defense at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also continued to consider filing a more serious charge of 
attempted assassination against the 26-year-old Colorado resident. The charge 
carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The four counts already lodged 
against Duran carry an aggregate maximum punishment of 35 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence against Duran includes handwritten notes left in his pickup 
truck, which was found parked near the White House. The exact content of the 
notes remains a mystery, although federal sources have said that one suggests 
he expected to die in his attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A second note scrawled on a map, the sources said, contains the words "kill 
the . . . " followed by a misspelled word believed to be an abbreviation for 
"President." It is this note, together with statements by a former co-worker, 
that has led investigators to believe Duran intended to harm President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The former co-worker, David Millis, who once worked with Duran at the 
Broadmoor resort hotel in Colorado Springs, has told FBI agents that Duran once 
said he wanted "to take out the President." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the shooting, the President was watching a college football 
game in a rear bedroom of the White House and was nowhere near the line of 
fire. Duran, standing on a public sidewalk in front of the White House, fired 
what the Secret Service now estimates were 27 shots from a Chinese-made 
semiautomatic assault rifle. About eight chipped the exterior of the mansion 
and the adjoining West Wing, which houses Clinton's office and the press 
briefing room. 
</P>
<P>
 The magistrate, citing public safety, ordered Duran to be held without bail 
over objections of his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney argued that the government had failed to show Duran intended to 
harm anyone, even Secret Service agents who she said hid behind trees as they 
rushed toward Duran. 
</P>
<P>
 The four charges lodged against Duran to date are possessing a firearm as a 
convicted felon, causing more than $100 damage to federal property, assaulting 
or endangering federal agents and using a firearm in the commission of a 
violent crime. Duran has not yet entered a plea.

<P>
 AND HE IS US: In Tennessee, where two U.S. Senate seats are at stake, 
Republicans are benefiting from contrapuntal advertising by the Democratic 
candidates, Rep. Jim Cooper and incumbent Sen. Jim Sasser. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's campaign against Republican Fred Thompson makes much of renouncing 
political action committee money. That doesn't help Sasser, whose campaign is 
fueled by PAC money. At the same time, Sasser attacks his opponent, Bill Frist, 
as a rich man, indirectly damaging Cooper, who is one of the wealthiest men in 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating matters is the ad campaign of Democratic gubernatorial 
nominee Phil Bredesen, who regularly denounces the influence of Washington. Two 
guesses where Cooper and Sasser make their living.

</P>
<P>
 BIG TENT: President Clinton's apparent vulnerability and a wide-open 
Republican field have prompted a growing number of GOP luminaries to explore 
White House bids for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all are household names. Among them is Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), a 
moderate who is well-known as one of Anita Faye Hill's toughest cross-examiners 
during the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. 
Specter has formed a political action committee called the Big Tent PAC to 
broaden the base of the Republican Party. The PAC, which has raised about 
$83,000, also helps fund Specter's travels around the country to urge 
Republicans to reach out to women, minorities and blue-collar voters even as 
others pull the party to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a mistake in 1992 by not confronting the issue early on," Specter 
said. But carving a niche for himself may be difficult in a field that could 
include such relative Republican moderates as California Gov. Pete Wilson or 
Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld, if both are reelected next week.

 HELLO, SAILOR: The Hawaii GOP candidate running against Democratic Rep. Patsy 
Mink has all but vanished from the campaign scene. A Republican Party 
spokeswoman said Wednesday that the party had virtually no contact with elusive 
candidate Robert Garner, who won a surprising victory in the September primary 
but is trailing Mink badly in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard he's off sailing on his boat," the spokeswoman said. She had just 
one phone number for Garner, a beeper. It did not work. How about a number for 
his campaign headquarters? "We assume it's on his boat," she said. State GOP 
Chairman Jared Jossem calls Garner "an extremely independent Republican."

 BOOSTING CRIME: Add AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland to the growing list of 
critics of the media. Kirkland, in a rare press briefing, said "market driven" 
television reporting on crime and violence has been in part responsible for 
boosting public concern with crime to the point that it "blankets out" other 
issues on the labor agenda, such as health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to look at the Zeitgeist , that's one of the factors in it," he 
said. And, in general, Kirkland maintains, the crime issue contributes to 
Americans' current sour, anxious outlook: "The public sees the failure of 
government at all levels to achieve the role of safe streets and the removal of 
fear from their lives."

 POLITICAL MONSTER: Vice President Al Gore dressed as Frankenstein at a

carrying a sign that said: Speaker of the House.

ELECTIONS; VOTERS TO SETTLE LAND BATTLE IN ARIZONA; PROPOSITION 300 HAS BECOME 
RALLYING POINT FOR THOSE WHO SEE GOVERNMENT REGULATORS AS A THREAT TO PROPERTY 
RIGHTS. ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY IT WILL HURT THE WILDERNESS, TAXPAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Election Day, the eyes of America's environmental movement will be on 
Arizona. And a good chunk of its money will be there too. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the nation's fastest-growing states, voters intent on protecting 
their private property from government regulators are squaring off against 
environmental activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 300 would direct Arizona state agencies to analyze how any new 
regulation would affect the value of private property and determine whether and 
how much citizens should be compensated for their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome is expected to reverberate powerfully in Washington and in 
statehouses across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition is one of dozens of "private property rights" measures 
springing up in states and gaining ground on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a crusade embraced only by libertarians and conservative constitutional 
scholars, private property rights has become the rallying cry for citizen 
backlash in an angry political year. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory in Arizona would boost the fledgling movement, as well as 
demonstrate how general voter unhappiness with government can be harnessed and 
converted to pursue a specific political goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of Proposition 300 argue that the measure would uphold a cherished 
constitutional principle: The government may not deprive citizens of private 
property without just compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for us to make the unaccountable government -- the bureaucracy -- 
responsible for what they do and how it affects private property and the 
business community," said Linda McClure, a spokeswoman for Arizonans for 
Private Property Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement is financed heavily by commercial developers, bankers and mining 
and timber industries, although its supporters include many small landowners 
who charge that they have been denied use of their property by laws and 
regulations intended to protect the environment, preserve historic sites and 
assure public health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists warn that Proposition 300 and similar measures will cost 
taxpayers dearly and erode the government's ability to protect the environment 
and public health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 It is "the single most important environmental referendum on the ballot this 
year," said Daniel J. Weiss, political director of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy Loyless, political director for the League of Conservation Voters, an 
advocacy group, said the measure is "a boondoggle and a scam" on Arizona 
voters. "This proposition will allow polluters to tell their communities, 'If 
you don't like what I want to do on my property, then pay me not to pollute, 
pay me not to locate here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Property-rights advocates have focused on two categories of national and state 
laws -- those preserving wetlands and those protecting the habitat of plants 
and animals considered in danger of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely without providing compensation to landowners, the federal Endangered 
Species Act and the Clean Water Act -- under which federal wetlands policy is 
administered -- have blocked activities ranging from logging to the 
construction of shopping malls and subdivisions on privately owned lands. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than a week to go, each side has taken to Arizona's airwaves with a 
vengeance. Polls sponsored last week by proponents showed the measure leading 
slightly, but nearly half of Arizona voters were still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arises at a time when the environmental movement has suffered a 
series of legislative defeats on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Many activists have concluded that the best chance of strengthening 
environmental protection now is through regulation -- a tortuous process by 
which federal agencies, not Congress, adopt new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that strategy could be thwarted if the private-property-rights movement 
begins racking up victories in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 House and Senate lawmakers already have proposed legislation that would go 
well beyond Arizona's proposition by requiring compensation for any federal 
regulation that would devalue a piece of land by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the new Congress arrives, we're going to find a much more friendly 
audience," predicted Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (D-La.), one of the House's most 
fiery advocates of such measures. "The momentum is growing." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides describe Proposition 300 as a fight between David and Goliath -- 
and each side claims to be the little guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, with both sides reporting their financial assets, backers of 
Proposition 300 had twice as much money on hand as those opposing the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Arizonans for Private Property Rights has raised $598,000 and 
attracted the attention of at least one national organization, the National 
Assn. of Realtors, which has contributed $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona Community Protection Committee, which is organizing the campaign 
against Proposition 300, reported Oct. 27 that it had raised $240,000.

Society.

JAPAN OKS PAYMENTS FOR A-BOMB VICTIMS; WORLD WAR II: AS MANY AS 280,000 PEOPLE 
MAY GET $1,000 EACH. THE MOVE IS A VICTORY FOR SOCIALISTS IN THE GOVERNING 
COALITION. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite Japan's refusal to pay individual foreigners for suffering during 
World War II, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's coalition Wednesday approved 
special payments of about $1,000 apiece for as many as 280,000 relatives of 
victims of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was reached by the ruling group's "war-end 50th anniversary 
special projects committee," consisting of members of Murayama's Socialist 
Party and its coalition partners, the Liberal Democratic Party and the New 
Party Harbinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Funeral rite payments," which will be made in the form of 100,000-yen ($1,042 
at the current exchange rate) bonds redeemable in two years, will be given to 
relatives of people who died between 1945 and 1969 as a result of the bombings 
and who themselves were exposed to the bomb blasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Kozo Igarashi estimated that as many as 280,000 people 
who hold government certificates verifying that they were in the two cities 
when the bombs were dropped will be eligible to receive the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1969, the government has made "funeral rite payments" for deaths only. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision marked the first time the Socialists' partners have yielded to 
them since the Socialists, once the perennial opposition, started joining 
coalition Cabinets in August, 1993. Murayama reportedly regarded approval of 
the payments as essential to convincing his own party of the benefits of 
belonging to a coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 During their 38 years of unilateral rule, the Liberal Democrats consistently 
opposed Socialist demands for the special compensation for fear of spurring 
demands from relatives of other Japanese who were killed during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, they yielded on the condition that a bill to be submitted to the 
current session of Parliament spell out the "double suffering" of losing a 
relative and being exposed to radiation as the reason for the measure. At the 
insistence of the Liberal Democrats, the Socialists dropped a demand to call 
the payments "state compensation" -- phrasing that LDP conservatives said would 
be tantamount to admitting that Japan was responsible for launching the war. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 31, Murayama announced that Japan will commit $1 billion over the next 
10 years to a "war contrition" program aimed at foreign countries that will 
include historical research on World War II by Japanese and foreign scholars 
and support of international programs for the advancement of women. 
</P>
<P>
 Igarashi at that time reiterated that no official payments will be made to 
foreign individuals but mentioned that the government might help establish a 
private fund of as much as $100 million for individual payments, especially to 
Asian women -- as many as 200,000 by unofficial estimates -- recruited as 
"comfort women" for Japanese troops during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 No new moves to compensate foreigners have been reported since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Wednesday that Koreans certified to have been in Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki when the bombs were dropped and who lost a relative in the bombings or 
because of illnesses from radiation between 1945 and 1969 will be eligible for 
the new payments.

NEWSPAPER URGES CHANGES IN JAPAN'S CONSTITUTION; ASIA: THE STEP BREAKS A TABOO 
ON ADVOCATING REVISIONS. NUCLEAR WEAPONS WOULD BE EXPLICITLY BANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's largest newspaper today broke a 48-year taboo by urging a sweeping 
revision of the nation's postwar constitution that would formally ban Japan 
from possessing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Not once since the constitution was promulgated in 1946 during the U.S. 
occupation has any general newspaper advocated specific proposals for 
constitutional revision. The press has long avoided the issue, for fear that 
changes in the charter's "no war" provisions might open the door to Japan again 
becoming a military giant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yomiuri newspaper, with a nationwide circulation of 10 million, proposed 
amending the controversial Article 9, which bans the establishment of armed 
forces, to allow the nation to possess troops "to secure its peace and 
independence." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, political interpretations of the ban have caused ceaseless 
controversy over the constitutionality of Japan's 239,000-strong Self Defense 
Forces. Only in August did Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's Socialist Party 
recognize the Self Defense Forces as constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yomiuri's proposed amendment would retain a declaration that "the Japanese 
people shall never recognize war as a sovereign right of the nation and the 
threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes." The 
proposal also goes further than post-World War II Japanese politicians ever 
have in committing Japan to an eternal non-nuclear defense policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeking to eliminate from the world inhuman and indiscriminate weapons of 
mass destruction, Japan shall not manufacture, possess or use such weapons," 
states the Yomiuri's proposed "no war" provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Japan has pledged, but only as a political policy, not to 
manufacture, possess or allow the introduction into its territory of nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans continually argue that Japan would build nuclear weapons if North 
Korea constructed a nuclear arsenal, and refuse to believe Japanese who say 
Japan will not go nuclear under any circumstance," said a Yomiuri editor who 
asked not to be named. "This provision should end that argument." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ban on "inhuman and indiscriminate weapons" includes nuclear, 
chemical and biological armaments and any such weapons that might be created in 
the future, the Yomiuri explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The new "no war" provision also would forbid the state to conscript citizens 
for service in the armed forces, making permanent Japan's current practice of 
voluntary military service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yomiuri's proposed charter would authorize the state to dispatch both 
civilians and troops overseas, but only for humanitarian and peacekeeping 
missions approved by "internationally recognized institutions" such as the 
United Nations. The provision is intended to end "one-nation pacifism, a 
self-centered mentality involving a desire for peace for Japan and indifference 
to the fate of the rest of the world," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented move after two years of internal debate by Japan's largest 
newspaper is certain to stir a new constitutional debate. 
</P>
<P>
 With amendments requiring approval by two-thirds of the members of Parliament 
as well as a majority of voters in a referendum, chances of changing the basic 
charter in the near future appear remote. However, the Yomiuri reported in 
April that 50.4% of people surveyed in an opinion poll that it carried out 
supported constitutional revision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yomiuri's proposals also call for the establishment of a constitutional 
court, relieving the Supreme Court of its seldom-used power to rule on issues 
of constitutionality, as well as greater powers for the upper house of 
Parliament. A new human right -- the right to privacy -- also was proposed.

U.S. REJECTS CHRISTOPHER VISIT TO VIETNAM; DIPLOMACY: SECRETARY OF STATE 
DEPARTS MONDAY ON AN 11-DAY TRIP TO ASIA. HE CITES NEED FOR MORE POW-MIA 
PROGRESS WITH HANOI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration considered having Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher make a groundbreaking visit to Vietnam while traveling through Asia 
this month but decided that the time still was not right, Christopher disclosed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although leaders of other countries, such as Japan and France, have visited 
Vietnam, no top-level American official has been to Hanoi since before the 
Vietnam War. The Administration partially lifted the longstanding trade embargo 
against Vietnam in February but balked at having Christopher stop in Hanoi for 
what would be a major new step in relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've concluded that the situation isn't quite ready for me to stop in 
Vietnam. I think for a secretary of state to go there . . . I think we have to 
see some more progress on the MIA and POW issue," said Christopher, referring 
to the search for Americans missing in action during the Vietnam War. "The time 
will come, but it's not here yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary also said relations with China have not improved enough for 
President Clinton to travel there, despite China's persistent lobbying for a 
presidential visit. "I think the relationship will have to develop in a more 
positive way before the President is prepared to go," he said. "I hope it will 
develop in that manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam remains a politically sensitive subject for the Administration, both 
because of the MIA issue and because of Clinton's successful effort to avoid 
military service during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher made his remarks in a breakfast session at The Times' Washington 
Bureau, during which he also made these points: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Administration hopes to talk about "preservation of democracy" with 
Latin American leaders at a "Summit of the Americas" in Miami next month. "I 
hope what we did in Haiti would be a lesson to coup plotters that they cannot 
lightly overthrow a duly elected president," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the Administration's top priorities in foreign policy next year will 
be to work on new ways of bringing together Western and Eastern Europe. "One of 
President Clinton's dreams is to have an integrated Europe with no dividing 
lines," Christopher said. "Nothing like the Warsaw Pact line, nothing like the 
Berlin Wall in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher strongly denied a report, published in Wednesday's New York Times, 
that Arab governments are refusing to back the Administration's proposal for a 
Middle East development bank. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the American plan has been to have Arab governments agree in principle 
to the idea of such a bank, and then have experts iron out the details. "It's 
fairly clear to me that the bank will evolve after negotiations over the next 
six months," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher is preparing to leave Monday on an 11-day trip to Asia that will 
take him to South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. Over the last 
few weeks, State Department officials had quietly considered whether to have 
him stop in Vietnam as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech last week, Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East 
Asia, disclosed that the United States and Vietnam are now very close to 
settling outstanding financial claims against each another -- a step that will 
clear the way for the two governments to open diplomatic liaison offices in 
Washington and Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 During his Asia trip, Christopher said, he plans to raise human rights issues 
"as I always do in the capitals where that's appropriate. Certainly that will 
include Indonesia." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, American labor organizations repeatedly have criticized 
Indonesia for its restrictions on workers' rights. In addition, human rights 
groups have complained about the Indonesian government's recent decision to 
close down three weekly news publications.

 NASA fretted over the weather more than 4,000 miles away Wednesday night while 
preparing space shuttle Atlantis for launch today on an ozone-mapping mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantis was scheduled to blast off at 8:56 a.m. PST. Good weather was 
expected at the space center, but clouds and high wind were forecast for the 
emergency landing sites in Spain and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA cannot launch Atlantis unless at least one emergency landing site has 
acceptable weather. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the fifth shuttle mission this year and the third in a row that 
is part of NASA's program to understand such environmental changes as ozone 
depletion and global warming.

ARISTIDE PAYS BRIEF TRIBUTE TO SLAIN SUPPORTERS; HAITI: U.S. TROOPS STAND GUARD 
AS PRESIDENT VENTURES OUT TO TWO CHURCHES AND A CEMETERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. combat troops took up sniper positions atop tombs Wednesday to guard 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide as the former exile ventured out for a rare 
public visit -- kneeling at a cemetery and two churches to pray for Haitian 
priests, politicians and thousands of others who died for him and his 
democratic cause under three years of military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Buglers played taps as Aristide touched foreheads with fellow priests, hugged 
an orphan he once adopted and waved to adoring throngs during three brief 
appearances before being whisked back to the Presidential Palace by scores of 
U.S. Army escorts in battle gear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roman Catholic priest-turned-politician then ended the final day of a 
marathon holiday festival for the dead with a dinner at his suburban villa for 
President Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake. U.S. officials 
said Lake's two-day visit here is aimed partly at urging Aristide to speed up 
efforts to rebuild the nation's democratic institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake also visited U.S. Army troops in the northern town of Cap Haitien and a 
Special Forces unit in the rural town of Grande Riviere du Nord, to help shore 
up military morale in the prolonged mission dubbed Uphold Democracy. Today Lake 
is due to meet Haitian business, religious and political leaders, among them 
Smarck Michel, Aristide's nominee for prime minister whose appointment has been 
before the nation's plodding Parliament for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior U.S. officials said Lake plans to tell Haitian leaders of the Clinton 
Administration's concerns about delays in crucial parliamentary and local 
elections. Originally scheduled for December, voting for more than 2,000 
national and local offices may not take place until February or March, and the 
Administration has vowed to keep the U.S. intervention force in Haiti until 
after those elections are held. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials in Haiti sought to temper any appearance of urgency in 
Lake's visit, stressing that Aristide has won high marks for his earnest, 
though time-consuming, process of institution-building and neutralizing Haiti's 
armed and angry political right. 
</P>
<P>
 "What appears to be a slow process is also a careful process," said U.S. 
Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager. "President Aristide is reaching out to a 
lot of people. He's working the phones, and talking to many former enemies. 
It's better than rushing into something." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Aristide did reach out on Wednesday, and seemingly in many directions 
at once. 
</P>
<P>
 With U.S. Army snipers posted on rooftops surrounding the capital's Sacre 
Coeur Church, Aristide stood at attention with eyes shut tight for half a 
minute. Then he knelt and touched the base of a towering gray cross, near the 
spot where his campaign financier and Haiti's former justice minister were 
gunned down in separate incidents by military agents last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He laid a wreath of yellow zinnias dedicated to the memory of the two. Antoine 
Izmery had helped finance Aristide's successful 1990 run for the presidency. He 
was raked with gunfire just outside Sacre Coeur's front gate following a 
protest Mass a year ago. Justice Minister Guy Malary was executed soon after in 
similar gangland fashion as he drove past the church en route to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide hugged the church's vicar, the Rev. Launay Saturne, who described 
Aristide's brief visit as "an expression of solidarity for those who fought for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 As American combat officers barked orders and shooed adoring Haitians from 
surrounding streets, Aristide barely managed to stop on his way out to embrace 
Waldeck Janvier, an orphan he adopted nearly 20 years before and raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his final appearance at Port-au-Prince's main cemetery, where U.S. 
military escorts briefly broke up Wednesday's traditional voodoo party for the 
dead, Aristide paid a solemn visit to the Montfortain Fathers compound, which 
includes the orphanage where Janvier grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Aristide knelt and touched the blue-tiled tomb of Father Jean-Marie 
Vincent, a priest who once saved Aristide from machete-wielding assassins. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 28, Vincent was gunned down just outside the compound. His murder 
fueled the Administration's decision to send 20,000 troops to restore Aristide 
in Haiti. More on Haiti

ISRAELIS WORRY ARMY'S FIGHTING SPIRIT IS BROKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Israel's progress toward making peace with neighboring Arab states 
undermining its army's fighting spirit? 
</P>
<P>
 That question is being fiercely debated this week in the nation's newspapers, 
on its airwaves and in the halls of Parliament, after a unit of soldiers from 
the Givati infantry brigade failed to defend their south Lebanon outpost 
aggressively against an attack by Lebanese guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The disgrace" is what Israeli newspapers are terming the incident, which 
occurred Saturday morning in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in south 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that . . . soldiers avoided risking their lives will be explained by 
local failure and by objective difficulties," wrote commentator Yaron London in 
the mass-circulation newspaper Yediot Aharonot. "Perhaps this is so, but it is 
also possible that the fighting spirit has been broken. The fighting spirit has 
been broken because nobody wants to be the last war victim, and many feel that 
the war of one hundred years is about to end." 
</P>
<P>
 To an outsider, Israelis may seem to be making much of a relatively small 
incident involving only a handful of soldiers. Only five soldiers and two 
officers have been charged with improper conduct. The Hezbollah guerrillas did 
not overrun the position and inflicted only three casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 But the anxiety infusing the public discussion here says much about the 
nation's collective fears as it moves into the unknown realm of peacemaking. 
Labor Party leaders may rejoice at what they say is the ending of the Arab 
siege, but many Israelis are frightened by the changing contours of a conflict 
that has defined the nation since its birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is changing and changing very rapidly, and people don't know what 
it means," said Avishai Margalit, a professor of philosophy at Hebrew 
University. "People are told that the change is for the better, but from time 
to time there are setbacks, and people don't know how to react." 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli reaction to the south Lebanon incident, Margalit said, "contains a 
rational element and a hysterical element. The rational element is that we are 
in an in-between period -- we are signing peace agreements, and yet there are 
still active conflicts. People fear that soldiers may feel that there is no 
longer a need for sacrifice, bravery, courage." 
</P>
<P>
 The hysterical element, Margalit said, is generalizing from one isolated 
incident "to the performance of the entire army. The army is not falling 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
 "We mustn't close our eyes and deny what happened," said Gen. Yoram Yair, head 
of the army personnel branch, "but we absolutely must not lose proportion, 
because the results (of this incident) will be reversed. We want to make it 
singularly clear that this is not behavior characteristic of IDF (Israeli 
Defense Forces) soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident's impact was magnified by the fact that Hezbollah videotaped its 
assault on the unit. A hand-held camera captured a Hezbollah guerrilla planting 
the organization's flag triumphantly on the perimeter of the army position, in 
the eastern sector of the security zone. As the incident mushroomed into a 
scandal this week, Israel Television repeatedly showed the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, senior army officers and politicians gave an accounting of the 
incident before committees of the Knesset, Israel's Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief of the General Staff Ehud Barak told army radio that "this was an 
important achievement for Hezbollah, and something that shouldn't have 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said any clash that fails to inflict heavy losses 
on the enemy is "a failure, to put it mildly." But Rabin said the incident had 
to be seen in the context of a recent upsurge of attacks by Hezbollah on army 
units in the security zone. Israeli officials said privately this week that 
they believe Hezbollah is acting on instructions from Syria, stepping up 
attacks in the zone to drive home the point to Israel that Syria must not be 
left out of the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, two soldiers involved in the incident had been court-martialed 
and sentenced to monthlong military jail terms. Five more soldiers, including 
two officers, also will stand trial before military courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Military investigators said guerrillas from Hezbollah, a militant Lebanese 
Islamic organization, first shelled and then tried to storm the army outpost. 
Three soldiers on the perimeter abandoned their posts, falling back to join 
their comrades. That allowed the guerrillas to get close enough to plant their 
flag, wound two soldiers and kill another. The post then fought off the 
attackers, but it failed to pursue them or inflict any casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the army's northern command transferred all the soldiers from 
the post to other positions, but it left the post in the hands of Givati -- 
which has about 1,200 soldiers serving in the security zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernand Klein, mother of Almog Klein, the army sergeant killed in the attack, 
has spoken out in defense of the soldiers at the post. 
</P>
<P>
 "These soldiers loved each other so much that no one could believe that 
someone would leave them to be killed," Klein told reporters Tuesday. She 
insisted that the soldiers were abandoned by other army units that could have 
come to their aid and that they were suffering from fatigue after serving three 
months in south Lebanon.

CAR BOMB IN GAZA KILLS A LEADER OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A booby-trap car bomb killed a leader of an extremist Islamic faction 
Wednesday, and armed supporters poured into the streets vowing vengeance 
against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion, the first 
such incident in Gaza since Palestinian self-rule began in May. 
</P>
<P>
 But a top Islamic militant spiritual leader blamed Israel for the blast, 
pointing to a threat by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to hunt down military 
leaders of the Muslim movement after a deadly bus bomb in Tel Aviv last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hani Abed, 35, died hours after a bomb exploded in the trunk of his car when 
he opened it in front of a college where he taught engineering in Khan Yunis.

SEVEN MORE GENETICALLY ALTERED FOODS PASS FDA'S SAFETY TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven more genetically engineered foods have passed a voluntary safety 
inspection, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday, but scientists 
questioned whether the FDA is scrutinizing such foods closely enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a little troubled," Dr. Marion Nestle, an FDA adviser from New York 
University, told the agency. "It's as if FDA scientists have accepted these 
very complicated (safety) assessments on face value." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new foods is a potato produced by Monsanto that naturally resists 
the Colorado potato beetle. The potato produces a natural pesticide that kills 
beetles that take a bite. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA last spring approved the nation's first biotech food, Calgene Inc.'s 
Flavr-Savr tomato, which has a gene that allows it to ripen longer on the vine 
and still get to supermarkets without turning soft. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the agency has completed much more cursory safety inspections of the 
potato and six other genetically altered plants, FDA food safety chief Dr. Jim 
Maryanski said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also approved were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Three more tomatoes, one that works like the Flavr-Savr and two with altered 
genes that slow the tomatoes' natural ripening, so they can be picked earlier 
and reach optimal ripeness by the time they hit store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 * A squash genetically altered to resist two deadly viruses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cotton that tolerates a common herbicide, bromoxynil, so farmers could use 
the herbicide. The cotton is intended to produce cottonseed oil for animal 
feed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Soybean plants that tolerate the herbicide glyphosate. Although the FDA said 
the plant will be used for animal feed, soybeans and soybean oil are consumed 
by people. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA is preparing to mandate that it be notified before any genetically 
engineered food is marketed. That will give the agency a chance to decide what 
kind of safety review each needs. "We simply don't have the resources to give 
every plant that intensive review, and we don't see the public health need," 
Maryanski said. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists warned that these foods must be watched closely to ensure that 
people with allergies aren't put in danger if, for instance, a nut protein is 
put into soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentalists were also concerned, Reuters reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Rifkin, head of the Pure Food Campaign, a group opposed to the genetic 
engineering of food, said: "When you release a genetically engineered plant 
into the environment, the organisms are alive -- they can reproduce, they can 
mutate and you cannot recall them to the laboratory."

NAACP SEEKS CONTRIBUTIONS TO RETIRE DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NAACP called on organization leaders, members and corporate backers 
Wednesday to contribute to a massive fund drive to retire its $3.8-million debt 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement, by Interim Senior Administrator Earl H. Shinhoster, came two 
days after the financially troubled civil rights organization furloughed 88 of 
its paid staff for at least two weeks because it said it could not meet its 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The "austerity plan" announced by Shinhoster is the latest move by the 
85-year-old NAACP to shore up a reputation tarnished by its financial crisis 
and the firing of Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. on Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinhoster said the plan devised by the NAACP leadership was designed to raise 
$93,000 per day to "generate sufficient dollars to retire our debt by the end 
of Dec. 31, 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 The NAACP leadership will ask every member of the National Board of Directors 
and Special Contribution Fund Trustees to contribute at least $5,000, 
Shinhoster said. The organization's 2,208 local branch offices and other groups 
will be asked to contribute $1,000 apiece, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 He said 22 corporate sponsors who cut funding to the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People this year will be asked to resume contributions, 
and "appeals will be made to African American entrepreneurs, athletes and 
entertainers."

GALAXY DISCOVERED BEHIND MILKY WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Astronomers have discovered a galaxy virtually in their own back yard, hidden 
behind the fuzzy streak the ancient Greeks dubbed the Milky Way. 
</P>
<P>
 The galaxy is 10 million light-years away in the direction of the 
constellation Cassiopeia, said researcher Ofer Lahav of the Institute of 
Astronomy at Cambridge University in England. 
</P>
<P>
 With astronomers spending so much effort looking at the far reaches of the 
universe, "it's kind of remarkable that still there is a big galaxy like this 
one hidden just behind our own Milky Way," Lahav said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lahav and colleagues report in today's issue of the journal Nature that they 
detected the galaxy by its radio wave emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lahav said it contains about one-third the mass of the Milky Way galaxy, which 
includes Earth.

CHRISTIAN COALITION ACCUSED OF GOP SLANT IN VOTER GUIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Christian Coalition will distribute 33 million election guides to voters 
this weekend, but Democrats are accusing the group of distorting the party's 
views in an effort to help Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of guides shows that in the overwhelming majority of cases, it is 
the Republican candidate whose views are most in line with those espoused by 
the coalition, the offspring of religious broadcaster Pat Robertson's 1988 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But coalition leaders vehemently deny picking sides -- which would violate the 
organization's tax-exempt status -- and say records are meticulously researched 
and the choices left to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the rules, and we play by them," coalition spokesman Mike Russell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The voting guides are usually shipped to state chapters in mid-October, but 
the national headquarters has ordered that they not be distributed to churches 
and Christian bookstores until the Sunday before Election Day. One reason is 
that the guides are viewed as a timely reminder to vote. But another is that 
Christian Coalition leaders worry about candidate complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to hold it until that last Sunday because, if they start raising 
doubts about the voter guide, you're going to have a real skittish pastor that 
is just going to pull them," Christian Coalition voter education director Chuck 
Cunningham told a September coalition strategy session with state affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the guides have been seen by candidates in advance, there already are 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oklahoma, for example, Democratic House candidate Stuart Price says the 
guide is full of "mistruths" about his views on abortion, school prayer and 
homosexuality, and he has urged Tulsa churches not to distribute it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic candidates for governor and lieutenant governor in South 
Carolina, one of the Christian Coalition's strongest states, have complained 
that their views on abortion are distorted. School board candidates in New 
Hampshire have criticized the guides as inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russell said: "What we routinely see is, candidates who refuse to answer 
our survey start complaining that we are putting their record out there for 
people to judge."

SEVERAL INCUMBENTS APPEAR TO BE COASTING TO VICTORIES; POLITICS: SOME GOVERNORS 
AND BLACK LAWMAKERS SEEM TO BE ESCAPING ANGER AT CURRENT OFFICEHOLDERS. BUSH 
BROTHERS ARE IN TROUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the midterm elections only six days away, the brightening outlook for 
gubernatorial and black congressional incumbents seems to be turning the 
pundits' conventional wisdom about trouble for current officeholders on its 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of former President George Bush's sons, who were poised for upsets over 
incumbents a few weeks ago, appear to be yielding ground in their gubernatorial 
bids in Texas and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 And a survey of polls from around the country Wednesday suggested that more 
than a dozen governors and every black Democrat running for reelection in 
Congress are on their way to easy victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one truism was consistently being proven. In the final hours, candidates 
in both parties unleashed an array of negative ads that were strikingly harsh, 
even in a campaign season noted for contentiousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news for the Bush brothers came in two forms. In Texas, where George 
W. Bush is challenging Democratic Gov. Ann Richards, a new poll released 
Wednesday revealed that Richards had climbed into a slight lead by last 
weekend, even before former independent presidential candidate Ross Perot 
endorsed her Tuesday. Experts said the Perot endorsement, one of the few he has 
given to a Democrat this year, could mean a further boost. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, by the Houston Post and KHOU-TV in Houston, found Richards leading, 
47% to 44%. She was gaining particularly among previously undecided voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were also looking up for Democratic Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles, who was 
receiving positive press reviews Wednesday after his latest debate with real 
estate magnate Jeb Bush, the former President's younger son. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miami Herald said Chiles had put on his best performance while putting his 
opponent on the defensive in the debate, particularly when the governor 
criticized the young Republican for an ad that featured the mother of a murder 
victim who accuses Chiles of being too soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles, calling the ad demagoguery, likened it to the notorious Willie Horton 
ad that helped Bush's father win the 1988 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bush accused Chiles of being an "old liberal," Chiles answered with a 
Southern aphorism that seemed to befuddle the Texas-bred Republican. "The 
old-he-coon walks just before the light of day," Chiles said, a suggestion that 
the toughest raccoon best protects his brood from predators. Bush turned his 
palms up and offered an expression of mystification. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush appeared to be running away with the campaign a few weeks ago but has 
slowly lost ground, and the race now generally is viewed as a dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
 In other governors' races, a review of polls shows that six Democrats and 
seven Republicans appear to be coasting to reelection victories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican count includes five Midwesterners -- George V. Voinovich in 
Ohio, Tommy G. Thompson in Wisconsin, Jim Edgar in Illinois, Arne Carlson in 
Minnesota and John Engler in Michigan -- and two New Englanders, William F. 
Weld in Massachusetts and Steve Merrill in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic governors who appear virtually assured of reelection include 
Roy Romer in Colorado, Ben Nelson in Nebraska, Robert Miller in Nevada, Jim Guy 
Tucker in Arkansas, Jim Folsom in Alabama and Howard Dean in Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, there are 21 incumbent governors up for reelection, and in most of 
the races where the sitting executives are not clearly ahead, the races are too 
close to call. In New York, however, a new poll Wednesday showed New York Gov. 
Mario M. Cuomo ahead of George Pataki, his Republican opponent, by 15 
percentage points. A week ago, Cuomo was trailing in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 In Congress, polls indicate that every black Democratic incumbent standing for 
reelection should win. That is partly a reflection of the 1992 redistricting 
that was designed to encourage more minority representation in Congress by 
creating safer minority seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are 38 black members of the House (two lost in primaries, one 
is Republican and one is now running for the Senate). 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the only black House incumbent who has a close race, according to 
polls, is a Republican, Gary Franks of Connecticut, who is running against 
Democrat James Maloney. 
</P>
<P>
 This week has also seen what even Democrats are calling the most vicious 
negative ad of the season. Democratic Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey 
has a new ad that attacks Republican opponent Chuck Haytaian because of the 
people who support him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pro-Life extremists. The national gun lobby. A racist (radio talk show host). 
They're all supporting Chuck Haytaian," a throaty narrator says over a 
soundtrack of frightening music. "Should you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lautenberg is ahead in the polls.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; INSIDE THE ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GOVERNOR 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson released two new television commercials Wednesday. Here is 
the text of the ads with analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: "They are as different as two people can be. On crime, Pete Wilson 
was the force behind the tough new "three strikes" and "one strike" laws. And 
he has enforced the death penalty. . . . Brown opposes the death penalty, is 
supported by criminal defense lawyers, and will appoint more lenient judges. . 
. . Wilson pushed through tax incentives and cut red tape to keep business and 
jobs in California. . . . Brown has a plan that will increase taxes and drive 
jobs out of California." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Although Wilson played a key role in the passage of the "three 
strikes" sentencing measure and signed the bill, the force behind it was Mike 
Reynolds, whose daughter was killed by an ex-convict. Brown personally opposes 
the death penalty but has said she will see that it is carried out if she is 
elected and will appoint judges who believe in capital punishment. Wilson 
signed a record $7-billion tax increase in 1991. Two years later, he pushed for 
tax breaks for business totaling about $500 million, including a sales tax 
exemption for the purchase of new manufacturing equipment. Though his 
Administration has tried to coordinate government programs to help businesses 
stay in California, the state has lost about half a million jobs since Wilson 
took office. The only tax increase in Brown's plan is a 15% excise tax on the 
sale of ammunition. There is no evidence her plan would drive out jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: "Kathleen Brown supports continuing state services to illegals even 
though it costs taxpayers over $2 billion a year. Another reason we need Pete 
Wilson as governor." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: The only major service on which the two candidates disagree is 
public education. Brown says it would be unwise to expel illegal immigrants 
from the public schools because the state then would have to deal with 300,000 
idle children. Brown, like Wilson, believes the federal government should pay 
for all the state's cost of serving illegal immigrants. TREASURER 
</P>
<P>
 The two major party candidates in the race for state treasurer are expecting 
television ads now running to be the deciding factor in their contest. Until 
last weekend, Republican Matt Fong, a member of the State Board of 
Equalization, and Democrat Phil Angelides, a developer, had aired only positive 
ads. But Sunday, Phil Angelides came out with the campaign's first negative 
commercial, a 30-second spot depicting Fong as a wasteful spender who whiles 
away his working days as a public official playing golf. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: Photographed in a shaky, spontaneous-looking camera style, the 
commercial opens with a shot into Fong's Board of Equalization office. As an 
announcer intones: "There are things candidate for treasurer Matt Fong doesn't 
want you to see," a hand covers the lens of the camera. "Matt Fong spent over 
$5 million for his new government offices and the building owners gave him free 
office space for his political campaign," the announcer says. Repeatedly using 
the hand-over-lens device, the ad goes on to say that Fong "gets a government 
expense account, drives a free car and is out golfing during working hours." It 
closes by noting that during Fong's tenure, the board's budget increased $42 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Fong, who was appointed to the five-member tax board in 1991, 
did select a new office in a City of Industry complex managed by Majestic 
Realty Co. The state Department of General Services negotiated a $300,000 -- 
not a $5-million -- contract to rent the office. The same month the rental 
contract was signed, Majestic Realty began providing Fong free office space for 
his campaign. In 1994, the General Services Agency sought competitive bids for 
a new regional Board of Equalization office and awarded a $5-million rental 
contract to the low bidder -- at the same location and to the same interests as 
those providing Fong free office space. However, department records indicate 
that Fong had no role in the selection of that site or the awarding of the 
contract. Like many officials holding high state offices, Fong is provided 
travel expenses and a car. He did show on his financial reports that he 
accepted free golf games on seven occasions, but says that on the days that he 
played during working hours, he took vacation time. The board's budget is 
established by the Legislature, which has in recent years provided more money 
to the agency to hire more auditors to catch tax cheats. PROPOSITION 186 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides of the campaign over Proposition 186, the single-payer health care 
initiative, have been using television ads statewide. The initiative would, if 
fully implemented, create a state-run health insurance system designed to 
replace the current one based on private insurance. Money raised in part by tax 
increases would be used to dispense more than $100 billion in health benefits 
annually to more than 30 million Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ADS "FOR": One 30-second spot features representatives from the 
California Nurses Assn., Consumers Union, the California branch of the American 
Assn. of Retired Persons and the California League of Women Voters. Each 
speaks, and as the ad runs, their voices and images dissolve into each other. 
The ad tells viewers, "Proposition 186 will give each of us complete health 
care that can never be taken away." It goes on to say, "It was put on the 
ballot by a million Californians," and, "The insurance companies are spending 
millions of dollars to kill 186." Another ad involves a series of images of 
children, one in a wheelchair, two in a sandbox, others in various forms of 
play. The announcer asks, "What will happen to our children?" and mentions the 
possibility of their losing medical insurance, making the statement: "We are 
all at risk" and repeats the statement about insurance companies trying to kill 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * ANALYSIS: Sponsors of the initiative say they chose to present nurses as 
supporters because nurses are trusted more than insurance companies. With 
roughly 80% of Californians now holding health insurance, supporters want to 
persuade voters that their plan is better. The California Nurses Assn. 
represents about 25,000 nurses, roughly 10% of all California nurses. Though 
the California branch of AARP endorses the measure, organizations representing 
retirees from Los Angeles County and state governments oppose the initiative, 
contending their members would lose benefits if it passes. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ADS "AGAINST": One ad shows a politician with two aides nearby. An 
announcer says that the initiative would give an "elected politician" the right 
to ration health care with the statement, "Medical decisions made by a 
politician . . . for political reasons." A female aide says, "We're out of 
money . . . we have to cut something or raise taxes." The male aide, holding up 
a polling chart, responds: "Hip transplants . . . only lose a few thousand 
votes there. . . ." Another ad shows a woman with her family in a park. She 
says, "Like most families, we support health care reform. But we can't support 
this Proposition 186." She goes on to say the initiative "would take away our 
private coverage and force us into a government-run system headed by an elected 
politician." She also expresses alarm over the prospects that her California 
income tax "would nearly double." At the end of the ad, opponents of the 
initiative are cited that include business and taxpayer groups as well as the 
Organization of Nurse Executives/California. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Though the new system would be headed by an elected 
officeholder, medical decisions, such as those on hip replacements, would be 
expressly left with physicians. The initiative would not "take away" private 
coverage and, in fact, the statement in the ad contradicts what opponents have 
said elsewhere. Although the initiative would impose tax increases, the ad 
neglects to say that taxpayers would be relieved of health insurance premium 
payments and a substantial amount of out-of-pocket medical expenses. One study 
said that the average Californian would save $550 annually on health care, even 
with the new taxes. The organization of nurses represents 1,100 nurses who 
perform administrative duties.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; IN THE SENATOR'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington and rival Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
released new television commercials this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE HUFFINGTON AD: The candidate is featured walking through a tree-filled 
setting as he talks. "There are two reasons why I invested my own money in this 
race," Huffington says, speaking to the camera as soft music plays. "Special 
interest cash buys votes in Congress. And career politicians are destroying 
this country." Huffington then contrasts himself with Feinstein. "The basic 
difference between Mrs. Feinstein and me is that I believe in less government. 
She believes in more government, higher spending and higher taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: The ad focuses on a primary theme of the Huffington campaign 
-- that the candidates have sharp, philosophical differences on the role of 
government and lawmakers. Huffington contends that Feinstein supports higher 
taxes because she voted for President Clinton's 1993 economic package. He has 
voted against many of the appropriations bills that come before Congress, 
charging that they contain too much spending. Huffington said he is also 
independent of special interests because he is financing his own campaign while 
Feinstein has raised money from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE FEINSTEIN AD: The ad lists a number of California law enforcement 
organizations that have endorsed Feinstein. A narrator says: "Every California 
law enforcement organization endorses Feinstein, even those that endorse Gov. 
Wilson. None endorse Huffington." The ad then notes some of Feinstein's 
anti-crime positions -- her sponsorship of the federal assault weapons ban, a 
bill to keep guns out of schools and her commitment to only support judges who 
favor the death penalty. Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block is also 
featured: "Although I'm a registered Republican, I'm pleased and proud to join 
with other members of law enforcement in endorsing Sen. Feinstein for her 
reelection." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Feinstein has been endorsed by 16 California police 
organizations. Many supported her opponents in previous races. Huffington's 
campaign charged that the ad is wrong, however, noting that one police group, 
the Assn. of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, has endorsed the Republican. In part, 
the one-sided support is because of Feinstein's strong support of the federal 
crime bill that passed this year. Huffington cast a vote that was criticized by 
law enforcement groups who believed it might jeopardize the bill.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 185; MEASURE'S FOES PRESS FOR CONVINCING 
LOSS; OPPONENTS WANT TO DISCOURAGE PROMOTERS OF BELEAGUERED GAS TAX INITIATIVE 
FROM SIMILAR FUTURE EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Like a football coach who deliberately runs up a score to humiliate the 
opposition, the opponents of Proposition 185, a proposal for a new tax on 
gasoline, are not just trying to make the measure lose -- they want it to lose 
big. 
</P>
<P>
 So at a time when internal polls on both sides show the measure in serious 
trouble, the opposition is still turning up the heat, churning out news 
releases and media mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition leaders acknowledge that the heavy assault is part of a deliberate 
strategy to make Proposition 185 lose so badly that its promoters will be 
discouraged from ever proposing such an initiative again. 
</P>
<P>
 They have selected as the prime target not the initiative itself, but its 
promoters, the Planning and Conservation League, a veteran environmental group 
that has sponsored four initiatives in the past. Proposition 185, its fifth and 
latest initiative, would impose a new 4% sales tax on gasoline and use the 
revenue to finance a massive rebuilding of California's urban and intercity 
rail system -- necessary, proponents say, to reduce air pollution and other 
environmental damage by getting people out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opposition campaign is hammering less at those fundamental issues than 
at the league's acceptance of hundreds of thousands of dollars from two 
corporations that would benefit from the measure: railroad giant Southern 
Pacific and a rolling stock manufacturer, Morrison Knudsen Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 78 pages of provisions, the initiative specifically allocates up to 
$200 million for the purchase of railroad right of way along a coastal route 
stretching from Gilroy to the Los Angeles County line. That right of way is 
owned by Southern Pacific, which has contributed $489,000 to the campaign to 
pass Proposition 185. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the initiative requires the California Department of Transportation 
to use the new tax revenues to purchase rail cars under an existing contract. 
The contract is with Morrison Knudsen, manufacturer of the California car, a 
rail car specifically designed for the state. Morrison Knudsen, which was 
recently penalized $80,000 for late delivery of the car, contributed $150,000 
to the Proposition 185 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in recent days Southern Pacific and Morrison-Knudsen said they have 
stopped giving contributions. Internal polls show the measure so far behind, 
they said, that it would be fruitless to give more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald H. Meral, the scholarly zoologist who has headed the league since 1983 
and masterminded its initiatives, said he is mystified that the contributions 
are even an issue although they have provided nearly 75% of the funding for his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the face of it, why is that bad?" he asks. "If the initiative as it stands 
is good for the public, then if it does benefit a large donor what's wrong with 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the bleak prospects for passage, the league persists with the 
campaign. "We're not giving up, but we're worried," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry McCarthy, president of the California Taxpayers Assn. and a leader of 
the No on 185 campaign, said it is a chief aim of many in his camp to end once 
and for all what he calls the league's "initiative industry." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a concern on the part of our organization about PCL," McCarthy said, 
"and some of what they've tried to do with the initiative process. . . . There 
is a real concern that if this thing is not repudiated by voters, we'll see 
more of it." 
</P>
<P>
 To promote its message, the opposition distributes brochures entitled "Should 
California Taxpayers Pay $700 million More in Taxes to Pay for Sweetheart 
Deals?" News releases carry comments from prominent business people and 
politicians. "We must send a clear message that it's unacceptable for the 
promoters of Proposition 185 to . . . (turn) the initiative process into 'Let's 
Make a Deal,' " says one release quoting Senate Transportation Committee 
Chairman Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp and his counterpart in the Assembly, Transportation Committee Chairman 
Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), have given added weight to the opposition campaign by 
becoming its most frequent spokesmen. They charge that the league includes 
certain projects in its initiatives not because they are meritorious but 
because their promoters believe that they will attract large contributions from 
rich corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a large extent I think what's happening here is PCL has figured out a way 
to pay for their overhead by running these initiative campaigns where they get 
special interests to pony up big bucks in return for getting projects funded," 
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that earlier this year the league proposed a $2-billion parks bond 
issue -- defeated by voters in June -- that attracted large contributions from 
landholders whose property was designated for purchase if the measure passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the league does consult a wide range of interests in the writing of 
initiatives, including some that eventually contribute, Meral said 
contributions play no role in the design of its measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that businesses . . . are motivated to support something that 
happens to be in the public interest and is also in their business interest is 
a happy coincidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization pays itself to run some of its campaigns, he said, but the 
amounts are small. Financial reports show that since mid-1993, the Planning and 
Conservation League has paid itself about $129,000 out of campaign funds for 
expenses and staff work. 
</P>
<P>
 R.F. Starzel, vice chairman of Southern Pacific Lines, said the environmental 
group is being attacked because it has chosen to go around the Legislature to 
make public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Lawmakers) are infuriated at the notion that their little privy party should 
be invaded by such a bunch of Visigoths," he said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; VOTER ROLLS AT RECORD HIGH FOR STATE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Voter registration for next week's election is the highest ever for a 
non-presidential election in California, the secretary of state's office 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 14.7 million Californians are eligible to vote next Tuesday, 
including 552,373 new voters. The Democrats won the battle of late voter 
registration, signing up 295,515 new party members as compared to 211,382 new 
Republicans since the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats fell short of their goal of registering 500,000 first-time 
voters. They downplayed the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mulholland, a state Democratic Party campaign adviser, said he was happy 
with the outcome, adding, "We've beaten the Republicans by 84,133 new 
registrations." That led to scoffing from Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Said John Peschong, executive director of the state Republican Party, of the 
Democrats' advantage: "When you register dogs, cats and children, and pay 
bounty hunters $10 per registration like the Democrats do, you are bound to get 
more registrations." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the about 14.7 million registered voters, 7,219,635 are Democrats (49.03%) 
and 5,472,391 are Republicans (37.17%). 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats made particular efforts this fall to register more traditional 
Democratic voters such as blacks. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen 
Brown and the Rev. Jesse Jackson caravaned through parts of Los Angeles in late 
September seeking to boost black registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and the Legislative Black 
Caucus also were active in late voter registration efforts. The number of new 
black voters, however, is not known, the secretary of state's office said, 
explaining that the new registration numbers are broken down only by political 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulholland insisted that, if the registration of party members who have moved 
to new residences is included in the new totals, then Democrats did reach their 
goal of 500,000 new registrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually registered 500,000 Democrats," he said, "including those who have 
moved to a new residence. Remember, you can't vote unless you re-register after 
you move." 
</P>
<P>
 Peschong countered by explaining that Republicans traditionally are more apt 
to vote, closing whatever gap exists in the numbers of registered voters. "We 
think we did exceptionally well," Peschong said, "and our registrants are 
Republicans who will vote on Election Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Completing the list of registered voters were 1,514,979 (10.28%) who declined 
to state a party affiliation, 242,510 (1.65%) from the American Independent 
Party, 86,198 (0.59%) from the Green Party, 69,951 (0.48%) Libertarians, 66,955 
(0.45%) from the Peace and Freedom Party and 51,166 (0.35%) in the category of 
miscellaneous non-qualified party registrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous registration record for a non-presidential election was 13.5 
million in November, 1990. The record for voter registration occurred in the 
1992 presidential election, when 15,101,473 Californians were on the voter 
rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats lead in voter registration in 40 California counties, compared to 18 
counties for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has 3,665,868 registered voters, including 2,037,899 
Democrats (55.59%) and 1,162,889 Republicans (31.72%). 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County remained the state leader among Republican counties with 615,025 
registered Republicans (52.5%) and 400,721 Democrats (34.2%). The county has 
1,170,072 registered voters in all. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, 351,921 registered to vote, with 155,468 (44.2%) 
Republicans and 144,791 (41.1%) Democrats.

 5 days to go before Californians go to the polls 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Wednesday: Democrat Kathleen Brown boarded buses and planes 
for a 29-hour campaign marathon. She appeared Wednesday in Sacramento, 
Emeryville, Hayward, San Jose, San Diego and Los Angeles. She suggested that 
Wilson had a "secret" plan to implement Proposition 187. Wilson spoke to Asian 
American leaders in San Francisco's Chinatown and released two television ads 
touting his record on crime, jobs, immigration and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Brown will continue her tour with stops in Bakersfield, 
Fresno, Merced, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Wilson will hold an anti-crime 
rally in Hollywood with relatives of crime victims and will appear at a Palm 
Desert rally for congressional and legislative candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Wednesday: Republican candidate Mike Huffington spoke at Town 
Hall in Los Angeles. Feinstein appeared in Orange County and the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Feinstein has scheduled events in San Diego, Los Angeles and 
San Francisco that will focus on women voters. Huffington scheduled no public 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
 "I took full responsibility . . . and that should not be lost in all of this 
other stuff coming out. But when is Mrs. Feinstein going to take responsibility 
for making San Francisco a sanctuary (for illegal immigrants) . . . that was 
for ten thousands and thousands of people. At least I paid our person with 
private funds. All of these other people that came into San Francisco that Mrs. 
Feinstein let in, they went on social welfare services that the taxpayers paid 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Huffington, continuing to defend his hiring of an illegal immigrant as 
a nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 LIGHTER TOUCH 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic state chairman Bill Press stunned a San Bernardino audience to 
silence when he said that he was "sick and tired" of people who sneak across 
the border into California in the dark of night, refuse to pay California taxes 
and take advantage of state services. It sounded frighteningly like a 
Republican speaking in favor of Proposition 187, the ballot measure to cut off 
services to illegal immigrants that Press and other Democrats oppose. The 
silence was broken with hearty laughter, however, when Press continued: "But 
enough about Mike Huffington. . . ."

WHITE FAMILY TO MOVE TO SETTLE RACIAL BIAS SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A white couple have agreed to sell their home of 20 years to settle a 
$10-million lawsuit accusing the family of harassing their next-door neighbors 
with racial slurs and death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors who filed the federal civil rights suit are a Chicago policeman 
of black and Puerto Rican descent and his Puerto Rican wife, Isidor and Minerva 
Ramos.They moved to the Northwest Side neighborhood in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "Close this chapter in your lives," U.S. District Judge Ann Williams told both 
families Tuesday when the settlement was reached. "Get over it and move on." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleged that a year after the Ramoses moved next door, John and 
Marie Kraft, their three children and a son-in-law began hurling racial insults 
and obscenities at the Ramos family. The harassment eventually escalated to 
death threats, the lawsuit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Krafts denied the allegations, but to avoid a costly legal battle, they 
agreed to move out, their attorney said.

SOVIETS TRIED TO BLACKMAIL U.S. JOURNALIST, BOOK SAYS; COLD WAR: RUSSIAN AGENTS 
HAD PHOTOS OF COLUMNIST JOSEPH W. ALSOP JR. ENGAGING IN HOMOSEXUAL ACT. HE 
REJECTED THEIR EFFORTS TO TURN HIM INTO SPY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1957, during one of the harshest periods of the Cold War, Soviet agents 
secretly photographed one of America's most well-known journalists engaging in 
a homosexual act in a Moscow hotel room and tried to blackmail him into 
becoming a spy. 
</P>
<P>
 The journalist, the late syndicated Washington columnist Joseph W. Alsop Jr., 
rebuffed the Soviets and reported the attempt to U.S. intelligence officials, 
many of whom were among his close friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the incident are spelled out in a forthcoming book, "Joe Alsop's 
Cold War," by syndicated columnist Edwin M. Yoder Jr. Richard M. Helms, former 
director of central intelligence and a senior intelligence official at the 
time, confirmed Yoder's account in an interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 After the blackmail attempt, Alsop never wavered as a passionate 
anti-Communist and outspoken critic of the Soviet Union. But the incident 
haunted him the rest of his life, and he never ventured back to the Soviet 
Union, according to Yoder, a longtime Alsop friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of such tactics by intelligence agencies during the darkest days of 
the Cold War has long been talked about. But this may be the first clearly 
documented case involving a prominent American figure that has become public 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 And Alsop's gritty reaction to the blackmail attempt appears all the more 
courageous when viewed in the context of prevailing attitudes toward 
homosexuality during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Information and photographs about the Moscow episode -- set up by Soviet 
agents to entrap Alsop when he visited Moscow to research columns -- were 
obtained from the CIA by then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a typical ploy to ingratiate himself with important leaders, Hoover 
circulated the material among top officials of the Dwight D. Eisenhower 
Administration -- officials who had been frequent targets of Alsop's biting 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, 15 years later, the KGB, seeking to undermine Alsop's credibility 
with his colleagues, mailed copies of the photographs to several prominent 
Washington journalists, according to Yoder's book, which will be published next 
spring by the University of North Carolina Press. The Times obtained a copy of 
the book's chapter dealing with the Moscow incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Alsop was one of the most influential political columnists of the post-World 
War II and Vietnam War periods. His column appeared in more than 250 
newspapers, including most of the major ones. A ubiquitous figure on 
Washington's social scene, he had many friends in high places, including 
President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. intelligence officials and some of Alsop's relatives and closest friends 
had guarded the secret of his homosexuality and the blackmailing attempt until 
Yoder began researching his book. 
</P>
<P>
 Alsop, who died in 1989 at 78, kept top U.S. intelligence officials apprised 
of his contacts with Communist officials. In fact, according to Yoder and other 
sources, Alsop turned to one of his CIA friends for advice after the NKVD, 
predecessor to the KGB, tried to blackmail him. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoder documents his account with FBI records, other official memoranda and 
on-the-record interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 In confirming the blackmail attempt, Helms told The Times that he learned of 
it shortly after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the blackmailing attempt, Alsop had gone to the Kremlin and 
conducted a long interview with Nikita S. Khrushchev, who was clearly 
outdistancing other Soviet officials on his way to becoming the unchallenged 
leader of the Soviet Union. The interview, like many of Alsop's columns during 
that period, was featured on the front pages of many newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoder wrote that Alsop "had written ebulliently of the convivial company of 
singers, talkers and drinkers gathered at his hotel from all over Europe. They 
were to be encountered at all hours. Among them there had been planted an agent 
of the secret police, who was aware of Joe's long-concealed homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night in Moscow he and this companion were photographed in a sexual act 
in his hotel room and he was soon confronted with the photographs and, under 
the threat of blackmail, was urged -- unsuccessfully -- to become an undercover 
agent," Yoder wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Yoder said he had "extremely mixed feelings" in dealing with 
the blackmailing attempt "because I had great personal fondness and respect for 
Joe, and as a rule, I take no particular interest in private lives of public 
figures and deplore the extent to which they tend to be written and talked 
about these days." 
</P>
<P>
 "Further," Yoder said, "I was fearful it would distort the overall story of 
Joe's journalism. On the other hand, since I was aware of all the rumors and 
hearsay, I knew it would be written about by someone. In a sense the ultimate 
significance of the story is Joe's absolute refusal to be bullied or 
blackmailed or doing anything false professionally or to his country -- and 
that's a tribute to Joe."

 The University of Minnesota's School of Social Work said Wednesday that it has 
banned students and faculty from using perfumes, colognes, shampoos and other 
smell-good products that might trigger allergic reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that is strongly scented" is not permitted, said Nancy Johnston, 
associate director of the graduate school. "We're trying to make people know 
there are products out there which are less strongly scented. The response has

POLITICAL NOTES: HARMAN, BROOKS CAMPAIGNS TRADE CHARGES THAT ADS DISTORT TRUTH

 GUNNING FOR VOTES: Rep. Jane Harman(D-Rolling Hills) and Rancho Palos Verdes 
Councilwoman Susan Brooks have taken their campaigns to the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 And -- surprise, surprise -- both candidates accuse the other of distorting 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign was especially ruffled over a Harman ad that highlights 
Harman's support of the crime bill and opposition by the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad says: "The Daily Breeze reports that South Bay congresswoman Jane 
Harman has become the target of the National Rifle Assn., which is going to 
work for Harman's opponent, Susan Brooks." 
</P>
<P>
 In another portion of the ad, a narrator says that, "to satisfy the NRA, 
Brooks opposed" the crime bill, which includes a ban on certain types of 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign, however, said that she opposed the bill because it included 
$7 billion in what she calls "social engineering spending." Brooks supported 
the Brady Bill and opposes assault weapons "of mass destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 However, about 30 NRA members have been working for Brooks' campaign, and NRA 
champion Charlton Heston has endorsed her as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one on the NRA is a paid member of the staff," campaign manager John 
Perkins said. "They are walking precincts, but they understand Susan's 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a source at the NRA, who asked not to be quoted by name, Harman 
got an "F" grade from the group while Brooks got an "A." But the NRA has not 
invested any money to oust Harman.  
</P>
<P>
 Harman's campaign, meanwhile, took exception to a series of Brooks' 
commercials that debuted over the weekend on cable TV outlets in Torrance, the 
beach cities and the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, a laid-off aerospace worker says: "Jane Harman voted to cut defense by 
$150 billion. Jane Harman, like her millionaire friend Leona Helmsley, thinks 
integrity and truth is only for us little people." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Brooks says: "Over 50,000 jobs are lost in this district alone since Jane 
Harman and Bill Clinton gutted defense, and now our national security is at 
risk. Scary thought! We must restore our core infrastructure in defense and 
aerospace." 
</P>
<P>
 Their job loss figures, according to Perkins, are based on figures from UCLA 
and other sources, such as newspaper articles outlining companies' downsizing 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Behr said Harman never voted for a $150-billion cut in defense. Cuts in 
defense were begun by President George Bush, he said. "Jane voted for the full 
amount (of the defense budget) requested by the Pentagon." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Helmsley: "Jane Harman has never met Leona Helmsley," Behr said. "It's 
obviously an attempt at guilt by association." 
</P>

 FINE LINE: Last week, state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) was fighting 
mad over opponent David Barrett Cohen's mailer that attacked the veteran 
legislator's pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the situation is reversed. Cohen was fuming at a Dills mailer that 
took a swipe at his unpaid student loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad features students waiting in line at a student loan office. At the 
front of the line is a statement that says: "You'd think he'd have paid back 
the more than $10,000 in student loans by now. But he hasn't. And thousands of 
young people are waiting in line because of deadbeats like him." The mailer, 
sent throughout the 28th State Senate District, is signed by Dills. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether "deadbeat" means Cohen missed his loan obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an absolute lie, and he knows it," Cohen, an attorney and educator, 
said in a statement. "I've never missed a payment. Dills thinks he can say 
whatever he wants because he thinks I don't have the money to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen produced documents showing that he had already repaid several student 
loans in full. Of his remaining loans, he has met his $334.96 per month 
obligation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could afford to prepay that damn thing early, don't you think I'd do it 
and save all that interest?" Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills' campaign, however, said that they were taking issue with Cohen lending 
his campaign $9,000 rather than paying off his student loan debt.  
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is, he chose to loan his campaign money," campaign manager Richie 
Ross said. "First things first. We don't say he's late. That's not said 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen responded that he had to raid his retirement fund to lend his campaign 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to file a cross-complaint in a response to a $1-million suit Dills 
filed last week. In a flyer, Cohen mistakenly said that Dills accepted a 
legislative pension while still a legislator, which is prohibited by state law. 
Cohen apologized and said that his staff has been correcting the error. It 
didn't matter to the Dills camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "His idea of a fight is he gets to slap the old guy around," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Shortridge, Cohen's consultant, said, "They realized there was no way for 
Dills to get reelected without attacking David." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 AND MORE: Libertarian Guy Wilson has filed a complaint with the Federal 
Election Commission over campaign finance reports field by Rep. Walter R. 
Tucker III (D-Compton). 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is Tucker's listing of $22,702 in expenses from April 1 to May 18 
that were not itemized. That is out of a total of $32,448 during the period. 
The campaign listed the expenses as "fund raising and office expense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Election Commission requires that all expenditures to a single 
vendor of more than $200 be reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker's spending "would have required a minimum of 113 separate and distinct 
recipients over a period of six weeks," said Wilson's treasurer, Elizabeth 
Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign also said that more that 200 contributors to the Tucker 
campaign do not include addresses, employers and industries. Campaigns are 
required to make their "best efforts" to find such information for those who 
contribute more than $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is Tucker's only challenger in the heavily Democratic 37th 
Congressional District. Tucker, a freshman congressman, is facing charges that 
he accepted bribes while mayor of Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker said he had not seen the complaint filed by Wilson's camp, but noted 
that his campaign provided 100 pages of response to a similar complaint from 
Lew Prulitsky, his challenger in the Democratic primary.  
</P>
<P>
 "It goes with the territory," Tucker said. "When people are running, they try 
to attack you. They try to find fault wherever they can."

WATER DISTRICT RACES; A FLOOD OF CANDIDATES WILL VIE FOR POSITIONS ON OBSCURE 
BOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Bay voters will find record numbers of candidates and unusual acrimony 
in once-sleepy water district races. 
</P>
<P>
 In years past, the candidates for four-year terms on the West Basin Municipal 
Water District's board spent little money on the races, which have been 
described as typically nonpartisan, nonpolitical elections where press coverage 
is limited and fund raising is not customary. But this year, nine candidates 
are on the ballot for three open seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents and challengers alike wonder why so many candidates are running for 
the obscure posts. Some contenders appear to be true water buffs -- engineers, 
environmentalists and others with a passion for water issues. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three candidates have ties to former Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, who 
opened the nonprofit Robert Smith Water Institute in April. Candidates Mark S. 
Dymally (Mervyn Dymally's son), R. Keith McDonald (son of Assemblywoman Juanita 
M. McDonald) and JoAnn S. Williams all list positions with the institute on 
election documents.  
</P>
<P>
 McDonald is running against incumbent Charles L. Stuart, former Rancho Palos 
Verdes Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach and consultant Basil Kimbrew in Division 1. 
Mark Dymally is running against incumbent Richard Heath in Division 2. Williams 
is opposing incumbent Edward C. Little in Division 4. Robert Katherman's name 
also appears on the ballot in Division 1, although he has withdrawn from the 
race.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the former congressman is trying to stack the powerful water 
boards with his allies. Mervyn Dymally acknowledges that the candidates are 
affiliated with the institute, but he denies that the nonprofit organization is 
backing any candidate. Nonprofit agencies are barred by state law from 
political activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Other institute-affiliated candidates are running in the Central Basin 
Municipal Water District and the Water Replenishment District of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 West Basin acts as a middleman for water sales to more than 800,000 Southern 
California residents. Water that the district buys from the Metropolitan Water 
District is resold to cities and water companies in coastal neighborhoods from 
Malibu to the South Bay. Torrance and Los Angeles, however, buy their water 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its role as a purveyor of water, the West Basin district has 
created partnerships with other public and private groups for water 
conservation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 13, West Basin dedicated its water recycling plant in El Segundo. The 
$200-million facility is the largest in the nation and will ultimately treat 
100,000-acre-feet of waste water each year. The facility will treat water from 
the Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant for use in industry and irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people who swarmed the October dedication heard district officials 
praise the project, which has received $6.7 million of a $50 million commitment 
from the federal government.  
</P>
<P>
 West Basin incumbents Stuart, Heath and Little have cited their stewardship of 
the recycling project throughout the campaign, while criticizing water 
institute challengers and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Heath called challenger Mark Dymally's supporters "cronies and insiders" and 
said Dymally is "not on record as having set foot in a single West Basin 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Dymally counters by citing his nine years as a water resources specialist 
for the Metropolitan Water District and describing himself as a leader who "is 
going to represent all of our needs and not those of a select few."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart filed suit against Katherman, an engineer and small-business owner. 
Stuart's lawsuit said that Katherman's candidate statement "contained 
malicious, untrue, misleading and damaging allegations" about Stuart's 
compensation. In September Katherman lost the lawsuit, withdrew from the race 
and endorsed Stuart. Katherman's name is still on the ballot, however, because 
he withdrew too late to have it removed.  
</P>
<P>
 Just this week, more lawsuits were threatened. In a letter addressed to 
Richard Atwater, general manager of the water district, Mervyn Dymally accused 
Atwater and other district officials of giving out information that would 
damage his reputation. Dymally also requested an opportunity to address the 
board of directors to complain, and said he had referred the matter to his 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected board members will be responsible for guiding the district through the 
final phases of the water recycling project.

KARNETTE, KUYKENDALL IN TIGHT RACE IN 54TH DISTRICT; ASSEMBLY: RANCHO PALOS 
VERDES MAYOR HAS MOUNTED STRONG CHALLENGE TO FIRST-TERM DEMOCRAT. INCUMBENTS 
ARE FAVORED IN OTHER LOCAL RACES. 
</P>

<P>
 Crime, schools, Proposition 187 and an unusual proposal to pay prison convicts 
to opt for the death penalty are some of the issues this year as 13 candidates 
vie for five South Bay seats in the California Assembly. 54th District  
</P>
<P>
 In the 54th Assembly District, which covers the Palos Verdes Peninsula, San 
Pedro, Long Beach and some adjacent areas, one-term Democratic incumbent Betty 
Karnette is facing a serious challenge from Republican Steven T. Kuykendall, 
the mayor of Rancho Palos Verdes. Democrats have only a small edge over 
Republicans within the district, 46% of registered voters to 41%. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Oct. 22, Karnette had raised $212,000 in contributions to Kuykendall's 
$187,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've got a good record (in the Assembly)," said Karnette, 63, a 
former public school mathematics teacher who in the last election staged an 
upset victory over 14-year incumbent Gerald Felando in the newly redrawn 
district. "I don't think there's any reason for anyone to support anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Karnette added, "Jobs, crime and education, that's what everybody is talking 
about." She said she opposes Proposition 187, which would deny a host of public 
services to illegal immigrants but supports stopping illegal immigration at the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a real horse race," Kuykendall, a disability-retired Marine Corps 
captain and a mortgage banker, said of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that voters in the 54th District have a clear choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are two distinctly different people," Kuykendall, 47, said, describing 
himself as an advocate of more limited government than his opponent. He 
supports Proposition 187, calling it "a terrific vehicle for sending a message 
to the federal government" about illegal immigration, and opposes Proposition 
186, the "single payer" health care initiative that would take health care out 
of insurance companies' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not about to turn over one-seventh of this state's economy to the 
government," Kuykendall said. Karnette has not taken a position on Proposition 
186. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall won the Republican nomination after a bruising June primary race 
against restaurateur Jeffrey Earle, who has since thrown his support to 
Kuykendall. 
</P>
<P>
 Also vying for the 54th seat is Libertarian party candidate Al Carlan, 64, a 
retired aerospace executive who says his opponents are "Republi-crats" who take 
traditional views of government. Carlan says crime is a major issue; he favors 
decriminalizing drugs, releasing drug offenders from prison and using the space 
for violent criminals instead of building more prisons. He also favors 
abolishing parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlan said he initially favored Proposition 187 but now opposes it because 
"it's unconstitutional and we Libertarians support the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlan has raised about $12,000 in campaign contributions and is using most of 
it for billboards telling voters, "You Have a Choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Another choice is Patrick John McCoy of the Peace and Freedom Party. McCoy, a 
40-year-old public school teacher in Long Beach, supports raising taxes on 
large corporations and the wealthy, raising the minimum wage and developing 
more innovative jobs programs. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy opposes the state's new "three strikes" law, which mandates 25 years to 
life in prison for a third felony conviction when a person has been convicted 
of two prior serious or violent crimes. "We're going to spend more money on 
prisons than we are on jobs," he said. "We have our priorities reversed." 51st 
District  
</P>
<P>
 In the heavily Democratic 51st Assembly District, which covers Inglewood, 
Hawthorne, Lawndale, Westchester and some adjacent areas, Democratic incumbent 
Curtis R. Tucker Jr. isn't worried about his reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not focusing so much on my particular race," said Tucker, a two-term 
Assemblyman who believes his past service to his constituents -- and a district 
where 72% of voters are registered Democrats -- will allow him to breeze to 
victory over his Republican opponent. "I'm working on turning out our district 
for the top of the (Democratic) ticket."  
</P>
<P>
 Tucker opposes Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, 40, who was a legislative aide before being elected to the Assembly, 
has raised $232,000 in campaign contributions as of Oct. 22 and had spent 
$191,000, including a $10,000 contribution to the Assembly Democratic Victory 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 His Republican challenger, Adam Michelin, had raised $3,257 as of Sept. 30 for 
his campaign. He insists that Tucker may be overconfident.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how disgruntled the Democrats (in the district) are," said 
Michelin, 52. "I wouldn't say my chances are quite even money, but it's close." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelin, a political newcomer who founded a chain of child-care centers, has 
drafted a 29-page "legislative blueprint" in which he advocates reforming 
juvenile courts, limiting welfare to two years, putting priorities on 
government spending, and, in one of the more unusual proposals of the political 
year, offering any prison inmate who volunteers for the death penalty a cash 
payment, made to his estate, equal to 10% of the state's savings in 
incarceration costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't worked out all the details on that one yet," Michelin admitted. He 
added, "I'm not a career politician. I'm just a concerned citizen trying to 
make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelin supports Proposition 187. 52nd District  
</P>
<P>
 In the heavily Democratic 52nd District, which covers Lynwood, Paramount, 
Gardena, parts of Compton, Long Beach and south Los Angeles, and nearby areas, 
incumbent Democrat Willard H. Murray Jr. has a lock on his fourth and final 
term in the Assembly. (He must relinquish his seat at the end of his next term 
because of voter-mandated term limits.) 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's only opponent, Republican Richard A. Rorex of Gardena, withdrew in 
July after deciding to take a job with the U.S. Postal Service. Federal 
employees are prohibited from serving in partisan public offices. Rorex's name 
will still appear on the ballot. 53rd District  
</P>
<P>
 In the 53rd District, which stretches from Venice to Marina del Rey, 
Westchester and the South Bay beach cities, Democratic Assemblywoman Debra 
Bowen is running her first reelection campaign with the traditional perks of an 
incumbent -- name recognition, political allies and a campaign war chest far 
larger than her opponent's. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that edge, Bowen says she's not overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always run like I'm behind," she said. "It's part of my nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a narrow 43% to 41% margin in 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first political campaign in 1992, she won a bitter race for the 
Assembly, garnering 55% of the vote to Republican Brad Parton's 41%. 
</P>
<P>
 Running on her Assembly record, Bowen, 38, notes that she wrote a bill that 
provides free computer access to state legislative information, such as 
legislators' voting records, the text of bills and their status. She also 
sponsored new laws to help businesses get variances from air-quality districts, 
to force state agencies to coordinate the oversight of toxic cleanups and to 
require the state to publicize condom reliability testing data. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen's Republican opponent, commercial insurance agent Julian Sirull, 36, 
said one of his main qualifications is that he's not an incumbent politician. 
He hopes to benefit from Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection campaign and from the 
trend favoring Republicans nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sirull acknowledges that he is not getting as much financial support from 
the Republican Party as he would like. As of Sept. 30, his campaign had $15,946 
in the bank, far below Bowen's $79,546. He had spent $4,988, compared with 
$53,960 by Bowen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirull said he would help businesses by seeking a cut in the corporate income 
tax and changing the workers' compensation system. The corporate tax rate, 
which is higher in California than in neighboring states, and workers' comp. 
are encouraging businesses to leave California, he said. He insists that any 
revenue lost would be offset by increased collections as a result of the 
generally improved business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the race are Libertarian candidate William Gaillard, a public works 
employee, and Peace and Freedom candidate J. Kevin Bishop, a cable installer. 
55TH DISTRICT  
</P>
<P>
 In the 55th District, which includes Carson, Compton, Long Beach and 
Wilmington, Assemblywoman Juanita M. McDonald, 56, looks like a shoo-in. In a 
district where 69% of voters are registered Democrats, a primary bid by former 
Assemblyman Richard Floyd never materialized, and McDonald has no Republican 
opposition. Still, McDonald had raised $225,000 in campaign funds as of Oct. 22 
and had spent $123,000. Libertarian Daniel O. Dalton has not invested more than 
$1,000 in the race.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated calls from The Times, McDonald was not available to discuss 
her positions on the issues.

COUNCIL RACE IS AS LOW-KEY AS ISLAND; AVALON: PERSONALITY MAY DECIDE THE 
CONTEST BETWEEN SCOTT NELSON AND GEORGE SCOTT ON CATALINA. NEITHER HAS FORMALLY 
CAMPAIGNED.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When voters on laid-back Catalina Island go to the polls Tuesday, they will 
choose between two candidates seeking election to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But the race between businessmen Scott Nelson and George Scott is anything but 
cutthroat. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just discovered this week that there was a race," said Scott, a 
well-known figure on the island who runs for council every election. "We 
haven't done anything (to campaign), not either one of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who declined to give his age, has served four council and two mayoral 
terms since he arrived on Catalina in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, 40, agreed that personality will be a major factor when island 
residents cast their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson has filled the council position temporarily since former Councilman 
Ralph J. Morrow Jr. was elected mayor in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson now seeks official election to fill the remaining two years of Morrow's 
four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson indicated that some voters say Scott "has had his time around and he's 
not what we want anymore." But he said the main issues affecting Avalon include 
development projects and attracting people and business to the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they're not really affecting us now. They're all future projects," Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nelson is his opponent, no ill will exists between the two, Scott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't said anything derogatory about him and I don't think he's going to 
say anything derogatory about me." SUSAN WOODWARD

DEFENSE FIRMS PUT MONEY ON A HARMAN WIN; POLITICS: CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORTS 
SHOW THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY OVERWHELMING BACKING THE INCUMBENT AND SHUNNING GOP 
RIVAL SUSAN BROOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aerospace and defense companies have overwhelmingly backed Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Rolling Hills) and have virtually shunned her Republican rival, Rancho Palos 
Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks, according to a study of contributions to both 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman has received $64,900 from employees at aerospace and defense firms and 
another $71,200 from their political action committees, according to a Times 
study of contributions from 1993 to Oct. 19. Brooks, meanwhile, has received 
$3,400 from aerospace employees and no PAC contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures come from campaign disclosure statements filed with the Federal 
Election Commission since Jan. 1, 1993. They include only PAC money and 
individual contributions of more than $200. Over that period, Harman itemized 
$523,500 in individual contributions to Brooks' $179,000. Harman also listed 
$448,000 in PAC money, compared to $61,100 for Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Not included in the figures are individuals who listed themselves as retired 
or homemakers, although they could be the spouses or family members of 
aerospace and defense workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Harman has been adept at raising money from law firms, including 
$62,200 from individuals and $20,500 from PACs. A large portion came from 
Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, the Washington law firm where she was a corporate 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harman also received contributions from entertainment industry sources, 
including $43,700 in individual contributions and $13,000 from PACs. Her 
supporters include entertainer Barbra Streisand, "Happy Days" star Henry 
Winkler and super-agent Mike Ovitz. She received almost $10,000 from a PAC and 
individuals at Walt Disney Co., including Chairman Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks drew on financial institutions, such as banks, stockbrokers and 
investors, who gave her $23,600 in individual contributions and $6,600 in PAC 
money. Also high on the list were real estate developers and construction 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the near-unanimous backing of Harman at aerospace firms has been a source 
of frustration for Brooks. Harman in part has been helped by her position on 
the House Armed Services Committee, according to Common Cause, a public 
interest research group. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual for members of Armed Services Committees to get substantial 
contributions from defense contractors, said Ruth Holton, Common Cause's 
California director. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though aerospace executives traditionally are cut from Republican 
cloth, political analysts say that it is typical for major contributors to 
support incumbents financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executives "think Jane Harman will probably win, and they are afraid 
that if they give money to Susan Brooks, they will anger Jane Harman, and she 
won't be as willing to go to bat for them," said Ben Sheffner, a political 
analyst for the Cook Political Report in Washington. "It's typical of the 
situation across the country. (Corporate PACs) want to do what is safest, and 
the safest thing to do is to give to an incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal for any company to contribute directly to a candidate's 
campaign, but employees can make donations on their own or through a company 
political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Hughes Aircraft Co., where individual employees and a political 
action committee have given Harman $20,600, say that Harman has garnered 
support because she has pushed for aerospace conversion projects and lobbied 
Clinton administration officials to lift restrictions on the sale of commercial 
satellites to China. Some of those trade barriers have been eased. 
</P>
<P>
 "She prepared legislation to lift the sanctions and permit the sale of 
satellites," said Hughes spokesman Rand Christensen. "We feel that she has 
represented us well." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign, however, has questioned Harman's acceptance of corporate PAC 
money in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1992 campaign flyer, Harman said she "will refuse campaign contributions 
from special-interest PACs that have business before her committees in 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the aerospace money that she has got are (from) companies that have 
business before her committees," Brooks' campaign manager, John Perkins, said. 
"She has broken a pledge she made (in the flyer) two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, Harman said last week.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I could have stated it more carefully; hindsight is always better," 
Harman said. "But what I intended to say was, 'I will not accept contributions 
from PACs that come before my committees that have no connections to my 
district.' But if constituents want to contribute, and they happen to work for 
Rockwell or someplace, I think it is totally appropriate to accept their 
support."  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Brooks' campaign says she has won the support of rank and file 
aerospace employees, whose contributions are not itemized.  
</P>
<P>
 Harman's campaign also says she gets support from workers, including labor 
union PACs. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Brooks has tried to give presentations at Hughes, TRW Inc. 
and Northrop Grumman Corp. -- three of the South Bay's largest aerospace firms 
-- only to be rejected by the companies, Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan Brooks can't even get on any of the facilities to make a presentation," 
Perkins said. "(Jane Harman) has strong-armed all of them, and therefore the 
door has been slammed in our face." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman for Hughes and Northrop Grumman said they were not aware of any 
requests from Brooks, although it could have been made to any number of 
employees. An official at TRW could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is that if a candidate wants to visit, we would be glad to 
accommodate them, and we do offer that same opportunity to their opponent," 
said Northrop Grumman spokesman Jim Hart. "If Miss Brooks' campaign was told 
differently, that was an error." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman's spokesman Roy Behr said: "The bottom line here, when you cut through 
all of the whining and the rhetoric, is that Jane Harman has nearly unanimous 
support from the aerospace community, employers and employees, and Susan Brooks 
has zip." 
</P>
<P>
 The study of the contributions also reflected the gap between the two 
candidates' abilities to tap outside sources. Of Harman's individual 
contributions, 41% came from outside the state, compared to only 6% for Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty clear, by accepting that amount of out-of-state contributions, 
that she is more concerned with what is going on in Washington and not in the 
interest of the district," Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unitemized contributions come almost entirely from California," Behr 
said. "We have a telemarketing program that raises money almost entirely from 
California. (Harman) has a much larger donor base in California than she did 
two years ago." The Top Givers

SOUTH BAY / ELECTION GUIDE; 2 COUNCIL MEMBERS HOPING TO UNSEAT LONGTIME MAYOR; 
INGLEWOOD: JUDITH DUNLAP AND GARLAND HARDEMAN SAY THREE TERMS ARE ENOUGH FOR 
EDWARD VINCENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Vincent, mayor of Inglewood, is usually all over town. He's shaking 
hands at banquets and lunches. Rubbing shoulders at sign raisings or store 
openings. Schmoozing people at early morning business meetings. Hamming it up 
at evening networking sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it can be difficult to get away from Vincent -- unless you're running 
against him for office. 
</P>
<P>
 At the mayoral debate last week at the Mayflower Ballroom, Vincent was absent. 
His opponents, Garland Hardeman, a five-year veteran of the Inglewood City 
Council, and Judith Dunlap, a councilwoman for 18 months, sat side by side, 
occasionally sparred with one another and attacked Vincent for not attending. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent, who did not once debate his opponents during the campaign, sent a 
letter to the Beach Cities League of Women Voters apologizing for his absence 
but saying his record stands for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Vincent has entirely ignored his opponents throughout the campaign and 
has focused on driving home his accomplishments and goals. In conversations 
about the campaign, he rarely mentions either Hardeman or Dunlap. That strategy 
has helped make this election season one of the calmest in recent Inglewood 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I be bothered with them?" Vincent said at a fund-raiser last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, Inglewood elections have been anything but quiet. In 1987, 
Hardeman lost his first council race in a bid to unseat one of the mayor's 
allies, Ervin (Tony) Thomas. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge, however, threw 
out that election, ruling that Vincent and other Thomas supporters had invaded 
voters' rights to ballot secrecy during a house-to-house ballot drive. 
Ultimately, Vincent was fined $16,000 by the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission. The mayor denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent's political luster was briefly tarnished, but he weathered the scandal 
and has remained the city's head cheerleader. Inglewood, he often says, is 
unfairly disparaged by outsiders who have been influenced by media-perpetuated 
stereotypes of cities populated by blacks and Latinos. In fact, in a video put 
together for his campaign, the narrator refers to Inglewood as almost a 
paradise. His primary job as mayor, he says, is to fight a never-ending barrage 
of wrong perceptions about Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent, 60, was a football star at the University of Iowa in the 1950s and 
played briefly with the Los Angeles Rams until an injury stymied his career. 
His conversation is filled with football analogies and calls for teamwork. He 
became the city's first black mayor 12 years ago and has been easily reelected 
since then. He is particularly well-liked by many in the business community, 
who say that Vincent's positive spin on events can only help the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, though high in Inglewood, remains on a 10-year downward trend, 
according to Inglewood Police statistics. And Crime Watch Consultants, based in 
Marina del Rey, recently praised the city for being among the top 10 cities in 
California in which crime has dropped between 1992 and 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's great! The city's great! All anyone has to do is look around!" 
Vincent said recently at a $100-per-person "Monday Night Football" fund-raiser 
for his campaign at Hollywood Park. "I feel very confident. Why shouldn't I? 
Inglewood is better today financially than it's been at any time in its 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 business leaders in Inglewood, nearly half of them residents, 
gathered for the event; others had contributed but did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I became mayor, crime was at an all-time high," read a statement at each 
table. "We had to beg developers and home builders to consider us. Unemployment 
was high, graffiti and prostitution plagued the city. More importantly, our 
community spirit was nonexistent. Using teamwork we've turned all that around." 
</P>
<P>
 The major criticism leveled at him by his opponents is that he is unduly 
guided by City Manager Paul D. Eckles. Vincent treats it like praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud to be connected with Paul Eckles," Vincent said. "Eckles has this 
city a Triple A bond rating with Standard & Poors -- and they don't go on 
personality." Vincent was referring to the highest possible municipal bond 
rating, which allows a city to borrow money at lower rates of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 To run against Vincent is to allege that Inglewood has problems, which can be 
a touchy election theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman has walked a careful line, pointing out that Inglewood is a great 
place, but saying it could be a lot better. Vincent, he said, lacks vision, and 
even if he had it, Eckles wouldn't let him use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "His leadership of the city has left a lot to be desired. For example, the 
poverty rate in Inglewood is the highest in the South Bay. Why, when we have 
more assets than most?" Hardeman said, referring to Hollywood Park, the Forum 
and other major businesses in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman decries the same crime rate that Vincent touts. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, do we know that it's falling? We've seen an increase in our 
population, especially our immigrant population, (which doesn't) traditionally 
report crime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that, although overall crime has dropped nearly 12%, murders 
have been on the rise. In 1982, the year Vincent took office, 17 people were 
killed in Inglewood, police statistics show. In 1993, 47 people were murdered. 
"Is that an improvement?" Hardeman asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman, 37, holds a master's degree in public administration. A Los Angeles 
police officer for 15 years, Hardeman now serves as a field representative for 
Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton).  
</P>
<P>
 He proposes bringing technology-based industries to Inglewood, such as those 
developing rail cars and alternative fuels. Among his accomplishments he counts 
his work to help start after-school programs in his district, as well as the 
Late Night Basketball program at Darby Park for at-risk teen-agers. Hardeman 
also promoted community police centers and worked to enact an ordinance 
prohibiting the proliferation of small motels, a move intended as a deterrent 
to drug dealing and prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, he said, he would work to attract more restaurants and specialty 
stores to the city's commercial corridors. "We should have a Third Street 
(Promenade) here like in Santa Monica or an Old Town Pasadena," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, about 125 Hardeman supporters, some of whom also attended Vincent's 
football fund-raiser, gathered at a $15-per-person party in the Hollywood 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhythm and blues hits, soft raps and funky tunes kept the youngish crowd 
dancing until about 1 a.m. Hardeman, sporting black leather pants, a black 
shirt and a red jacket, talked and danced with guests and raffled off tickets 
to his Oct. 29 fund-raiser at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Jackee Harry of the television show "Sister, Sister" mingled with 
guests and then took a microphone and urged the crowd to get "that old man" out 
of Inglewood, referring to Vincent, and to "let somebody young do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Hardeman calls for change to revitalize the city, Dunlap goes several 
steps further and says only a change in leadership can save the city from 
peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, who taught for 25 years in Inglewood's schools before leaving on 
disability, charges at council meetings and wherever she speaks publicly that 
Inglewood's administration, staff and even some council members, are dishonest. 
She has not accused anyone by name. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a rising tide of fiscal mismanagement, a rising tide of corruption 
in City Hall and a rising tide of moral deterioration," Dunlap said at the 
League of Women Voters debate last week.  
</P>
<P>
 Her allegations infuriate city staff and her council colleagues. The charges, 
however, resonate with some voters in her district. When she called upon 
supporters in February to protest what she said was an effort by Eckles to keep 
city staff from providing her with information, more than 100 people packed a 
City Council meeting on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckles strongly denied that he has behaved improperly or discourteously to 
Dunlap, saying at that time that her constant requests for documents and 
research into the minutiae of running government were wasting city money and 
staff time. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her promise to try to oust Eckles if elected mayor, Dunlap says 
she will ensure that local minority businesses receive more city contracts. 
Businesses outside Inglewood often are given thousands of dollars in contracts 
to perform jobs that could be fulfilled by local contractors, Dunlap said. 
Vincent and other city officials, however, say bidding for contracts is fairly 
applied to all businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have been a staunch supporter of recycling dollars in our community, and 
that's fallen on deaf ears," she said. " We have a $160-million budget, and I 
believe we can generate our own local economic development."

SOUTH BAY / ELECTION GUIDE; YOUNG WARRIOR TAKES ON A BATTLE-TESTED VETERAN; 
STATE SENATE: DAVID BARRETT COHEN HAS TRIED TO PORTRAY INCUMBENT RALPH C. DILLS 
AS BEING OUT OF TOUCH. BUT THE SENATOR HAS PROFITED FROM COHEN'S MISTAKES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican David Barrett Cohen has hammered state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El 
Segundo) on his long tenure in office and on taking contributions from special 
interests. But it was a recent Cohen mailer that especially irked the 
84-year-old Dills. 
</P>
<P>
 It featured Cohen holding a saxophone -- long a Dills trademark -- and 
included the slogan "Time to Change the Tune." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's holding that thing the wrong way," Dills, once a professional sax 
player, said in his raspy Southwestern drawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Their race in the 28th Senate District is a classic matchup of a young 
insurgent and an entrenched, battle-tested incumbent. Also running are Peace 
and Freedom candidate Cindy Henderson and Libertarian Neal A. Donner.  
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, a 34-year-old Redondo Beach attorney, has tried to define his opponent 
as out of touch and beholden to political action committees that represent the 
liquor, gambling and tobacco industries.  
</P>
<P>
 Dills, meanwhile, has seized on his opponent's fumbles. Most recently, Cohen 
charged that Dills collected a legislative pension while in the Senate. That 
turned out to be false, and Cohen sent a letter of apology. Dills filed a libel 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Making their battle more complex is the split personality of the 28th 
District, which was created when legislative lines were redrawn to include the 
beach cities and Torrance. The district's eastern half -- considered a Dills 
stronghold -- includes blue-collar and ethnically diverse Compton, Carson and 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks very good for us," said Tim Mock, Dills' campaign coordinator. The 
anti-incumbent tide "is the only thing that worries me. I'm concerned about the 
voter turnout in the (eastern half) -- if we don't take that overwhelmingly and 
they don't come out to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Republican consultant Allan Hoffenblum: "The point is: Will there be so 
many votes in the Republican coast areas to counteract (the) east side (of the 
district)? For Cohen to have any chance, he has to win big in the beach cities 
and hold his own in the eastern end." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Oct. 22, Dills had $83,816 in campaign funds, compared with Cohen's 
$18,213. Since then, Dills has received an additional $104,829 in large 
contributions. Cohen has received $500. State Republicans won't say whether 
they will invest in the final days of the race, and the Dills campaign has 
launched a blitz of mailers in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 The registration in the district is 53% Democrat and 33% Republican, and Cohen 
has taken pains to distance himself from his party's conservative wing. He 
favors abortion rights and opposes Proposition 187, the initiative that would 
deny many public services to illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up thinking that Republicans didn't care about the poor. I felt they 
were mean-spirited and greedy," said Cohen, who was raised in a working-class 
section of Washington, D.C., and got a scholarship to attend the University of 
Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor's degree and a law degree. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits Jack Kemp with changing his mind in the mid-1980s. Kemp, then a New 
York congressman, ran for President in 1988 with a platform of "bleeding heart" 
conservatism that emphasized aid to urban areas. Cohen has adopted many parts 
of Kemp's platform of enterprise zones and tax incentives to stimulate 
low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the type of Republican people can respond to in this area," Cohen said. 
"It seemed pretty much tailor-made for me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also the same approach he took in his unsuccessful bid against then-Rep. 
Mel Levine, a Santa Monica Democrat, in 1990. Cohen did well in the South Bay 
areas of El Segundo and Manhattan Beach, but he was trounced by Levine in the 
Democratic strongholds of the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 This time Cohen is trying to persuade longtime Democrats to cross party lines. 
In doing so, he is promoting his family's multiethnic history -- he is Jewish 
and half-Samoan and his wife, Radha, emigrated from India, prompting his slogan 
a "rainbow on the right" -- as well as his ties to Carson's Pacific Islander 
community. Among them are more than 200 relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our family has sort of a weird, tortured history, but it is sort of the wave 
of the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Dills is fighting to retain his foothold in Carson. At a recent 
Carson parade to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Gen. Douglas MacArthur's 
landing in the Philippines, Dills promoted his ties to Filipino Americans, 
including a scholarship that the United Filipino Service Organization gives in 
his wife's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I see those of you my age, we're not ready for the trash heap this soon," 
said Dills to the war veterans. His opponent was in the crowd courting support 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills, who taught in Compton schools in the 1930s and 1940s, traces his 
judicial and legislative career to 1938. Resplendent in colorful ties (fuchsia 
and neon purple on a recent day), he recalls playing saxophone with Nat King 
Cole. Baseball great Duke Snider was one of his students in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 But far from reminiscing on the trail, Dills has set out to highlight his 
accomplishments in the state Senate, where he is the presiding officer and 
chairs the powerful Government Organization Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 To appeal to residents of the beach cities, he trumpets his ties to 
environmentalists on the premise that the coastal residents are more 
eco-conscious. His endorsements include the California League of Conservation 
Voters, a group that had once chided him for pro-industry votes and recently 
gave him the "most improved score" on his Senate votes. He recently helped push 
through a bill banning offshore oil drilling in state tidelands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the people's will," he says of his switch to "green" issues. "I'm in a 
new district. They're the boss. (The oil companies) didn't like it. But there 
was not a damn thing they could do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the age issue. Dills spent almost $500,000 during the 
primary, blanketing the district with billboards that showed him tooting a sax 
and featured the slogan "Too Old to Quit." 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a footrace," he says of his endurance. "I can vote. . . . I'm not 
the retiring type. I go to the funerals of those who exercise."

SOUTH BAY / ELECTION GUIDE; ON THE HOT SEAT; U. S. CONGRESS: REP. JANE HARMAN 
WON OFFICE IN 1992 WHILE DEMOCRATS WERE STRONG, BUT THAT'S CHANGED. REPUBLICAN 
SUSAN BROOKS IS CAMPAIGNING HARD TO OUST HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) had tapped one of her 
Washington friends for a visit to her district. This time it was CIA Director 
James Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
 As the congresswoman introduced Woolsey at a recent gathering, she quipped: 
"Some of you think I know everybody. I don't know everybody. I just know 
everybody good." 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, Harman would seem to have potent weapons in her race for a second 
term -- and connections with Washington powerbrokers is just one. She can also 
draw upon adept fund raising, her personal wealth, her two powerful committee 
posts and her host of endorsements from aerospace executives and police chiefs 
in the 36th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this election year, Harman's arsenal doesn't pack the usual punch -- 
even with an opponent, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks, who was 
all but unknown before the primary and has far less campaign cash. This time 
around, Harman is something that poll after poll says the electorate doesn't 
like: an incumbent, a D.C. insider and a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is what is making this race so much harder," even if incumbents such as 
Harman "make the system work," said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, 
senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 In other congressional races in the South Bay: Freshman Rep. Steve Horn 
(R-Long Beach) faces a strong challenge from Cypress College professor Peter 
Mathews in the 38th District. In the 37th District, Rep. Walter R. Tucker III 
(D-Compton), indicted in August on bribery charges, is being challenged by 
merchant seaman Guy Wilson, a Libertarian. In the 35th District, Rep. Maxine 
Waters (D-Los Angeles) is expected to easily win reelection against Republican 
computer graphics designer Nate Truman. 36th Congressional District  
</P>
<P>
 The Brooks-Harman race has drawn national attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ben Sheffner, assistant editor of the Cook Political Report in 
Washington: "Harman is one of the purest examples of a candidate who won based 
on the strength of the Democrats and Bill Clinton in 1992 but will be hurt by 
their relative weakness in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing on the situation is Brooks, a fierce campaigner who has seen her 
insurgent bid bolstered by visits from GOP stalwarts and money from the 
National Republican Congressional Committee. Complicating matters for Harman, 
Brooks does not present an easy target on the issues. Like Harman, for example, 
she supports abortion rights, making it far harder for Harman to use that issue 
to peel away moderate GOP votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had no illusions about this race," said Harman, who also faces American 
Independent Joseph G. Fields and Libertarian Jack Tyler. "I've detected the 
anger (of the electorate). You go to the League of Women Voters event, and 
there are angry people. And they are unforgiving. It's, 'If you disagree with 
me today, it doesn't matter what else you did.' But I think constituents are 
fairly well informed, and I think that people want to be constructive. And I'm 
running a campaign to appeal to the positive in people." 
</P>
<P>
 After her election two years ago, Harman moved quickly to build a record she 
could run on. She secured a post on the House Armed Services Committee, which 
has served her well in gaining the near-unanimous support of the district's 
aerospace executives. Harman, a onetime aide to President Jimmy Carter who 
later worked as a corporate attorney in Washington, also used the committee 
position to wade into defense issues important to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman also landed a post on the Science, Space and Technology Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 She teamed with Horn to save the C-17 cargo plane, built by McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. in Long Beach, and lobbied then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin to keep the 
Los Angeles Air Force Base off the military's base closure list. Earlier this 
month, she was at the White House as President Clinton signed a bill to reform 
the defense procurement system. 
</P>
<P>
 Her track record, however, may not help her much -- especially since her 
Democratic base appears far less energized compared to 1992, when Clinton was 
at the top of the ticket, poised to take the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would probably give Jane Harman a slight edge, given the inroads she has 
made with the business community," said political analyst Sheffner. "I suspect 
that if people identify Jane Harman (with) saving jobs, that will help her. But 
it's not easy to get the message out. And you have to remember that this is a 
Republican district, part of which used to send Bob Dornan to Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Brooks says that Rep. Robert K. Dornan (who now represents a district 
based in Garden Grove) nicknamed her "B-2 Sue," a takeoff on his nickname of 
"B-1 Bob." In her campaign, Brooks has tried to tag Harman as a carpetbagger 
who is partly to blame for a "defense meltdown." Harman voted for Clinton's 
defense budgets, which cost the district jobs, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people in America are screaming for is, 'We don't want these insider 
people anymore because they are screwing up the country big-time,' " said 
Brooks, a former special-education teacher who grew up in Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she flirted with liberalism in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when 
she studied to be a teacher at Columbia University. But she became a 
conservative, she said, because she learned from her experience as a teacher 
that government cannot solve all problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were out to save the world," she said of her first teaching job, as a 
special-education instructor in Harlem. Once, as she went to tutor a student in 
one of the projects, she was accosted by several gang members. So she just 
started having a conversation with herself. Her assailants thought she was 
crazy and ran off, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She says her "fire in the gut" style helped her when she and her husband, Jim, 
moved to Rancho Palos Verdes in 1985. She unsuccessfully fought the closure of 
Marineland, organized a Neighborhood Watch program and worked on a committee to 
keep local schools open. That led her to a seat on the city's Planning 
Commission and, in 1991, on the City Council. Her tenure has had its raucous 
moments, including when she voted to cut the city's recreation programs to 
balance the budget. She points out, however, that local groups have continued 
most of the programs.  
</P>
<P>
 But on the campaign trail, her subject is primarily Harman and Clinton -- 
specifically, Harman's vote for Clinton's deficit-reduction plan, which 
included income tax increases aimed at high earners. (Harman's campaign 
responded by giving Brooks a candy bar, a reminder that she was among the City 
Council members who urged state officials not to revoke the state snack tax in 
1992.) 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the Brooks broadsides, Harman is using the campaign stretch -- and 
her considerable resources -- to portray herself as above the partisan fray. 
Last week, she launched a series of broadcast television advertisements, one of 
which describes her as "tough, independent and on our side." In the ad, Harman 
makes no mention of Clinton and says: "My party leadership isn't always happy 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
 And although recent polls suggest that Clinton's popularity has picked up, it 
is unclear how much that will help Harman.  
</P>
<P>
 Said political analyst Jeffe: "It's clear that there appears to be a 
turnaround (to) some extent, but the question is: How dramatic?" 38th District  
</P>
<P>
 Democrats smell an upset of freshman Horn despite national trends that suggest 
the GOP could make substantial gains on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration figures in the district, which includes San Pedro and parts of 
Wilmington, favor the Democrats, and Mathews has raised enough money to run a 
strong campaign and has galvanized a corps of youthful volunteers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Can Horn really represent the middle-class and working-class people of the 
district, given his philosophy?" asks Mathews, a Cypress college associate 
professor, citing the incumbent's opposition to social spending. Mathews would 
become the first person who traces their heritage to India in Congress since 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Seasoned political observers, however, are skeptical of the Democrat's 
chances. They note that Horn, in winning the seat two years ago, showed that 
his generally moderate views are attractive to many registered Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn also has local successes to point to: He was a visible leader in the 
successful effort to keep the Long Beach Naval Shipyard operating as the 
federal base-closing commission announced shutdowns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've kept every promise," said Horn, a former president of Cal State Long 
Beach. "And I've worked hard to help the country and the people of our 
district."  
</P>
<P>
 Also on the ballot are Libertarian Lester W. Mueller and Peace and Freedom 
candidate Richard K. Green. 37th District  
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, running in a district that includes Carson, Wilmington and parts of 
San Pedro, has directed most of his energy to defending himself against charges 
that he took $30,000 in bribes during his tenure as Compton's mayor. He pleaded 
not guilty in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "The indictment is not a secret to anyone," he said. "The people who are 
supporting me are supporting me in spite of (the) indictment, and that has been 
very positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker's troubles have invigorated the race of Libertarian Guy Wilson, a 
merchant seaman who is his only challenger. Wilson has raised more than 
$19,000, a rare feat for a third-party challenger, and bought more than 30 
billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wilson's ideas is repealing the 16th Amendment, which established the 
income tax, and issuing vouchers to parents so they can send their children to 
either public or private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would give people the opportunity to uplift themselves," Wilson said.  
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro businessman Lew Prulitsky has also launched a write-in campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always someone in the wings willing to run, particularly if there's 
someone in trouble, going through tough times," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "Believe you me, this is the big leagues. There needs to be someone 
educated, someone qualified, someone who cares and grew up in the district." 
</P>
<P>
 As examples of his accomplishments, Tucker said that he has been able to 
secure a new transportation manufacturing plant in Carson and a youth center in 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't have to worry about reelection, political analysts say. Prulitsky 
was handily beaten by Tucker in the Democratic primary, despite news reports 
that the congressman would be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of, shall we say, controversial news accompanied us even into the 
primary," Tucker said. "We weathered that storm and, with God's help, we will 
fight another battle." 35th District  
</P>
<P>
 Waters is expected to have an easy victory in one of the state's most heavily 
Democratic districts. It includes Gardena, Hawthorne and Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters' opponent, Republican businessman Nate Truman, ran against her in 1992, 
and she beat him handily. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's campaigning here," said Truman, owner of a computer graphics 
company. "Republicans have in a lot of ways written (the district) off. 
Everyone's written these people off, so with my candidacy at least they have a 
choice between two ideologies." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many issues that divide them is Proposition 187, which would bar 
government services to illegal immigrants. Truman supports it and Waters 
opposes it.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: WHETTING THE APPETITE FOR SHOPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Going out to eat is an indulgence, and while no restaurant can literally save 
you money, a conveniently located restaurant in the South Bay can actually help 
cut down on your grocery bill: Bristol's Cafe inside sleek Bristol Farms in 
Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 We've often heard the sensible advice not to go shopping while hungry. That 
especially holds true at Bristol Farms, a gourmet shop the size of a 
supermarket. The choices here are so varied and tempting -- everything from 
imported French butter and cheeses to a mousse of foie gras from the respected 
purveyor D'Artagnan -- that if I attempt to roll my cart down the aisles while 
I'm hungry, my appetite ends up emptying my wallet. The simple cure? Stop in 
first for a bite at the market's casual Bristol's Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued by his mom's cooking, the cafe's chef Bruce Jacobs knew at an early 
age he wanted to cook for a living. In the seventh grade, the Massachusetts 
native enrolled in a home economics cooking class. The move brought a barrage 
of verbal attacks from his friends as fierce as those heard when Red Sox fans 
turned on Carl Yastrzemski after he struck out in the 1967 World Series at 
Fenway Park. Jacobs had the last laugh, however, because, he says, "Being the 
only guy in class, it was a great way to meet girls." 
</P>
<P>
 At Bristol's Cafe Jacobs tries his hand at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Early 
shoppers can stop in for bagels with cream cheese and Nova lox ($6.50) or "the 
good, bad & ugly" ($5.75), two eggs over easy on tortillas with ham, jack 
cheese, salsa, avocado and home fries. Specials might include French toast 
stuffed with cream cheese and strawberries, topped with pecan butter and served 
with bacon or sausage ($4.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Two appealing choices from the sandwich lineup are the shrimp and avocado club 
with a remoulade sauce ($6.95) and the grilled veggie mozzarella sandwich with 
eggplant, zucchini, summer squash, mushrooms, red bell peppers and fresh basil 
on a baguette ($5.95). 
</P>
<P>
 After 4 p.m. the cafe serves dinner specials such as the Mediterranean medley 
of bay scallops, shrimp and baby clams sauteed with garlic, peppers, capers and 
tomatoes in a white wine sauce ($12.95) served over linguine. On Fridays, 
nearly everyone orders the cioppino ($12.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you're not shopping, Bristol's Cafe is worth a stop for a casual meal 
of simple, fresh food. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristol's Cafe is at 1570 Rosecrans Ave., Manhattan Beach. (310) 643-5229. 
Open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day. Window service is open at 7 a.m. for patio or 
to-go orders. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

 FALLING FAST 
</P>
<P>
 Before football season opened, a confident Serra High assistant coach said the 
Cavaliers had comparable talent -- on paper, at least -- to the 1989 team that 
was 14-0 and won the Southern Section Division VII title. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's time to throw that paper in the waste basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra (4-4) probably won't even make the playoffs after falling to 0-3 in the 
Mission League with Friday's 28-14 loss at Chaminade. The disappointing season 
has left Cavalier coaches scratching their heads and pointing fingers, mainly 
at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary scapegoat appears to be first-year offensive coordinator Scott 
Altenberg, whose system has been criticized by Coach Charles Nash and others on 
the staff for being too complicated for high school players. Serra, despite a 
wealth of offensive weapons, has averaged only 11 points a game in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hindsight is always better, but I think some things we've done in some 
instances were a little too complex," Nash said. "Looking back, I think simpler 
would have been better." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to simplify the offense, Nash said Serra has changed some of its 
blocking schemes and adopted a more run-oriented attack. But the changes might 
be too little, too late. The Cavaliers need to win their last two games against 
St. Bernard and Bishop Montgomery, and St. Francis needs to lose one of its 
remaining games in order for Serra to gain the league's third and last playoff 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 If Serra continues to play like it did Friday against Chaminade, it won't win 
again this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers botched three punts that led to three short scoring drives for 
Chaminade, and quarterback DeWayne Hervey completed only six of 24 passes for 
59 yards. Hervey, a returning starter who has struggled as a senior, will be 
replaced by junior Darnell Lacy in Friday night's game at St. Bernard. WHIZ KID 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the brightest part of the football season at Serra has been the play 
of freshman Brice Montgomery, who has scored 27 touchdowns in leading the 
sophomore team to a 7-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, a two-way starter at tailback and cornerback, cannot play on the 
varsity team this season because he is only 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was 15, for sure I would have brought him up," Nash said. "He's a 
tremendous talent." ON THE BUBBLE 
</P>
<P>
 Carson High, the 1993 City Section 4-A Division football champion, might not 
have the opportunity to defend its title after being forced to forfeit two 
Southern Pacific Conference victories because of an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 The forfeits have left Carson in fifth place at 2-3 in the eight-team 
conference. Judging by the remaining games, the best Carson can realistically 
hope for is a fourth-place finish. That may or may not be good enough to get 
the Colts in the 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 teams judged to be the best in the section will be placed in the 4-A 
playoffs after the season, with the next 16 placed in the 3-A bracket. The new 
selection process begins next week when coaches from each of the six 
conferences meet to rank their teams, one through eight, and recommend which 
teams, if any, should be placed in the 4-A and 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The results will then be turned over to a seeding committee, which will 
determine the playoff draws Nov. 11 based on the coaches' recommendations, 
strength of conference, past records and, if necessary, strength of 
nonconference schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned. WINGING IT 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity level figures to be turned up Friday night when Serra visits St. 
Bernard in a game with playoff implications. Adding to the highly charged 
atmosphere will be the season's most intriguing coaching matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard's offensive coordinator is Kevin Crawley, who was dismissed as 
Serra's coach midway through last season. Crawley was added to the staff after 
the Vikings lost their opener against Culver City, 26-12. He is using the same 
offense, the run-oriented wing-T, that he did at Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Culver City game, I knew we needed help with the offense and more 
help with the line," said St. Bernard co-coach Bob Yarnall, who took over the 
team with Tom Burgess after Mike Noonan resigned as coach shortly before the 
season. "Lo and behold, (Crawley) showed up. He said he saw the Culver City 
game and would be glad to help out in any way, even if it was carrying water. I 
talked with him and was very impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Yarnall made several inquiries and came to the conclusion that Crawley's 
dismissal at Serra was caused by parental pressure. Crawley came under fire at 
Serra for allegedly being verbally abusive to his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarnall said Crawley has exhibited no such behavior at St. Bernard. HEIR 
APPARENT 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Sarkisian can't seem to get out from under the shadow of John Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were quarterbacks at West Torrance High in 1990 when Walsh transferred to 
Carson for his senior year, leaving Sarkisian, a junior, as West's starter. 
Now, Sarkisian has his sights set on replacing Walsh again. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino College sophomore has given an unwritten commitment to transfer 
to Brigham Young University, where he hopes to succeed Walsh as the Cougars' 
quarterback next season. Walsh, a junior, is expected to skip his senior year 
in favor of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkisian, who has completed 71% of his passes for 2,533 yards and 25 
touchdowns this season, will lead El Camino (7-0) against Long Beach (7-1) in a 
showdown for first place in the Northern Division of the Mission Conference at 
7 p.m. Saturday at Veterans Stadium. He passed for 354 yards and four TDs 
Saturday in a 35-14 victory over Mt. San Antonio to become El Camino's career 
passing leader with 5,503 yards, breaking the previous record of 5,448 yards 
set by Tim Green (Aviation High, USC) in 1981-82. ROAD KILL 
</P>
<P>
 The home-field advantage definitely means something to the South Torrance High 
football team. The Spartans are 4-0 at home and 0-4 on the road after Friday's 
35-3 loss at Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just haven't played well on the road," South Coach Mike Christensen said. 
"We haven't showed up. Our kids are aware of it, but we can't seem to do 
anything about it. We turned the ball over three times inside Mira Costa's 20. 
You can't do that against a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for the Spartans is that they return home to play Morningside on 
Friday night. They close out the season Nov. 10 at El Segundo. If South wins 
both games, Christensen believes the team can finish in fourth place in the 
Ocean League and gain an at-large berth in the Division VII playoffs. South is 
in fifth place at 2-3, but fourth-place Redondo (3-2) finishes against Culver 
City and Mira Costa, the league's top two teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad because it's out of our control, but I think we can do it," 
Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 On another note, Christensen said tailback Chad Morton will not play again 
this season after suffering a broken collarbone in South's opener Sept. 9. In 
Morton's absence, quarterback-tailback Mel Miller has had to shoulder most of 
the offensive load. He leads the team in passing, rushing and scoring. KNIGHT 
MOVES 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery, regarded as the area's second-best prep girls' volleyball 
team behind Mira Costa, went unbeaten in seven matches Saturday to win the 
championship of the Redondo tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by tournament most valuable player Cindy Weglarz, the Knights defeated 
Culver City, Peninsula, Whittier Christian and El Toro to reach the playoff 
round, where they beat Palisades, El Toro and South Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Area players joining Weglarz on the all-tournament team were Heidi Ilustre and 
Teri Zartman of Bishop Montgomery, Allison Root and Angela Daywalt of runner-up 
South, and Percilla Donald and Heather Peters of Redondo. NOTABLE 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor College, playing its second consecutive game without ailing Coach Don 
Weems, posted its first victory of the season Saturday by defeating host Santa 
Monica, 14-9, in a Western State Conference football game. The Seahawks are 
1-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount had its 12-match winning streak snapped last weekend, but 
still managed to keep its grip on first place in the West Coast Conference 
women's volleyball race. Pepperdine upset Loyola, 15-13, 2-15, 15-12, 2-15, 
15-13, Saturday at Firestone Fieldhouse, leaving the Lions (15-7, 9-1 in the 
WCC) with a two-match lead over second-place San Diego (16-7, 7-3) with four 
matches remaining. Loyola, seeking its second conference title and first since 
1986, plays at San Francisco on Friday night. ROB FERNAS

SCHOOL BOARD CANDIDATES TAKE AIM AT DISTRICT CHIEF; EDUCATION: CENTINELA VALLEY 
RIVALS ANN BIRDSALL AND JOHN DRAGONE JR. CRITICIZE SUPT. JOSEPH M. CARRILLO AND 
HIS HANDLING OF FINANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike the acrimonious races of the past, this fall's special election for an 
open seat on the Centinela Valley Union High School District board has been 
marked by little mudslinging. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Ann Birdsall and John Dragone Jr. have chosen instead to target 
current Supt. Joseph M. Carrillo for problems they say plague the district. 
</P>
<P>
 In two previous elections, challengers spent much of their time attacking 
incumbents over the district's problems, including racial discrimination suits, 
labor disputes and fiscal mismanagement that nearly left the district insolvent 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This election, Carrillo's management style has come under attack. Birdsall, a 
former board member, and Dragone are vying for a seat left open when board 
President Pamela Sturgeon left her post in June to move to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the board has been deadlocked on key issues, with two longtime 
board members siding with the administration, and two recently elected members 
criticizing Carrillo. The winner Tuesday is likely to break the tie. But both 
candidates said they would not necessarily vote against Carrillo.  
</P>
<P>
 Birdsall and Dragone agree on many issues, including a need to change the way 
Carrillo handles the district's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Birdsall criticized Carrillo's practice of signing district purchase orders 
before seeking board approval, saying that past officials were less than 
forthcoming about the district's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what you've got to do to make sure no one is breaking the rules. It's 
to keep everything on the up and up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Birdsall says the practice is against board policy. Current board members have 
split on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Dragone questioned Carrillo's use of outside contractors to do work that 
Dragone says could be done by district employees for less money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very costly," Dragone said, adding that the district should purchase 
equipment and use the district's maintenance staff to do things such as carpet 
cleaning and plumbing. "If you have paid people on the books, utilize them." 
</P>
<P>
 Both said Carrillo's proposal to open a magnet school that would cater to the 
district's brightest students is misguided. Overcrowding at the district's main 
schools, Leuzinger High and Hawthorne High, shows a need to open a 
comprehensive high school on the former Lawndale High School site, they say.  
</P>
<P>
 In the only attack between the opponents, Dragone linked Birdsall's six years 
on the board during the 1980s to the fiscal crisis of three years ago. In 1989, 
Birdsall, along with former board members Aleta Collins and Herbert Bartelt, 
held a majority on the five-member board. All three, who were supporters of 
then-Supt. McKinley Nash, were voted out of office that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dragone believes that the district's decline began during Birdsall's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (Birdsall) and her two colleagues controlled the school board, they not 
only failed to solve the problems, they created them," Dragone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Birdsall maintains that the district was in good financial shape when she was 
ousted, and that subsequent administrations were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Birdsall, 54, who lost a bid for a board seat in 1993, is a part-time records 
clerk at El Camino College. She has a grandson who attends Leuzinger.  
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of a race-related brawl on the Leuzinger campus last month, 
Birdsall says she will make school safety a top priority.  
</P>
<P>
 Stepping up enforcement of the district's anti-gang attire policy, random use 
of hand-held metal detectors and beginning an anti-truancy program at Leuzinger 
are essential to a safe school environment, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Making neighborhood "safe houses" available to students walking to and from 
campus and separating students by using two lunch periods will help alleviate 
student tensions and fears, Birdsall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people in this community are to the point where they want to free up 
their community . . . to make it safe for the kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dragone, 33, a manager of a company that moves freight through U.S. Customs, 
also ran for the board in 1993. This time he is running on a platform of "zero 
tolerance," a policy that calls for the immediate expulsion of students who 
seriously threaten the safety of other students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He proposes requiring parents of disruptive children to attend classes with 
them. Dragone has two children attending elementary school in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 Dragone agrees with Birdsall that lax enforcement of the district's anti-gang 
dress code must be changed, but Dragone opposes the use of hand-held metal 
detectors.

 DEAR SOS: I'd love to have the recipe for Chasen's Hobo Steak.  
</P>
<P>
 -- BILL 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR BILL: Maude Chasen of Chasen's in Beverly Hills provided the recipe in 
1978. The method of finishing the steak in a chafing dish at the table is 
typical of Continental service, which one rarely sees today. (Chasen's is one 
of the few restaurants in Los Angeles still practicing table-side service.) The 
use of fat and a salt crust is a classic flavoring trick for sealing meat 
juices. Both the fat and salt crust are discarded before the steak is finished. 
It's a great steak to serve when company comes because it can be cooked ahead 
and finished just before serving. CHASEN'S HOBO STEAK 
</P>
<P>
 1 (3-inch-thick) New York steak 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1/4-inch-thick) strip beef fat, as wide as steak is thick or several 
smaller pieces of fat 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
 Sourdough French bread, cut into 3x1 1/2x1/4-inch slices, toasted 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 Season steak to taste with pepper. Wrap fat around steak to cover sides 
completely but not top or bottom of steak. Tie around sides with 1 string near 
top or bottom or steak. Tie another string over steak to hold fat securely. 
Combine salt and water to make mush. Mound mush over top of steak, covering 
meat completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Place steak under broiler and broil 8 to 10 minutes, depending on size. Remove 
salt crust, keeping crust in 1 piece. Turn steak over and place salt on other 
side. Broil another 8 to 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove steak from oven and discard salt and fat. Slice meat, cutting slightly 
on diagonal. Heat butter in chafing dish or large skillet until foaming and 
lightly browned. Place meat, few slices at time, in foaming butter. Cook to 
desired degree of doneness. Allow about 1 minute on each side for rare. Place 
each slice of meat on 1 slice of toast and spoon some of hot butter over. Makes 
2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 415 calories; 863 mg sodium; 111 mg cholesterol; 23 grams fat; 19 grams 
carbohydrates; 30 grams protein; 0.07 gram fiber.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; CITY COUNCIL MOVES TO SHIFT FISCAL YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week made the first move toward creating a new fiscal 
year designed to give incoming council members more influence over budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The new year, if approved by the council, will run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, 
beginning in 1996.Currently, the fiscal year is July 1 to June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fiscal year would allow new council members, who take office July 1, 
three months to consider a budget before voting. The new schedule would also 
give city staff more time to react to the state's budget, which has taken city 
revenue in recent years. The state budget is supposed to be approved by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Alan Lowenthal and Jenny Oropeza opposed the proposed change, 
saying it wouldn't give newly elected members enough time to learn the budget 
and all its issues before voting. The council voted 6 to 2 Tuesday to direct 
the city attorney to prepare all the documents to make the change. Once the 
legal documents are ready, which will take about four weeks, the council is 
expected to make a final decision. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LA MIRADA; COUNCIL GIVES AILING PLAYHOUSE A REPRIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will allow the financially strapped La Mirada Playhouse to 
continue using the city's Theatre for the Performing Arts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The council acted last week after the playhouse's manager handed over a 
$14,000 check to pay some of the back rent owed to the city."I feel like we 
have been given a reprieve," said Yolanda Robinson, the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was considering evicting the playhouse, City Manager Gary Sloan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said she cut her salary from $18,000 to $12,000, and tightened the 
budget for sets. Paid directors and designers also offered to work for free. 
</P>
<P>
 But the playhouse still owes $16,000, and the debt could approach $60,000 
before the season ends in June, said Richard D. Patton, city finance director. 
The playhouse pays about $15,000 rent for each production, which includes 
rehearsal time and use of the city's lighting, sound and technical crew. 
</P>
<P>
 The community theater group usually produces about four Broadway-style shows a 
season. The group has three shows remaining this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said the playhouse hopes to get out of the red by cutting costs and 
stepping up fund raising, marketing and advertising. The playhouse's financial 
problems have been attributed to sagging ticket sales. Season ticket sales 
dropped from about $186,000 in 1990 to $126,000 for the 1994-95 season, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson will retire at season's end, and will be replaced by two volunteers. 
She said she is resigning after 33 years because she wants time to write, paint 
and pursue other artistic endeavors. JOHN CANALIS

ELECTION ROUNDUP; WATER BOARD ELECTIONS GRAB SPOTLIGHT AMONG LOCAL POLITICAL 
RACES; CANDIDATES: A RECORD 30 PEOPLE ARE VYING FOR EIGHT SEATS IN THREE 
DISTRICTS. SCHOOLS POSTS ARE ALSO OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND and EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several lower-profile races in the Southeast area will be decided Tuesday as 
voters sort through dozens of candidates vying for seats on water districts and 
school boards. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, water board elections have attracted the most attention. A record 30 
candidates are seeking eight seats in the Central Basin Municipal Water 
District, West Basin Municipal Water District and the Water Replenishment 
District of Southern California. The agencies store and distribute water 
throughout the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents and challengers alike wonder why so many candidates are running for 
the obscure posts. Some contenders appear to be true water buffs -- engineers, 
environmentalists and others with a passion for water issues. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four of the candidates have ties to former Rep. Mervyn Dymally and 
are affiliated with the nonprofit Robert Smith Water Institute that Dymally 
created earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say Dymally is trying to stack the powerful water boards with his 
allies -- including his son. Mark Dymally lists himself as president of the 
water institute and three other candidates -- Charles M. Trevino, Joann S. 
Williams and Richard Mayer -- list themselves as institute directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mervyn Dymally acknowledges that the candidates are affiliated with the 
institute, but both he and his son deny that the organization is backing any 
candidate. Mark Dymally said the institute, as a nonprofit entity, is barred by 
state law from involvement in political activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local races and issues: 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Municipal Court Judge 
</P>
<P>
 This race between Compton Municipal Court Commissioners Thomas Townsend and 
Kelvin D. Filer has featured accusations that the city has attempted to 
interfere with Townsend's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, city officials notified Townsend that he would have to remove 
some of his campaign signs because they violated a municipal law prohibiting 
such advertisements on fences and street corners, among other places. Townsend 
took the city to court, saying officials were selectively enforcing the law 
against him, an allegation officials denied. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the city agreed not to enforce the law and Townsend agreed not to 
take any further legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Bar Assn., whose rating is highly valued by judicial 
candidates, has rated Filer "well qualified" and Townsend "not qualified." A 
letter from the association's judicial evaluation committee said that 
Townsend's objectivity was in question and that the committee believed Townsend 
had preconceptions that could affect his judgment of the law. Townsend said the 
negative rating was the result of insider politics and his aggressive campaign 
against Filer. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District 
</P>
<P>
 Five people are vying in a special election to fill an empty Norwalk-La Mirada 
school board seat. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada businessman David H. Cosper was appointed to the board in June, but 
had to vacate the seat in July when a group of citizens successfully petitioned 
to hold a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosper is running for the seat. The other candidates are Richard A. Blodgett, 
a Norwalk house painter; Jason Garber, a Norwalk salesman; Eliseo (Lee) Millen, 
a La Mirada teacher, and Kim Marie Geiger, a Norwalk homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will fill the seat vacated last April by Jesse M. Luera, who 
resigned with more than three years left in his term, after he was elected to 
the Norwalk City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell Joint School District 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Janet Averill, Jerry Powell and Gayle Rogers and Whittier 
businessman Bob Sargent are vying for the three seats on the Lowell Joint 
School District board. The district serves Whittier and La Habra Heights in Los 
Angeles County, and La Habra in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Proposition D 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely have so few objected to spending so much in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition D, a proposal to sell $48 million in bonds to make the city 
accessible to the disabled, has been endorsed by a City Council that has a 
history of distancing itself from measures that ask taxpayers for money. Last 
month, in fact, Mayor Beverly O'Neill and eight council members appeared en 
masse at a downtown march in favor of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean the bond measure is a shoo-in, however. Supporters need a 
two-thirds' vote to win. The Englander Group, a political consulting firm 
helping out the "Yes On D" campaign, conducted a 200-person telephone poll last 
month and found widespread support, but not enough, said consultant Peter 
Murphy. The poll found 53% would vote yes, 17% were opposed, and 29% were 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond money would be spent to create wheelchair-accessible curbs, bus stops 
and buildings, to install a hydraulic lift at the Belmont Plaza Pool, and to 
purchase listening devices in City Council chambers, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 If voters reject the bond, the city will face a real predicament: how to raise 
the money and bring the city in line with the 1990 Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA). Long Beach, like most other municipalities, is already behind 
schedule, acknowledged Dolores Barrows, the city's ADA coordinator. The federal 
law set a deadline of Jan. 26, 1995, for compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 El Rancho Unified School District Proposition C 
</P>
<P>
 Pico Rivera residents will vote on a $13-million bond measure to fund 
renovations at city schools and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of El Rancho Unified School District, which serves Pico Rivera, say 
money generated by Proposition C is needed to make the district's 16 schools 
earthquake safe and accessible to wheelchairs. The funds would also pay for 
repairs at other district buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the measure contend that repairs should be put off until the 
district can afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, proposed by the district's school board, would extend for 25 
years an annual property tax of $26 that was established in 1969 to pay off a 
$5-million bond for school facilities. The tax will expire in July if 
two-thirds of the voters do not approve the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos Proposition B 
</P>
<P>
 Voters are being asked to move the date of City Council elections to 
odd-numbered years. The measure, which requires a majority vote to pass, would 
move the April, 1996, election to March, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The city wants to distance its elections from statewide and presidential 
races, which are held in even-numbered years. Council members whose terms 
expire in 1996 and 1998 would get 11-month term extensions.

ELECTION ROUNDUP; FAMILIAR FACES, SPIRITED CHALLENGES; ELECTIONS: SOME 
INCUMBENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE RETURNED TO OFFICE, BUT NOT WITHOUT BEING GIVEN A 
RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.

 Voters across southeast Los Angeles County are expected to return several 
familiar faces to office next week, but challengers in some races are making 
spirited bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list of close matchups is the 38th Congressional District contest 
between Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) and Democrat Peter Mathews, who hopes to 
buck what many political observers predict will be a banner year for GOP 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration figures in the district -- where 52% of voters are Democrats and 
36% Republicans -- appear to favor Mathews. But the figures themselves do not 
tell the whole story. Political observers say that conservative Democrats in 
the district do not hesitate to cross party lines. Horn, who has won support 
for his moderate brand of politics, may have the advantage because of his 
appeal to such voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In two other closely watched races, state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) 
and Assemblywoman Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach) are facing stiff challenges by 
well-organized Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 28th Senate District race, Republican David Barrett Cohen, an attorney 
from Redondo Beach, has tried to paint Dills as an entrenched politician tied 
closely to special interests. Dills, 84, who has served longer than any 
lawmaker in California history, has focused on Cohen's missteps, including 
erroneous allegations that Dills collected a legislative pension while in the 
Senate. Karnette is facing Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Steve Kuykendall, the 
Republican candidate in the 54th Assembly District, in which Democrats slightly 
outnumber Republicans.

 Background: Rep. Walter R. Tucker III is the overwhelming favorite despite 
facing charges that he took $30,000 in bribes during his tenure as Compton's 
mayor. He is opposed by a write-in candidate, San Pedro businessman Lew 
Prulitsky, whom Tucker swamped in the Democratic primary, and a Libertarian 
opponent who received 45 votes in gaining his party's nomination in the June 
contest. Tucker, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges, has directed most 
of his energy to his legal defense.

<P>
 Background: Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) is facing an aggressive challenge 
from Democrat Peter Mathews, a Cypress college associate professor. Democrats 
think Mathews may have an advantage because of the district's strong Democratic 
registration. Mathews would become the first American of Indian descent in 
Congress since 1963. Horn, seeking his second term in the House, believes his 
moderate views and a reputation for tending to local issues will help him win.

 Background: Freshman Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) appears to have the advantage 
in this Republican-dominated district that straddles Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. Nevertheless, Royce's Democratic challenger, R.O. (Bob) Davis of 
Buena Park, thinks he will find support among moderate Republicans angered by 
Royce's opposition to the national crime bill and other important legislation. 
Royce says he voted for the original version of the crime bill but opposed a 
watered-down plan that emerged after congressional negotiations.

 Background: Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) has a lock on his fourth term. 
Murray's only opponent, Republican Richard A. Rorex of Gardena, withdrew in 
July after deciding to take a job with the U.S. Postal Service. Federal 
employees are prohibited from holding partisan public offices. Rorex's name 
will still appear on the ballot. Murray will have to relinquish his seat at the 
end of his next term because of voter-mandated term limits.

 Background: First-term Democratic incumbent Betty Karnette of Long Beach is 
facing a serious challenge from Republican Steve Kuykendall, the mayor of 
Rancho Palos Verdes, in a district in which Democrats have an edge over 
Republicans. As of Sept. 30, the end of the most recent campaign reporting 
period, both had raised more than $150,000. Two years ago, Karnette upset 
14-year incumbent Gerald Felando in the newly redrawn district.

 Background: Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) hopes to win a third 
term in a district that is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. 
Horcher, who calls himself a "mainstream candidate," thinks his appeal to 
moderates and conservatives will make the difference. He faces Democrat Andrew 
M. (Andy) Ramirez, a political consultant who has raised less than $4,000 but 
says he is walking precincts to introduce himself to voters. Ramirez says 
Horcher's defeat recently in a special election to fill a vacant state Senate 
seat showed Horcher's limited voter base, but Horcher says he maintains 
widespread support in the Assembly district.

 Background: This race is shaping up to be a classic contest between an upstart 
challenger and an entrenched incumbent. Republican David Barrett Cohen hopes to 
unseat veteran state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo). Cohen has hammered 
Dills on his long tenure, his pensions and his special-interest contributions, 
which include funding from liquor, gambling and tobacco interests. Dills, 
meanwhile, has seized on his opponent's fumbles. Cohen's charge that Dills 
collected a legislative pension while in the Senate turned out to be false, and 
Cohen sent a letter of apology.

 Background: Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Montebello) appears headed for a 
second full term despite recent controversy over campaign finances. 
Investigators for the state Fair Political Practices Commission found he had 
improperly dipped into his campaign treasury to pay for personal items, 
including tennis clothes. Calderon's only opponent, Republican Ken Gow, said he 
decided not to raise the issue of campaign finances because he doesn't expect 
to win. He has raised less than $1,000.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MONTEBELLO; CITY PLANS CENTER FOR EMERGENCY TRAINING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is planning a $5-million regional emergency training complex for 
police, firefighters and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire and police officials realized after the Northridge earthquake that more 
volunteer workers are needed and that police officers and firefighters need 
additional training, said Steve Huson, Montebello fire battalion chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, to be built in Montebello or Santa Fe Springs, would offer 
training in first aid, emergency evacuations, rescues from collapsed buildings, 
shelter management and communications. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has received a $1-million federal grant from the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development and Department of Veterans Affairs to help fund 
the training center. Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) helped obtain the 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials plan to seek private donations, additional federal monies or funds 
from area cities to make up the balance, Huson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex would serve Montebello, Pico Rivera, Commerce, Downey, Santa Fe 
Springs, Whittier, Monterey Park, East Los Angeles, Norwalk, Compton, Vernon 
and La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to obtain the remaining funds and begin construction next year.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PICO RIVERA; WATER BOARD URGED TO TIGHTEN EXPENSE POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Auditors have urged Pico Water District officials to tighten their spending 
procedures after discovering that officials apparently failed to document 
thousands of dollars of petty-cash expenditures and credit card purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit found no wrongdoing but pointed out that the district had no written 
policies for filling out receipts or providing other documentation for the 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Joe Dermody said the district has established rules requiring 
board members and other officials to document spending. "We require receipts on 
everything now," Dermody said. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, completed last month by Vilmure, Peeler & Boucher of Whittier, 
examined $29,300 in petty-cash expenditures for six years through December, 
1993, and $8,300 in credit card charges from August, 1991, when the cards were 
issued to board members and the general manager, through December, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 The accountants said there were no receipts for about $4,800 in cash 
expenditures and $1,800 in credit card charges. An additional $1,500 in credit 
card charges for lunches included receipts but no explanation of why the meals 
were considered business expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The board ordered the audit after firing General Manager Harold Maupin in 
October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Fred Silva had accused Maupin and other board members of spending 
thousands of dollars unnecessarily over the previous three years on such items 
as lavish banquets and expensive hotel rooms. Maupin had insisted that the 
expenses were legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he was disappointed that the audit didn't include names of 
officials who failed to provide adequate receipts. Board President Lydia Mae 
Mercado praised the report. "It was done well and done professionally," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to review the audit report today. JOHN D. WAGNER

<P>
 A lawsuit that had temporarily stalled the $1.8-billion Alameda Corridor 
project has been dropped by four cities along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing Compton, Lynwood, South Gate and Vernon filed papers in 
Superior Court last month to dismiss the lawsuit against the Port of Long 
Beach. Port officials had pulled out of the project in August, contending they 
could not negotiate corridor matters with cities that were suing the port. Port 
officials resumed work on the project after the suit was withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities agreed to drop the lawsuit after the port promised to include in 
the environmental impact report a statement that the Alameda Corridor will 
mitigate Pier J traffic. JOHN CANALIS

COVER STORY; KEEPING TOURISM AFLOAT; LONG BEACH PINS ITS FUTURE ON SPLASHY 
WATERFRONT DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the edge of the vast asphalt desert that separates downtown Long Beach from 
the shoreline, a lone tattoo parlor and a weathered, domed building stand as 
the sole survivors of an era when the city reigned as the busiest tourist spot 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 This desolate place, visible from the 14-story City Hall building to the 
north, serves as a painful reminder that not since the heyday of the bustling 
Pike amusement park has Long Beach been able to woo the tourists it once did. 
</P>
<P>
 But city leaders hope to change that with an ambitious, $557-million 
waterfront development covering a 310-acre area that includes land once 
occupied by The Pike. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials envision that in about 10 years, tourists, conventioneers and 
Long Beach residents will stroll along sprawling, richly landscaped waterfront 
walkways, board historic ships from floating docks, dine in one of many 
restaurants overlooking a new harbor -- created from a dredged Shoreline Lagoon 
-- and discover undersea wonders at a $100-million state-of-the-art aquarium, 
the project's centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors could picnic in lush parkland, stop for dessert at a sidewalk cafe, 
catch a dinner cruise or shop in quaint retail outlets before dancing the night 
away at a club. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate goal of the Queensway Bay development, said City Manager James C. 
Hankla, is "to re-establish Long Beach as the largest and most compelling 
waterfront tourist destination in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood of the attraction promises to be far different from that of The Pike, 
which closed in 1979. For starters, there won't be a roller coaster or fun 
house. There won't be showmen like motorcycle daredevil Reckless Ross and 
maverick dentist Painless Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 The south side of the harbor, near the Queen Mary, will have an outdoor 
amphitheater, where concert-goers can watch performances under the stars. There 
also will be musicians and mime troupes. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is patterned after a successful waterfront development that turned a 
blighted urban harbor in Baltimore into a bustling tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the aquarium, Long Beach officials have selected an attraction that 
draws millions of visitors every year in other cities. So many cities have 
built aquariums, in fact, that an Associated Press business writer dubbed the 
1990s: "the spawning of the Age of Aquariums." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that the Queensway Bay project would create 3,500 jobs 
and pump about $275 million a year into the Long Beach economy. And residents 
would gain an attraction that costs nothing to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can walk around and enjoy the waterfront and not spend one penny unless 
you want to," said Phil F. Infelise, a retired banker who chairs the Queensway 
Bay Citizen Advisory Committee, which meets with residents to promote the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By connecting shops, promenades, restaurants and the new harbor, the city 
intends to link downtown with the shoreline, a connection that was lost when 
landfills moved the shoreline hundreds of feet south. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials launched the project after Walt Disney Co. decided three years 
ago against Long Beach as a site for a proposed $3-billion theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney's enthusiasm for Long Beach showed us that there is a substantial 
opportunity here that we should not allow to pass by," Hankla said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitious plan does have its critics. Some see the development as a costly 
gamble for a city grappling with severe budget cuts and struggling to raise 
millions of dollars for such projects as making the city more accessible to the 
disabled and upgrading an overtaxed 911 emergency system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't sufficient financing to run the city's existing services 
properly," Long Beach resident Thomas Murphy said at a recent City Council 
meeting. "(The project) will create even more economic problems, adding another 
white elephant to the costly and impractical decisions that were so prevalent 
with our past elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
 The development, according to estimates by its architects, would require about 
$125 million from the city, about $40 million from the Port of Long Beach and 
nearly $400 million from private investors and developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously approved the Queensway Bay plan in March, and has 
chosen a company to oversee a bond issue to pay for the aquarium. The bond 
issue will not require voter approval. The bonds would be repaid through income 
from parking, admission and concession fees. Officials also have ordered an 
environmental impact report and have begun securing the necessary permits.  
</P>
<P>
 A $120-million expansion of the Convention Center, now considered part of the 
initial phase of the Queensway plan, was finished in July. The renovations 
nearly tripled the size of the exhibit hall -- from 88,000 to 224,000 square 
feet -- and the meeting room space -- from 21,000 to about 61,000 square feet. 
The expansion puts the Long Beach center among the 10 largest in the state, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Convention Center last month hosted its first major convention since the 
expansion, a three-day League of California Cities conference. About 2,500 
municipal officials attended from throughout the state.  
</P>
<P>
 The aquarium proposal is the key to the development, critics and proponents 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crucial part of the plan is bringing in private sector dollars, and the 
way to do that is to have a major attraction like the aquarium," said City 
Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal. "It's going to knock people's socks off, and 
people will be clamoring to do business in Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The aquarium gained significant momentum this summer when Kajima International 
Inc., a Japan-based developer, agreed to head up its planning. Kajima built an 
$84-million aquarium in Tampa, Fla., that is scheduled to open in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the city's Redevelopment Agency allocated $2.3 million toward the 
design of the aquarium. Kajima, which is not being paid for its work at this 
stage of the development, will use the money to pay a team of designers to 
begin drafting plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Two firms that worked on the Tampa aquarium -- Esherick Homsey Dodge and 
Davis, and Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum -- will serve as architects. 
Boston-based Joseph A. Wetzel Associates Inc., which also worked on the Tampa 
aquarium, will design the exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect construction to begin in September, 1995, and are predicting 
a 1998 opening. 
</P>
<P>
 But many longtime residents such as Murphy, who once owned a Western-style 
nightclub on The Pike, remain skeptical about waterfront redevelopment 
proposals. They can cite a succession of ill-fated attempts to redevelop The 
Pike land. 
</P>
<P>
 The amusement park, which had become overshadowed by more modern attractions 
such as Disneyland, closed in 1979 in anticipation that a Downey-based 
developer would build a $365-million complex of high-rise condominiums, hotel 
rooms, stores and offices. But the developer could not reach an agreement with 
the amusement company that leased the land. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the Planning Commission approved a plan by Dominion Property Co. of 
Santa Monica to build three high-rise residential towers on nine acres at the 
old Pike site. The deal fell through, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, Los Angeles developer Wayne Ratkovich proposed a $1-billion 
plan for a "city within a city," a complex of ocean-view condominiums, shops 
and offices. But after a two-year legal battle between the developers and 
environmentalists -- who contended that the city approved the project without 
studying its impact on traffic and air quality -- the recession had hit and 
funding for the plan dried up, city planning officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney entered in 1990, like a fairy-tale prince to rescue the city from its 
economic slumber. But its plan for a theme park fell through the next year. 
Although the project drew criticism on several fronts, officials said the deal 
finally collapsed because Disney executives could not persuade the Legislature 
to amend the state coastal laws to allow 250 acres of landfill in Long Beach 
harbor waters. 
</P>
<P>
 After Disney decided to pull the plug, the city scrambled to find a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach hired Ehrenkrantz & Eckstut Architects to pattern a plan after the 
successful Inner Harbor project in Baltimore. The firm was paid $225,000 by the 
city and $490,000 by the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly three years, the architects unveiled a five-part project to be 
built over 10 years. The city would pay $124.9 million for infrastructure 
costs, such as roadway improvements and parking structures. The Port of Long 
Beach would kick in $41.8 million to build a new, 478-slip marina. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach officials are hoping to avoid the pitfalls of the earlier 
development proposals by encouraging several investors to become involved 
during various stages, rather than trying to put up a massive development all 
at once. By avoiding major changes in the coastline, they also hope to avoid 
the issue that doomed the Disney plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dealing with many smaller developers gives us more flexibility," said Robert 
Paternoster, the city's director of building and planning who was recently 
named project manager for the Queensway Bay plan. "The project builds on 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Hankla and Paternoster said they are negotiating with some developers and 
retailers who are interested in the waterfront project, but they would not 
disclose details. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, cities large and small have turned to aquariums in an effort 
to boost their economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, aquariums have opened in New Orleans; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Corpus 
Christi, Tex.; Camden, N.J., and Newport, Ore. The National Aquarium in 
Baltimore added a dolphin pavilion, and the granddaddy of these attractions, 
the John G. Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, more than doubled its size. The Florida 
Aquarium in Tampa is set to open in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 By mixing family entertainment with environmental education, even aquariums in 
cities that have few other tourist attractions are reporting attendance figures 
of more than 1 million. The top marine museums average about 1 1/2 million 
visitors a year -- about triple this year's expected attendance at the Queen 
Mary -- and some approach 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love to watch these denizens of the deep," said Harrison Price, whose 
Torrance-based company conducts feasibility studies for museums and theme 
parks. "And it's a generally inexpensive outing at a time when inexpensive 
things have got an edge." 
</P>
<P>
 But the results have been mixed. In Camden, officials are struggling to keep 
their aquarium afloat after attendance dropped from 1.1 million in 1992 to 
about 600,000 last year. Several staff members also were laid off and the 
operating schedule was reduced from seven days a week to five days. 
</P>
<P>

 In Norwalk, Conn., the city has taken over payments for the Maritime Center, a 
facility featuring an aquarium, museum and movie theater. So far, the city has 
paid about $18 million toward the debt, said Jack Miller, Norwalk's director of 
finance. "Ours is not a disaster story, but we have had our birthing pains," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aquarium-building trend, which Price compared to the growth of theme parks 
triggered by Disneyland in the 1950s, began in 1981 with the National Aquarium 
in Baltimore. That attraction transformed the city's waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baltimore is a case study in urban renaissance," Price said. "The city was an 
absolute drag before this happened, and now new construction is abounding." 
</P>
<P>
 The $3-billion Baltimore project, far more costly than the Long Beach 
proposal, has been developed in stages over 30 years. Baltimore city 
spokeswoman Barbara Bonnell said the development has created 35,000 permanent 
jobs and brings about $550 million to the city annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Other aquariums are being planned in Southern California, and experts say the 
demand will be limited.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the greater L.A. and Orange County area, the first city to develop 
a major aquarium will get major visitor response," Price said. "It could work 
in one city. If it got funded, it could generate an operating profit, but it 
would take some dough to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Long Beach seems to have taken the lead, lining up a developer and 
setting a construction date. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro, the Los Angeles area's only 
aquarium, is planning a $50-million expansion that would triple its 20,000 
square feet of exhibit space. Officials from the aquarium, which is largely an 
educational and research facility with no large-scale exhibits, said they are 
meeting with consultants but do not have a specific plan for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles is planning a 
100,000-square-foot aquarium. Museum officials said they are negotiating with 
some possible developers but would not discuss details. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have pointed to Marineland, the Palos Verdes theme park and 
marine research center that closed in 1987, to support their claims that a 
local aquarium cannot succeed financially. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Marineland was a different type of institution, with unique problems, 
officials said. The 33-year-old park needed millions of dollars in renovations, 
coupled with high overhead costs for its research and performances featuring 
killer whales and dolphins -- which the Long Beach facility will not have. 
</P>
<P>
 Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. bought the park and moved its two star 
attractions -- the killer whales -- to the company's other marine park at the 
time, Sea World in San Diego. Without the whales, the company said at the time, 
Marineland could not attract enough visitors to justify keeping the park open. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Long Beach residents said they hope the Queensway plan will be 
successful. Others say they worry that taxpayers may get stuck with the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people like the idea, but they hope the city's not going to raise 
taxes to get this," said Ella Collins, a North Long Beach community activist 
and member of the Queensway advisory board. "They're just not sure if it's 
going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Infelise, the advisory board's chairman, insisted that the project will create 
jobs and tax revenue that will benefit the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenthal, the councilman, added: "It's exciting because we're creating this. 
It won't be Disney; it will be Long Beach. And when that idea catches on it 
will being back a real spirit." Queensway Bay Development

THEATER REVIEW; LOVE CONQUERS HATE IN 'REMEMBRANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if "the Troubles" in Ireland seem to be on their way to some sort of 
conclusion, a healing of the pain will be a long time coming. As one of the 
characters says in Graham Reid's "Remembrance" at International City Theatre in 
Long Beach, the hatred didn't begin in 1916; it's been around for hundreds of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The play begins in a graveyard in Northern Ireland, where Bert (Jack Axelrod) 
has come to visit the grave of his son, Sam, and Theresa (Bobbi Holtzman) has 
come to visit the grave of her son, Peter. They strike up a casual friendship 
that slowly ripens into something much more. 
</P>
<P>
 They're in their 60s but find that it's not too late for companionship and 
love. The only problem is their families, for Sam was Protestant and Peter was 
Catholic, slaughtered in the senseless, age-old struggle. Bert and Theresa have 
seen it all and, in their maturity, have found a wisdom that helps to obscure 
the prejudices that fire the young in any generation. 
</P>
<P>
 When her two volatile daughters and his alcoholic son discover the 
relationship, the expected explosions occur, and only the golden glow of the 
relationship between Bert and Theresa eventually tends to dampen their 
ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remembrance" is an oddly touching dramatic comedy, which is in no way 
dependent upon the Irish question. And that's to its benefit. Except for a 
denouement that too neatly wraps up unresolved questions, it is a gentle poem 
not only to late-blooming love, but to a true love that can rise above temporal 
improbability. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Shashin Desai treats the text with tender understanding and stages it 
effectively on Bradley Kaye's tri-part set, where both Bert and Theresa's 
homes, and the graveyard bench where they meet, are beautifully illuminated, 
like soft-focus album photos, in Paulie Jenkins' lighting design. 
</P>
<P>
 Axelrod is exceptional as Bert, displaying humor and a sly, knowing way with a 
phrase that gives his characterization a sense of the richness of his heart. 
Holtzman's Theresa shines with the inner light of a woman fatigued by a 
difficult life but refreshed in Bert's affection. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Bell Denton, as Theresa's bitter younger daughter, and particularly 
Judith Bohannon as her randy sister, whose husband is serving a life sentence 
for murder, are nicely etched portraits. Tom Sminkey is right on target as 
Bert's defensive and frustrated policeman son, and Betsy Mohler gives the son's 
ex-wife a nice sharp edge atop her sensible base. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Remembrance," International City Theatre, Long Beach City College, Clark 
Avenue and Harvey Way, Long Beach. 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 2 and 7 p.m. 
Sundays. Ends Nov. 15. $16. (310) 420-4128 or (310) 420-4051.

PEOPLE: SALON IS MODEL OF SUCCESS IN FASHION WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

 When Sylvia Lozano began charging a few dollars for haircuts out of her living 
room nine years ago, she had high hopes and little money. A longtime resident 
of Mexico, Lozano came to California thinking of the state as a place where a 
woman could succeed in the male-dominated world of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mexico at that time, men didn't respect a woman with ambitions," said 
Lozano, 46, the mother of five, who was born in the United States but raised in 
Guadalajara. "When I came here and saw so many women working, I knew it was the 
place for me," she said, "but my family thought I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, after much hard work and some advice from an East Los Angeles professor 
of business, Lozano's foray into the beauty business has flourished. She now 
employs 10 and owns and operates the Rizo Beauty Salon and the Ellechante 
Modeling Studio and Talent Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I can't believe our rise," said Lozano in crisp Spanish that she 
occasionally tempers with terms such as cash flow and marketing.  
</P>
<P>
 Lozano said her break came about two years ago when she received a mailer 
announcing the services of the just-opened Business Assistance Center in 
Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 That letter was written by Roger Holguin, who teaches business classes at East 
Los Angeles College and moonlights as a pro bono consultant for the Los Angeles 
Business Development Corp., a nonprofit consulting company that provides 
entrepreneurial training and management assistance to businesses in 
economically disadvantaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin's first step was to help Lozano devise a 12-month business plan to 
track her salon's revenue and expenditures. Along with the plan came a budget, 
complete with realistic projections and forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
 After consulting Lozano on the principles of bookkeeping, Holguin invited her 
to free seminars on sales and advertising, where she learned the importance of 
image in the fashion industry and the need to cater to each client's particular 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 From her second-story office along Pacific Boulevard in Huntington Park, 
Lozano's well-groomed staff banters in Spanish while receiving faxes from such 
fashion hubs as New York, London and Tokyo, all requesting some of the 500 
models represented by Ellechante. 
</P>
<P>
 Business is going well, Lozano said, because of the changing trends of the 
fashion industry and new trade opportunities in Mexico after the passage this 
year of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're seeing the apogee of Latinas in modeling -- you open any 
fashion magazine and you'll see lots of Mexicans, Venezuelans, Brazilians. . . 
. Our exotic looks are in high demand."
