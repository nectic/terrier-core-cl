SEGA SEEKS TO CAPTURE TECHNO TOY MARKET FOR YOUNGSTERS; TECHNOLOGY: THE VIDEO 
GAME GIANT'S FLAGSHIP PRODUCT IS A $160 COMPUTER DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN AS YOUNG 
AS 3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sega of America Inc., the video game giant that has won the hearts and minds 
of many a youngster with its hip image and popular games, is expected this week 
to launch a line of high-tech toys for children and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 By developing and marketing products unrelated to video games for the first 
time since it entered the U.S. market in 1986, Sega hopes to capture a niche 
largely ignored by traditional toy makers as American children's appetite for 
techno toys continues to amaze their often less technologically inclined 
parents.  
</P>
<P>
 Sega Chief Executive Tom Kalinske, himself a former executive at toy maker 
Mattel, said the company expects to generate $50 million in revenue from the 
new products this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our analysis of the industry is that most of the toy companies are avoiding 
high-tech," Kalinske said. "We don't intend to compete with Mattel or Hasbro. 
But we have the R&D capability, and for us, this is a logical way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The flagship product, designed for children as young as 3 years old and 
expected to cost $160, is essentially a simplified computer, with rounded 
edges, a fat stylus instead of a mouse and a storybook-shaped electronic 
drawing pad. 
</P>
<P>
 When the storybook is plugged into the "Pico" -- which runs on a Motorola 
microprocessor -- the screen is activated, and children can interact with a 
variety of early math, reading, spelling and drawing activities. Kalinske said 
both Disney and Paramount plan to develop educational software for the product. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The toy resulted from research showing that while parents may want to 
introduce their children to computers at an early age, they are reluctant to 
subject such costly equipment to the sort of abuse that can come from 
preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when Sega has been criticized for allowing excessive violence in its 
video games, the new Pico may boost the company's image -- while providing it 
with a way to hook into the growing educational software market. But analysts 
say the success of such a product will depend on how easy and intuitive it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could open up a whole new market for personal computers," new-media 
analyst Denise Caruso said. "If they can run rudimentary educational and 
entertainment software on that box that's kids-oriented, that could be a 
massive seller. But . . . you have to make it very, very basic." 
</P>
<P>
 Other products in the new Sega line include an electronic comic book and a 
"personal digital assistant for teen-agers" -- a hand-held device that serves 
as an electronic address book and also allows the user to beam messages via 
infrared transmission to friends on the other side of the room.

O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS; A FRIENDLY DECEPTION; WOODWORKING MEETS MAGIC IN TONY 
DELAP'S EXHIBITION AT CSUF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "You see how the deception is made. That's very important to me, to see how 
the trick was done," Tony DeLap said of "The Great Escape," part of an 
exhibition of his work from the '60s and '70s at the Cal State Fullerton Main 
Art Gallery (through March 13). 
</P>
<P>
 Settled into a battered couch in the airy studio he and a hired hand conjured 
out of a Corona del Mar garage 17 years ago, the 66-year-old artist said the 
piece was "my excuse to work with materials, instead of being purely 
conceptual. Something where I could show off . . . the craft. Something I can 
do well." 
</P>
<P>
 He held up his index fingers to show how the steel rod and the long wooden 
post "float" vertically, a few inches above the floor, at opposite sides of the 
gallery. A ceiling-mounted cable-and-pulley system -- clearly visible -- 
connects them. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pieces in the show, titled "The House of the Magician: An 
Installation of econstructed Works from 1967-1979," originally were made -- 
four of them are being reconstructed to fit the gallery space -- their spare 
look and unadorned raw materials seemed to reflect the matter-of-fact 
physicality of minimalist art. Two decades later, their metaphorical and 
vernacular qualities emerge more clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 In these sculptures, the craft of woodworking -- and the practicalities of 
calibrating an object to fit in a specific architectural space -- meet the 
craft of magic. The deceptions that fool the magician's audience meet the 
formal conventions that rule the world of contemporary art. The artist-magician 
calmly exposes all his tricks, daring you to find meaning and pleasure simply 
in being in on the secret. 
</P>
<P>
 A longstanding member of the Magic Castle, the professional magician's club in 
Hollywood, DeLap is fascinated by the world of professional deceivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the stories of card hustlers and card cheats and the way they would 
design and invent sleights-of-hand," he said. "There is no way in the world I 
would want to lead that kind of life, but I find it fascinating. I love the 
terminology, the slang, the technical information on how cards are palmed." 
</P>
<P>
 For DeLap's version of the "Floating Lady" trick (on view at CSUF), a woman 
lies supine on a board balanced on a chair. Nearby, a metaphorical version of 
the piece consists of two gallery-spanning wooden "beams" (actually just 
plywood veneers) that almost meet in the middle, where a block of Plexiglas 
serves as the "secret" fulcrum. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLap's allusions to famous magicians' tricks are only means to an end, 
however, like his meticulous tongue-and-groove joints attaching one piece of 
wood to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I have the pleasure and justify using tools and paint and refining a 
kind of craft -- how can I justify all that and still make it something that's 
of some importance as art?" he asked rhetorically. "For me, that's the catch." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a youth in the Bay Area during the '40s, DeLap painted watercolor 
landscapes. At Claremont Graduate School, where he studied with Millard Sheets, 
Phil Dike and others, he began to be aware of the larger world of modern art. 
</P>
<P>
 California artists were isolated from major currents in contemporary art in 
those days. In San Francisco, DeLap depended on black-and-white art magazine 
reproductions of works by such Abstract Expressionists as Conrad Marca-Relli 
and Robert Goodnough to fire up his own abstract collages. Meanwhile, some Bay 
Area painters were abandoning abstraction for a lyrical new figurative style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was painting people sitting in chairs in the corner, which all came 
out of (Richard) Diebenkorn," DeLap said dryly. "I missed all of that, probably 
as much as anything out of naivete. My interests were obviously other places." 
</P>
<P>
 To support himself, he did graphic design, exhibition design -- "anything I 
could find that was somewhat architectural," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Typically, one major piece of guidance came from a memory of an architectural 
detail: the concrete bricks with cross-shaped cutouts shielded by glass in 
Frank Lloyd Wright's Millard House in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLap's breakthrough work was a series of pristine two-sided glass boxes with 
edges that step down toward the center. Displayed at the Dilexi Gallery in San 
Francisco, they resulted in what he calls "a fairy-tale come true" -- an 
illustration of his work on the cover of the February, 1964, issue of Artforum, 
with a glowing review by his friend and teaching colleague John Coplans, then 
editor-at-large of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 When Artforum moved its operations to Southern California later in 1964, 
Coplans became the first member of the art department at UC Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 DeLap accepted Coplans' invitation to move south and join the UCI faculty, 
which soon became a heady center of bicoastal networking, with major East and 
West Coast artists constantly being invited to teach or lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was later, really, that I felt isolated," DeLap said, referring to the 
period after Coplans moved to New York, where Artforum relocated in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 When top artists no longer routinely spent time in Orange County, the psychic 
and geographic distance from Los Angeles could seem almost unbridgeable. The 
consolation prize was a friendship with painter John McLaughlin -- who lived in 
semi-isolation in Dana Point -- and the freedom to pursue a personal agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "The isolation can be good and not good," DeLap said. "One thing that is not 
good: The artist has a tendency to demand more and more (of himself) all the 
time, to feed their own daily activity. Whereas if you're in a real hot spot of 
art you are . . . meeting critics and collectors and museum people. I've always 
felt that (you get) kind of an edge from (such) daily activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Coplans once said to me -- a backhanded compliment in some way -- 
'Tony's never going to be a famous artist because he moves too fast.' I kind of 
know what he meant. Instead of spending time developing (ideas) with people . . 
. I moved on to the next thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For DeLap, the "next thing" was a hybrid of painting and sculpture that he 
began making in the late '70s (not in the CSUF show). These geometric pieces 
have edges that curve away abruptly, as if vanishing into the wall -- often 
described as the Mobius strip effect you get when you twist a deck of cards. 
</P>
<P>
 An accompanying selection of prints and drawings from the past quarter-century 
(in the East Gallery) show off other facets of DeLap's fascination with magic. 
"Hand and Stick" and "13 Magic Tricks" scrutinize the mystique of vaudeville 
legerdemain and the mixture of wonder and didacticism inherent in vintage magic 
trick illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other works -- like the black-and-white postcard photographs of European 
monuments to which DeLap added small colored shapes mimicking his own works -- 
play with notions of the self-aggrandizing magician-artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I like about magic," DeLap said, "is that it can be so 
trivial and in a sense awful that . . . it can rise to an unbelievable height 
and become art. . . . It's the ability to do that that I like. The fact that 
much of it is subcultural activity. I think that's fine because that's (the 
origin of) all art." 
</P>
<P>

1967-1979" remains through March 13 at the Main and East Art Galleries, Cal

O.C. MUSIC REVIEW; STATE SYMPHONY: FROM RUSSIA WITH RESONANCE 
</P>

 The State Symphony of Russia, which played a triumphant concert at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center on Sunday afternoon, used to be just one of 10 
government-sponsored orchestras in Communist Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1936, the mighty ensemble made its first foreign appearance in 1957 
and its first visit to Southern California three years later. The 1994 tour is 
the eighth for the State Symphony in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 One would trivialize the obvious to say that much has happened since we first 
encountered the itinerant Muscovites at Shrine Auditorium in 1960 (with Kiril 
Kondrashin on the podium and Emil Gilels as stellar firebrand). The shifting 
name of the organization tells enough: What started as the Moscow State 
Symphony became the U.S.S.R. State Symphony before assuming its current 
all-purpose identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, an orchestra is an orchestra is an orchestra. Some things don't change. 
</P>
<P>
 Yevgeny Svetlanov, born in 1928 and the much-decorated music director since 
1965, still mans the podium with authoritative, businesslike decorum that masks 
an obviously flamboyant temperament. The players still file onstage in 
democratic unison, led by the self-effacing concertmaster. At the end, a 
particularly valiant player may rise from the ranks, however, to take a bow 
from the maestro's podium in reward for an incidental solo. 
</P>
<P>
 If all had gone as planned, Los Angeles would have heard the State Symphony in 
a strangely constituted pops concert Saturday at UCLA. Unfortunately, the 
recent quake caused structural quivers at Royce Hall that forced cancellation 
of this and similar projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, one had to be doubly grateful for the Orange County 
concert. The program here offered a sophisticated all-Russian agenda that paid 
easy homage to just one potboiler: Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 2 in C minor, 
a.k.a. "Full Slushpump and Empty Arms." 
</P>
<P>
 The only possible chagrin involved an unexplained switch in keyboard 
protagonists. The vaunted Alexei Sultanov was promised; one Vladimir Ovchinikov 
was delivered. The disappointment turned out to be bearable. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovchinikov, a prizewinner from the Urals apparently in his boyish 30s, is not 
your average whiz-bang heart-on-cuff virtuoso. He made a noble effort to keep 
Rachmaninoff's sparks in check, along with his push-button tears. One could 
argue that he slighted the romantic rhetoric. Still, erring on the side of 
restraint is better than erring on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 His fervor and intelligence -- not to mention his fine sense of rubato and 
subtle use of color -- made one eager to overlook a couple of technical lapses. 
And it wasn't his fault that the local piano at his disposal sounded tinny amid 
the unusually opulent orchestral timbres. 
</P>
<P>
 The discerning audience of the Orange County Philharmonic Society, it should 
be noted, managed to resist the temptation to shatter the mood with premature 
applause after the first movement. There may be hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Svetlanov, who chooses not to use a baton these days, opened the festivities 
with "Prince Golitsin's Journey," a brooding interlude from Mussorgsky's 
"Khovanshchina." It served to remind us how dark and resonant this orchestra 
habitually sounds. The bass rumbled, the treble throbbed, and everyone really 
sang. Together. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, Svetlanov turned to the mystical poetry of Liadov's 
"Enchanted Lake." In the delicate process, he contradicted popular claims that 
his orchestra soars better than it shimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 It did soar, however, with roof-rattling, gut-thumping bravura in the 
sensitively gauged performance of Scriabin's "Le poeme de l'extase" that 
followed. With the conductor blithely grunting the finest vocal obbligatos this 
side of Toscanini, the swelling crescendos brought the program to a Wagnerian 
close and the audience to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Any encore would have been anticlimactic, both literally and figuratively.

ART REVIEW; 'BAD GIRLS': FEMINISM ON WRY; TONE BEMUSEDLY SUBVERSIVE IN WEST 
COAST EDITION OF N.Y. SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Bad Girls West" is a good show because it acknowledges the continuing 
significance of a pivotal dynamic that has operated within contemporary art for 
a quarter-century. But it's not a great show because it seems unsure of -- or 
perhaps just unconvincing about -- how that dynamic currently functions. 
</P>
<P>
 The dynamic is feminist. The current artistic mode of feminism is said by the 
show's curators to be marked by a playfully subversive sense of humor. If 
there's a feminist anthem celebrated here it's "Girls just wanna have fun," 
Cyndi Lauper's joyous hit from several years back. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition, which is at UCLA's Wight Art Gallery through March 20, is a 
West Coast version of "Bad Girls," organized by Marcia Tucker and currently on 
view at New York's New Museum of Contemporary Art. The independent UCLA 
edition, assembled by San Francisco-based curator Marcia Tanner, includes 41 
artists, many from California. Videotapes by another two dozen artists are also 
being shown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad Girls West" is light and lively, and some of the work is in fact 
hilarious. At the entrance, Erika Rothenberg has set up a table soliciting 
donations for "America's largest oppressed minority" -- yes, men, who make up 
only 48% of the population, but whose homeless numbers surpass women 10 to 1; 
who commit suicide at a much higher rate than women; who are required to expose 
their breasts when wearing a bathing suit, and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren Lesko has upholstered a Freudian psychoanalyst's couch in cuddly black 
lambskin, wickedly shaved into a traditional poodle cut; the loony recliner 
rests delicately atop a red-brocade Victorian pillow. Lesko makes sly 
buffoonery of the Viennese doctor's convoluted sexual take on women as man's 
(subservient) best friend, while subtly recalling all those erotically 
available odalisques who populate Western art from Titian to Manet. 
</P>
<P>
 The show includes weak one-liners, too, such as Rachel Lachowicz's small 
reinterpretations of Marcel Duchamp's famous urinal, which she has cast from 
lipstick and returned to the wall. "Boy art" made with "girl material" just 
doesn't resonate much. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever laughs might be had, the curatorial insistence that recent art with a 
feminist core is characterized by how funny it is isn't really matched by the 
work in the show. You might groan at the corniness of Nancy Dwyer's "Big Ego," 
which spells out ego in huge letters made from inflated nylon -- rather like a 
Macy's Thanksgiving Parade float -- but funny isn't the right word. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is there anything particularly hilarious about Laura Aquilar's documentary 
photographs, which are dour self-portraits, or in Jeanne Dunning's remarkable, 
thin sheets of flesh-colored latex, each with a simulated mole or tuft of hair, 
which likewise examine supposed physical "flaws." 
</P>
<P>
 One person's pratfall is, of course, another's bodily injury. Yet the mood of 
the show is more wry than funny. The bemused tone doesn't seem to represent an 
effort to reform the dismissive stereotype of feminism as "shrill" or 
"aggressive" or "hostile." Thankfully, this isn't art designed to catch more 
flies with honey. Rather, like Cyndi Lauper's song, it suggests the degree to 
which art, including feminist art, has merged with entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 A curatorial focus on artistic humor takes advantage of a central function of 
entertainment, which is to speak to and reinforce a sense of commonality within 
the audience. The pervasive tone of wry bemusement in the show comes from 
recognizing and acknowledging a kindred spirit. Being a "bad girl" turns out to 
be a way of being a "good girl." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Being a bad girl also turns out to be a way of being a good boy, as evidenced 
by the work of Ken Aptekar, Charles Gute, Manuel Pardo and, especially, Jerome 
Caja. Caja's wonderfully eccentric little genre paintings made with eyeliner 
and nail polish rather than oil paint unburden the pompous load carried by 
Lachowicz's grave lessons of art history. For feminism has not just had an 
impact on artists who are women, while questions of gender aren't merely 
determined by biology. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other artists are shown to good effect. Among them is Kim Dingle, 
whose raucous paintings of wild little girls, all dressed up in crinolines and 
patent leather shoes, replace decorum with a head-spinning mix of joy, terror, 
violence and play. 
</P>
<P>
 Judie Bamber's drawings of female vampires and Playboy magazine sex-kittens 
meld surgical precision with lacerating insight, while Megan Williams' dreamy 
pastels are part nightmare, part wet-dream. And Marlene McCarty's blunt 
descriptions of sex and sexuality are made from heat-transfer patches applied 
to canvas -- a sly merger of ironing and painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Two installations are notable. Jean Lowe uses the frothy conventions of Rococo 
decoration to gussie up a room full of blunt pictures wittily devoted to animal 
husbandry down on the farm (no Marie Antoinette with a porcelain milk-pail 
here). And Theresa Pendlebury and her alter ego, Jane McElheney, have furnished 
a Victorian drawing-room entirely in life-draining black; it's funereal quality 
is oddly matched by a liberating sense of having created a blank slate. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the simplest of the show's most compelling works are Lesko's fur 
collars from coats or dresses, which are placed high in the corners of several 
galleries. Titled "Lips," they are both serious homage and satirical retort to 
the search for a purely female imagery, which characteristically centered on 
the vagina in first-generation feminist art of the late-1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 High in the corners, Lesko's furry sculptures metaphorically transform the 
enclosing walls of the gallery into spreading legs, defining the environment in 
which both visitors and works of art mingle. Her work knowingly asserts that, 
in the United States, the arts have long been perceived as a feminine rather 
than a masculine arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The feminization of American culture, which dates to the 19th Century, has had 
complex consequences for artists. In part it has meant that, in a culture that 
also devalues women, significant art practically demands to be hyper-masculine. 
If it's not, it's tainted. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this mean for women who make art? What does it mean for male artists 
who are gay, and who are devalued by our culture because they are seen to be 
"like women," or for lesbians, who are not surprisingly made invisible? 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Rothenberg might wonder, what does it mean for any man who makes art? 
</P>
<P>
 Lesko's work, like "Bad Girls West" in general, keeps these crucial questions 
front and center. It's worth doing, because the answers are no joke.

 L.A. Chamber Orchestra Revises Plans: Announcing that the Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra "faces serious financial problems," LACO board president Jennifer 
Diener said Monday that the orchestra's management and board are restructuring 
the current season, "and are seeking to develop workout arrangements with 
creditors." First action in the plan is postponing two concerts at UCLA and 
Ambassador Auditorium, scheduled for Friday and Saturday, until "later in the 
season." Subscribers and other ticket holders "are being contacted individually 
as details are being finalized," Diener said.

 Met Fires Battle: American soprano Kathleen Battle has been fired from the 
cast of the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Donizetti's "La Fille du Regiment," 
scheduled to open Monday. According to Met General Manager Joseph Volpe, 
Battle's "unprofessional actions during rehearsals were profoundly detrimental. 
. . . I could not allow the quality of the performance to be jeopardized." 
Harolyn Blackwell, already scheduled to sing the role of Marie in two of the 
performances, will now sing all seven. Battle could not be reached for comment. 
A Met spokesman said that Battle had been offered several roles in the Met's 
1994-95 season, but "those offers are now withdrawn." POP/ROCK

 The Pride of Mississippi: Mississippi officials are leading a campaign to have 
the state's official song changed to "Roll on Mississippi," by country singer 
Charley Pride. The current song, "Go Mississippi," has been associated with 
segregation because Gov. Ross Barnett, who used it as his campaign tune in 
1959, tried to block integration in the state in 1962, the year the Legislature 
adopted the song with new, innocuous words. To promote interest in changing the 
official song, Pride will perform at the Mississippi Capitol today, which Gov. 
Kirk Fordice has declared Charley Pride Day in the state. MOVIES

 Fraud Case Stops Musical: A London stage musical about the life of the late 
press baron Robert Maxwell will not be allowed to open because it might 
prejudice a forthcoming fraud trial against Maxwell's sons Kevin and Ian, a 
British High Court judge ruled Monday. The show, set to open in two weeks, was 
to feature 14 Gilbert & Sullivan tunes set to new lyrics. . . . Meanwhile, 
another London musical that had been barred has now been given a reprieve. 
British stage producer Cameron Mackintosh, who is set to open a London revival 
of "Oliver!" in November, had stopped a local school from mounting the same 
show by invoking a law barring schools from performing plays running 
concurrently in London's West End. After a groundswell of criticism, the 
producer has relented and will allow the student production to go on. QUICK

MUSIC REVIEW; HERALDING TRUMPET'S VERSATILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Music director Micah Levy treated the Orange County Chamber Orchestra's 
audience to an afternoon of Baroque courtliness on Sunday at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre. The fare brimmed with regal pleasantries that revolved around the 
celebratory sound of the trumpet, both as solo instrument and within the 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpeter Fred Holmgren tackled two concertos. The first -- Concerto No. 2, in 
D -- by Johann Melchior Molter, required piccolo trumpet for its typically 
stratospheric part. Holmgren -- principal trumpet of the San Francisco-based 
Philharmonia Baroque and a member of the Portland Baroque Orchestra -- managed 
a mostly tidy, delicate account of this technically difficult work. Still, he 
offered only modest inflection to his interpretation and -- perhaps further 
hindered by his instrument's muted tone, in comparison to those of his 
accompanists -- conveyed little of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmgren reappeared as protagonist for Leopold Mozart's Concerto in D, which 
he now had to reinvent because the orchestra reportedly had inexplicably 
received its music in the wrong key. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, playing on a hastily borrowed Scherzer D-trumpet, he gave a 
creditable reading of this graceful and unassuming piece, a bright and stylish 
performance, if unexciting. 
</P>
<P>
 During Giuseppe Torelli's Sinfonia a Quatro, Holmgren joined the trumpet 
section in its festive replies to highlighted duos, all deftly handled by 
principal first and second chair violins, cellists and oboists. Concertmistress 
Diana Halprin and principal second Joseph Goodman brought particular vitality 
to their duos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other selections included a Concerto Grosso in D by Telemann, Sinfonia No. 3, 
in G, by Vivaldi and Thomas Arne's Symphony No.1, in C. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, Levy led his group in sprightly, attentive and neatly ornamented 
presentations. Sandy Matthews provided suitable continuo on a keyboard sampler 
set to emulate, in turn, the sound of a harpsichord, a portative organ and a 
"church" organ.  
</P>
<P>
 Though not authentic, in times of financial crunch its digitally reproduced 
sounds are surprisingly practical and serviceable.

MUSIC REVIEW; SALAMUNOVICH LEADS L.A. MASTER CHORALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like years, traditions accumulate as institutions survive. But worthwhile 
traditions have to be tended, shaped and watched -- vigilantly. Otherwise, like 
weeds in one's garden, slatternly and haphazard patterns take over. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 29-year existence -- its debut concert took place in January, 1965 -- 
the Los Angeles Master Chorale has not been unlike a garden, expanding and 
thriving in some seasons, parching in others. Now in its 30th season as a 
resident company of the Music Center, it seems at this moment to be 
consolidating its strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Paul Salamunovich, the 
Chorale's third and current music director, led a Classical-period program 
displaying that consolidation-in-progress. It was an agenda of masterpieces by 
Mozart and Haydn, the "Vesperae Solennes de Confessore" in C, K. 339, and "Ave 
Verum Corpus," K. 618, surrounding the "Nelson" Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 One will not find three more exposing works in the repertory. The joy of these 
performances lay in the ease, stylishness and variety of the singing and 
playing, by the resourceful Chorale and by the crackerjack, 34-member Sinfonia 
Orchestra. High standards can again be taken for granted in these 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration is another matter. Though sung handsomely, the concluding "Ave 
Verum" lacked most of its magic and a deal of its spirituality. The Solemn 
Vespers moved briskly, in a few moments -- as in the detailing of feeling of 
"Laudate, pueri" -- touchingly, but without regularly ascending to a plateau of 
musical intensity from which to survey the emotional landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor and his forces achieved better integration in Haydn's "Missa in 
angustiis." Here, the Chorale showed its virtuosic ensemble and purity of tone 
beautifully, yet without masking words, and the orchestra played crisply but 
with finesse. 
</P>
<P>
 The most challenging solo duties went to the strongest of the five featured 
soloists, soprano Elissa Johnston, who made the complications of the Haydn Mass 
seem easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Though clearly suffering a cold, basso Michael Gallup sang with his customary 
authority. The others, all members of the Chorale, were soprano Lesley 
Leighton, contralto Kathryn Stewart and tenor John Klacka.

MUSIC REVIEW; PEPPERDINE HOSTS TOKYO QUARTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pepperdine University went for the gold by presenting the Tokyo String 
Quartet, in its only local appearance of the season, on Sunday in the 
acoustically friendly Smothers Theatre, a venue used for more humble offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an inspired decision, with the players -- violinists Peter Oundjian and 
Kikuei Ikeda, violist Kazuhide Isomura, cellist Sadao Harada -- in peak form 
technically while exhibiting an even greater degree of daring than is their 
custom. 
</P>
<P>
 The program offered no surprises: Beethoven's Quartets in F, Opus 18, No. 1, 
and E minor, Opus 59, No. 2, surrounding Dvorak's "American" Quartet. But in 
readings as spirited and accomplished as theirs one could savor the grandeur 
and originality of all three works anew. 
</P>
<P>
 One need no longer speak about such chamber music requisites as proper balance 
and centered intonation with the Tokyo. Rather, in this instance, one might 
note that in dispatching the finale of Beethoven's E-minor Quartet so 
vigorously and speedily, and getting ever faster in the process, the players 
courted disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was the Tokyo String Quartet, and instead of running the music off 
the rails, they caused it to emerge even more than usually tense and dramatic.

MUSIC REVIEW; HEROIC PLAYING FROM EROICA TRIO AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earthquake damage may have forced a venue change at UCLA, from Royce Hall to 
the more intimate Schoenberg Hall, but it's hard to imagine the Eroica Trio 
having any trouble filling a larger space than it did on Sunday. This is a 
small group with a bold sound and a forceful presence. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westwood, the trio played with aplomb, individually and in ensemble, and 
delivered an impressive connective empathy. True to the group's name, after 
Beethoven's opus, the Eroica Trio has a tendency to embrace the heroic rather 
than savor the meditative. 
</P>
<P>
 Often as not, cellist Sara Sant'Ambrogio led the charge, with a more intense 
approach to her instrument than either violinist Adela Pena or pianist Erika 
Nickrenz. Continuous dynamic flexibility is a hallmark of the group, but they 
live for the big moments. 
</P>
<P>
 This tack worked well on the baroque and romantic turf, respectively, of 
Jean-Baptiste Loeillet and Edouard Lalo. On the latter's Trio in C minor, the 
Eroica tightly hugged the bravura contours of the finale, to dazzling effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the all-important enigma was lost, however, in Ravel's A-minor Trio, 
to which the ensemble brought a fastidious clarity, and vigor instead of 
vagueness. At the risk of personalizing culture, the "Passecaille: Tres large," 
with its rueful Oriental theme reconfigured over funereal, tolling piano 
chords, played like a becalming prayer for a disaster-stricken city. 
</P>
<P>
 For an agreeable bit of Francophilic fluff, they played Benjamin Godard's 
Berceuse, from "Jocelyn," as an encore. JOSEF WOODARD

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; A TEMPER TANTRUM SCARS THE WONDER STUFF'S STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miles Hunt of the Wonder Stuff was hardly the first young rocker to come to 
the Coach House expecting a standing tribute in a sit-down club where audiences 
tend to be loudly appreciative, but are usually content to kick back and avail 
themselves of a particularly good listening room. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hunt threw one of the bigger snits over it Sunday night.When the Wonder 
Stuff's stormy opening number, "Change Every Light Bulb," failed to lift the 
capacity crowd to its feet, he added multiple cusswords to the lyrics, then 
announced that he was bored and threatened to remain so unless this assembly 
got up on the double. 
</P>
<P>
 Instant compliance didn't stop his sulking. Hunt basically ditched it during 
"On the Ropes," a rousing anthem from the English band's current album, 
"Construction for the Modern Idiot." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood lingered, robbing the concert of the spunk and humor that are the 
Wonder Stuff's most endearing qualities. Still, most of the show went forward 
on solid and varied musical footing: no problem with the singing and playing, 
just the attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt was at his vivid best on a couple of nasty, biting songs that seemed to 
fit his mood (one of them was called "I Wish Them All Dead"). Two sprightly 
encore tunes promised a happy ending, but the Wonder Stuff called it quits 
after a stingy hour. MIKE BOEHM

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; RICKY MARTIN: THERE'S LIFE AFTER MENUDO

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike most of the former Menudo members who have faded into obscurity, Ricky 
Martin showed in his Los Angeles solo debut on Sunday at the Universal 
Amphitheatre that he can make it on his own. At least commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '70s and early '80s, the young singer and dancer was both the most 
charismatic and talented member of the Puerto Rican vocal quintet, which is so 
focused on teen-age appeal that its members are automatically replaced when 
they turn 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Martin -- now in his early 20s and soon to join the cast of TV's 
"General Hospital" -- continues to exhibit a confident, sexy stage presence, an 
above-average ability as a dancer and a likable personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite styles ranging Sunday from light pop to '50s-style rock, however, 
Ricky Martin, who was backed by a 10-piece band and two dancers, hasn't moved 
artistically much beyond the simple, teen-oriented fare of Menudo. 
</P>
<P>
 His appeal seems based chiefly on his history with the group -- and the 
Amphitheatre fans certainly seemed content with that. To truly deserve 
attention on his own, however, he needs to improve vocally and find more 
challenging or affecting material. ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; 'ACE VENTURA' DETECTS A WINNING TAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With comical television ads and a PG-13 rating making it accessible to teens, 
Morgan Creek Production's "Ace Ventura Pet Detective" tracked down a solid $12 
million in its opening weekend. It grossed nearly double that of its closest 
rival--"Mrs.Doubtfire," which was pushed to second place but claimed the rank 
of the second-highest grossing movie released in 1993. With $181.5 million, it 
now tops "The Fugitive," which has grossed $179 million since opening last 
summer and trails only the $343 million of "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 An expensive marketing campaign didn't help James L. Brooks' one-time musical 
"I'll Do Anything," which grossed an unspectacular $4.7 million in its first 
weekend. Touchstone's less-anticipated American remake of Francis Veber's 
French film "My Father, the Hero," starring Gerard Depardieu, outgrossed it. 
</P>

ONLY IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Harvey

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's someone looking forward to L.A.'s Big One: Of course, she lives in San 
Jose. Joanne Jacobs, a columnist for that city's Mercury News, summed up the 
Southland's Jan. 17 disaster this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that not enough of Los Angeles fell down."  
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs goes on to say that a bigger quake would "make it possible to rebuild 
Los Angeles as a more livable city." 
</P>
<P>
 Her theory is interesting, except for one small flaw. The bigger the quake, 
the more people tend to lose their lives. Experts warn that tens of thousands 
could die in the Big One. 
</P>
<P>
 We notice, by the way, that the drawing accompanying Jacobs' article shows a 
collapsed -- but empty -- freeway. Guess the newspaper decided not to show a 
collapsed building, such as the Northridge apartment complex in which 16 people 
died. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On thin ice: Ike Shatori thought that Tonya Harding was making a local 
appearance when he saw the title of a musical program at Long Beach City 
College -- "The Lady Behind the Baton." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A crash course needed for traffic reporters?A USC study charges that the 
helicopter corps of L.A. radio stations tends "to reinforce the aggressive 
driving subculture that exists in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 USC Prof. Sandra Ball-Rokeach asserted that the reports: 
</P>
<P>
 * Use "the word accident instead of crash . . . Accident suggests a fatalist 
attitude . . . something that can't be avoided." 
</P>
<P>
 * Are "framed in such a way that they convey a 'fun and games' attitude toward 
driving -- i.e. there's a hit-and-run over to the right shoulder." Often 
there's "fast-paced background noise." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Send out the messages that cars get hurt -- not people." Coverage of a 
jackknifed truck, for instance, rarely deals with what "happened to the . . . 
truck driver." 
</P>
<P>
 * Omit "many details of a crash, such as . . . the age or sex of the injured. 
This allows people to avoid emotionally reacting." 
</P>
<P>
 * Use "terms such as 'Orange Crush' or 'No. 4 Lane' (which) confuse many 
drivers, especially visitors to an area."  
</P>
<P>
 * Largely ignore "nonaggressive values." Ball-Rokeach recommended that traffic 
reporters say of crash victims "something like: 'I sure hope they make it home 
to dinner tonight,' or 'Moms, dads and kids were involved.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Journalistic milestone: It's long been a tradition of the press to reveal the 
contents of secret government documents that are in the public interest. Thus 
we were happy to see that Los Angeles magazine, in an act as courageous as the 
publishing of the Pentagon Papers, has reprinted the . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Well, let the cover of its February issue make the big announcement: 
</P>
<P>
 "DMV Test! Shhh! We've got the answers to the driver's exam." 
</P>
<P>
 At last -- the truth about to whom you must yield the right of way "when you 
arrive at a corner without a traffic light or stop sign at the same time as 
vehicles on the cross street." 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. magazine will be hard-pressed to equal this coup. Unless the publication 
chooses to be even bolder by printing the standard eye chart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We deserved that: We recently referred to the founding of a Southern 
California city by a religious group whose name has a sort of double meaning 
here in Seismic California. We asked: Aren't we all quakers these days? 
</P>
<P>
 Replies Rich Reed: "I really thought you were Whittier than that." miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 A comedy sketch group called Laughworks, which appears at Pasadena's Ice House 
on Sunday, has a money-back guarantee, pledging it won't make "one Menendez, 
Tonya Harding or Bobbitt joke." Obviously, Only in L.A. can't make the same 
offer.

AL MARTINEZ: DAYS OF WINE AND UKULELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I sing today of an ordinary man on a melancholy day, because Robert Nevel 
Johnson has died and something should be said about that. 
</P>
<P>
 He died of cancer in the colorless confines of a hospital room after telling 
his wife, Mary, "Now I wish I could just go to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 This was after she promised him that with Social Security, a part-time job and 
help from a loving family she would make it all right financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK to go," she said gently. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob needed her assurance because first in his mind was the welfare of his wife 
of 54 years, and before that the five children they had raised together. 
</P>
<P>
 Once given that assurance, he let go of the pain and grief that is cancer and 
slipped quietly into his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 I say he was an ordinary man not as a means of dismissal but as a song of 
praise, for even those who do not lead parades fashion lives of decency and 
personal courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles glows with the strength of them. They're the ones who rush into 
violent mobs to help someone they don't know, who brave flames to put out fires 
that don't threaten them, who enter dangerously damaged buildings to assist 
earthquake victims they will never see again. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob was ordinary only in the sense that he did not aspire to great things and 
was not eaten alive by the corrosive acids of ambition that damage so many of 
us beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to work, he wanted to support his family and he wanted to enjoy what 
he had as long as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the dwindling days of his life he could go on a family picnic and haul 
his portable oxygen tank into a nearby saloon for a whiskey old-fashioned 
before his last ride home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I know of him because he was my friend. Bob came into my life when I was a boy 
and he was not long out of high school, a hell-raising street kid with savvy 
beyond his years. 
</P>
<P>
 His life at home was filled with emotional pain, and he ran from it. Mary's 
home life was not much better, and they met the way anguished people often do, 
seeking out each other in a crowd of strangers, destined to be one. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary was still in school when they were married and no one thought the union 
would last beyond Tuesday. But they fooled everyone, rode out adversity and for 
half a century remained true to the fate that had brought them together. 
</P>
<P>
 From a shaky beginning emerged Bob the man, filled with a sweetness one could 
barely imagine when he was taunting teachers and rolling cars in the wildness 
of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 He raised four sons and a daughter with loving care, and was the strength in 
their family when two of the boys died young, one of cancer and the other from 
a drug overdose. He held back his own tears so that others could cry. 
</P>
<P>
 But even under those terrible circumstances, Bob was a positive man, pursuing 
a half-dozen careers in an endless search for the best way to support his 
family. He drove a truck, tended bar, opened a milk depot, became a carpenter 
and for a while was a keno boss in a Lake Tahoe casino. 
</P>
<P>
 They were not huge successes, but Bob liked doing them all and, in the end, 
there is a kind of glory to that. He was never beaten down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The man rarely cursed life. The closest he came to dreary self-evaluation in 
my presence was once when he was praising a friend's achievement and 
denigrating himself by saying, "Even my name is ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure he was ever aware of how much his family adored him and how much 
his friends valued him. My admiration went the full route: I joined the Marines 
because he had been a Marine before that, and what was good for him was good 
for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob was my drinking buddy and my singing partner. He had somehow learned to 
play the ukulele and, with Ed Fernandes, the three of us entertained at parties 
with flawed but enthusiastic renditions of "The Three Caballeros." 
</P>
<P>
 There were other tunes too, but that one seemed to characterize what Bob once 
referred to as our days of wine and ukuleles. 
</P>
<P>
 We're three caballeros, three gay caballeros, they say we are birds of a 
featherrrr . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone liked my dad," his son Wayne said to me the day of his funeral, one 
of those brilliant, bright blue days that precede rain. "He fit in wherever he 
went. I remember once he won enough money gambling to buy a Cadillac and 
everybody was ecstatic. It was his one big victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Not really. Bob Johnson's whole life was a victory, because it was a triumph 
of the soul that few of us ever achieve, a place in the heart reserved for 
those who are special. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a good man and I'll miss him, both as a friend and as element of those 
days of wine and ukuleles that can never be again . . . because we were three 
caballeros, and now we are only two.

CAN IT REALLY BE AMERICA'S POSITION TO DO NOTHING?; AIR STRIKES MUST BE 
EMPLOYED TO RELIEVE THE SICKENING SIEGE OF SARAJEVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The weekend's terrible bloodshed in Sarajevo -- 68 dead and more than 200 
wounded -- once more puts the immensely difficult issue of Bosnia before the 
Western World. Let's put this horrible matter this way: What course of action 
would entail the lesser risk? Would it be for the West to ignore the latest 
atrocity? Or for the West to take strong military action, without delay, in 
response? 
</P>
<P>
 That is the question that President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher now must ask themselves. For if the United States does nothing at 
all, that would be seen throughout the world as a major policy decision. Bosnia 
is no longer simply George Bush's legacy; it is now specifically Clinton's 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The brutal mortar attack on Sarajevo's open-air market has changed the 
equation. If, in the past, the decision not to decide could somehow be 
justified -- as prudent, cautious, statesmanlike -- that no longer is the case. 
Not to act now is to turn one's back on attempted genocide. 
</P>
<P>
 So the question is: Do nothing? Or do something? Whatever -- but do decide. 
</P>
<P>
 SAVE SARAJEVO: Last summer, reviewing the options, The Times made the case for 
Western intervention to relieve the siege of Sarajevo. That, in our view, is 
still the best course. To do more at this time -- to launch massive air 
strikes, against many if not all significant Serbian military targets -- would 
be to plunge the entire theater into a sudden, massively larger war. Who knows 
how other parties, especially Russia, would react? 
</P>
<P>
 But to go the other way -- to pretend as if the problem will go away, or to 
argue that there is no compelling American or Western interest in putting a 
stop to the calculated and callous Serbian aggression -- would be to feed that 
aggression, the primary, though not the solitary, cause of the current tragedy. 
For who knows at which point the thirst of the aggressor would be slaked. 
Bosnia? Greater Serbia? Beyond? Aggression is never predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is why the sensible middle-ground option -- to relieve the siege of 
Sarajevo with Western bombing of the promontories surrounding the besieged 
city, and to be prepared to place a small, token force of NATO and/or U.S. 
forces at the city's airport -- makes the most sense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It is a discrete act. It attacks one problem, it saves one situation, it 
does not involve massive forces or intervention, it would be nearly universally 
supported and indeed enthusiastically praised. And it would be morally right. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It sends a clear message. Such a relatively small, symbolic commitment -- 
involving whatever level of air bombardment is required around Sarajevo to 
silence the Serbian guns -- is the only way of convincing Belgrade that the 
Serbian strategy of selective strangulation is doomed. If America commits, and 
commits firmly, Sarajevo will be saved and the Serbs will have to see the 
light. They must see that the choking of Sarajevo is becoming a disaster for 
themselves as well as the city's residents. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the best policy to spur peace. For without Western action now, the 
theater will be no closer to peace, the war might widen and the volatile region 
could become increasingly unstable. Only action by President Clinton now can 
curb the slide toward chaos; only a carefully conceived, limited and successful 
use of air power can hope to arrest the genocide. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. ALLIES: Relieving the siege of Sarajevo has not had the support of this 
nation's longtime ally, the British, though on Monday London did call for 
"immediate and effective action." Along with the Canadians, they have had 
peacekeeping troops on the ground in Bosnia, and they fear retaliation from 
Serbian forces if the West uses air power. Those fears are hardly baseless. It 
may therefore be necessary for U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to 
order a partial and possibly temporary withdrawal of the soldiers stationed 
there under the flag of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 If President Clinton spells out a limited, targeted humanitarian mission to 
save Sarajevo, the American people will support him and he Bosnia tragedy will 
be moved back from the terrible abyss toward which it is now heading.

THE COLISEUM AT THE CROSSROADS; EARTHQUAKE HAS PUT A HUGE QUESTION MARK OVER 
THIS HISTORIC FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rebuilding from last month's Northridge earthquake is going to be costly. 
Government well may be required to make tough choices between rebuilding 
structures such as hospitals and rebuilding structures that aren't as vital to 
the functioning of the city, like cultural or sports facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of those choices is shaping up over the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum. For now, it is reasonable -- indeed, only prudent -- to proceed with 
plans to rebuild the 70-year-old Exposition Park stadium, which sustained 
damage estimated at $35 million in the Jan. 17 temblor and its aftershocks. But 
we must also be prepared to face a worst-case scenario: that the venerable, old 
facility is so damaged it simply can't be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the upbeat scenario. If it is at all possible to repair the Coliseum, 
it must be done, and soon. No entertainment facility can compare in importance 
to a police or fire station, but a good case can be made that the Coliseum is 
special and, as such, merits special attention. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surrounding community in central Los Angeles, the Coliseum is a major 
employer and source of business revenues. For all Los Angeles, a relatively 
young city, the Coliseum is genuinely historic -- the site of two Olympics and 
speeches by presidents, popes and other leaders. And, as the many memorable 
games played there show, Coliseum events provide a sense of community for this 
diverse and dispersed metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Coliseum is on the National Registry of Historic Places, it 
qualifies for rebuilding money provided by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. Coliseum officials already have asked that the stadium be on the list 
of sites that will get FEMA funds if Congress approves President Clinton's 
$8.6-billion earthquake aid package. They estimate that an initial grant of $15 
million would be sufficient to begin repairs that would make the stadium ready 
for the start of next fall's football season. That is a reasonable request -- 
but the money should be granted only if structural engineers determine that the 
Coliseum can be made safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the worst-case scenario. Current estimates of rebuilding 
costs are based on preliminary inspections. A thorough engineering assessment 
is due next week. Should it turn out that a rebuilt stadium would not be safe, 
or that the cost would far exceed $35 million, all bets are off. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point Mayor Richard Riordan and County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke, chairwoman of the Coliseum Commission, would face some extremely hard 
decisions, including whether to raze a prized facility and whether Los Angeles 
has the financial wherewithal right now to build and operate a major new 
stadium. Let's hope that the Coliseum proves to be salvageable and that those 
decisions won't have to be made.

SHOOTING CASE: HAND IT OVER TO D.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police officers carry guns because they are in a dangerous business -- 
protecting the public from those who would harm others. Police are, in effect, 
licensed to use the force that is necessary to maintain peace and order.In 
return, the community must feel confident that officers use that force 
responsibly and judiciously. That's why the Los Angeles Police Department 
should cooperate fully in the district attorney's investigation of a 
controversial shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, officers were called to St. Vincent's Medical Center, where Sonji 
Danese Taylor was on the roof. Taylor was reported to be yelling and holding a 
knife in one hand and her 3-year-old son in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers managed to get the child away by using pepper spray on Taylor; 
later, officers said that they fired because she was threatening them with the 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor suffered 10 wounds; seven shots struck her in the back. No drugs or 
alcohol were found in her body, according to a coroner's report. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office rightly wants answers. The LAPD has refused to 
turn over internal documents until its own inquiry is completed. In a move that 
irked the LAPD, a frustrated D.A.'s office went to the grand jury. It didn't 
have to be that way.  
</P>
<P>
 Chief Willie L. Williams says he is committed to promoting openness between 
his department and the community. He can demonstrate that commitment by quickly 
ordering the LAPD to answer all questions about the strange death of Sonji 
Danese Taylor.

 * Our daughter was a tenant at Northridge Meadows. She was not in the 
apartment when the quake hit, for which we are very grateful. We also want to 
express gratitude in two other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff of FEMA was wonderful. Our daughter was able to get an appointment 
the Saturday following the quake. The two men from FEMA were efficient yet very 
patient and compassionate with my daughter, who was very emotional about the 
potential loss of her worldly and cherished possessions. Although you are 
nameless to us, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 The gentlemen from the Fire Department deserve an especially big thank you and 
pat on the back. On two occasions that following week these men, at personal 
risk to themselves, went into the building and salvaged a great many of her 
belongings. They did so with a care and understanding that can only come from 
people with big hearts. They will have our enduring gratitude.

 * First of all, I'm not Scrooge. I feel that those people deserving of 
earthquake relief should get it. But in looking at the long lines of people 
waiting for help from the government (i.e., taxpayers), I can't help but wonder 
if everyone there has tried to use his or her own resources first. This, of 
course, excludes those waiting for loans. 
</P>
<P>
 I was taught that you should have three months' salary saved to use in 
emergencies. It seems that even if their dwelling is uninhabitable the bank is 
still standing. Is the government here to bail out everyone? Do people really 
need 18 months of certificates for housing? Does everyone need food stamps? 
There is a surplus of apartments in the area. Everyone should be able to find 
one in a short period of time, say three months at the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's time we began looking to ourselves for solutions instead of 
depending on the government. 
</P>
<P>
 P.S. Has anyone thought of requiring earthquake insurance along with fire 
insurance to get a mortgage?

 * In regard to "The Next Terror: Challenge of Rebuilding" (Opinion, Jan. 30): 
The author describes the task of rebuilding as being slow in one paragraph and 
"perhaps impossible of realization" in another paragraph. This is most negative 
and pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has a diverse population and a diverse economy quite able 
to rebound from the natural disaster that occurred. Sadly, there are people and 
businesses that have and will suffer, but there are people and businesses that 
will try to turn this around to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilding is perhaps the wrong way to think about earthquake recovery, and 
the wrong way to approach the situation. Rather than rebuild what was old, why 
not use this as an opportunity to build something new? Why not think of the 
possibility of "new-building"? This is a time to rethink and change what 
doesn't work: the retail store to re-evaluate layout and store design, the 
homes and apartments that needed improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, loss of any kind is unfortunate, but the right approach is what we 
need at a time like this.

COLISEUM REPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The estimate to repair the Coliseum due to the earthquake is $35 million or 
more. The county supervisors are looking to the federal government to pick up 
the bill.Where are those good conservatives who want the federal government "to 
get off their backs"? I guess when it comes to disaster, "Big Brother" is the 
logical guy to turn to! 
</P>
<P>
 I have an idea for some of the repair money for the Coliseum. How about the 
National Football League pitching in with some money to help in reconstruction? 
Owners are now paying football players in the millions, which means they can 
afford it. Instead of the NFL conning cities to build stadiums for its owners' 
benefit, let's have the NFL give a few million back to Los Angeles for the 
repair of the Coliseum and, in turn, to benefit the Raiders (as a native son, 
how I dislike the name "Raiders"!). 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, let's get the government "off our backs" and put some of it on the NFL!

DEALING WITH ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Bobbitt and Menendez brothers cases have a common denominator, anger. 
None of them knew how to properly deal with their anger.Anger is a reaction to 
feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, not being heard, being discounted, 
used, abused, etc. If one is verbally attacked, it is better to say, "I feel 
that I am being attacked by you," rather than "you dumb S.O.B., you can't talk 
to me that way." The latter cuts off communication in a hostile fashion, the 
former opens the door for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 My point is that many parents do not know how to deal with their anger and 
bring up angry children who can learn to steal and murder, and have destroyed 
people and nations in their anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrist, psychologist and human behaviorists do have the technology to 
understand and educate the populace, yet they are ignored. I would highly 
recommend, if we are to survive as a civilization, that our government set up a 
department of human behavior, so that our populace can become better educated 
in dealing with their destructive feelings. It is better to start teaching 
about human behavior in kindergarten rather than in the penitentiary.

PERSPECTIVE ON U.S./JAPAN RELATIONS; WE'RE RISKING MORE THAN TOYOTAS; THE U.S. 
DEMAND FOR A SPECIFIC SHARE OF JAPAN'S MARKET IS NOT WORTH FORCING A SCHISM 
BETWEEN TWO GREAT PACIFIC POWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of President Clinton's meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa this week, the United States and Japan appear to be on a collision 
course. Both countries are preoccupied with internal problems -- political 
reform and economic stimulus in Tokyo; health care, personnel problems and the 
deficit in Washington. Both leaders have recently expended considerable 
political capital pursuing controversial free-trade policies that may make 
their respective America- and Japan-bashers all the more virulent and a 
reasonable deal all the more distant. And each side rightly blames the other's 
structural rigidities for their growing trade imbalance, which reached $50 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under these circumstances, there may not be much appetite for the kind of 
face-saving but superficial compromise that has long kept strained economic 
relations from poisoning the basic bilateral relationship. The Administration 
has repeatedly warned that it is willing to walk away from trade talks if Japan 
fails to accept its demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of what Washington wants is reasonable: specific market-opening measures 
in the insurance industry, liberalization of government procurement policies in 
telecommunications and medical supplies and reduced barriers to the sales of 
U.S. autos and auto parts. These are in the Japanese national interest as much 
as in our own. 
</P>
<P>
 But the core U.S. demand, in effect, that Japan should guarantee specific 
shares of its market for American-made imports, is ridiculous economics and 
questionable politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Every college economics student is taught that trade deficits reflect too 
little national savings and too much consumption, a condition that afflicts the 
United States, not Japan. Further, specific bilateral balances -- whether our 
deficit with Japan or our surplus with Mexico, so highlighted during the NAFTA 
debate -- are unlikely targets for government intervention since they reflect 
the cumulation of thousands of decisions made by individual buyers and sellers. 
And, finally, once the United States opens wider the Pandora's box of targeting 
specific levels of trade, the specious notion that some bureaucrat in 
Washington, Tokyo or elsewhere knows the right number of American-made mufflers 
or anything else the Japanese should buy is likely to spread. By any standard, 
that would be an open invitation for trade war. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Administration persists in this demand and if the Japanese continue to 
be adamant in their rejection (justified by a newfound commitment to at least 
the rhetoric of free trade), then the long-anticipated rupture in the bilateral 
relationship will finally be at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious question is, so what? Even if the United States and Japan 
eventually imposed reciprocal trade sanctions on each other, the reality is 
that the basic fabric of bilateral commercial and financial interaction is so 
dense that it would probably not be seriously affected. 
</P>
<P>
 But the impulse that would resonate from such a confrontation between the 
United States and Japan would go far beyond whether sales of Toyotas, Treasury 
bills or Hollywood movies can be sustained. A confrontation would signal that 
the two great Pacific powers, whose regional influence is already being 
challenged by China, which neither country seems to understand, are not going 
to be able to agree on the political, military, economic and commercial 
framework within which the fastest-growing region of the world will continue to 
develop. It would force countries in the region to choose between the United 
States and Japan -- or maybe between Japan and China. And it would collapse 
whatever promise the newly born Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) holds 
as a vehicle to assure American commercial access to the booming Pacific 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 To risk all of this in the name of a flawed concept is foolish. This is not to 
deny the Administration's understandable frustration with a persistently huge 
Japanese trade surplus or with Japanese trade policies that have resisted the 
conventional assaults of American trade negotiators. But the Japanese decision 
to give themselves a lower standard of living than their economy is capable of 
generating -- which is the inevitable result of protectionism -- is, after all, 
legitimately their decision to make. That this could be an underlying cause of 
the radical transformation of Japanese politics that seems to have begun only 
underscores the point that it is for the Japanese to decide how to organize 
their economy and then to deal with the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, President Clinton has to decide whether he really believes in 
free trade and the multilateral trading system he has just reinforced with the 
successful NAFTA and GATT negotiations. If he does, then he should stop trying 
to impose arbitrary targets for Japanese purchases of foreign-made goods or to 
micromanage Japanese economic change. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he should rely on the Japanese figuring out that the freest possible 
trade is essential to their national interest. And if they persist in failing 
to do so, then he should tell the Japanese leaders that this country, and the 
rest of the countries damaged by their actions, will aggressively seek 
protection through the GATT. In other words, he should forge a multilateral 
response to a multilateral problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Hosokawa could then turn to more appropriate and more promising 
matters for great-power summitry, such as building a stable relationship 
between the only two countries that can guarantee peace and prosperity in the 
most dynamic region of the world economy.

COLUMN RIGHT/ SUSAN CARPENTER MCMILLAN: WRONG TIME, WRONG MAN TO LIFT EMBARGO; 
THE VIETNAM WAR IS STILL AN OPEN WOUND. THE ONLY WAY TO HEAL IT IS TO ACCOUNT 
FOR ALL THE POWS AND MIAS. 
</P>

 I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I simply can't believe it. I am 
talking about President Clinton's decision to lift the trade embargo against 
Vietnam. With 2,200 servicemen still officially listed as missing in action, 
how dare we as a nation even think about doing business with a country that has 
refused to turn over all the information concerning prisoners of war and MIAs? 
</P>
<P>
 Before Clinton's decision, the Senate voted 62-38 to recommend that the 
President lift the 19-year-old trade embargo. An anonymous congressional source 
stated, "A lot of people just seem to be getting tired of this issue." What a 
cruel, thoughtless statement. Many of us can remember that Congress had no 
trouble, in the 1960s and '70s, in sending our boys over to Vietnam and asking 
them to give their lives and limbs. But now that the war is over and a 
supposedly appropriate amount of time has passed, it's back to business as 
usual. And business as usual is placing corporate profit over the value of 
human life. 
</P>
<P>
 I am so sick and tired of certain politicians who would never put their 
ethically decaying bodies on the front line, but are willing to abandon the men 
who did. If members of Congress wanted the embargo lifted, then why didn't they 
ask President Bush -- a war hero whose actions would not have been questioned 
by the country -- to do it? But for a man who dodged the draft, then lied about 
his draft-dodging antics, a man who shamefully demonstrated against his country 
on foreign soil while his peers were dying in Vietnam, a man who was given a 
tour through Russia by the communists during that sensitive time to be the one 
to lift the trade embargo is adding cruel insult to 20 years of pain.  
</P>
<P>
 I, too, was opposed to the war in Vietnam. It was indeed a divisive and 
controversial time. Good people supported the war and good people opposed it, 
but opposing the war and flirting with America's foreign enemies are two very 
different things. This cowardly, draft-dodging stranger to truth is once again 
betraying his country. Since when has Bill Clinton ever cared about corporate 
profit and promoting capitalism? The man never even held a real job. He has 
spent his entire career on public payrolls, yet suddenly we are to believe he 
is reborn and supposedly buckling under to the pressures of big business. I 
don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 Which leads me to suspect that Clinton's contempt for the military and the 
Vietnam War runs so deep that he is actually willing to abandon the families of 
POW/MIAs who have waited for years to be given that final word. There is 
something immoral and disgusting about opening up trade with a country that 
continually refuses to give us simple human-rights information. The last 
bargaining chip we as a nation held with Vietnam was the trade embargo, and now 
this President has foolishly given that away.  
</P>
<P>
 I am truly surprised that Clinton was willing to touch an issue dealing with 
Vietnam, since he is so vulnerable on this topic. Is it ironic or perhaps 
consistent that the man who turned on his country 25 years ago is the very one 
to reopen trade with a conquered country today? As Rep. Robert Dornan, 
(R-Garden Grove) put it, "We know Clinton was missing from Vietnam, but we need 
to find out what happened to the others who were actually there." 
</P>
<P>
 Some day, the time will come to put the war behind us, to let go, to heal deep 
wounds, but now is neither the time nor the right President. You cannot heal 
open wounds without proper treatment, and the only treatment that is proper is 
the full release of all information concerning our missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to Albro Lundy III of Beverly Hills, whose father is still listed as 
missing: "My father risked his life every day by flying search and rescue 
behind enemy lines . . . Now Clinton won't even bring him home.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe for a moment that corporate profit is driving Clinton. I 
believe instead that his deep disdain for those who fought and served in the 
Vietnam War is so ingrained that he has finally discovered the ultimate way to 
punish them -- total abandonment."

GIVE THE CHIMPS, AND THE PEOPLE, A BREAK; L.A. ZOO: ANIMALS NEED STIMULATING 
SETTINGS, WHICH ALSO ADDS TO OUR ENJOYMENT OF THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A $25-million Los Angeles Zoo renovation plan has sparked a debate about 
spending priorities: grand projects versus enhancement of the animals' 
environments. I have logged hundreds of hours observing the behavior of the 
zoo's 11 chimps, as well as the behavior of thousands of visitors. There is no 
doubt to me that the animals' needs should come first. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the chimps' deplorable enclosure -- one that is entirely concrete 
except for some ropes and a hammock -- they usually have little to do. So 
visitors see them looking terribly bored, if not severely depressed, as they 
lay idle, stare at seemingly nothing, eat their feces, repetitiously pull out 
their hair, groom obsessively or anxiously pace. Under these circumstances, it 
is not surprising that whether people respond with expressions of 
disappointment, pity, sadness, anger or disgust, or whether they clap, shout or 
throw things to try to "wake up" the chimps, visitors invariably beat hasty 
retreats. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, thanks to the dedication of zoo staff and volunteers, enriching materials 
are routinely placed in the enclosure that allow the chimps to use tools, build 
nests, play with objects, explore or forage for food; that is, to develop some 
of the skills for which their wild counterparts have become famous. When 
provided with such opportunities, the chimps come alive and demonstrate the 
high levels of intelligence that they possess. And the people grow more 
fascinated, ask questions and learn. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the current chimp enclosure was never designed to maintain 
the kind of constantly varying stimulation that chimpanzees' minds require. So 
their reprieve from monotony is always short-lived as the concrete enclosure 
must be routinely raked clean and hosed down, necessitating the removal of all 
materials that they might find interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike 27 years ago when this enclosure first opened, we now know how to 
design naturalistic captive habitats that do provide the kinds of ongoing 
stimulation needed by chimps if they are to maintain their mental health. We 
also know that such habitats simultaneously serve as the most powerful 
educational laboratories available to people -- short of trips to wild animal 
parks or to Africa itself. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that those who decide how to spend the $25 million allocated to the zoo 
will ask themselves: What good are a new entrance and educational center when 
zoo visitors see real chimps who are so bored that they eat feces and pluck 
themselves bald? I am convinced that people do not want to see depressed 
animals. I suspect that those who do don't come back. Surely this isn't good 
for the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that the chimps at the L.A. Zoo make up one of the largest and 
most socially sophisticated chimpanzee groups in the country. They represent a 
species that shares almost 99% genetic similarity to humans, more than any 
other living species. Isn't it time that visitors see just how remarkable they 
are? And don't the chimps deserve the opportunity to show us simply by being 
allowed to live better? 
</P>
<P>
 So, yes, let there be a new educational center at the zoo. Indeed, let there 
be many and let them consist of intelligently designed naturalistic habitats 
that will allow all the zoo's residents to develop their full genetic 
potentials and that will allow the people to learn by watching them do so.

 Digging out of the rubble will require creativity and leadership. It's time 
for bold approaches and new ideas. Here are two: 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce traffic congestion, why not, for a time, make the buses, trains and 
subways free? "It won't work," the critics will say."You'll never get Southern 
Californians out of their cars." Wrong. Watch how quickly we'll leave our cars 
behind after we've had two or three frustrating weeks of spending four hours on 
what is normally a one- or two-hour commute. By establishing express routes on 
heavily traveled arteries such as the 10 and the 14, and by running extra 
buses, the MTA can make shared commuting a reasonable alternative. The dollars 
that will be "lost" in fares will pale in comparison with the hundreds of 
millions the economy is losing to congestion and lost productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 And, to restore Southern California's social order, why not hire and train 
unemployed youth to help rebuild? Why not give some of South-Central's and the 
Eastside's long-term unemployed the opportunity to learn a trade? Such a 
program would rebuild the region's infrastructure and strengthen our most 
precious resource -- underdeveloped human capital.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; LOSS DROPS UCLA BACK TO NO. 9

<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA, which dropped from No. 1 to No. 3 in the Associated Press college 
basketball poll after losing to California, fell to No. 9 after Sunday's loss 
to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina, which beat Duke in a No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown last Thursday, 
returned to No. 1 Monday, receiving 60 first-place votes and 1,617 points from 
the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels (19-3), the preseason No. 1 coming off their national 
championship, held the spot for the first week of the regular season and have 
now had it twice during the run of six polls with a different top team. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke (16-2) switched places with North Carolina, receiving three first-place 
votes and 1,486 points. The Blue Devils were the record sixth school to be No. 
1 this season, but like North Carolina, Kansas and UCLA, they were beaten the 
week they moved to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels have home games with Maryland and Georgia Tech this week as they 
try for the weekly repeat. Georgia Tech beat North Carolina earlier in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas, which had one first-place vote, and Kentucky each moved up three 
spots to third and fourth. They meet Wednesday night at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas dropped from third to fifth after losing to Missouri last week and was 
followed by Connecticut, Louisville, and Temple, which had a first-place vote.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A STORY -- AND CHARACTERS -- OF LITTLE SUBSTANCE; BONDAGE 
BY PATTI DAVIS ; SIMON & SCHUSTER $23, 338 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Children's television shows are supposed to do more than just sell licensed 
products to impressionable kids. Programming should have some inherent merit; 
then, if it wins those wee hearts and minds, as "Sesame Street" has done, it 
earns the right to exploit the connection with every conceivable kind of toy 
and game. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't adults deserve similar consideration? Shouldn't a novel have a higher 
purpose than simply selling lots of books? 
</P>
<P>
 If I sound cranky, I have cause. Ex-First Daughter Patti Davis (who, God 
knows, must have a treasure trove of material that she could transform into 
fiction) has written a novel about what it's like to be in sexual thrall to 
someone -- to give yourself up, past reason, despite the fact that every 
warning light on your spiritual dashboard is flashing. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide the illusion that this is a multidimensional story, she has a 
subplot about the heroine's friend, who is enslaved both figuratively (by her 
sorry past) and literally (by a pop culture messiah selling dime-store 
salvation). But she pays as little attention to the story's framework as she 
can get away with. 
</P>
<P>
 The main character, Sara, was jumped by three of the neighbor boys when she 
was 12, fought them off, and decided right then to learn everything she could 
about the opposite sex so she would never again fall prey to one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 That enough foreshadowing for you? Fast forward: Sara's gone Hollywood, become 
a costume designer, befriended Belinda (possessed of a tragic secret) and met 
Anthony the famous director, a man who, with a single laser glance, cuts 
through all those decades of defensiveness. Sara is all over him -- and him, 
her.  
</P>
<P>
 She does things she swore she would never do -- some of them printable, such 
as turning down work to follow Anthony to Paris, and some of them not, such as 
the episode involving the starlet or the stuff about alternate uses for 
bathrobe sashes and silk scarves. 
</P>
<P>
 Will our heroine hit bottom, and can she bounce back? Is there any dastardly 
sexual deed that Anthony won't consider? Does anyone really believe that 
Belinda (clearly a descendant of the little guy with the black cloud over his 
head in the L'il Abner comic strip) will pick herself up, dust herself off, and 
start all over again?  
</P>
<P>
 If you care, you've put more effort into reading the book than Davis put into 
writing it. Let's start with the characters. Anthony starts out sounding 
promisingly dark -- until he heads off to Paris to direct a banal romance, at 
which point any alert reader flips back to the first description to make sure 
it's the same guy. Has he taken early philosophical retirement? Is he falling 
in love with love and losing his edge? We don't know enough about him to guess. 
A clue would have been nice (she says he'd decided "to try a safe, 
non-controversial film," but she doesn't tell us why). 
</P>
<P>
 But then, how much do we know about Sara? She has long brown hair and split 
ends. She has an active fantasy life. She's ambivalent about what's happening 
and unsure of what to do. Hello; could we have another helping? 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Beattie, that master of minimalist fiction, always manages to suggest that 
she knows everything about her characters and has simply chosen to share 
certain evocative details with the reader. Davis, unfortunately, gives the 
opposite impression -- that she hasn't thought through the material, that what 
you see is all she's got. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad thing is, Davis seems to believe that withholding is a viable approach 
to life -- that the more you keep to yourself, the better off you are. Belinda 
and Sara are destroyed by intimacy, in a way, or by their stultifying inability 
to put bad news behind them. Maybe Davis is saying men are jerks and should be 
avoided, except that they can be fun in bed. Maybe she's saying women are 
fools.  
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe, just maybe, Davis is smarter than the rest of us: She knows that sex 
sells, and it doesn't need any fancy wrapping to make it walk out of the store. 
A plain brown wrapper will do, which is all she's given us. There might have 
been a better book here, a braver one, if she'd been willing to give into it a 
bit more.

<P>
 The California Arts Council granted East Indian dancer Ramya Harishankar of 
Irvine a spot on its Touring Artists Directory for 1995-1997. Those who present 
artists on the roster are eligible for partial fee subsidies from the CAC. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, meeting at the Bowers Museum here last month, also extended by 
two weeks the Feb. 1 deadline for certain organizational grant applicants in 
Los Angeles County affected by the Northridge earthquake. The extension applies 
to educational, service and multidisciplinary performing-presenting and visual 
arts organizations.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; CHAVEZ'S LOSS HAS AFTERSHOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has time finally passed Julio Cesar Chavez by? 
</P>
<P>
 Even in this upset-strewn period in boxing, full of new faces and fallen 
champions, Chavez's loss to little-known Frankie Randall on Jan. 29 was 
staggering, an end-of-an-era kind of moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Norris lost recently, but he had been driven to the canvas before. 
</P>
<P>
 Riddick Bowe's defeat by Evander Holyfield didn't surprise insiders nearly as 
much as it did the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Morrison was a disaster waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez barely getting a draw against Pernell Whitaker couldn't be called a 
shock given Whitaker's technical proficiency. Whitaker is left-handed and a top 
fighter in his prime; he fought a brilliant fight, and still did not knock down 
Chavez. The decision? That was merely a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chavez losing to Randall? And most stunning of all, getting knocked down 
for the first time in his career in the 11th round by a 32-year-old fighter 
getting his first title opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
 It was similar to the moment when Roberto Duran quit against Sugar Ray 
Leonard, or when Mike Tyson was upset by Buster Douglas. These events cannot be 
explained away or ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who saw Chavez collapse onto the MGM Grand Garden canvas, victim of a 
jolting Randall right hand to the face, anybody who saw the dazed, desperate 
look in his eyes during his last-gasp 12th-round attack, understands that 
things will be different from now on. 
</P>
<P>
 At 31, he is slower. He is not as strong. He is tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of sad," veteran trainer Eddie Futch said. "Chavez was a great 
fighter who meant a lot to a lot of people. But we knew this day was going to 
come someday." 
</P>
<P>
 He gave glimpses during the Whitaker fight of his growing frustration, but 
after the Randall loss, obviously, Chavez is not the same fighter who dominated 
boxing for years, who had gone undefeated in 28 previous title fights, who 
seemed to win by sheer force of will. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Randall bout, Chavez is merely another aging, beatable fighter, and 
for boxing, that changes everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still a big draw, still a national hero (in Mexico)," trainer Alex 
Shearer said. "People want to see if he can climb the mountain again. He's 
still a part of history -- he's the greatest Mexican fighter of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he's been losing it gradually. I don't think people were paying 
attention. Ever since he fought Meldrick Taylor, he's been fighting bums, with 
the exception of Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time you couldn't hit Chavez with a clean right hand. Now, guys 
just go jab, jab, jab and then stick Chavez with a strong right hand. Frankie 
Randall, of all people, drops him with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time has beaten down the man. Think about all the fights, the thousands of 
punches. Sooner or later, it has to take its toll." 
</P>
<P>
 Through his promoter, Don King, Chavez turned down the Whitaker camp's offer 
of $9 million for a rematch. Last week, Whitaker promoter Dan Duva said they no 
longer have any interest in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julio Cesar Chavez should punch Don King in the mouth, and then punch himself 
in the mouth for allowing Don King to bully him into not taking Pernell 
Whitaker instead of taking Frankie Randall for one-fifth of the money," Duva 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it before, but now there's no question, Pernell Whitaker is the 
best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. Julio Cesar Chavez now is in the 
ranks of the also-rans." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez has had 91 professional fights and has won 89 of them, so his 
bitterness and sour grapes immediately after the loss were hardly surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 An acquaintance of his said last week that Chavez, after watching the tape of 
the fight carefully, has finally acknowledged that he lost the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 But does it matter now? Even if he comes back and defeats Randall in their 
scheduled May 7 rematch, has Chavez slipped permanently from boxing's highest 
level? 
</P>
<P>
 "Chavez was a great, great champion," Oscar De La Hoya said. "I called up my 
father right after (the fight) and he said, 'It's over for him.' I believe it, 
too. He's had fights, just tough fights, and he's been getting hit a lot and 
it's been wearing him out. He got dropped, and when he got up he was stung. 
</P>
<P>
 "Randall wasn't a fast, good-technician fighter. It was a big disappointment 
for everybody, but he's had so many fights, he should just quit." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, who was being suggested as a possible opponent for Chavez, said 
every boxer coming up in the Chavez-dominated divisions will feel the effect of 
his loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that a lot of fighters coming up, a lot of young stars, a lot of 
fighters who didn't have the opportunity to be in the limelight, they have a 
chance to prove themselves," De La Hoya said. "There was a lot of attention on 
Chavez, they would just focus on him. Now a lot of fighters in the 
junior-lightweights, lightweights, junior-welterweights have a chance at it." 
</P>
<P>
 And De La Hoya said he no longer believes that he will fight Chavez. "I 
believe that was HBO's idea, me fighting Chavez," he said. "But now he's going 
downhill and I'm picking up more experience and coming up. It would've been a 
big, big, huge fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Evander Holyfield, who has signed to defend his International Boxing 
Federation and World Boxing Assn. heavyweight titles against No. 1 contender 
Michael Moorer (34-0, 30 knockouts) at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on April 22, 
hasn't fought a left-hander since 1986. If Moorer wins, he would become the 
first left-handed heavyweight champion in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Want an indication of how the local fight scene is heating up? Go to Larry 
Goossen's gym in Big Bear City, where Oscar De La Hoya is training for his 
March 5 fight, where Rafael Ruelas is sparring with junior-welterweight Hector 
Lopez and others before Ruelas' Feb. 19 title bout at the Forum and where 
Kennedy McKinney, the International Boxing Federation junior-featherweight 
champion, is training for his Feb. 19 fight overseas. Last week, the most 
compelling action was four fast rounds of sparring between Ruelas and Lopez, 
who has the same kind of busy style as Ruelas' opponent, IBF lightweight 
champion Freddie Pendleton. "Hector will be here until the end because he can 
give me the inside work and he can move like the dickens," said Joe Goossen, 
Ruelas' trainer. "He's in the top 10 in the world -- how often can you get 
sparring with the top 10 in the world? He knows every trick, he's had many, 
many fights, so he's going to prepare Rafa with a variety of styles and 
punches, and that's what you need." Said Ruelas: "He's somebody that I can 
definitely push myself with. . . . I can push myself to the level I need to be 
at." Boxing Calendar

MORNING BRIEFING: SUPERMAN SHOWS BO A FEW THINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Feb. 27 episode of "Lois & Clark: the New Adventures of Superman," 
Clark Kent will play a one-on-one basketball game against new Angel Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 After an obligatory "Bo knows jump shots" line, Kent, played by former 
Princeton football standout Dean Cain, leaps super high to block a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent returns to Earth, smiling sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Jackson: "Bo don't know that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Bo: Before anyone writes off Jackson, Peter Schmuck of the Baltimore Sun 
points out that only three players last season hit longer home runs.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson hit a 472-foot shot in Seattle's Kingdome, the sixth-longest of the 
season, according to IBM Tale of the Tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Tigers' Cecil Fielder had three longer home runs, and Dean Palmer 
of the Texas Rangers and Andres Galarraga of the Colorado Rockies also went 
deeper than Jackson.

players to have scored 100 points in a game?

 Shaken Shirley: You'd think drag racer Shirley Muldowney has felt worse 
shakings than the 6.7 earthquake on Jan. 17. Not so, apparently.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our house is 1 1/2 blocks from the Northridge apartment building that 
collapsed," she told National Dragster magazine.  
</P>
<P>
 "The shaking was at least 10 times worse than any tire shake I ever had on the 
track. During the two hours before the sun came, up we had good reason to 
believe everything was flattened from here to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the quake, we've been sleeping in our truck because our nerves are on 
edge.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm out of here. We're looking for property in Northern Michigan right now." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The joker: Fred Richman, longtime friend of NFL Hall of Fame member Dick 
Butkus, says some of Butkus' greatest plays were as a practical joker, not as a 
linebacker for the Bears.  
</P>
<P>
 "The two of us spent a weekend at a friend's Chicago apartment once," Richman 
recalled. "At the last minute, the friend had to go out of town, and he asked 
us to help out a carpet installer when he came. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the guy finished with the carpet, Dick and I moved all the furniture. We 
put his couch in the kitchen, put his refrigerator in the bedroom. . . . stuff 
like that. Then we left. 
</P>
<P>
 "A month later, Dick called the guy and asked how he liked the carpet.  
</P>
<P>
 "The guy told him: 'The carpet's great, but that installer -- what a . . . 
idiot that guy was.' "

IT'S CHILD'S PLAY AS KIDD AND CAL ROUT NORTHRIDGE; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: POINT 
GUARD SCORES 24 IN 93-63 VICTORY OVER MATADORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So much had changed in the 364 days since California last played host to Cal 
State Northridge in Harmon Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Bozeman, who debuted against Northridge a year ago, no longer carries the 
title of interim coach and the Golden Bears no longer need a wave of emotion to 
blow past a team such as the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, talent and poise are more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cal blew out Northridge, 93-63, in a nonconference game Monday before 
6,578, Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy was asked to compare the 18th-ranked Bears 
with the team that defeated the Matadors by 24 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a year older and a year better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And no longer playing amid turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Campanelli, who was fired and replaced by Bozeman exactly a year ago, is a 
distant memory. In fact, Bozeman, who is 26-6 since taking over, claimed he 
would have forgotten the anniversary if the local media allowed him to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look back to last year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably because he and the Bears seem to have a bright future. Cal (15-4) has 
won five in a row with Pacific 10 Conference games at home against Arizona 
State and Arizona scheduled this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Northridge, Jason Kidd and Lamond Murray did most of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd scored a game-high 24 points, had a team-high seven rebounds, added five 
assists and five steals, and then pronounced himself ready to try out for the 
Cal baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball comes way before the NBA," said Kidd, a sophomore point guard. "I'd 
have to go through baseball, finish that, re-evaluate my basketball season and 
go from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray had 22 points and five rebounds in 25 minutes. Michael Stewart, a 
6-foot-10 freshman, set a school record with seven blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (4-15) got 15 points from Peter Micelli, 10 from Brent Lofton, nine 
points and eight assists from Andre Chevalier and six steals from Brooklyn 
McLinn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors also committed as many turnovers -- 25 -- as they made field 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They totally dominated us," Cassidy said. "You have to take care of the 
basketball better than we did tonight if you're going to stay in a competitive 
realm with a team like Cal." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge led once, 7-6, at which point Cal ran off 10 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're quick and perceptive," Cassidy added. "You can ask a lot of teams -- 
like UCLA -- what happens when they turn it on." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal led by 17 points at the half despite shooting 37.8%. In the second half, 
the Bears shot 68%. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge shot 37.9%, the 12th consecutive team to shoot less than 45% 
against Cal.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
 If their teammates played with as much enthusiasm as the lowest-paid Laker and 
Clipper -- CBA products Reggie Jordan and Harold Ellis -- it would be a lot 
more fun to watch pro basketball in this town. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The plus side to the Lakers having no all-stars is that everyone but Nick Van 
Exel, who will play in Saturday's rookies games, will have four days off after 
playing three consecutive nights. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Sacramento Kings, who were in town when the earthquake hit and play the 
makeup game Thursday night at the Forum, will find that not much has changed. 
The quakes are continuing, except they are called aftershocks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA was overrated at No. 1 two weeks ago -- and underrated at No. 13 in the 
Associated Press preseason poll. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Six of the 11 teams in the so-called Big Ten have been ranked in the top 25 
this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Bob Boyd will honor the Utah State assistant coach and former head 
coach at schools too numerous to mention Wednesday at 7 p.m. at a dinner at the 
Red Lion Inn in Costa Mesa. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Strings, who have been disbanded, was Jerry Buss' first sports 
franchise. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Buss' World Team Tennis venture wound up costing him millions of dollars, but 
he has a championship trophy to show for it. The 1978 Strings, led by Chris 
Evert, defeated the Boston Lobsters, led by Martina Navratilova, for the title. 
. . .

</P>
<P>
 There have been more famous winners of the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award, 
but none more grateful or perhaps more deserving than Phil Grove. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Winning the award came as the greatest shock of my life," Grove said during 
ceremonies Sunday in the walking ring at Santa Anita."I felt honored just being 
nominated." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Grove, 46, who was the leading apprentice rider in the nation in 1967, has

NHL ROUNDUP; LEMIEUX CONSIDERS RETIREMENT; PENGUINS LOSE TO CANADIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The news was bad for the Pittsburgh Penguins even before they lost to the 
Montreal Canadiens, 4-1, on Monday night at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Lemieux, whose condition was diagnosed as Hodgkin's disease last season, 
is so frustrated by his bad back he's talking about retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm 28 going on 48," the defending NHL scoring champion said. "If 
it doesn't work out this year, I'll think about retiring this summer." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time Lemieux has discussed leaving hockey. Last fall, he 
disdained talk of a premature retirement, saying he still had things to 
accomplish. After a battery of radiation treatments sent his cancer into 
remission, Lemieux came back to win the scoring title last season and 
proclaimed he was still hungry to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Two operations and three months away from competitive hockey haven't 
alleviated the back pain. He has appeared in only four of the Penguins' 52 
games this season. He has played a regular shift in only two. He hasn't been in 
the lineup since Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mornings, Lemieux wakes up and feels fine. Other days he needs help to 
tie his shoes. There has been no way to predict how his back will feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemieux said he will discuss his future with those close to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm the one who feels the pain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the absence of Lemieux, the Penguins have spent most of this season in 
first place in the Northeast Division, but the Canadiens moved a point ahead of 
them with Monday night's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal scored on each of its first two power-play chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 4, N.Y. Rangers 1 -- Steve Konowalchuk and Michael Pivonka scored 
43 seconds apart during the Capitals' three-goal second period at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 2, Toronto 1 -- Tim Bergland and Randy Poeschek each scored for the 
Lightning, which held the Maple Leafs without a shot on goal during the final 
14 minutes at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 4, Edmonton 3 -- Robert Reichel scored two goals to lead the Flames at 
Calgary.

NBA ROUNDUP; AUGMON SCORES 26 TO LEAD HAWKS' 44-POINT WIN OVER PISTONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stacey Augmon scored a season-high 26 points and the Atlanta Hawks made 64% of 
their shots and had their highest-scoring game of the season in a 141-97 rout 
of the Detroit Pistons on Monday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody came in, played hard and just took the game away from them," said 
Coach Lenny Wilkens after the Hawks recorded their largest victory margin since 
moving to Atlanta. "I was very happy with that. When you get a chance to put a 
team out of the game, you want to. Tonight we didn't give them any 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Five other Hawks scored in double figures -- Mookie Blaylock with 18, 
Dominique Wilkins 17, Kevin Willis 16, Craig Ehlo 15 and rookie Doug Edwards 
11, his season high. Willis also had 11 rebounds and Augmon matched his season 
high with 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta never trailed after Wilkins, who made his first seven shots, broke a 
2-2 tie. A 15-4 second-quarter run in which Ehlo, Wilkins and Ennis Whatley 
each scored four points gave Atlanta a 51-30 lead 3:55 before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks have won eight of their last 10 games, while Detroit has lost 23 of 
25. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Houston led the Pistons with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 104, Golden State 99 -- Rik Smits, who had season highs of 28 points 
and 13 rebounds, made a key basket with 14 seconds to play at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the sixth in a row for Indiana, equaling its longest winning 
streak in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 125, Charlotte 117 -- Jeff Hornacek scored 36 points and Tim 
Perry scored a career-high 31, including a club-record seven three-point 
baskets, to lead the 76ers at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets, who have been without Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning since 
late December, have lost seven in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 96, New York 85 -- Rony Seikaly sparked a third-quarter surge and scored 
22 points to help the Heat overcome a 17-point deficit at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami, which has won five of its last six games, had lost 10 in a row against 
the Knicks.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; EX-U.S. COACH SAYS HE HAS NO REASON TO BE ASHAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Peterson feels no need to defend either his brusque manner or his gung-ho 
offensive strategy, although he was vilified for both as the U.S. hockey coach 
at Calgary in 1988 and again at Albertville, France, four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played very well (in '88) and I know most people would find that 
shocking," Peterson says of a team that finished seventh with future NHL stars 
Brian Leetch, Craig Janney, Tony Granato, Kevin Stevens and Mike Richter. "You 
second-guess yourself and say, 'Should our (pre-Olympic) schedule have been 
tougher?' And you think, 'Should we have had a few older players?' But with the 
rules and format in effect then, those were the players available. I have no 
apologies over who we picked and how we performed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'If you had all that talent, how come you didn't win?' I turn 
around and say, 'Maybe we did a pretty good job preparing them for the NHL.' I 
thought I did a pretty good job coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1992, I thought we came up a little emotionally dry in the bronze-medal 
game. By and large, I thought the players played well and we got the maximum 
out of them. Obviously, we had a great goalkeeper in Ray LeBlanc." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he ignored the criticism heaped upon him, even when officials of the 
International Olympic Committee mocked the team's defensive disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to be in the coaching profession, you've got to live with 
it," adds Peterson, whose work as technical director of USA Hockey, the sport's 
governing body, includes compiling instructional material for players and 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always feel there are little things you'd do differently. The tournament 
is such that if you played it every week, you'd have a different winner. There 
are so many factors: How a player plays that day, how a team plays, how well 
you are physically, how well you adjust, especially if the Games are in another 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, 63, will watch these Games on TV at home in Colorado Springs. "I 
think all coaches miss coaching, especially about now when the team is getting 
ready for a big competition," he says. "It's a great adventure. You say to 
yourself, 'It would be great to be doing this again,' but knowing the hard 
work, you're glad you're not doing it." MORE BAD MEMORIES 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years after he coached the United States to seventh place at Sarajevo, 
Yugoslavia, Lou Vairo has more excuses than Olympic victories. No one, he says, 
knew center Pat LaFontaine was ill and couldn't take medication because it was 
banned, or that defenseman Chris Chelios broke his foot in the first game. Or 
that David A. Jensen had a knee injury. No one made allowances for Al Iafrate 
and Ed Olczyk being 17, or for the effects of David Hirsch hitting the crossbar 
with the U.S. team trailing Canada, 3-2, in the opener, a game that killed 
American medal hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that made me feel saddest is the world didn't see them at their 
best," says Vairo, director of special projects for USA Hockey. "We were 2-2-2 
and we lost to two great teams, Canada and Czechoslovakia. That same year, 
Czechoslovakia beat Canada at the World Championships." 
</P>
<P>
 Vairo believes that he and Peterson have been maligned. "I've yet to hear 
anybody say we did a great job of player development. Leetch, Janney, Stevens . 
. . Nobody said Dave Peterson or Lou Vairo did a great job in player 
development. No, we didn't win a medal, but we did some things well. We didn't 
ruin them, anyway." SITTING PAT 
</P>
<P>
 LaFontaine still rues his team's showing in '84. And it probably should have 
been better, because he and many of his teammates had successful NHL careers. 
He played with Olczyk, center Corey Millen, Chelios -- a two-time Norris Trophy 
winner -- and Iafrate, a four-time all-star. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a really talented team, but every place we went (on an exhibition 
tour), they had a reception for us and that might have distracted us," said 
LaFontaine, the Buffalo Sabres' top center. "We ended up playing 65 games. I 
look back and say we played some of our best hockey before the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, LaFontaine set a record for American-born players when he had 148 
points and was runner-up to NHL scoring champion Mario Lemieux. He underwent 
knee surgery in November, but is progressing rapidly and might return in May. 
HE'S AN OLYMPIC FLAME 
</P>
<P>
 Dave King's mind will be with the Calgary Flames, but his heart will be with 
the Canadian Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 King, the Flames' coach, led Canada to fourth-place finishes in 1984 and '88 
and to a silver medal in '92. As these Games approach, he pines for the drama 
of international competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be doing what I'm doing, but the Olympic hockey tournament to me 
is the highlight for any coach or athlete," said King, who had Eric Lindros, 
Joe Juneau and Sean Burke on his squad at Albertville. "I made so many friends 
there and at the World Championships. You miss seeing those people." 
</P>
<P>
 King sees no clear favorite in the competition, which will begin Saturday. 
"The U.S. and Canadian teams are really good, and I think they can go a far 
ways," he says. "I don't think the Russians are as strong as in the past, and 
since the split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, their depth is thinned. . 
. . It's going to be awesome." VIKTOR, VICTORIOUS 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Duck defenseman Alexei Kasatonov, who played for the Soviet Union in 
1980, '84 and '88, knows little about the Olympic field, "Just what I see in 
the newspaper," he says. "Five, maybe six teams have a chance to win." He does 
know Viktor Tikhonov will coach Russia, and that's enough for him to predict a 
strong performance, despite a total roster turnover since the Unified Team's 
'92 gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He prepares the team very well, I believe, from my experience with him," adds 
Kasatonov, who got one silver and two gold medals under Tikhonov. "He won three 
Olympics. No question, he is a great coach and a good teacher. Tikhonov will 
show he can work not just with the best players, but with any player." EYES ON 
LILLEHAMMER 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Duck wing Joe Sacco (U.S. '92) has a strong interest in the American 
team: His brother, David, is a center. "It's only going to help him," Sacco 
says. "For me, it was a great experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Other local Olympians: the Ducks' Sean Hill, Tim Sweeney (U.S. '92), Patrik 
Carnback (Sweden '92), Anatoli Semenov (Soviet Union '88); the Kings' Granato 
(U.S. '88), Tomas Sandstrom (Sweden '84), Alex Zhitnik (Unified Team '92), 
Shawn McEachern (U.S. '92), Robert Lang (Czechoslovakia '92), Tim Watters 
(Canada '80 and '88), Jari Kurri (Finland '80). 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I would have been able to make the jump to the NHL without 
playing in the Olympics," Granato says.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: NORCO'S GENTIS IS OVERLOOKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things could not have gone any better for Shane Gentis last football season. 
The senior rushed for 1,571 yards, added 754 yards in receptions and scored 28 
touchdowns to help lead Norco to an undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
 For his efforts, Gentis was voted to the All-Southern Section team and 
selected as the Riverside County player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this was not enough to obtain a Division I college scholarship. Gentis 
was ignored last Wednesday on national letter-of-intent day. Three of his 
teammates signed with Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with," Gentis said. "I know 
I'm good enough, but the recruiters think different." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentis' main problem is size. He is 5 feet 8 and 195 pounds. He runs the 
40-yard dash in 4.6 seconds. Recruiters prefer backs that size to be able to 
run the 40 in 4.2 or 4.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he received letters of interest from many major colleges, Gentis said 
the attention started to wane in November. He took a paid visit to Colorado 
State two weeks ago, but after he arrived there coaches told him they did not 
have a scholarship available. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got back from that trip, I realized that college coaches didn't think 
I was good enough," Gentis said. "It really hit me hard." 
</P>
<P>
 He might attend junior college in the fall or try to join a lower-division 
college program. He could also be a walk-on at a big school. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other notable players without scholarships, including quarterback 
Seka Edwards of Westchester, offensive tackle Jason Rempel of Calabasas and 
running backs Enrico Bozman of Los Alamitos and Chris Johnson of Saugus. 
</P>

 Dean Bradshaw, boys' basketball coach at Simi Valley, has been suspended for 
the remainder of the season for shoving one of his players during a game 
against Westlake on Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was made by officials of the Simi Valley Unified School District 
last Thursday. Bradshaw, who was suspended after the incident, was told of the 
punishment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw, in his sixth year as coach, shoved senior reserve guard Sam 
Rodriguez to the floor for apparently not playing well in the fourth quarter of 
the Westlake game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret the incident and I apologize to the Simi Valley community and Sam 
Rodriguez," said Bradshaw, who will return to his coaching job at the end of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (15-6) will be coached by Brian Saunders, a local attorney who has 
worked with many of the players in youth basketball leagues. Saunders took over 
two weeks ago and is 3-1. 
</P>

<P>
 Security has been increased and tickets limited for Wednesday night's boys' 
basketball game between Gardena Serra and Santa Monica St. Monica. The Camino 
Real League showdown will begin at 7 at Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Hernandez, Serra's principal, said he has assigned two additional 
police officers to the game and that the crowd will be limited to 150 fans from 
each school. 
</P>
<P>
 The precautions are being taken because of a fight that broke out between the 
teams in their last meeting Jan. 24 at St. Monica. Two players were ejected, 
and Serra Coach Dwan Hurt struck a parent who was hitting one of his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez and Cheryl Milner, St. Monica's principal, were ordered by league 
officials to improve the atmosphere for Wednesday's game. Milner suggested 
playing before no fans, but Hernandez obtained a compromise to limit the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF State Federated Council passed a motion last week that requires the 
midcourt stripe to be used in girls' basketball. Girls currently are not 
penalized for returning the ball to backcourt after it has been advanced to 
front court. The rule goes into effect next season. . . . The San Juan 
Capistrano St. Margaret's boys' basketball team set a Southern Section 
single-game scoring record last Tuesday with a 151-35 victory over South Gate 
Southeast Lutheran. The record of 144 was set by Ribet Academy against Antelope 
Valley Christian during the 1990-91 season. . . . This is the final week of the 
regular season for boys' and girls' basketball teams in the Southern Section. 
Playoff pairings will be announced this weekend. City Section basketball teams 
have two more weeks left in the regular season. Times' Top 20 Basketball Polls

VALLEY-AREA DIGEST: BELL-JEFF BASKETBALL COACH TO QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing frustration with the athletes and athletic department at Bell-Jeff 
High, basketball Coach Steve Wahl said Monday he will not coach at the school 
after this season. Wahl resigned as the school's baseball coach in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a difference in philosophy with me and the school and particularly 
the athletic department," said Wahl, whose team is 9-13. "I'm a little 
disillusioned with Bell-Jeff athletes. I think I'm working harder than they 
are, and that's wrong. You get to that point and you have to hang it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Wahl has kicked two basketball players off the team, two others have quit, and 
three starters -- Dave Matekel, Anthony Couch and Mike Reyes -- were ruled 
academically ineligible Monday. Of the 14 players Wahl began the season with, 
six remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Wahl, 42, has coached basketball, tennis and baseball at various times for the 
past eight years at Bell-Jeff. JEFF FLETCHER

SUSPECT IN KIDNAPING OF GAMING MOGUL'S DAUGHTER PLEADS GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A key suspect in the kidnaping of the daughter of gaming mogul Steve Wynn 
pleaded guilty Monday as part of a plea bargain that could result in a sentence 
of 17 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Paul Watkins agreed as part of the deal to testify against alleged 
kidnaping mastermind Ray Cuddy and two others charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Cuddy said he also was talking with prosecutors, amid 
increasing indications the case may never go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're discussing it with the government," said attorney Mitchell Posin. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy, Watkins and Jacob Harold Sherwood were indicted on several charges in 
the July 26 abduction of 26-year-old Kevin Wynn from her Las Vegas home. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynn was found bound and blindfolded but unharmed a few hours after her 
abduction in the back of her car in the parking lot at McCarran International 
Airport. Her father, chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., had paid a $1.45-million 
ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy, the reputed ringleader, was arrested a few days later in Newport Beach 
while buying a $196,000 Ferrari. Watkins and Sherwood were apprehended in St. 
Louis on Sept. 20.

COLLEGE PAY RAISES AND FEE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what could only described as a miscarriage of fiscal responsibility, the 
University of California regents have decided to award merit pay increases to 
the top brass of the UC system, while simultaneously approving yet another 
increase in student fees. 
</P>
<P>
 University of California President Jack Peltason has justified fee hikes with 
a "need to share the pain." With whom is the pain being shared? Certainly not 
those university officials whose salaries have been increased. 
</P>
<P>
 As an Assembly member, I have consistently voted against raising student fees. 
Given the current difficult economic times, our joint goal should be to make 
public education more accessible rather than more prohibitive! It is time for 
these academicians to leave the "ivory tower" and join the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 While the regents might deem merit pay increases necessary at this time to 
guarantee quality education, a decision to concurrently raise student fees and 
award pay increases is evidence of poor timing. I hope in the future the 
regents' goals and actions are more compatible with those of us in the 
Legislature who continue to make affordable higher education a priority.

 * In response to "Cal State Panel OKs 8.6% Raise for Presidents," Jan. 26: 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what specious and misleading arguments to the contrary are offered 
by Chancellor Barry Munitz and the California State University board of 
trustees, the fact remains that they are recommending exorbitant pay raises for 
CSU campus presidents (who already make over $100,000 per year) at a time when 
student fees are being raised for the fourth year in a row, when merit salary 
adjustments for our youngest and most promising faculty have not been fully 
restored, and when thousands of lecturers and staff have been laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 What the chancellor and the trustees fail to grasp is that in such difficult 
times the students, faculty and staff of the California State University 
deserve some measure of moral leadership. Instead, what we have is an 
unconscionable display of greed.

 * Re "North Launches Campaign for Senate Seat," Jan 28: 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver North, who admitted lying to members of Congress seven years ago, now 
wants to join their ranks "to take back government from the insiders and 
wheeler-dealers and put it back where it belongs -- in your hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you can't really say he invented wheeling and dealing, and working with 
insiders, but he certainly did his utmost to propagate the cause.Is this the 
pot calling the kettle black, or what? It will be interesting to watch to see 
just how gullible the voters of Virginia are this coming June.

 * The charismatic North is running for the U.S. Senate on a platform stressing 
integrity. The man who has been scrutinized by that body is now ready to face 
the media and to convince the citizens of Virginia that he is worthy to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Will we ask the right questions of him and will we get satisfactory answers? 
Will he tell us about the airlift he oversaw which smuggled cocaine from Costa 
Rica to the United States? Will he tell us the details about the Costa Rican 
government's declaring him persona non grata for narcotics trafficking? Will he 
finally justify taking such actions at the very time President Reagan and Vice 
President Bush were waging their "War on Drugs"? And will his rationale be 
consolation to the families, youth and crack babies so victimized by his 
actions? 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, look to you to seek out answers to questions such as these during 
the campaign!

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A LESS-THAN-PERFECT CONTRACT PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office is right to investigate last 
month's awarding of an $80-million telecommunications contract after questions 
were raised about the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October the county accepted a bid from the Harris Corp. but later 
retracted the contract and gave it to another company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors contracted with Harris for an emergency 
communications system for the Sheriff's Department and police departments in 
the county. However, the supervisors gave the firm one month to fulfill 
technical conditions, and when it did not do so to their satisfaction they 
switched the award to Motorola Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted an outcry from Harris Corp. Vice President Lewis Kling that the 
contract process was "flawed" from the start. That assertion is debatable, but 
it does appear there were irregularities in the bidding. Even if the district 
attorney decides there is no reason to prosecute anyone, the supervisors should 
aim for error-free bidding in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract is one of the biggest in county history. The supervisors wisely 
left the door open to revoke the award with Motorola if the district attorney's 
inquiry warrants such action. Last month's Northridge earthquake showed again 
the need for efficient communications in an emergency. The county must be sure 
it has the best system and that it chose its vendor properly.

OFF THE TICKER: MAXWELL TRIAL WON'T BE STAGED

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the cast of the new production "Maxwell -- The Musical Review," the show 
won't go on. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general won an injunction to prevent the show about the late 
media tycoon from opening Friday. He claims it may prejudice a fraud trial of 
Maxwell's two sons and four others. 
</P>
<P>
 The order prevents millionaire Evan Steadman from "promoting, producing and 
presenting the musical" until after the trial, the date of which is yet unset.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: WOMANLY ADVICE FOR ENTREPRENEURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For one lucky woman entrepreneur, a unique San Francisco mentoring program is 
like winning the Irish Sweepstakes. The worthy small-business owner is given 
thousands of dollars' worth of free legal, financial and public relations 
counsel for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Carey, an architect who specializes in restoring historic buildings, was 
the Adopt-a-Business program's 1992 winner. She was too busy working on new 
projects to be interviewed. Last year's winner, Beth Setrakian, founder of 
Beth's Fine Desserts in San Rafael, has tripled her sales, signed a $200,000 
contract with a major food chain and moved into a larger space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really happy we were adopted," said Setrakian, a pastry chef who 
founded her bakery in 1989. "It's like going to school and having these people 
as teachers. They are there when we call on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other mentoring programs that rely on veteran entrepreneurs to provide 
free advice to novices, the Adopt-a-Business program provides hands-on help 
that most struggling entrepreneurs couldn't afford. 
</P>
<P>
 The mentors, all women, represent the San Francisco law firm of Bronson, 
Bronson & McKinnon; Moss Adams, an accounting firm; Bank of California, and 
Torme & Co., a public relations firm. Before Setrakian's year ends in May, her 
advisers will have provided about $70,000 worth of free consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key people from each organization are women who have achieved a certain 
level of success in our lives and want to give something back to women business 
owners," said Michele Trausch, a partner at Bronson. "We feel a lot of 
satisfaction in seeing the women succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Trausch, a real estate attorney, helped Setrakian with lease agreements. Other 
members of the firm worked on labor issues and writing contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Setrakian's accounting mentors faced the greatest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people from Moss Adams came in and were overwhelmed by our lack of 
bookkeeping expertise," she said. "It took a CPA and her assistant weeks to 
crack the nut of our accounting mess."  
</P>
<P>
 Once the books were straightened out, Setrakian hired a part-time bookkeeper 
to keep things in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know where every penny is, which is a real switch," Setrakian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her newly organized bookkeeping system and soaring sales, Setrakian 
was still unable to qualify for a much-needed credit line. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bank of California provided free checking accounts and other services, 
it could not grant Setrakian the credit line she applied for. Although sales 
are approaching $600,000 this year, she doesn't have the solid balance sheet 
the bank requires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating," Setrakian said. "Even if they adopt you, you still have 
to show three years of profitability and collateral." 
</P>
<P>
 Because she and her husband don't own their home, they were unable to 
collateralize a loan. "I've been trying to rustle up someone to guarantee the 
loan, and I'm looking into factoring our receivables," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney Maehara, manager of Moss Adams' San Francisco office, said Setrakian's 
growing business is gobbling up all the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she wasn't growing as fast, her cash flow would look better to the bank," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maehara said Moss Adams' Portland office pioneered the Adopt-a-Business 
program about four years ago. Although that office is no longer participating 
in it, the firm's Santa Rosa office continues to help a lucky entrepreneur each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beth has so much charisma," Maehara said. "She has so much energy, you want 
her to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Setrakian has built her business around Beth's Babies -- butter-rich, 
quarter-size cookies. When she started her bakery, her specialty was pecan pie, 
but the ingredients were costly and the pies had a short shelf life. It was her 
sister, Gina, who suggested they make tiny cookies, which were an immediate hit 
in San Francisco's gourmet delicatessens and coffeehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth's Babies' big break came in 1989, when a buyer for I. Magnin helped 
design a package and put them into the stores for Christmas. Now the cookies, 
which are packed in cardboard tubes and canisters, are widely available. The 
labels feature angelic portraits of Setrakian's children, Nick and Sofi. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Setrakian worked as a pastry chef for tony restaurants and created 
wedding cakes for San Francisco's wealthiest families, she had a tough time 
convincing her college professor father that being a baker was a real 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father said it took us 200 years to get out of the kitchen and you want to 
get back into the kitchen?' " said Setrakian, who is an African American. 
"Unfortunately, he died before he could see (that) what I'm doing now requires 
a lot of business acumen." 
</P>
<P>
 (Bay Area women whose businesses are between 3 and 6 years old with sales of 
at least $250,000, can write to Bronson, Bronson & McKinnon for a 1994 
Adopt-a-Business application. The address is 505 Montgomery St., San Francisco, 
CA 94111) How to Find a Mentor 
</P>
<P>
 Women business owners can tap into several public and private mentoring 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Small Business Administration's program matches experienced 
entrepreneurs with new business owners. Contact your local SBA office and ask 
for information on the Women's Network for Entrepreneurial Training. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chicago's Women's Business Development Center offers a variety of counseling 
and training programs for women in business. For information call (312) 
853-3477. 
</P>
<P>
 * The National Assn. of Women Business Owners also helps women business owners 
find help. Contact the group in Silver Springs, Md., at (301) 608-2590.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: BUT WAIT, YOU ALSO GET 'SOUNDS OF SUMNER!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Paramount Communications takeover battle staggers down the home 
stretch, it's business as usual on Barry Diller's QVC Network -- with faux 
diamond rings, treadmills and radar detectors selling alongside Beatles 
memorabilia personally blessed by Cynthia Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
 All that's missing is Diller himself, whose Paramount gambit would probably 
benefit from a promotional push on his own airwaves. The technology revolution 
hasn't spawned any merger infomercials so far. But imagine if it did -- and the 
$10-billion Paramount prize came down to dueling TV pitches between Diller and 
his rival, Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone. 
</P>
<P>
 It could democratize the bidding process and create a whole new brand of 
infotainment. It would also be a natural byproduct of the Paramount deal, since 
Diller and Redstone both have access to their own networks. Redstone could 
theoretically simulcast his sales pitch on MTV, VH-1, Nickelodeon and Showtime. 
And the QVC format is ideally suited to Diller hawking Diller. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most celebrity guests, Diller could be introduced by one of QVC's regular 
hosts: 
</P>
<P>
 "So, Barr . . . uh, Mr. Diller. Welcome to QVC. Let's begin by telling our 
viewers a little bit about your career. Besides being my boss, you pioneered 
the movie of the week and the Fox network. You're also the former head of both 
Paramount Pictures and Fox Inc." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right, Biff. But that's not what I'm here for today. Today I want to 
talk about the chance of a lifetime for Paramount shareholders -- the chance to 
side with a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sounds good, sir. Tell us more." 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, Biff. As you may know, QVC's Paramount bid is backed by four of 
the leading companies in their fields -- BellSouth, Comcast, Cox and Advance 
Publications. When you're talking us, you're talking quality and concrete 
value. But that's not all. You're also talking prizes. Along with an attractive 
package of cash and securities, anyone tendering their shares on this show will 
get one of these special, limited-edition Marty Davis dartboards." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my, Mr. Diller. That's a stunning likeness. The dartboard alone must 
retail for $25." 
</P>
<P>
 "Easily. But you can't buy it in stores, Biff. It's only available to QVC 
shoppers, and then only to those tendering their shares to us today." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a mighty generous deal, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 "And there's more, Biff. The first dozen or so people who call in each get to 
personally fire an existing Paramount board member -- post-merger, of course." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm speechless, sir. And I'm sure our viewers are too. But their hands must 
be working, because I hear those phones ringing. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount shares would surely climb as tension mounted over Redstone's 
rebuttal, renewing interest in a deal that's suffering from a real fatigue 
factor after five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone would appear on MTV Jams with Bill Bellamy roughly an hour later as 
part of a campaign to enliven his image. In a history-making event simulcast 
over Nickelodeon, VH-1 and Showtime, a confused-looking Bellamy would introduce 
Redstone as the show came out of a commercial break for Clearasil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yo, ya'll," he'd improvise. "We've got a special surprise guest in the house. 
You may not recognize the face, but this is The Man -- the master of MTV, the 
viceroy of video. Give it up for Mr. Sumner Redstone! 
</P>
<P>
 "Yo, Sumner." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yo, uh, Bill." 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to MTV Jams. That's a down ascot." 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, no, it's silk. But thanks just the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "No sweat. I hear you got a message for the people." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's correct." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then tell it, Sumner." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Bill, I obviously feel that Viacom's offer for Paramount Communications 
is financially superior and that our companies would make a better match. But 
I've gone one step further than that. Since multibillion-dollar mergers 
facilitated by stock transactions and impacted by the vagaries of the market 
are so complicated, my good friend H. Wayne Huizenga of Blockbuster 
Entertainment and I have prepared a special song that explains why we think 
shareholders should back our bid. I'd like to sing it for you now. Gimme a 
beat, H. Wayne! 
</P>
<P>
 "My name is Sumner, and it ain't no jive;  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to sell ya on the best deal alive.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's big, it's bad, it'll make you quake --  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm talkin' 'bout Paramount, and I want my stake.  
</P>
<P>
 "With Beavis and Butt-head and videos too,  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a deal for me, it's a catch for you.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a deal with muscle, it's a plan with flare --  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only offer with Unplugged in there.  
</P>
<P>
 "So get your homie and his best friend Tom  
</P>
<P>
 "And pledge your shares to Viacom."  
</P>
<P>
 As the curtain fell on Redstone, the phone lines between arbs and their 
sources would be burning up. Diller would get points for salesmanship. Redstone 
would win for originality. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount board might even call it a draw, advising shareholders to vote 
their consciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon all takeover battles would be waged on television -- thus fulfilling the 
prophesies of those promoting the information superhighway. And Redstone might 
get a record deal.

THE WEEK AHEAD: TOKYO; HOSOKAWA TO SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa heads to Washington for a Friday summit 
meeting focused on U.S.-Japanese trade issues, particularly proposed steps to 
further open Japan's markets to foreign goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 American and Japanese negotiators are trying to reach a set of trade 
agreements in four priority areas before the summit: automobiles and auto 
parts, insurance, telecommunications and medical equipment. Talks have been 
virtually deadlocked by disagreement on whether to include numerical goals to 
measure progress in expanding market access. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say difficult negotiations are likely to continue up to the 
last possible moment but add that there is a possibility of success.

NEXT STEP; TINY VILLAGE GREETS GAMES WITH NORWEGIAN RESERVE; * LILLEHAMMER FOLK 
TRY TO CARRY ON NORMALLY WHILE AWAITING THE ONSLAUGHT OF 100,000 OLYMPIC FANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan epic may be the hot pre-Olympic story in the 
United States, but here it draws a cluck, a shake of the head, occasionally a 
blank stare. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in this vest-pocket city of the XVII Olympic Winter Games, the folks 
have other fish to fry. And bake. And poach. And simmer in sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an extraordinary time in this otherwise ordinary Norwegian community, 
these last few days before it all comes down, and almost everybody is trying to 
carry on in a reasonably ordinary fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a little difficult, though, when you don't know what to expect. And no 
matter how exuberantly the politicians and Olympic types spout the 
successful-Games line, Sven Citizen isn't quite sure just what will happen, or 
how he feels about it all. 
</P>
<P>
 There is pride, of course, that of all the cities in all the world, this city 
will have the Winter Olympics. But there is a little Norwegian reserve working 
here too -- and maybe even the niggling suspicion that maybe, just maybe, this 
little city might have taken too big a bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who are old enough remember another little city with big ambitions -- 
Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1980 -- and the fiasco it pulled down over its ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Winter Games will forever be remembered for the U.S. hockey team's 
"Miracle on Ice" and Eric Heiden's five gold medals in speedskating while 
thousands of ticketed fans -- of hockey, speedskating and other events -- sat 
marooned in outlying parking lots, unable to get where they wanted to be 
because of a colossal transportation snafu. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Placid's plan was to close the city to vehicular traffic, direct the 
car-borne fans to those outlying lots and take them by bus to the various 
venues. It probably would have worked, if someone had ordered the buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lillehammer's plan is to close the Olympic region to vehicular traffic, direct 
the car-borne fans to outlying parking lots and take them by bus to the various 
venues. But the folks in the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee say they 
have ordered the buses and have been stressing for years that public 
transportation, not private cars, is the right way to these Games. Extra train 
services to Lillehammer have been set up, especially from Oslo, where up to six 
trains an hour are scheduled to depart each day of the Olympics. So, nobody is 
really expecting another Lake Placid. But . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "This is normally a town for 23,000 people," said Oyvind Kvernen, a clerk in 
the Sport and Fritid sports shop. "I think the transportation will work, but 
each day (there) will be 100,000 people here. Each day! That's too many people 
all at once. That's too tough for the city. Transporting all those people. . . 
. I hope it will work." 
</P>
<P>
 As long as they're coming, though, Sport and Fritid wants some of what they're 
bringing with them and is holding up its end of the Olympic souvenir market. 
There are gloves, pass holders, fanny packs and T-shirts, all bearing the 
Lillehammer '94 emblem -- the northern lights, snow flurries, the Olympic rings 
and "Lillehammer '94" -- right in there with the ski jackets, parkas, 
cross-country equipment and Lakers, San Francisco 49ers and Boston Celtics 
caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Kvernen reported that business has been better than usual, with the real 
bonanza still several days away. "That's when the wealthy tourists will come," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there will be no gouging, he added: "If we don't take the prices up, then 
the tourists will return. Otherwise, the people will say Norway is very 
expensive and not come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Foto Olsen, where they are putting in a "pro shop" in anticipation of 
a run on rental photographic equipment, Lars Erik Skraefsrud shared some of 
Kvernen's concern. 
</P>

 "It's going to be hectic," he said. "It will be fun while it lasts and most 
people are pretty excited, but I think some will be relieved when it's over. I 
think the transportation will work, but I don't know what 100,000 people will 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did Lisbeth Berntsen in G.C. Lunde's bakery, where the windows are 
decorated on one side with gingerbread Olympic scenes and frosted gingerbread 
evergreens, and on the other with three decorated cakes, two in honor of 
Lillehammer '94 and one recalling the '52 Oslo Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if there's a place for everybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, said Eva Snilsberg of the Lillehammer Turist Kontor. Everything 
is going to work out just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of people and lots going on," she said. "And most are already impressed 
with Lillehammer. The sun is shining and it's lovely here when the sun is 
shining. That makes all the difference in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 And just down the block, Harald Belsvik has auctioned off T-shirt No. 993, the 
one proclaiming seven more days till the Games begin, for 6,800 Norwegian 
kroner. He started at 1,000 days till the Games and has been auctioning a shirt 
a day for more than three years on Storgata, a pedestrian shopping mall, 
turning the proceeds over to the Lillehammer organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many shirts are left, not many days are left before Saturday's opening 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working on this for several years, so I'm happy it's coming," 
Belsvik said. "But in a way, I'll be happy to see it end, because the town will 
be back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Not an unpopular sentiment in this little Olympic city. BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Lillehammer, 110 miles north of Oslo, is in the Troll Park Area, a region 
popular for Alpine and cross-country skiing and named for the mischievous 
dwarfs of local legend. Tiny Lillehammer's most famous native, by some 
accounts, is Thor Bjorkland, inventor of the cheese slicer. With a population 
of 23,000, it is the smallest city to host the Winter Olympics since Lake 
Placid, N.Y., in 1980.

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; STOCKS SIZZLE IN S.E. ASIA; * MARKET FEVER INFECTS THE NEW 
MIDDLE CLASS, DRIVING SOME REGIONAL MARKETS UP 100% OR MORE IN A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jariporn Kiatsamphan, a 44-year-old Thai housewife, scanned the flashing 
electronic board in front of her with a look that turned instantly from 
hard-edged suspicion to undisguised joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made a lot of money," she acknowledged frankly, "but I want to make more 
profit. There are lots of opportunities to get rich here." 
</P>
<P>
 Around her in the trading room of Kiatnakin Finance and Securities, a Bangkok 
brokerage company, housewives wearing diamond earrings shared cups of morning 
coffee while men in open-necked shirts murmured into portable telephones. Every 
time the numbers changed on the immense stock-price board, the conversation 
paused perceptibly before resuming. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, a lavender Jaguar with red license tags -- a sign the car was only a 
few days old -- pulled to the curb with four more investors for Thailand's 
booming stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock market investing has become the hottest craze in Southeast Asia in the 
past 18 months, taking millions of newly enriched, middle-class Asians on a 
breathtaking roller-coaster ride with their life savings. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, many investors have made huge profits -- on paper, at least. Despite a 
sharp correction at the beginning of the year, which caused market slumps 
throughout the region, billions of dollars continue to flood into the stock 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is clear: In 1993, Southeast Asian markets were among the hottest 
in the world. The Philippines market index shot up 154%, Hong Kong rose 116%, 
Malaysia 98%, Thailand 88% (27% in the last two months of the year), and even 
conservative Singapore's market bolted up 59%. 
</P>
<P>
 The bull run was helped along by billions of dollars flooding in from 
international mutual funds based in the United States, as American savers 
continued to switch out of money market funds into higher yielding stock funds. 
But in most of Southeast Asia's markets, local investors, known as retail 
accounts to stockbrokers, accounted for the majority of share purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a trickle-down effect of the wealth in the region," said Simon Woods, 
general manager of the stock research firm Pesaka Jardine Fleming in Kuala 
Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. "Maybe gushing down would be more accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts agree that the economic strength of the region, with annual 
growth figures at 8% or 9%, made regional stocks good bets for an increase in 
value. In recent months, however, market fundamentals have given way to rank 
speculation as market indexes have soared through the roof. There is reason to 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a casino market," said Tuangrat Kirtiputra, director of Thai Securities 
Co. Ltd., one of Thailand's largest retail stock brokerage houses. "People 
realize they shouldn't keep their money in the market. But those returns are 
so-o-o tempting." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this: Suwimon Chotwattanapun, another Thai housewife who took up 
investing to pass the time now that her children are in school, watched her 
investment in Shinawatra Satellite, a satellite telecommunications firm, zoom 
from $1.56 a share at the market opening on a day last month to $7.48 at the 
close of trading seven hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 "You watch the screen and you make money," she said with a smile. "If I worked 
for an entire month, I couldn't make the kind of money I am making here." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of these kinds of returns and this kind of enthusiasm, markets in 
the region have catapulted from being sleepy backwater exchanges a few years 
ago to internationally watched markets that rival the world's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, the world recognizes that the major economies are concentrated in East 
Asia, including Southeast Asia," Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad 
boasted last November. "Such has been Malaysia's achievements that the volume 
of shares transacted on the Kuala Lumpur Stock exchange has surpassed business 
done on the New York and Tokyo markets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One recent day in Malaysia, a developing country with only 18 million people, 
market turnover was 380 million shares. On the same day, turnover on the New 
York Stock Exchange, the world's largest, was 300 million shares. Market 
turnover in Bangkok now reaches $1.6 billion a day, more than the value in Hong 
Kong and Singapore combined. 
</P>
<P>
 One dramatic example of stock fever saw thousands of motorists bring traffic 
to a standstill in central Kuala Lumpur in the rush to buy shares in Malaysia's 
soon to be privatized oil and gas company, Petronas Dagangan. "In future they 
should receive the forms in a more open space, like Merdeka Stadium," growled 
Kuala Lumpur's police chief, Mohamad Jeran Jani. 
</P>
<P>
 In Singapore, where the government plays the dominant role in many walks of 
daily life, stock market investing caught on only last year when officials 
decided to privatize the state-owned phone company, Singapore Telecoms. 
</P>
<P>
 To sell shares, the government launched what it called "Invest Singapore," a 
slick public relations campaign about the benefits of share ownership. "The 
more assets each one of us has, the more we will work to enhance their value," 
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong told the nation in a speech laced with Singapore's 
save-and-be-thrifty philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, the government allowed workers to shift some funds in their 
social security saving accounts from low interest money market rates to stocks. 
To further encourage novice investors, it subsidized the price of 350 million 
shares of Singapore Telecoms for local investors, offering them at little more 
than half the eventual market price. Investors could even buy stocks at bank 
automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some $2.1 billion poured into the stock market from social 
security accounts in the last three months of 1993. The number of investors in 
the country went from 200,000 to 1.48 million, half the population, in a single 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hong Kong, the only factor keeping more people from piling into the market 
was real estate values, which soared in tandem. While investors on the stock 
market doubled their money in 1993, investors in luxury real estate doubled the 
purchase price, which was often funded by a 90% mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this has come to the region without causing some well-founded 
concerns. "The market volatility these days is a bit scary," said Eugene K.K. 
Law, director of research at Standard Chartered Securities in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 While Asian officials remain bullish about their stock markets in the long 
run, there have been increasing worries about the recent effect of rampant 
speculation on the markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore's finance minister, Richard Hu, warned last month that investors 
should be cautious about jumping in to booming markets. "Investors should not 
treat the stock market as casinos, buying and selling on rumors and hoping to 
make a quick profit," Hu warned. "Investors must recognize that the higher 
potential return from stocks and shares reflect the greater risks involved, and 
should therefore be prepared to risk losses when markets turn down." 
</P>
<P>
 In Malaysia, similar warnings from the prime minister and finance minister in 
December went unheeded and the market climbed to dizzying heights. Finally, 
last month a former finance minister, Daim Zainuddin, who was rumored to be a 
heavy market player himself, was quoted as urging investors to sell. As one 
tabloid put it in a banner headline, "Daim: Get Out Now, Don't Say We Didn't 
Tell You." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The result was panic selling that saw the market index collapse nearly 30% in 
a couple of days. Billions of dollars were lost and the press stationed 
photographers at the emergency rooms of hospitals in a grisly vigil for 
possible suicide victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are sitting on paper losses and a fair proportion are sitting 
on actual losses because of they were buying on margin," said Wood, the Pesaka 
Jardine Fleming official. Margin buying means investors borrow money against 
stock to buy more stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, markets from Singapore to Hong Kong and Thailand also declined 
sharply at the same time as Malaysia, though there was no regional news or 
event to explain it. As one analyst in Hong Kong put it, the markets were a 
correction waiting to happen and seized upon even the slimmest news to begin 
selling. 
</P>
<P>
 One factor which makes the Asian exchanges far more volatile than those in the 
United States or Europe is so-called "contra" trade, which amounts to little 
more than gambling. Taking advantage of a rule which allows investors up to a 
week to pay for stock once they have purchased it, many investors now never 
actually invest but merely buy and sell within the settlement period. 
</P>
<P>
 Ang Kok Heng, head of research for the big Malaysian retail broker TA 
Securities, said 60% of the market was in shares held less than a week. Further 
leveraging the market, he said, was the fact that the majority of investors had 
borrowed 50% of the money they invested. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets dangerous when you combine leverage with the everybody's gaming 
instinct," said Pauline Almeida, research director for Phileo Peregrine 
Securities in Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial historians point out that extensive use of margin trading was 
largely responsible for the 1929 stock market crash and some have wondered 
whether history may be repeating itself in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cause for concern in the region is the lack of strict regulation by 
financial authorities. Insider trading is so rampant in most countries that 
there is not much outsider trading. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter asked one Thai housewife where she got her stock tips, she 
proudly admitted her husband had provided her with advance word on several 
major developments at his company, a well-traded stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you have to do is track share performance before major announcements to 
see how pervasive insider trading is," said Korn Chatikavanij, managing 
director of Jardine Fleming Thanakom Securities in Bangkok. "There's a lot of 
social pressure to give friends information." 
</P>
<P>
 In Malaysia, Union Paper, a toilet paper manufacturer, soared from $2 a share 
to $20 on rumors of a takeover that never took place. A plantation company 
called Lingui rocketed from 70 cents to $17 in a few weeks on acquisition 
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the small regional markets are much more susceptible to 
manipulation than are the bigger markets of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 A famed Thai investor, Song Watcharasriroj, was arrested briefly last year 
after it was disclosed that he had driven up the price of a company called KMC 
nearly 600% by trading millions of shares to himself at ever-increasing prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The government in Kuala Lumpur was forced to publicly deny that it was 
manipulating the market following a spate of rumors that the ruling party, 
which controls a number of companies, was hoping for a surge in stock prices to 
help pay for a local election campaign later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are rumor-driven markets with a one-day time horizon," said an American 
broker who asked not to be identified. "If they lose, they go home and cry and 
if they win they go out and buy a Mercedes." Thailand Stock Market

THE WEEK AHEAD: RIO DE JANEIRO; ECONOMIC SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The final battle in the war of political nerves over Brazil's economy is 
slated to begin this week when the legislature gathers to decide the fate of 
the government's embattled stabilization plan.Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso says that righting the economy, racked by monthly inflation 
mounting 40%, hinges on approval of a sweeping reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cardoso has run into fierce resistance from legislators on the right, who 
believe the reform is too timid, and on the left, who want to block a 
constitutional reform. "We stagger from impasse to impasse," Cardoso told 
reporters last week after Congress declined to approve the plan's centerpiece, 
an emergency fund for the poorest Brazilians.

THE WEEK AHEAD: MECCA; MUSLIM HOLY MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across the Muslim world, the holy month of Ramadan begins this week with the 
appearance of the new moon.In Mecca, the month of fasting and prayer will begin 
Thursday. During the lunar month, Muslims are expected to abstain from food, 
drink, tobacco and sex during the daylight hours. At nightfall, at least in 
less observant countries, the faithful jam restaurants and their family dining 
tables for Iftar, the meal that ends the day of fasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramadan marks the revelation of the first verses of the Koran to the Prophet 
Mohammed. It is meant to be a period of piety, sacrifice and charity toward the 
poor. In conservative societies such as Saudi Arabia the demands are met.

THE WEEK AHEAD: LILLEHAMMER; LET THE GAMES BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Winter Olympic Games begin Saturday in this Norwegian sports resort. The 
Lillehammer Games start a new sequence in the Olympic schedule.Previously both 
the Winter and Summer Olympics were held in the same year. The last Winter 
Games took place in 1992 at Albertville, France, and the 1994 resumption begins 
a cycle in which each even-numbered year will see either a winter or summer 
festival. The 1996 Summer Games will take place in Atlanta, and Calgary will 
host the 1998 Winter festival. 
</P>
<P>
 These Games have been marked by controversy even before the opening ceremony, 
notably the drama involving the American women figure skaters.  
</P>
<P>
 But as the XVIIth Games approach, Lillehammer appeared to be taking a 
fun-filled approach to the festival, anticipating the arrival of 100,000 
tourists a day with bulging wallets.

AMERICA FROM ABROAD; U.S. SOLDIERS MUSTERING CONTROVERSY; * COLOMBIAN 
PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF THE HUMANITARIAN MISSION RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT HIS 
LEADERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American soldiers have come to Colombia before. 
</P>
<P>
 They helped install the radar directed at planes used by narcotics 
traffickers. They lent a hand in supplying bases along this country's remote 
jungle rivers and built the first airstrips on the Colombian island of San 
Andres. 
</P>
<P>
 So it caught officials off-guard when the arrival early this year of about 150 
U.S. Army engineers and Navy Seabees on an ostensibly humanitarian mission 
triggered a storm of protest and, ultimately, a frenzy of anti-American 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 President Cesar Gaviria has been called before Colombia's highest 
administrative body to explain why he allowed the troops to enter national 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Editorials in newspapers are filled with debate over the American presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Several American symbols, including a Coca-Cola plant and two Mormon churches, 
were attacked with dynamite last month, and graffiti demanding "Yankees -- Get 
Out!" has popped up on buildings in the capital of Bogota and here in Cali, a 
major city near the engineers' base. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is the proximity to Cali, home of the organization that dominates the 
world cocaine trade, that made many Colombians wonder about the true motives of 
the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Colombians are sure that the arrival was timed as a show of force just as 
the Colombian government entered into negotiations with Cali cartel leaders 
over their possible surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Colombian and U.S. spokesmen deny such motives, and Gaviria suggested 
that the traffickers themselves are responsible for the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the troops are stationed at the Pacific seaport of Juanchaco, on 
Malaga Bay, as part of a two-month mission to build a clinic, a school and 
about seven miles of highway. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no evidence that the soldiers are doing anything more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 But the clumsy handling of the matter by Colombian and U.S. officials aroused 
suspicions, fed the controversy and raised questions about Gaviria's ability to 
defuse a potentially explosive crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "A wasteful, exhausting polemic would have been avoided with a more 
transparent and less careless handling of the case," wrote Enrique Santos 
Calderon, a columnist for the leading daily El Tiempo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ambiguous presentation and somewhat giddy handling of this matter by the 
government fueled the most overwrought conjectures. . . . It is as if Gaviria 
(with barely eight months left in office) were releasing the reins of 
government prematurely, which is not at all advisable in a country so explosive 
and unpredictable as ours." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy began in mid-December, when the U.S. Embassy first announced 
the impending arrival of the American soldiers, who press reports say are 
primarily members of the U.S. Corps of Engineers and U.S. Navy Seabees. 
</P>
<P>
 That the announcement should come from the embassy, and not the Colombian 
government, posed something of an affront to a Colombian public highly 
sensitive to American influence here. 
</P>
<P>
 Further raising suspicions, the announcement came just days after U.S. 
Ambassador Morris Busby congratulated the Colombian government for tracking 
down and killing drug baron Pablo Escobar on Dec. 2 -- and also urging 
authorities to go after the Cali traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pablo Escobar's death and the dismantling of the Medellin cartel is a big 
success for Colombia," Busby told a news conference. "But now they should 
continue with the Cali cartel." 
</P>
<P>
 The subsequent arrival of the engineers and Seabees took on an enhanced 
symbolism, prompting some local newspapers to label it a "Gringo Invasion." 
</P>
<P>
 The troops were frequently referred to, incorrectly, as Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 Contradictory and confusing statements from Gaviria and from the Colombian 
Defense Ministry fanned the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 The tons of equipment seen unloaded at Malaga Bay appeared disproportionate to 
the limited task of erecting a small school and clinic. (Only later was it 
explained that a highway was also being paved.) Authorities restricted 
journalists' access to the area, creating another shroud of suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Gaviria, responding to reporters' questions, said the residents 
of Juanchaco should monitor the American troops to make sure they stuck to 
their humanitarian mission and did not conduct military operations. The 
statement left many wondering how 2,000 peasants and fishermen who live in the 
small port were supposed to control the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
 As rumors and speculation filled the pages of Colombian newspapers and the 
airwaves of Colombian radio stations, the government was finally forced to 
clarify that the U.S. mission came under the auspices of a 40-year-old treaty 
and had been authorized long before Escobar was killed and the drug-war focus 
shifted to Cali. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government's attempts at damage control came only after the damage was 
done and did little to quiet the passions of nationalism stirred in a 
mistrustful population. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll conducted by the newspaper El Espectador showed that 66% of those 
responding regarded the American military presence as "damaging" or "very 
damaging." 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic sources privately blame a spate of anti-American attacks on the 
controversy: The kidnaping last month of two American missionaries by left-wing 
guerrillas was attributed to the arrival of the troops; Mormon churches in 
Medellin and Bucaramanga were bombed and U.S. flags were reportedly burned. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mormon Church in Medellin, gunmen entered the building and asked if any 
foreigners were present before setting off 30 pounds of dynamite, the 
diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is also an election year in Colombia. Citizens will choose members of 
Congress in March and a new president in May. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Violent, acrimonious campaigns are already under way, and it came as no 
surprise that the U.S. troops would be an electoral issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition members of the Senate are calling for an investigation, and 
opposition presidential candidates are trying to drum up concerns over national 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the gringos when they come as tourists, in Bermuda shorts with dollars 
in their pockets," Antonio Navarro Wolff, a former leftist guerrilla now 
running for president, said during a campaign swing. "But we do not want 
soldiers in our territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Added leftist Sen. Bernardo Gutierrez: "Our people remember very closely the 
experience of Panama." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaviria blamed the controversy on the Cali drug traffickers, whom he accused 
of orchestrating a disinformation campaign against the troops. The narcos, or 
traffickers, he said, were using politicians to manipulate public opinion and 
blow the U.S. mission out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, political analysts in Colombia say Gaviria, who has launched a personal 
quest to become the next secretary general of the Organization of American 
States, must share the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gaviria campaigned for the post, these sources argue, he allowed issues 
such as the troop deployment to snowball. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Gaviria can say public opinion was manipulated, but there were 
sectors of the population who simply wanted to understand what was going on, 
which is totally logical and justifiable," said Juan Gabriel Tokatlian, head of 
the International Studies Center at the University of the Andes in Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has gone from being a president who explains his decisions to one who 
informs on his decisions. He believes what he is doing is fine, and does not 
like criticisms. His handling of this was awful."

CULTURE; MP NOVELISTS HAVE 'COMMON' TOUCH; * BRITISH LAWMAKERS HAVE A LONG 
TRADITION AS NOVELISTS, AND THE CURRENT RECIPE RUNS HEAVY ON SPICE. 'A 
PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIR' HAS EVERYBODY TALKING -- AND READING. 
</P>

<P>
 Unlike their American counterparts, British political figures from Victorian 
Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli to contemporary members of Parliament have 
moonlighted as novelists. 
</P>
<P>
 But where Disraeli wrote genteel political comedies, modern lawmakers have 
veered toward political thrillers, and, more recently, to what the press calls 
"bonkbusters," books with plenty of sex. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, MPs who have written popular, bodice-ripping novels include 
Jeffrey Archer ("First Among Equals"), Rupert Allason ("Murder in the 
Commons"), Julian Critchley ("Hung Parliament"), Brian Sedgemore ("Power 
Failure"), Michael Spicer ("The Cotswold Murders"), Stuart Bell ("Paris 69"), 
Lord Rawlinson ("The Jesuit Factor") and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd ("The 
Palace of Enchantments"). 
</P>
<P>
 Joining their ranks this month is the energetic, publicity-keen legislator for 
Derbyshire, Edwina Currie, whose "A Parliamentary Affair" is the talk of the 
Palace of Westminster, home of the House of Commons and Lords. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the book, with its reported $150,000 advance, is opened, Currie 
hints of its contents with an official stamp on the cover: The parliamentary 
seal is affixed to the stocking seams of a shapely lady in stiletto heels. This 
gimmick has earned Currie a reprimand from Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd. 
</P>
<P>
 The slinky stockings give a hint of the sex scenes inside, and as Currie says: 
"The reason the cover works is that she's so threatening. Here's this stunning, 
confident woman walking into -- God help us -- the House of Commons, and taking 
her sexuality with her. She'll wreck the place!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of the book, a Cabinet minister gets involved with a young male 
prostitute; the environment minister is having an affair with the heroine, a 
back-bench, or less prominent, member, and the parliamentary secretary is 
bedding a female journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster insiders are speculating on possible identities of the characters 
in this presumed roman a clef since the female Parliament member, Elaine 
Stalker, in many ways is a dead ringer for the author: bright, ambitious, 
pushy, abrasive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the incestuous style of London literary circles, Parliament member Julian 
Critchley, whose own novel, "Hung Parliament," was called "salacious" by fellow 
member Enoch Powell, reviewed Currie's book. He found it "tedious." 
</P>
<P>
 "I took against it," he writes, "not so much for its explicit and all too 
frequent sex, not because I am prudish, but because it is entirely without 
humor. Sadly, I cannot remember who said that sex was God's joke upon the 
world. Edwina, please note." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Critchley, like many Tories, is not a great fan of the 
high-profile Currie. A working title for his new parliamentary thriller is 
reputedly: "Who Killed Edwina Currie?" because there would be no shortage of 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 American television audiences are familiar with sexually tamer machinations in 
Parliament and the government ministries in Whitehall through imported British 
series such as "Yes, Prime Minister," a comic portrayal of a British leader. A 
sinister depiction of the office came in "House of Cards," in which the prime 
minister resorts to murder to serve his political purposes. A sequel called "To 
Play the King" is currently on American TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Disraeli's prose was properly Victorian. A sample, from "Henrietta 
Temple"(1837): "They sprang into each other's arms. Ah, that was a moment of 
rapture, sweet, thrilling rapid! There was no need of words, their souls 
vaulted over all petty explanations; upon her lips, her choice and trembling 
lips, he sealed his gratitude and devotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Secretary Hurd raised the temperature, but not too much, in "The 
Palace of Enchantments" in 1985, an account of Parliament written with Stephen 
Lamport: "He began to fumble awkwardly at her clothes pulling a button off her 
shirt as he did so. His mouth searched her neck and a smooth white shoulder. . 
. . His body was excited now, and he broke away to undress." 
</P>
<P>
 But Currie has moved quickly into the bonkbusting major league: "Her head was 
spinning with the wine, but with more than that, with a heady delight in her 
own unexplored sexuality and her power to turn this daft bloke on. She leaned 
back invitingly, as in all the magazine photos. He took a deep breath and began 
kissing her breasts. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 In Currie's book, as in Archer's and others, one does learn from insiders the 
workings of the House of Commons and its murky world. As Currie puts it: "Very 
little in the novel is completely out of line. It is intended to have a 
strongly authentic feel." 
</P>
<P>
 A prominent Labor member of Parliament, Gerald Kaufman, says most 
parliamentary fiction, including Currie's book, is "on the whole unutterable 
trash." Yet he admits that her complaints against the barriers encountered by 
women in Parliament are "entirely justified." 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Palace of Enchantments," novelist Hurd writes: "At the moment of 
climax Sally sighed a great sigh, as if the ills of the world were cured." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Secretary Hurd, faced with the intractable problems of Bosnia and 
Northern Ireland, should be so lucky.

MEDIA; THE MAN BEHIND 'MONICA'; * BRAZIL'S MAURICIO DE SOUSA IS THE JET-SETTING 
CEO OF A CARTOON EMPIRE BUILT UPON A BUCKTOOTHED LITTLE GIRL. HE OVERSEES 200 
ARTISTS, A SIX-STORY OFFICE AND MUCH MORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAC MARGOLIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brazilian cartoonist Mauricio de Sousa first got into print in the late 
1950s as a cub reporter on the crime beat for the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. 
Budgets and staff were lean back then, so Sousa often ended up illustrating his 
own stories when a photographer was not on hand. Then, after nagging for five 
years, he persuaded the paper to print his first cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The protagonist was Monica, a pint-sized, bucktoothed girl with a closely 
cropped coiffure, a hot temper and a stuffed rabbit she dragged around by the 
ears. Monica caught on, and in time, Sousa was drawing a weekly episode of the 
adventures of Monica and a gang of tykes for dozens of papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Sousa no longer chases cops and ambulances. He has swapped the newsroom 
and a cramped atelier at home for a six-story office building in Sao Paulo. His 
comic muse -- he originally modeled Monica after his 2-year-old daughter -- is 
now a mom. His cast has now grown to over 200, from a straw-hatted hillbilly to 
an affable brontosaurus, and his bank account into the millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Monica reigns as the queen of comics in Brazil, vastly outranking the 
classics by Disney and Marvel. The entire Monica's gang collection of 11 comic 
books sells 2 million copies a month, making Mauricio de Sousa Productions 
(MSP) Brazil's, and probably Latin America's, largest funny business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes at night, Sousa still finds time and energy to draw, but like 
Disney, he has become the CEO of a comics corporation. By day he oversees a 
stable of 200 artists, shepherds contracts, negotiates with corporate sponsors, 
and jets to meetings at venues all over the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Headquarters is a renovated glass and concrete warehouse planted imposingly on 
the industrial outskirts of the city. On one floor, designers hunch over page 
proofs to meet deadlines for the next editions. On another, hostesses tend a 
great playroom, filled with games and rides and great plastic and Styrofoam 
replicas of Monica's gang, where children come to romp each day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last decade, MSP's business has burgeoned far beyond the comic page. To 
his editorial oeuvre Sousa has added eight feature-length cartoon films and a 
theme park for kids, the Parque da Monica, based in a Sao Paulo shopping mall. 
He has also gone a corporate giant step further, pressing his cast of tots into 
the service of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers know the value of stamping Monica's visage on their cookies, 
knapsacks, fruit juice bottles, and schoolbooks. Trolling the supermarket 
aisles, kids home in on the comic images. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the Brazilian domestic wares manufacturer Kenko Industrias and 
Comercio drafted Monica and her gang to boost a new line of disposable diapers. 
At the time Johnson & Johnson controlled 70% of the diaper market. "We knew we 
needed a strong image to compete," said Ling Wang, Kenko product manager. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, J&J's share had plunged to 21.8%, thanks in part to an 
influx of cheap imports from Argentina, but also to Monica. Kenko's market 
share rose from 10% to 19.3%. "We offered a quality product, but I'd say at 
least half of our success was because of Monica's gang," said Wang. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 60% of MSP's $250 million in yearly revenue is reaped from royalties 
from about 3,500 products made by companies such as Nestle, Procter & Gamble, 
and Bauducco. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Monica so enticing? Sousa leaned back in his swivel chair to field 
the question. "Monica's world is peopled by kids who could be your brother, 
sister or friend," he offered. Like the leading lady, Sousa's entire cast is 
based on real kids whose traits are at once local -- such as straw-hatted 
country bumpkin Chico Bento -- and universal -- like Cascao, who is terrified 
of taking a bath. 
</P>
<P>
 Sousa paused, then shrugged and finally surrendered with a toothy grin. 
Clearly, never growing up is part of his secret. He spoke in an office where 
every free surface was littered with different sized dolls of Monica and her 
gang, flanked by armies of stuffed rabbits, toy cars and rubber alligators. 
</P>
<P>
 Sousa's rise to the pinnacle of Brazil's comic world was not all belly laughs. 
In 1964, a right-wing military coup rocked Brazil, and the hard-liners saw 
conspirators behind every palm tree. Sousa, then head of the cartoonists union, 
was branded a Communist for his campaign in favor of copyright laws, and he was 
promptly blacklisted by the country's leading publishers. (Ironically, he was 
also snubbed by the left for refusing to turn his palette against the regime.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Sousa did not cave in. Working at home, he hand-sketched the comic strip 
figures, then carved them onto linoleum blocks, put the molds in a salesman's 
valise and got on a bus. "I figured out how much money I had and mapped out all 
the small town newspapers within a 50-kilometer radius," Sousa said. 
Eventually, he had 200 newspapers on his string. 
</P>
<P>
 Sousa's comics are today Brazil's best-selling children's magazines, and the 
leading title, "Revista da Monica," ranks a remarkable third place for all 
magazines sold nationwide. All 11 Monica's gang comics routinely outsell 
classics like Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And in Brazil, where 21% of adults are illiterate, and perhaps as many more 
can barely struggle through a newspaper, comics aren't just for kids. One 
survey found that a startling 56% of Monica's regular readers are adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Success in Brazil has also propelled Monica abroad. By the mid-1980s, Sousa's 
comics were translated into nine languages and exported to 17 countries, from 
Greece to Denmark. Children everywhere seemed delighted, but Sousa found the 
adults a harder sell. In patriarchal Japan, for instance, dads didn't take 
kindly to the pushy little girl who ordered bad boys around. In America, 
editors frowned upon Monica's dog, Bidu, peeing on lampposts. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1990s, however, the entertainment market was changing radically. 
Cartoon shows, videos, electronic toys and video games had seized the youngest 
imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today child entertainment is based on a tripod of cartoons, comics, and toys. 
If you don't have all three, you can forget it," he said. So Sousa recalled his 
international comics from all but four countries. He also scrapped feature 
films, which proved too drawn out for children's perishable attention span. 
</P>
<P>
 After this strategic retreat to get his marketing tripod in order, he is now 
crossing the borders again. He calls this new assault "Project Hispanidad," and 
the weapon is a weekly, 30-minute Sesame Street-styled variety show featuring 
Monica's gang's cartoons, puppets, computer graphics and cameos by live 
Argentine artists. The program will be recorded in Spanish and debut in 
Argentina in April. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recently a Belgian company came to Sousa with an offer to invest $10 million 
to produce a similar variety and educational TV show to be aired throughout 
Europe, possibly by the end of the year, Sousa said. He is serving up these 
shows as a kind of hors d'oeuvres for overseas appetites. The main course is an 
$18-million, 52-episode cartoon series, also in Spanish, which is to be 
produced jointly by MSP and the Taiwan-based animation studio, Cuckoo's Nest. 
He hopes to peddle the series throughout Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate, and bolder, project, he has contracted actors from 
Hanna-Barbera studios, creators of the Flintstones, to make over Monica in a 
pilot film aimed, eventually, at conquering the most coveted audience of all, 
English-speaking American television. 
</P>
<P>
 Sousa has still other plans for Monica. Each month about 150,000 kids push 
through the turnstiles at the Parque da Monica, a theme and interactive play 
center that sprawls over three floors of an upscale Sao Paulo shopping mall. 
The numbers have piqued interests abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Promising was a visit last year by executives from the Boston tourist 
development firm, Hamilton Betts Inc., who visited the Parque da Monica and MSP 
studios. A company official promptly wrote Sousa back to talk about replicating 
his theme park "throughout South America and, in time, North America." 
</P>
<P>
 A Disney-sized fantasy, perhaps, but if even a part of it comes true, Monica 
and her kin may be amusing children from Miami to Montevideo. And Mauricio 
Sousa will be grinning all the way to the bank.

PHOTO ESSAY; ANXIOUS WAIT FOR MYANMAR REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a string of squalid refugee camps in a forsaken corner of Bangladesh, the 
Rohingya people are steeling their nerves for a journey home. Many of them wish 
the time had not come. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim Rohingyas fled their villages in the state of Arakan in neighboring 
Myanmar, a largely Buddhist country, more than two years ago, claiming that 
they were driven out by pillaging troops. Now they are caught in the middle, 
wanted neither by Bangladesh nor Myanmar (formerly Burma). Some are resisting 
repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good life in Arakan," recalled Nabir Hossain, a former 
schoolteacher, who crossed the border with his daughter. "We were poor, but we 
had our own land and we could always grow enough rice to feed ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The military raids overturned his existence, Hossain related, saying his wife 
was abducted by the marauding soldiers. "This is the most difficult decision of 
my life," he lamented. "I know I may never see her again, but we can't go back 
there -- not now." 
</P>
<P>
 But many Rohingyas will be leaving the camps in coming weeks under a new 
program hammered out under heavy Western and United Nations pressure. In all, 
more than 250,000 left their homeland, and about 53,000 returned under earlier 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorities in Myanmar initially resisted repatriation efforts, at one 
point claiming that the Rohingyas were Bangladeshis living illegally in Arakan. 
They have now agreed to cooperate with the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees to arrange an organized return. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees will not find life the same when they go back, say Rohingya 
spokesmen and aid workers. Since the refugees left their villages, Myanmar has 
encouraged settlement there by Buddhist Arakanese families, and tension between 
the two groups is likely to grow as more Rohingyas return. 
</P>
<P>
 But life has not been easy in the camps in the Cox's Bazar region of 
Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries whose government is wary of 
the Rohingyas' pressure on scarce resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees' future, if they return to Myanmar, is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day in the camps, somebody comes to me and asks, 'Can you tell me about 
the situation in my village. Is it safe to go back?' " said a Bangladeshi named 
Shabir, an aide in an UNHCR transit camp. "What can I tell them? Nobody here 
really knows."

MARKET SCENE; BULGARIA'S MODERN WAR OF THE ROSES; * PERFUME OIL IS A STATE 
MONOPOLY THAT STUBBORNLY RESISTS CAPITALIST INROADS IN THE EASTERN EUROPEAN 
NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The heady scent and precious-metal price tag of attar of roses hint at the 
affluence Bulgarians dream of, and its production in grimy, dilapidated 
factories operated by hidebound managers and slothful workers embodies the 
Eastern European reality they would like to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the expensive essence itself, the soul of perfume, the rose-oil industry 
is Bulgaria in concentrate. It too has suffered under communism, yet it 
stubbornly refuses to submit to the capitalist era. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil, distilled from rose petals, is an ancient and unique ingredient of 
perfume, used to fix the scent, and is a major source of hard currency for 
impoverished Bulgaria. It accounts for 50,000 jobs and at least 2% of the 
economy. Proponents of privatization believe it could flourish even further 
with the decline of Communist-era mismanagement, but Bulgaria's rose growers, 
distillers and the state monopoly distributor have hunkered down, resisting 
outside investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, people in the industry fear that sale of their facilities to foreign 
investors might disrupt the delicate competition between Bulgaria and Turkey, 
the only two significant producers of attar oil. Specifically, many of them 
suspect that the Turks themselves might try to buy into the Bulgarian industry 
and shut it down, taking over the whole market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rose growers and distillery workers have reportedly been sabotaging any 
efforts to shift attar production from state control, and government officials 
are doing little to deter them because many are comfortable with a state 
monopoly that produces a profit, even with the winds of capitalism blowing 
across the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the 12-nation European Union, as part of its program for aiding the 
transition of former Communist states to market economies, contracted a U.S. 
company, Boston Consulting Group, to evaluate Bulgaria's rose-oil facilities in 
preparation for private sale. European Union sources here complained that their 
work and that of the consultants was constantly thwarted by industry managers 
and union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers at such state-owned companies as Alen Mak of Plovdiv have told 
Bulgarian newspapers they are refusing to disclose details of their financial 
and marketing positions to foreign consultants trying to determine their worth. 
They are also closing their records to potential buyers who come to scope out 
the profit prospects. The Sofia government has so far refused to accept the 
results of the pre-privatization study, bowing to industry managers who claim 
its evaluations are inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a nationalist as far as rose oil is concerned," proclaimed Boyan 
Kalakounov, an expert in aromatic oils at the state-owned Bulgarian Rose 
Company in Karlovo, summing up the view that attar production should stay in 
Bulgarian hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Yordan Todorov, an agronomist at a state-owned rose farm near the city of 
Kazanluk, suggests that foreign investors should merely provide cash for new 
equipment in exchange for a share of the attar output. Like most Bulgarians 
whose livelihood depends on the industry, he rejects the notion of letting 
foreigners own and control the means of production. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria's attar distilling, packaging and marketing facilities are poorly 
equipped and out of date, but production of the oil is as much art as science. 
Only roses grown in the rich soil of the 60-mile-long Valley of Roses in the 
heart of the country are used. To ensure that the petals are harvested at their 
aromatic best, they are picked only during the first two weeks of June and only 
during the first two hours after sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen distilleries scattered throughout the valley extract the attar oil 
from the roses and then truck it to Sofia, where it is tested and blended to 
ensure that the Bulgarian product is consistent in quality and composition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much like making wine," said Peter Dragostinov, a quality-control 
specialist at the Research Institute for Perfumes, Cosmetics and Essential 
Oils. Each year's crop of rose petals is slightly different, as is each vat of 
oil produced by the various distillers, so institute scientists must constantly 
revise their recipes to create the same properties and scent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria was the only attar-producing nation in the world until the middle of 
this century, when the Communist takeover after World War II subjected the 
industry to a series of disruptions and encouraged neighboring Turkey to move 
into the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey now slightly outproduces Bulgaria's annual output of 800 kilograms, or 
about 1,760 pounds, of the highly concentrated attar, which sells to 
wholesalers and major perfume manufacturers for about $150 per ounce. While the 
quantity of attar produced both here and in Turkey is relatively small, it is 
so dense that a tiny copper flask, holding about 3.5 ounces, has the power to 
preserve the fragrance in gallons of perfume. 
</P>
<P>
 "All rose oil produced in the country, without exception, is brought here," 
said Nikolai Nenov, head of the research institute's laboratory in Sofia. 
"Otherwise the product cannot be certified as genuine Bulgarian rose oil and 
affixed with the seal and national colors that guarantees buyers they are 
getting the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarians claim to be angling to recover some of the market share lost to 
Turkey over the past few decades. Prices for Bulgarian oil have been cut by 
about 20% in an effort to close the gap with Turkey and win back important 
French perfume makers that have turned to the Turkish oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Turkish producers sell their oil for much less, but the quality is lower 
as well," Nenov insisted, noting that the Turkish oil has never sold for more 
than about $85 per ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Both countries limit production to maintain prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Bulgaria had a reasonable trade policy during the Communist era, we would 
now have much better prospects for production and marketing as well," Nenov 
said. "It's not that the authorities adopted a particularly destructive policy 
toward attar, it was just that agriculture in general was not given much 
priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a historically agrarian region, Bulgaria was subjected to mass 
industrialization under the Soviet Bloc after World War II. Workers were drawn 
from farms to factories, and responsibility for food production was transferred 
to huge collective enterprises. Rose oil continued to be produced most years, 
but quality and quantity was inconsistent until its value as a hard-currency 
earner was realized in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the Turks supply the French, Bulgaria dominates the U.S. attar market, 
selling as much as 80% of its output to American perfume makers and 
wholesalers, Nenov said. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil is reputed to have medicinal uses as well as cosmetic, but Bulgarian 
industry officials concede that they have devoted too little time to 
development in that sector. With small-scale production, U.S. and Japanese 
companies have taken the lead in medicinal research, Nenov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazanluk and Karlovo, industry centers in the Valley of the Roses, host an 
annual Rose Festival and Rose Parade each June. This year's festivities will 
mark the 350th anniversary of the first production of attar, which began during 
the time of Ottoman Turkish rule of the Balkans. The Ottomans, who dominated 
the Muslim world, imported roses from Damascus, Syria, and compelled Bulgarian 
peasants to cultivate them. Officials at the Rose Institute say the industry's 
folklore sets the first attar extraction in 1644.

 SEAL OF APPROVAL: Deep in the recesses of President Clinton's $1.52-trillion 
budget released Monday was enough to put the total for the Ronald Reagan 
Federal Courthouse in Santa Ana at $128 million. Local congressmen had asked 
for $168 million, but Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) says that in these 
hard times, Orange County is fortunate with what it got. . . . "We can build it 
with that, but not a penny less," he says. "With a population the size of a 
dozen states, Orange County deserves a decent federal courthouse." 
</P>
<P>
 LOVELY HALF: Former Angels General Manager Whitey Herzog, now a consultant for 
the club, got a card from wife Mary Lou for their 41st wedding anniversary 
Monday: "It's been great, I hope we can have a great 20 1/2 more years." Her 
explanation: "The way I figure it, you've been gone half the time since we've 
been married." . . . Herzog says of his life since resigning from the Angels on 
Jan. 15: "I've gone skiing 12 of those days and fished five others. Now, how 
much better can life get than that?" 
</P>
<P>
 BAD REP? When Dr. Hugh Stallworth moved here from Fresno last month to become 
the county's public health director, in charge of 1,200 employees, friends 
warned him about Orange County's reputation as a bulwark of conservatism. . . . 
"But that's OK," says Stallworth. "Conservative people have health problems 
too. So far I feel I'm fortunate to have been put into a very nurturing 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 REFRESHER SESSION: Les McCraw is at the top of his field as chief executive of 
Fluor Corp. Which is why officials at the Barker Elementary School in Garden 
Grove are ecstatic that he's coming today to talk to 4th to 6th graders about 
the importance of math and science. . . . "It's never too early for them to see 
how the things they learn in school relate to the real world," says Barker 
Principal Vince Spinosa. More than 100 Fluor engineers will be pouring into 
local schools this month to promote interest in technology and math.

MAGRANE TO HAVE SURGERY; ANGELS: ARTHROSCOPY ON LEFT ELBOW TODAY WILL SIDELINE 
NO. 3 STARTER AT LEAST TWO MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In news that resurrected painful memories of Kelly Gruber's injury, Angel 
pitcher Joe Magrane will undergo arthroscopic surgery today on his left elbow. 
He is expected to be sidelined at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as traumatic as knowing that their No. 3 starter will be lost until 
mid-April, is the ridicule the Angels anticipate from their peers. They created 
a furor in September when Whitey Herzog, then the general manager, gave Magrane 
a contract that guaranteed $3 million over two years, and was worth a potential 
$13.3 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the same pitcher who missed all but five games during the 1991 and 
1992 seasons while recovering from reconstructive elbow surgery, and was 
released last August by the Cardinals. Yet, Magrane was 3-2 with a 3.94 
earned-run average with the Angels, and became their first free agent since 
Jerry Reuss in 1987 to sign a contract during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed about the whole situation," Magrane said, "because I honestly 
felt we were negotiating in good faith at the end of the season. I feel I've 
let a lot of people down." 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane began working out after the holidays and experienced some discomfort 
in January. He visited Dr. Lewis Yocum last week, and was given a cortisone 
shot. There was no improvement when he was examined again Monday, and Magrane 
opted for surgery, which is scheduled at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you have surgery you're concerned," Magrane said, "but . . . it's 
a lot smarter to have this done now than later and miss a large part of the 
season. It isn't like there's any huge bone chips or spurs in there, it just 
needs cleaning out." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi: "I don't like to panic unless given 
reason to panic. But am I concerned? Sure. What we expect is something minor, 
but that's not to say they can't find something else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels tentatively plan to move Phil Leftwich into the No. 3 spot in the 
rotation, and leave John Dopson, John Farrell, Russ Springer, Shawn Hillegas 
and Hilly Hathaway vying for the final two jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you sign a guy for three years and can't get to the first tee," Angel 
Manager Buck Rodgers said, "certainly, it's disappointing. He was going to be 
our No. 3 starter, and certainly be in the rotation. Now we have a whole new 
situation."

IT'S PLAY BALL FOR RETIRED JORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jordan, who said he retired from basketball to get away from the 
public eye, has been thrust back into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox on Monday and 
was invited to spring training as a non-roster player. 
</P>
<P>
 His contract is with the Nashville Sounds of the triple-A American Assn. If 
nothing else, Jordan will help the Sounds sell tickets. Even though Jordan may 
not make the club, the Sounds sold $60,000 worth of season tickets after the 
announcement. A season ticket is priced at $360. Single-game tickets will go on 
sale today. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan agreed to consider going to the minor leagues as long as the White Sox 
thought he had the potential to make it to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 He is still being paid by the Bulls this season, a salary reported to be $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chose to try to play baseball just to see if I could," Jordan said. "I'm 
not doing it as a distraction, and I'm not doing it as a media hog or looking 
for the media exposure from it. It's one of the wishes my father had and I had 
as a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Jordan, 30, went through a workout in a gym at the Illinois 
Institute of Technology. He said he'll report to spring training next week at 
Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been afraid to fail," Jordan said. "That's something you have to 
deal with in reality. I think I'm strong enough as a person to accept failure. 
But I can't accept not trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Jordan expects to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've improved tremendously," said Jordan, who has been working out 
underneath Comiskey Park for the last two months with some White Sox players 
and personnel. "My motto has been, 'It's no gimmick.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox, who are planning to send Jordan to their minor-league camp once 
it commences, privately are worried that Jordan's presence will create a 
distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Gene Lamont has told friends he is opposed to the idea, and owner 
Jerry Reinsdorf has said he simply can't say no to Jordan's request. Reinsdorf 
has told associates that he believes that once Jordan realizes he has no future 
in baseball, he will return to the Chicago Bulls for the 1994-95 season.

GAINING A PEAK SUCCESS; SKIER STREET COOLS HER TEMPER, HAS A SHOT AT THE GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Baby Girl" wasn't breathing in the crucial moments after her birth on April 
3, 1971. She was baby blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, this would glibly be recounted as her first temper tantrum, but the 
matter then was deadly serious. The nearest doctor from the family home in 
Triumph, Ida., was 12 miles away in Sun Valley. With no time to spare, Roland 
Wayne (Stubby) Street pressed his mouth against his daughter's and blew into 
her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby's chest swelled and soon she turned a healthy pink. Street describes 
this as the moment she "kicked in and fired up." 
</P>
<P>
 Stubby then flipped her over, held her feet with one hand and swatted her 
behind with the other. The girl didn't so much as yelp. Instead, the story 
goes, she looked up and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear to God she was laughing at me that day," her mother, Dee, recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could have imagined that nearly 23 years later, Picabo Street would be 
a contender for an Olympic medal in downhill skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 But everyone knew the Street girl was a spitfire right out of the gate. In her 
short but eventful life, she has bemused and bedeviled those closest to her -- 
family, friends and, to be sure, U.S. Ski Team coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1990, Street was kicked off the U.S team briefly for 
disciplinary reasons. But no one stays mad at Picabo for long. In between 
tantrums -- some of her best have been in ski-race finish areas -- Street is a 
mile-a-minute, straight-shooting talker and skier of some repute. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of work at U.S. Ski Team charm school, the pieces finally came 
together last year as Street earned a silver medal in the combined at the World 
Alpine Ski Championships in Morioka, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing would come easy for the girl named Picabo. 
</P>
<P>
 Some girls grew up singing. Picabo -- pronounced "Peek-a-boo" -- grew up 
swinging. 
</P>
<P>
 Street's parents, hippies who ran off to Idaho together in July of 1967, 
decided to let their children name themselves. Two years before "Baby Girl" was 
born, "Baby Boy" entered the world. He would be known as "Baby Boy" or "Baba" 
for five years until another Big Brother -- the federal government -- came 
calling. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, when the Streets applied for documents before a planned trip to 
Mexico, the government demanded that the parents give proper names to the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Baby Boy became Roland Wayne III. But no one has ever called him Roland; 
it's Baba, Bubbers, Bubs or Bobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby Girl? She became Picabo. 
</P>
<P>
 On the trailer trek to Triumph years before, the Streets had passed through a 
dot on the map called Picabo, Ida., and the name stuck in their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee says picabo is the Nez Perce Indian word meaning "shining waters." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a strange name, but this is a different girl. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be, as you might expect, the requisite playground fights at 
Hemingway Elementary School nearby Ketchum, named for the author who once lived 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo heard it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peek-a-boo, I see you!" was standard fare, she recalls. Or, "What's your 
brother's name? Hide and Go Seek?" 
</P>
<P>
 But she never backed down. Her parents told her she could change her name at 
any time, but she refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started coming up with stuff like, 'Well, at least my name's not Jim, like 
everyone else in the world,' " she says. "It started to sink in that it was 
pretty cool my name isn't like that. I kind of enjoyed it. It made me stand 
away and out from the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Family and friends have always called her "Peek" for short. 
</P>
<P>
 Those brave enough to pick a fight with her usually got their chance. 
</P>
<P>
 In fifth grade, while she was chasing a girl around campus after an 
altercation, Picabo slipped on a patch of ice and chipped her front tooth on a 
curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could've opened a beer can with that tooth," her mother still says 
proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Streets had a barter deal with the local dentist, though, and their 
daughter got the tooth capped. "We built him a fireplace and he fixed our 
teeth," Dee Street says. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumph had been a thriving mining community until the North Star Mine closed 
in 1953. But by the time the Streets hit town, there wasn't much town at all. 
Of the eight kids who ruled Triumph, population 13 or so at the time, Picabo 
was the only female. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in the neighborhood, she was always just one of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once, I got hit in the forehead and knocked out with a baseball," Picabo 
recalls, "and they just said, 'Ah, c'mon,' and kicked me around and got me back 
up. So I just had to hack it and be tough. I think that's what made me as tough 
as I was, growing up in that atmosphere and having the name that I did." 
</P>
<P>
 At 4, Picabo demanded a chance to ride her brother's bike, which had no 
training wheels, seat or brakes. Tired of her pestering, Baba put Picabo on 
board and pushed her down the street. She didn't stop until she bounced off a 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 At neighborhood birthday parties, Picabo would sometimes pull out the boxing 
gloves and "whip the crap out of everybody," her mother remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 Discipline was a problem. The prospect of a spanking usually drew a hearty 
laugh from Picabo, so her parents had to get creative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unpredictable," is how her mother puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing Picabo couldn't do was sit still. So, for punishment, Stubby 
would make Picabo place her nose on a designated spot on the wall barely high 
enough to make her crane her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 She would be ordered not to move for minutes at a time. It was very effective. 
</P>
<P>
 This sort of punishment pained the Streets, who had fled the establishment and 
its rules and regulations. INCENSE AND PEPPERMINTS 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Meyer met Stubby Street in Reno in 1966. Meyer was attending college, 
while Street was a gourmet chef and the son of a Nevada banker. 
</P>
<P>
 Stubby's childhood was strictly regimented, one reason he later joined the 
Marines, but he apparently had no desire to live a white-collar life in the 
shadow of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 So, on July 4, 1967, Street hitched a trailer to his Dodge van and took off 
with Dee. For two months, they rented a trailer space and camped in Grass 
Valley, where the couple made extra money by painting fences. 
</P>
<P>
 Stubby grew out his beard. Dee wanted a head with hair. Long, beautiful hair. 
Shining, gleaming, streaming, flaxen, waxen. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, Dee's mane extended below her knees. You could braid it and 
jump rope. Dee played guitar and sang folk anthems. She still gives lessons. 
She once performed at a peace march in Reno and claims she can sing Joan Baez, 
"backward, blindfolded and with my hands tied." 
</P>
<P>
 The Streets were, well, far out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't stoned out all the time," Dee says. "We weren't on acid all the 
time. But we were kind of anti-establishment. We rebelled against the 8 to 5, 
working for someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 While in Grass Valley, Stubby heard that there were jobs available at the Sun 
Valley ski resort in Idaho. He was, by trade, a ski bum and gourmet cook. 
</P>
<P>
 It took about 10 minutes to hitch the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho was everything they imagined. Where else could you rent a house for $50 
a month from a landlord such as theirs, Ernie Haar, whom Dee suspected had been 
chased out of South Dakota because he said he had made contact with UFOs? 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned to cook on a wood stove," Picabo recalls fondly. "We'd go up to the 
high country to camp and fish. We had horses. We ate really good food, rice and 
beans, powdered milk, just really healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Streets ate every meal at home. Picabo says she watched TV only about five 
times as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent all my time with my family," she says. "I never had a baby-sitter. My 
parents never left us . . . The best thing about my parents, they were really 
open-minded and they let us do a lot of things we wanted to do. They let us go 
out and experiment and were there to pick us up if we fell on our butt." THE 
AGE OF NEFARIOUS 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo Street and the Sun Valley ski resort were an accident and a ski 
champion waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there was no stopping her. 
</P>
<P>
 She started skiing at 5. She cried all the way up the chairlift the first 
time, thinking she would fall, but once she exited, Picabo made a bee-line to 
the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 She called it survival of the fittest. "I just started chasing my brother and 
my dad around the mountain," she says. "I had to keep up or get left behind. It 
was like, 'If you can't keep up, meet us at the car at 4.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo kept up. 
</P>
<P>
 It soon became clear she was something special. Picabo joined the Sun Valley 
ski team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day she left the Sun Valley ski team was the day we drove around the 
corner and she was lying on the snow at the finish line, kicking and screaming 
because she wasn't beating everyone," Dee Street says.  
</P>
<P>
 Picabo was 11. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Dee's mission to keep her daughter from becoming "a brat and a prima 
donna." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the majority of ski families, the Street's didn't have much money. Yet 
when Picabo was 13, the family moved to Salt Lake City so she could enter the 
prestigious Rowmark Ski Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience was a disaster, and the Streets were back in Idaho within the 
year. For one, Picabo didn't care much for schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 As she puts it, "I didn't want to get honors and go to Stanford. I wanted to 
learn what I could and get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo's ski career quickly took off. In 1988, she won the U.S. Junior 
downhill and super-G championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Pure talent brought her only that far. After suffering a knee injury in 1989, 
she came to dry-land training camp at Park City, Utah, in the summer of '90 out 
of shape and out of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Major, then the U.S. women's coach, took one look at Street and sent her 
home with the admonition to get her act together. 
</P>
<P>
 Street: "They flat-out said, 'Your attitude stinks and you need to go home and 
figure out whether you want to do this or not. So, I went home and wrote out 
the pros and cons of skiing or not skiing, and the pros outweighed the cons by 
a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Street returned, but it wasn't an open-and-shut case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never just turned around completely," Major says. "I think it's turned 
around now because she's had some success. She understands it's going to take a 
lot of work to stay up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Major, who now has the dual role as women's coach and Alpine director, and 
Street have had their share of run-ins. "There are 1,000 stories," Major says. 
"Some of them you can't repeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Street says she has worked hard to control her temper but still has a problem 
with authority figures. "I think they realized they had to approach it a little 
bit differently with me, too," she says. "They just couldn't wag their finger 
at me any more. That's not something I'm partial to at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Street and the coaches tried to find some common ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Her temper was still an issue. Last year, desperate to retrieve a duffel bag 
buried beneath a mound of others in the team van, Street grabbed the straps of 
her bag, put both feet against the bumper and yanked the bag out while falling 
flat on her backside. 
</P>
<P>
 Major says she was lucky she didn't break her back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have control over it," she says of her emotions. "I used to let it 
fly a lot worse. I used to freak out whenever I didn't ski as well as I wanted 
to. I didn't care who was around watching. I'd just throw my stuff around, 
throw a little temper tantrum. I've learned you can't do that. It's very 
distasteful . . . So I go around the corner and do it. It's not that I've 
stopped doing it, I just don't do it in the public eye anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 At least not as often. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a girl on the team, and we were playing broom hockey, and she kept 
hitting me with her stick, and it (teed) me off and I wound up to punch her. I 
was about to punch her out, and I stopped myself and said, 'Wow, you can't do 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With Street, control is a 12-step program. "I really like her because of her 
energy," Major says. "I like her because she's a genuine person. She's 
extremely extroverted. She just loves to tell you what's on her mind. There's 
nothing contrived about her. She may not have all the social graces to go with 
it, but that's fun. You're really seeing a person." 
</P>
<P>
 Street hopes to have it all working for her in the Winter Olympics starting 
Saturday. She wants to throw her best tantrum as she's screaming down the 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of fire in me," she says. "It's good, but it's taken me four 
or five years to channel it in the right direction. I've got to get it going, 
get it working for me, not against me." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents will be course-side when Street descends the Olympic downhill 
course at Kvitfjell on Feb. 19. Until she learned how to ski herself, Dee 
couldn't bare to watch Picabo race. The reality of that danger hit home on Jan. 
29 when Austria's Ulrike Maier was killed in a downhill race at 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo had completed her run and was leading the race when the accident 
occurred. Street ended up a respectable seventh. There was no celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Idaho, a flower-child-turned-mother grew more anxious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm somehow under the impression that it's never going to get better," Dee 
Street says of the worrying. "As a mother, I think I'm always going to go 
through this."

COUNTDOWN TO THE WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER '94; FEBRUARY 12-27; HEARING BY 
USOC EXPECTED; OLYMPICS: WALKER SAYS THAT GROUP MUST DECIDE ON TONYA HARDING'S 
FATE.

<P>
 While U.S. Olympic Committee officials said here Monday they were close to a 
decision to hold a hearing that would determine whether figure skater Tonya 
Harding can compete in the Winter Games, the committee's president said such a 
hearing is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any choice," LeRoy Walker said from his home in Durham, N.C. 
"We have to make the decision (on Harding)." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said he and the USOC's executive director, Harvey Schiller, had reached 
that conclusion in a telephone conversation last week, before the U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn. announced results of an investigation that found reasonable 
grounds existed to believe Harding was involved in either the plan to attack 
rival Nancy Kerrigan or in the cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving that decision from the USFSA Saturday night, Schiller 
announced that the USOC was weighing whether to convene the Games 
Administrative Board next week to decide if Harding's actions violated the 
committee's code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller said Monday the USOC was still uncertain whether to proceed, but 
acknowledged that the committee is moving in that direction. A USOC source, who 
did not want to be identified, said Sunday that the committee is "97, 98, 99%" 
sure to announce this week that a hearing will be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Walker's statement that the USOC has no choice, Schiller said: "I 
don't think we can say that yet. But I would say that the probability is really 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller said Sunday the USOC was waiting to make a decision until after 
Walker had evaluated between 300 and 400 pages of documentation from the 
USFSA's investigation. Walker said he still had not received the papers and 
seemed frustrated that no one from the USOC had contacted him since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source close to the situation said the papers were being reviewed by 
the USOC's chief counsel, Ron Rowan, at the committee's headquarters in 
Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that we have a firm grasp of all the legal issues," the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan did not return telephone calls to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did Harding's attorneys, although a spokeswoman, Janis Timlick, said 
Monday from Portland, Ore., that they would not hold any news conferences or 
make any comments about anything pertaining to the matter for 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC has been in daily contact with Harding's attorneys since Saturday, 
but has not given them notice of a hearing date. According to the Amateur 
Sports Act of 1978, Harding must be invited to attend the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the earliest the Games Administrative Board could convene would 
be next Tuesday. The USOC has until Feb. 21, two days before the women's 
competition begins in Hamar, Norway, to declare its two entrants. If either of 
the first two selections, Kerrigan or Harding, is unable to compete, the first 
alternate, Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, would be the replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 As the USOC's president, Walker can appoint members of the board. He said 
Monday he was considering the addition of two to the 13 already appointed 
before he arrives here Friday, one day before the opening ceremony at 
Lillehammer Olympic Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said the USOC should act either to remove Harding from the team or 
allow her to compete as soon as possible to shift the focus away from her and 
Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Winter Olympics are not just about two individuals," he said. "We have 
151 other athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, Harding and Kerrigan have dominated the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's coach, Evy Scotvold, had a harsh reaction Monday when it was 
announced the American skaters were assigned to the same practice session at 
the Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absurd," Scotvold said.

RAMBIS IS A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES; PRO BASKETBALL: THE LAKERS' FANS LOVE THEIR 
HORN-RIMMED, WORKING-CLASS HERO AS MUCH THE SECOND TIME AROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He is Kurt Rambis because of . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in Los Angeles, through four NBA championships and into what is now 
his second stint with the Lakers, they love his hard-hat style of play, the 
unpretentious personality, the notion they could see him on the Forum court one 
day and Boogie-boarding the next. They especially loved him as a contrast to 
his graceful, sleek teammates of the Showtime era. 
</P>
<P>
 No one scores less and is cheered more. Chick Hearn, the Laker broadcaster for 
34 years, said Rambis is possibly the fourth- or fifth-most popular player ever 
to call the Forum home, behind only Magic Johnson and Michael Cooper and in a 
group with Jamaal Wilkes, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Gail Goodrich. Josh 
Rosenfeld, the team's public relations director in 1982-89, ranks Rambis second 
during those years, behind only Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one thing might surpass the fans' love for Rambis. 
</P>
<P>
 His love for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans always appreciated all the little dirty stuff I did, all the things 
nobody else really liked to do," he said. "They appreciated the fact that I 
liked doing it, once they got over laughing at me the first time they saw me on 
the court. They appreciated all the stuff I did, and it just made me want to do 
more and play harder." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't sure what to think when it all started, when he first saw a group of 
kids in the stands wearing the geek glasses and cheering his every move. 
Deceived by 20/400 vision, he thought Rambis Youth was mocking him and told a 
Laker staff member to invite them to the Forum Club for a confrontation. Rambis 
was going to tell them to knock it off, only to pull the about-face after 
seeing that this adulation was on the level. 
</P>
<P>
 It took off from there, through his seven seasons as the gritty power forward. 
Then it continued, even after he left as a free agent to sign with the 
Charlotte Hornets and through stops with the Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings 
before the reunion this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only been a couple of times when I've seen him cry," said Linda 
Rambis, the former vice president and general manager of Forum tennis who 
became his wife. "I know it's not popular for a man to cry. But when our first 
son, Jesse, was born, it was like boo-hoo forever. That was the most emotional. 
But when he came back with the Hornets that first time and got the championship 
ring from the Lakers and the fans gave him a five-minute standing ovation, he 
was so, so touched. I was in Charlotte and I was crying. The kids were crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had a connection with the fans in L.A., and I don't know how to 
explain it. I don't think it's hero worship, because Kurt is not that type of 
person. It just makes him real teary-eyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years and three teams after leaving, he has that connection again. 
Everything except a new generation of Rambis Youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, if you were a kid, would you want to come to a game with 
glasses on like that?" he said. "OK. You can only take embarrassment so far." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think people looked at Kurt as a basketball player. I think they 
looked at him as a guy who played basketball.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 He is Kurt Rambis because of . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 His father got sick of having to buy new ones every time a pair would get 
knocked off and break while his son was playing sports. So, sometime around the 
sixth grade, an image was born. Black horn-rims. Earpieces that flap out so the 
hinges won't snap. Rubber padding in the nose area to prevent deep scratches on 
the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 He has tried contact lenses, but didn't like them, so he will finish his 
career sporting the 'rims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look too damn good in them," he said. "How can I give that up? They're 
women magnets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen years of pro basketball, including the one in Greece. That's more 
than Larry Bird played. More than Magic Johnson played. Who would have believed 
it?

</P>
<P>
 He is Kurt Rambis because of . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The stash of hotel soap, shampoo, sewing kits, shower caps, conditioner, 
wooden hangers and rolls of toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Rambis is not a kleptomaniac. He is simply, uh, frugal. He hoarded so much 
stuff from years of touring the league that when the family temporarily 
relocated from Manhattan Beach to Charlotte, then to Phoenix and then to 
Sacramento before returning to the South Bay, it cost about $200 each time for 
the boxes of hotel goods. Did we mention bathroom floor mats? 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows how to stretch a penny, I can say that," longtime teammate James 
Worthy said. "He hasn't bought a new pair of shoes since the last time he was 
with Lakers. He had one pair he just kept re-soleing year after year, putting 
orthotics in them, trying to save them. He was the reason we had a dress code 
enforced." 
</P>
<P>
 One time in Indianapolis, Rambis forgot his game shoes in the hotel after 
boarding the bus, so Rosenfeld retrieved them. The shoes are in the red bag in 
the closet, Rambis told him, but don't take anything else out. Rosenfeld opened 
the bag to find the sneakers, 10 rolls of toilet paper and 10 or 15 hangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rambis is quick to pick up tabs at expensive restaurants, and he gives money 
and time to charities and community-service projects. Those boxes of soap and 
shampoo and sewing kits? The Rambises donated them to a homeless shelter in Los 
Angeles during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just doesn't believe in wasting," Linda Rambis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rambis method has changed about as much as his popularity. He stuffed the 
free beers and sodas in his bag before heading out of the locker room before, 
and he does it now. After he was waived on Dec. 14 and then re-signed on Jan. 
5, one of the first acts after returning was to bring home about 50 sodas. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda saw them, all stacked up, and looked at her husband incredulously. "I 
took the ones I would have taken if I was there," he told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Linda: "I still think he's a geek, but I fell in love with that geek. 
He's just himself. He doesn't put on airs. He is who he is. I would think most 
people would find it embarrassing to put sodas in your bag all the time in 
front of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Charles Barkley. But to him, 
it's like, 'I don't give a darn. This is me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The thing I would describe if I were going to draw a picture of Kurt would be 
a human heart with a pair of glasses on it.  
</P>
<P>
 -- CHICK HEARN 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He is Kurt Rambis because of . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The talent. 
</P>
<P>
 He has some, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, it's unfair to Kurt that his reputation has only been around 
the overachieving and that part," said Coach Randy Pfund, an assistant during 
part of Rambis' first Laker stint. "Like a lot of players in the NBA, very good 
players in college come in, but the Michael Jordans, the Magic Johnsons, the 
Larry Birds tend to make them look very mortal. That's the situation Kurt was 
in. He'll always be known for that, but those around the game know. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of Kurt, I think of some of the basketball things he does. 
Inbounding the ball quickly (after an opponent's basket). That's a 
little-taught skill, but for years that was a real part of the Laker fast 
break. Good outlet passes. Setting screens. Talking -- he's not afraid to 
communicate and yell. It's those things, basketball-wise, that I always think 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'll always remember the championships, I'll always remember the funny things 
that happened on and off the court, the good things that happened. But there's 
no way I could describe to you the feeling, the joy and the incredible rush 
that goes through your body when those fans cheer for you. I'll never forget 
that feeling.

JIM MURRAY: TRADITION IS PAR FOR THE COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The L.A. Open is just about the most venerable of the regular city tour 
tournaments this side of the "majors." In fact, it even predates one of those. 
It was another eight years before the first Masters was played. 
</P>
<P>
 It stands alone as a one-city event. The Western Open is older by the calendar 
but that hoary event was played all over the continent, including one time in 
Los Angeles. It was also played in Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Salt Lake City, 
Houston, Detroit, Phoenix, St. Paul and every other place a train stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Open always had a prestige commensurate with its seniority. For many 
years, it was the first tournament of the year, the tour's harbinger. Long 
before the Rams, Raiders, Dodgers, Angels, Lakers and Clippers put Los Angeles 
on the map, the L.A. Open had beaten them to it. It came along when movies were 
silent, cars had to be cranked and phones didn't have dials -- and when you got 
a call the whole neighborhood listened in. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way it started corporate sponsorship. It had trouble getting start-up 
money, so it hit up Los Angeles Times' publisher Harry Chandler, who took in 
his counterpart on the old Examiner, Guy Barham, to bankroll the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsoring Junior Chamber of Commerce was light-years ahead of its time. 
The L.A. Open was the first tournament in history to put up $10,000, which for 
1926 was unheard of. It was decades before even the U.S. Open caught up with 
that kind of purse, in 1947. Even then, it paid only $2,000 to the winner. In 
1926, the L.A. Open paid $3,500 to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this deterred the sponsors of the first L.A. Open. Theirs was such an 
audacious move that it not only put L.A. on the map, but golf itself. They were 
to stage the first $100-a-plate dinner ever held in this country (emceed by 
Will Rogers). They attracted coverage from the Eastern press -- famed 
sportswriters like Damon Runyon and Grantland Rice came West, attracted by the 
open-handed purses posted by the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf was as elite as the promotion. The leader board -- and by the way, it 
is believed that the L.A. Open was the first place this innovation was to 
emerge -- read like a Who's Who of Golf. No "Unknown Wins Open" for L.A. 
Instead, Lighthorse Harry Cooper won the first, Bobby Cruikshank the second and 
then, when their time came, Ben Hogan, Sam Snead and Byron Nelson took turns 
winning it. After them, Arnold Palmer, Billy Casper, Gene Littler and Ken 
Venturi moved in. The first black player ever to win a tour tournament did it 
in L.A., Charlie Sifford. The L.A. Open was integrated long before the tour 
was. You qualified for L.A., your race was irrelevant. In 1948, the black 
player, Bill Spiller, led after the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 It was to be 26 years before even its own winner's share was to rise above the 
$3,500 that was paid the first year. Not till 1952 did it climb to $4,000. The 
most Arnold Palmer ever got for winning in L.A. was $20,000 in 1967. He got 
$9,000 for winning in 1963 and $11,000 for winning in 1966. Tom Kite got 
$180,000 for his victory last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any tournament, it had its mixture of joy and melancholy. Hogan's 
comeback try in 1950 saw him sitting in the clubhouse with an apparently safe 
lead only to have Snead come storming from behind with birdies on Nos. 17 and 
18 to tie the tournament and win the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Open has spun out of the grasp of several players but none more so 
than the pro from Hillcrest, Eric Monti. He was a club pro with an elegant game 
who was leading the tournament in 1955 after three rounds with a solid 205, the 
only guy in the field with three rounds in the 60s, when he crashed and burned 
in the final round with a 77. But that was nothing compared to what happened to 
him in 1960, when he was again leading after three rounds with a 205 -- and 
ballooned to an 80 in the last round. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, Art Wall thought he had the tournament in the locker with a brilliant 
207 after three rounds. Then Venturi, who was capable of those things, shot a 
63 on the final day to make up 10 shots and win by two. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign players have not fared very well here. Seve Ballesteros couldn't solve 
Riviera's barrancas. Neither could Nick Faldo. Sandy Lyle finished second one 
year, but not even the great Aussies could make it here. T.C. Chen was the only 
foreigner to win, making L.A. the first (and only) Open ever to be won by a 
player from China. 
</P>
<P>
 Unknowns did begin to make their presence felt but that was by the 1970s and 
'80s, when they were beginning to make their presence felt. Pat Fitzsimons, Tom 
Purtzer, Doug Tewell and Ted Schulz won, for some their first tour victory, 
others their only one. Chip Beck won his first tournament in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the unknown soldiers could not fend off the old warriors and the game's 
elite for long. L.A. was also won twice by Tom Watson, Lanny Wadkins and Fred 
Couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Hagen never won here. Neither did Jack Nicklaus, although he played 
sporadically. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a citadel of golf, among other things the first tournament to 
forge a link with area charities, now a staple of the PGA Tour. It is still the 
grandfather of tournaments, the Rose Bowl of golf, and the 144 players who tee 
it up in the 69th L.A. Open this week are basking in a great tradition and a 
daunting past to live up to. Just to hit the ball where Hogan did, to win where 
Snead, Nelson, Palmer and Lloyd Mangrum did, should be honor enough to last a 
lifetime for any golfer.

CALL HIM VIKING VOYAGER; OLYMPICS: FOR VEGARD ULVANG, WINNING SKIING MEDALS IS 
ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE ADVENTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And for his next trick, Vegard the Viking will sky-dive from a biplane onto 
the back of a dog sled, which he will mush to a triumphant victory in Alaska's 
Iditarod. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he will swim the Bering Strait, ski across Siberia to his home in 
Kirkenes in the far north of Norway, where he will go bear hunting with a 
switch. And in the afternoon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 These days, when the talk gets around to adventuring, Vegard the Viking's is 
one of the first names that pops up. 
</P>
<P>
 In his professional life, he is Vegard Ulvang -- that's WAY-guard OOL-wahng , 
which doesn't have quite the ring of Vegard the Viking -- one of the stars of 
the star-studded Norwegian cross-country ski racing team, winner of four medals 
two years ago in the Albertville Games, three golds and a silver, and former 
winner of the World Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
 In his spare time, the world is his playground. He climbs mountains. He treks 
across forbidding terrain in areas best known to the nomads who live there. He 
skis where only other adventurers -- or perhaps none -- have skied before. He 
has tried sky-diving. And if he said he was going to run with the bulls at 
Pamplona, no one would be surprised. He probably would wind up chasing them . 
</P>
<P>
 So what's with this guy? Isn't it enough, at 30, to be one of the world's 
great athletes, a national hero in a ski-crazy country who earns nearly $1 
million annually on his skinny slats? Can't he simply bask in the adulation and 
spend his time off playing at Monte Carlo? Must he attempt these offbeat 
ventures? This skiing across Greenland? This climbing of four mountains on four 
continents in a five-week period? This trekking across Mongolia? This canoeing 
in the wilds of Siberia? 
</P>
<P>
 He must. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like challenges," Ulvang said the other day from Davos, Switzerland, where 
he and his Norwegian teammates were concluding high-altitude training for the 
Lillehammer Winter Olympics, in which he hopes to win more gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do (adventuring) because I like it. It's not so dangerous. People only 
think it is dangerous because the media says so. But these things, many I have 
been doing all my life. I was born with a close contact with nature, so it is 
not unusual for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, it is good always to have a goal. And it is all good preparation for 
life as a skier. It is a way to stay in training without training." 
</P>
<P>
 Not dangerous, he says: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the summer of 1990, on the way down from Denali, the former Mt. McKinley 
in Alaska, Ulvang's brother and adventuring companion, Ketil, went through the 
ice of Wonder Lake, and eventually, in trying to pull him out, so did Ulvang 
and Frenchman Pierre Gay-Perret, their mountain-climbing mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulvang got out, pulled the others out, then stayed with the nearly unconscious 
Ketil while Gay-Perret ran for help. Park rangers later lifted Ketil out by 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the summer of 1991, Ulvang and Gay-Perret decided to ski across 
Greenland, following the 350-mile route used by Norwegian polar explorer 
Fridtjof Nansen on a six-week journey in 1888. With their modern equipment, 
they figured, it would take 20 days, and they packed 20 days' worth of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Storms early in the trip left them far behind schedule, however, and short of 
supplies, if they were to stick to their schedule. Instead, they went on short 
rations and picked up the pace, finishing the trip in 14 days and, in Ulvang's 
case, 25 pounds lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The summer after his Albertville triumph, he and a group of other 
Norwegians went on their climbing spree. He conquered Mt. Elbrus on the 
Russian-Georgian border, Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mt. Puncak Jaya in New 
Guinea, and nearly conquered Mt. Aconcagua in Argentina before being turned 
back by bad weather.  
</P>
<P>
 When the group reached 16,600 feet, Ulvang and another climber were chosen for 
the assault on the the 22,834-foot summit. The other climber turned back at 
19,000 feet, fearing he had frozen his toes, and Ulvang continued alone. He 
reached 22,000 feet, then a storm hit and the wind threatened to blow him off 
the mountain. Fearing an avalanche, he too turned back. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last summer, Ulvang, Gay-Perret and Vladimir Smirnov, a former Soviet 
cross-country skiing star who now represents his native Kazakhstan, trekked 
across Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, their Mongolian guide disappeared. Suspecting foul play, 
Mongolian authorities told the adventurers nobody could leave until it was 
learned what had become of the guide. He turned up four days later, trying to 
cross the border into Russia.  
</P>
<P>
 And those are only the narrow escapes Ulvang has told us about. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he isn't particularly looking for trouble, Ulvang sometimes finds 
it. He spent two days last fall in Sarajevo, the 1984 Winter Olympic city 
turned battleground, representing an Olympic relief organization. Driving 
through town, he and his group came under sniper fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Everest was to have been this summer's adventure, and it still may be. 
First, though, Ulvang has a grim bit of family business to attend to. 
</P>
<P>
 Ketil, a physical therapist, dropped out of sight last October not far from 
Kirkenes, about 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle, and hasn't been seen 
since. Returning home one evening with a group of other physical therapists 
from a professional engagement, Ketil, 32, got out of the car, saying he would 
run the rest of the way through the woods. He had run in those woods all his 
life, and the 17-mile distance figured to be about a two-hour workout for him. 
</P>
<P>
 He never arrived home. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegard, training in the Italian Alps, quickly flew home to help in the 
subsequent search, said to be one of the most intensive in Norwegian history. 
Mounting snow, however, thwarted searchers, dogs and high-tech tracing devices. 
Tracks that might not even have been Ketil's were inconclusive and quickly 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 So Ulvang's first order of business, he said, when spring comes to Kirkenes 
and the snow has melted, will be to find his brother's body.  
</P>
<P>
 "I will look for him until I find him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, there is nothing he can do, so he does what he always does in the 
winter. He trains for skiing and he skis. "It was a tragedy for me and my 
family, but I try to think of him in a positive way, as an inspiration for the 
Olympics," Ulvang said. "I think that would have been his wish." 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years since Albertville, Ulvang's star has dimmed a bit, and Bjorn 
Daehli, who also won three golds and a silver in the '92 Games, has become the 
dominant Norwegian. Still, Ulvang figures he is as ready as he can be, that 
gold is not out of the question for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still love skiing," he said. "The most interesting challenge still is 
pushing my body. The last week has been a little bit boring because we've been 
winding down our hard training, skiing hard in the morning, then relaxing. I 
love to go skiing -- I've skied all my life -- and if I ski well, I still can 
win."  
</P>
<P>
 There figure to be as many as 100,000 home-grown fans for any given 
cross-country event -- Norwegian fans overwhelmed Albertville -- and they will 
surely celebrate if Daehlie wins some races, as anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Vegard the Viking turns in a surprise, the din will be heard from here 
to Kirkenes.

NEWSWIRE: MAGRANE TO HAVE ELBOW SURGERY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In news that resurrected painful memories of Kelly Gruber, the Angels 
announced Monday that starter Joe Magrane will undergo arthroscopic surgery 
today on his left elbow, which will sideline him for at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as traumatic for the Angels knowing that their No. 3 starter will be lost 
until mid-April is the ridicule they surely will receive by their peers in 
baseball.The Angels created a furor back in September for providing Magrane a 
contract that guaranteed $3 million over two years, and was worth a potential 
$13.3 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, this is the same pitcher who missed all but five games during the 
1991 and 1992 seasons while recovering from Tommy John surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed about the whole situation," Magrane said, "because I honestly 
felt we were negotiating in good faith at the end of the season. I feel I've 
let a lot of people down." 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, who began working out after the holidays, began experiencing some 
discomfort in January. He visited Dr. Lewis Yocum last week, and was given a 
cortisone shot. There was no improvement when he was examined again Tuesday, 
and Magrane opted for surgery, which is scheduled at Centinela Hospital in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you have surgery you're concerned," Magrane said, "but I honestly 
believe this is very minor. It isn't like there's any huge bone chips or spurs 
in there, it just needs cleaning out." BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Evoking painful Angel memories of Kelly Gruber's injury after signing a big 
contract, the team said No. 3 starter Joe Magrane will undergo arthroscopic 
surgery today on his left elbow, sidelining him for at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the surgery, the signing of Magrane had been controversial.Whitey 
Herzog, then the general manager, provided Magrane with a contract that 
guaranteed $3 million over two years and was worth a potential $13.3 million 
over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane had sat out all but five games during the 1991 and 1992 seasons while 
recovering from elbow surgery. He was released last August by the St. Louis 
Cardinals and was 3-2 with a 3.94 earned-run average with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed about the whole situation," Magrane said, "because I honestly 
felt we were negotiating in good faith at the end of the season. I feel I've 
let a lot of people down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you have surgery, you're concerned. But I honestly believe this is 
very minor. It's a lot smarter to have this done now than miss a large part of 
the season (later). It isn't like there's any huge bone chips or spurs in 
there, it just needs cleaning out." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi: "I don't like to panic unless given 
reason to panic. But am I concerned? Sure. What we expect is something minor, 
but that's not to say they can't find something else." BOB NIGHTENGALE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Detroit Tigers signed right-hander Tim Belcher to a $3.4-million, one-year 
contract Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Belcher, the 70th of 90 free agents to sign, will be eligible for free agency 
again after the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Belcher, 32, was 9-6 with a 4.47 earned-run average for the Cincinnati Reds 
last season before being traded to the White Sox, with whom he was 3-5 with a 
4.40 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Belcher has had 15 victories in a season twice in his seven-year major league 
career. He was 15-12 with a 2.82 ERA for the 1989 Dodgers, and 15-14 with a 
3.91 ERA for the 1992 Reds.

COACH GOES ON LEAVE; NORTHWESTERN'S BYRDSONG REQUESTS BREAK AFTER WILDCATS' 
EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE LOSS 
</P>

<P>
 Northwestern Coach Ricky Byrdsong, who went into the stands at the University 
of Minnesota to shake hands with fans during his team's eighth consecutive loss 
last weekend, asked for and received an indefinite leave of absence Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Rick Taylor said assistant Paul Swanson will replace 
Byrdsong, in his first year at Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, appointed last month, said a university official he would not identify 
had spoken with Byrdsong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to describe. It's basically a matter of motivation that 
Ricky was trying to get to the team," said Taylor, who said he wasn't sure why 
Byrdsong asked for the leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor met with Byrdsong for about a half hour last Thursday but said he had 
no indication something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're asking me to determine the extent of a problem, if there is a problem, 
and I'm not qualified to do that," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrdsong spent most of the time during Saturday's 79-65 loss in a chair off 
the end of the Northwestern bench while assistants ran the team. Twice he went 
onto the floor to argue calls and was assessed a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Byrdsong twice went into the stands and began shaking 
hands with fans. When he attempted to sit in an aisle, an usher asked him to 
return to his chair.

NORDIC SKIING PREVIEW; IT'S HAMMER TIME FOR NORWEGIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It should come as no surprise that United States athletes do not figure to 
clean up in the Nordic events during the Winter Olympics opening Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans have never been very successful in Nordic skiing -- cross-country 
and jumping -- and its spinoff, the biathlon. They have seldom threatened the 
dominating northern Europeans for whom the competition is named. 
</P>
<P>
 Only twice, in fact, since the Winter Games began in 1924, have Americans won 
Nordic medals. And in one case the athlete, Norwegian-born Anders Haugen, had 
to wait 50 years to get his bronze medal for ski jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Haugen, a naturalized American, paid his way to the first Winter Games, which 
weren't recognized as Olympics until a year after they were over, at Chamonix, 
France, in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he took his two jumps, was told he had finished fourth and went home. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1974, an error in the scoring was uncovered, showing that Haugen had 
really finished third, ahead of Norway's legendary Thorleif Haug. And so, at 
83, Haugen went to Oslo -- Norway is the birthplace of ski jumping -- to 
receive his medal in a special ceremony. There was no protest by Haug, who by 
then was 40 years dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, in the 1976 Games at Innsbruck, Austria, Bill Kochgave 
America its second Nordic medal, surprising the world and himself by finishing 
second in the men's 30-kilometer cross-country race. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch, America's one and only Nordic star, had an up-and-down career and 
developed a reputation as an innovator. He pioneered the "skating" technique 
that eventually led to the recognition of freestyle cross-country racing, as 
opposed to the skis-in-two-tracks classical style, then retired in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 He launched a comeback two years ago and made the U.S. team that went to 
Albertville, France, proclaiming that he was really aiming for the Lillehammer 
Games. At 36, though, he was no threat at Albertville, and has since dropped 
out of the picture again. 
</P>
<P>
 So, once more, American skiers will likely finish back in the pack, while the 
cross-country giants -- the Norwegians, Swedes, Finns and Russians -- look to 
the medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway, particularly, is hoping for a strong showing here, for a number of 
reasons: Cross-country skiing is the national sport; the Norwegians have the 
home-track advantage, and they did so well two years ago at Albertville. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, no Norwegian man had won an Olympic cross-country race in 16 
years, but Vegard Ulvang took the opener, the men's 30K classical, and teammate 
Bjorn Daehlie finished second. Norway was off and ski-running. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulvang and Daehlie each won three gold and one silver medals in '92 and 
continue as the 1-2 international power, although Daehlie has emerged as the 
team's star. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the U.S. men are Norwegian-born John Aalberg of Salt Lake City, and 
three Midwesterners -- Luke Bodensteiner of West Bend, Wis.; Todd Boonstra of 
Eagan, Minn., and Ben Husaby of Eden Prairie, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Kemppel of Anchorage; Kerrin Petty of Townshend, Vt., and Laura Wilson of 
Montpelier, Vt., are the best U.S. women. 
</P>
<P>
 In ski jumping, the balance of power has shifted, from Finland to Austria. 
Toni Nieminen, the Finnish teen-ager who won two golds and a bronze in '92, was 
hailed as a national hero, then let success affect him and has had competitive 
problems the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The new international standout is Austrian Andreas Goldberger, 22, the 1993 
World Cup champion. Ernst Vettori, the normal-hill gold-medalist at 
Albertville, Werner Rathmayr and Martin Hoellwarth give the Austrian team 
depth. 
</P>
<P>
 The local favorite is Norwegian Espen Bredesen, who won the large-hill 
competition in the World Championships here last year, and led Norway to the 
gold medal in the team event. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Holland of Norwich, Vt., and Randy Weber of Steamboat Springs, Colo., are 
the United States' best hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland finished 12th on the large hill and 13th on the normal hill in 
Albertville but slipped in international competition in 1993, then suffered a 
back injury in December and has been trying to regroup.  
</P>
<P>
 In Nordic combined, which pairs jumping off the normal hill with a 15K 
cross-country race, youngsters Ryan Heckman and Todd Lodwick, both of Steamboat 
Springs, are the U.S. stars, although each is a better jumper than a 
cross-country skier. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Europeans have traditionally dominated in the biathlon, which combines 
cross-country skiing with target shooting. But now the promising newcomers 
include Andreas Zingerle of Italy among the men and Myriam Bedard of Canada 
among the women. 
</P>
<P>
 The best Americans are Curt Schreiner of Day, N.Y.; R. Duncan Douglas of Lake 
Placid, N.Y., and Joan Guetschow of Minnetonka, Minn.

'SUNSET,' 'TAVERN' TOP CRITICS' NODS; THEATER: THE PLAYS EARN SEVEN NOMINATIONS 
APIECE FROM THE L.A. DRAMA CRITICS CIRCLE. SOUTH COAST REPERTORY RECEIVES 10

 The giant "Sunset Boulevard" at the Shubert Theatre and the intimate "The 
Tavern" at the Matrix Theatre received the most nominations -- seven apiece -- 
for the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle awards covering 1993 productions, it 
was announced on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory snagged more nominations, 10, than any other single 
theater company. Five different productions contributed to its nominations. 
South Coast also won a special award on the occasion of the Costa Mesa 
company's 30th birthday, and it produced the play that won this year's Ted 
Schmitt Award for outstanding world premiere to occur in Los Angeles or Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schmitt Award will go to Roger Rueff for "So Many Words," a play about a 
best-selling author and his moral responsibilities, presented at South Coast's 
Second Stage last April. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Theatre Group, whose productions at the Taper and Doolittle theaters 
dominated last year's nominations, won only eight nominations this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Resident Theatre Ensemble won the circle's Margaret Harford Award for 
continuous achievement in the small theater arena. J. Kent Inasy will receive 
the Angstrom Award for career achievement in stage lighting. And Artists 
Confronting AIDS will take home another special award for presentations that 
"memorably dramatize an urgent health-care crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Sunset Boulevard" tied "The Tavern" for the most nominations for a 
single show, "Sunset" was omitted from the list of nominees for outstanding 
production. Nominees for that award, in addition to "The Tavern," include the 
musical that preceded "Sunset Boulevard" at the Shubert, "Crazy for You" -- 
which took six nominations -- and West Coast Ensemble's revival of "Equus," 
which mustered a total of four nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other shows to win as many nominations were Pacific Resident Theatre 
Ensemble's revival of "Ondine" with five and South Coast's "Great Day in the 
Morning" with four. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners in the competitive categories will be announced next month and 
will be presented at a luncheon at Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City on April 
10. The occasion will mark the 25th anniversary of the critics' organization, 
which includes 18 critics from 12 different publications.

GELSEY KIRKLAND HANDLES IMPERFECTION, HAPPILY; TELEVISION: WITH 'L.A. LAW' 
APPEARANCE, THE FORMER 'PERFECTIONIST' BALLERINA MAKES HER ACTING DEBUT. SHE 
TAKES THE RISK IN STRIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her kiss-and-tell-all autobiography, "Dancing on My Grave," onetime ballet 
star Gelsey Kirkland painted herself as a tormented perfectionist. Published in 
1986, the book took the sheen off the pristine world of classical dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland seems much more relaxed now, as she talks of her approaching acting 
debut Thursday as a guest star on "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as you become afraid to make a fool of yourself, you're in trouble. I 
decided I may as well just see if I can live with myself making millions of 
mistakes and learn something from it," Kirkland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often, when you've reached a very high level of achievement, you almost 
become paralyzed by the idea that anything you might do might be imperfect. 
Perfection is just the striving, the effort, the struggle, but it's hard to 
remember that. . . . This was one way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as one of her generation's greatest dramatic ballerinas, Kirkland, 
41, will appear on "L.A. Law" in a non-autobiographical role as an aging, 
veteran ballerina who sues her Svengali-esque choreographer-boss for breach of 
contract: He's not casting her anymore. She dons leotard and leg warmers for 
two brief dancing scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, the diminutive dancer made her last major appearance eight years 
ago in England, where she briefly guest-starred with the Royal Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 That fall, she published her autobiography detailing her teen-age ascent to 
principal status with New York City Ballet, her subsequent coupling, on-stage 
and off, with Mikhail Baryshnikov at American Ballet Theatre, and her 
near-fatal descent into drug addiction and bulimia. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, she put out her second book, "The Shape of Love," describing the 
Royal Ballet stint during which she began teaching and coaching, work she's 
been pursuing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully choosing her words during a phone interview from a Manhattan dance 
studio, Kirkland was nonetheless affably forthcoming about her acting debut, 
noting that she had just begun acting classes when the "L.A. Law" offer came in 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, she said, the oddest part of filming was hitting the marks, as 
it's called in Hollywood: Without looking, the actor must walk to, then stop 
at, an exact spot marked on the floor in front of the camera in order to appear 
in focus and properly lit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose it's equivalent to knowing where you are on stage without looking," 
Kirkland said, but "at one point, I said, 'Do you have some sort of neon tape 
that will glow?' Of course, they came up with something for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The short time span allotted to develop her "L.A. Law" character was likewise 
disconcerting, said Kirkland, who was known for meticulously investigating the 
psychology of every Giselle or Juliet she danced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly did the best I could to fill (the character) out," she said. "But 
I really wasn't comparing it to dancing. I just concentrated on what I had to 
concentrate on, which is all you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 During her dancing days, Kirkland also was known for her combustible 
temperament, which led to fights with management, and, in her perfectionistic 
artistic quest, a fearlessness at challenging choreographers. But she showed 
"not a hint" of any of that on the set and was open to guidance, according to 
"L.A. Law" director Dennis Dugan. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's well aware of the performer-director relationship, and was very 
respectful of it," Dugan said. "She's a hard worker, and she did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland said she took up acting in the first place because she'd like to 
direct a ballet company. "The more you know in terms of theater, the more you 
have to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said she hopes the lessons will hone her coaching ability, as she 
believes today's ballet lacks "a sense of theater" or attention to dramatic 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a future on the small or silver screen, the "L.A. Law" offer was "first 
and last so far," she said with a laugh, and, while she wouldn't sniff at 
others, her more immediate concern is learning "to become a decent actress." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny because a lot of people say, 'but you already are an actress.' In 
a certain sense that's true, but with this you have another instrument you have 
to develop. . . . I didn't get to speak with my toes this time, I had to use my 
diaphragm more." 
</P>
<P>
 Making a movie or miniseries out of her books is another possibility, but 
there's "nothing definite" to report, said Kirkland, who published her third 
book, a children's story, last fall. Like the previous two, she wrote "The 
Little Ballerina and Her Horse" with her husband of almost nine years, Greg 
Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, watching herself in a rough cut of Thursday's "L.A. Law" drew the 
same reaction she always had when watching herself dance on video. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see the flaws . . . and it takes a while before you can take in the whole 
picture." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she said, it took her about seven years before she could savor the 
televised production of ABT's "Nutcracker," a holiday perennial in which she 
stars opposite Baryshnikov. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I love it, and it was wonderful when I finally started to watch it on 
Christmas and see what others saw."

HERE'S A POP RARITY: HE'S JUST PLAIN FOLK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, there's Marc Cohn and then there's. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That's been the problem when trying to name male pop-folk singer-songwriters 
who have made it big in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's finally a new name to add to the list -- Joshua Kadison. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-year-old Los Angeles native cracked the pop Top 30 with his ballad 
single, "Jessie" -- a real accomplishment for a male "folkie." This kind of 
song hardly ever gets beyond the easy-listening chart. In fact, it's rare for 
such singer-songwriters to even make it that far. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes "Jessie" so special? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a song that a lot of people can relate to," explains Kadison, who's been 
getting star treatment lately -- including a recent guest appearance on David 
Letterman's show. "Everybody's heart has been broken by somebody they'll always 
love. That's what this song is about. It taps into a feeling that's buried in 
so many people." 
</P>
<P>
 The single is on his debut album, "Painted Desert Serenade," which is full of 
pretty, sad ballads featuring Kadison's plaintive piano accompaniment. The 
album was released by SBK Records, part of the EMI Records Group, last May and 
at first got little attention -- which didn't really surprise Kadison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never expected too much in the first place," he insists. "Not too many 
people listen to this kind of music and it's so hard to get it on the radio.' 
</P>
<P>
 But "Jessie" slowly began to catch on with adult-pop radio programmers last 
summer, boosted by a spot for Kadison as the opening act on a tour by veteran 
folk-pop singer Janis Ian. Still, Kadison was dubious about any sort of 
impending success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never got my hopes up," he recalls. "I knew it could fade quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 That skepticism is odd for a pop musician, but it fits perfectly when you 
understand that Kadison practically had to be badgered into seeking a record 
deal in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never something I was consciously interested in," he says. "I was 
happy writing my music for myself. The thought of making a record was probably 
in the recesses of my mind, but it certainly wasn't an all-consuming thing. But 
my friends thought my music was good enough to record. I finally submitted a 
tape to SBK just to shut them up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's all it took -- Kadison was signed by SBK two years ago. At the time he 
was working in piano bars, something he'd done frequently since leaving home at 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy doing that and writing songs and keeping to myself," he explains. 
"I'm sort of a loner -- sort of introspective. I like solitude. I write best in 
solitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Kadison started out playing the violin when he was 7 and dabbled in other 
instruments for several years before settling on piano at 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding a chord on the piano and playing melodies felt powerful and magical 
to me," he says. "I went through a period of liking jazz. I discovered 
(singer-pianist) Nina Simone when I was 13. She just enthralled me. She opened 
up a new world for me. Writing songs and singing gradually became an integral 
part of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 A gentle, unassuming type with something of a hippie-like air, Kadison doesn't 
seem suited for the fast, glamorous life of a star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get too caught up in the glamour because it would change how I 
write," he explains. "I write from personal experience and I'd be so changed by 
the glamour thing that I wouldn't write anything worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I eat in a lot of those hip, trendy restaurants these days because of 
business, but I'd be just as happy at some dingy diner." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the pressure of business becomes overwhelming or if record sales tail 
off in the future, he says he'd have no problem leaving it all behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd find some bar on a coast somewhere and get a job playing piano," he 
replies. "I'd continue to write music for myself and be just as happy."

AN APPRECIATION; JOSEPH COTTEN: THE FILM ACTOR AND THE GENTLEMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Charles Champlin is The Times' arts 
editor emeritus. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joseph Cotten, who died Sunday at age 88 of pneumonia (although after nearly 
two decades of failing health endured and fought with great courage), brought 
off two of the most difficult feats in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult art of all, of course, is simply to survive in the top 
ranks of the profession, and he did that handily, even though in his later 
performing years he sometimes had to play (and lend dignity to) material that 
was well below his stature. 
</P>
<P>
 The other achievement, hardly less testing, is to be able to balance star 
personality and status with the demand on actors to disappear into their roles. 
Cotten was an indubitable star personality; we went to see him because he was 
Joseph Cotten. Yet, in the way of very good actors always, he submerged himself 
so thoroughly into the characters he was playing that he was convincing in a 
wide variety of roles, from very good guy to very bad guy. (His range in itself 
was an achievement not all actors can bring off, or want to.) 
</P>
<P>
 When the Los Angeles County Museum of Art honored Cotten with a retrospective 
in 1987, the 16 films shown vividly confirmed that range, from the charming and 
lethal visiting uncle in "Shadow of a Doubt" to the steadying father seeing his 
family through World War II in "Since You Went Away" to the Westerner 
contesting with Gregory Peck for the favors of Jennifer Jones in "Duel in the 
Sun," not to mention his memorable and varied visitations for and with Orson 
Welles in "Citizen Kane," "The Magnificent Ambersons" and "The Third Man." 
</P>
<P>
 I first met Cotten standing in the smoky darkness of our neighborhood in 
Pacific Palisades in 1961, as we waited to see if the Bel-Air fire would sweep 
over the last remaining crest between it and us. It didn't, but he and his 
wife, Patricia Medina, were packed for a quick getaway, Cotten with a tuxedo 
for a television shoot the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 We met again at the time of the LACMA retrospective and the publication of his 
amusing and self-chiding autobiography, "Joseph Cotten: Vanity Will Get You 
Somewhere" (Mercury House, 1987). I wrote then that Cotten "speaks and writes 
like a man who has had a ringside seat at a wonderful show in which, from time 
to time, he has played a part." 
</P>
<P>
 Just so. The courtliness of his Virginia upbringing, along with his modesty 
and a beguiling self-detachment, gave him a low-key charm that made him a fine 
companion but also lent a useful persuasiveness to his acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the low-key charm could not conceal the truth that he was indeed a serious 
actor, a professional very proud of his best work. And beneath the charm as 
well was a reservoir of uncomplaining personal courage. The medical fates had 
dealt with him severely the last years of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Awful for an actor whose voice is his living, Cotten had had to go without 
speaking for several weeks after throat surgery in the late 1970s, and in 1981 
a severe stroke silenced him again and necessitated a long period of therapy to 
regain his powers of coherent speech. He won that battle, only to lose his 
larynx to cancer a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 In their Mercury Theater days, Orson Welles had chidingly told Cotten that his 
lack of classical training would keep him from being a great actor but that 
with his good looks and charm he might make it as a star. 
</P>
<P>
 Welles was half right. Cotten became a star actor who created an impressive 
body of work, including many films that are now classics, frequently revived. 
He is thus assured of that unique immortality reserved to actors, who live 
again each time the house lights go down, their films roll and the magic begins 
once more.

 ABC News sources said Monday they are taking seriously the threat that Diane 
Sawyer could jump ship to another network, but they said they are hopeful of 
re-signing her -- albeit with a hefty pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that ABC recently has been willing to go as high as $5 million a 
year to retain the co-host of the popular "PrimeTime Live," whose contract 
expires at the end of the month.She reportedly makes about $3 million a year 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 In an article published this week in the New Yorker, media writer Ken Auletta 
reports that Sawyer has been the subject of a bidding war that includes Fox and 
CBS, with Fox said to be offering about $7 million annually for her to anchor a 
weekly newsmagazine after the network's newly acquired NFL football games this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer has been wooing Sawyer with the 
offer of a "Nightline"-style newscast at 7 p.m. That would be difficult to 
manage on the network, since that is a time slot controlled by local stations, 
but sources said Monday that what Stringer has in mind would in effect be a 
joint venture between the CBS network and a large syndicator, such as King 
World, with CBS offering clearances on its owned-and-operated stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringer, who lost Sawyer to ABC five years ago, would love to win her back. 
</P>
<P>
 However it works out, one official observed, "with negotiating leverage, Diane 
is going to be very rich" at the end of her contract negotiations.

THE ECONOMY: ADJUSTING TO NEW REALITIES; POST-BOOM BUDGET; PRESIDENT'S PACKAGE 
TURNS FOCUS TO R&D, TRAINING FOR FUTURE 
</P>

 President Clinton's budget contains a sober message to businesses in 
California and nationwide about what to expect from the federal government in 
these lean times. The handful of major government initiatives for business are 
geared to helping workers and companies find their way now that the big defense 
contracts of the 1980s are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Total federal spending for research and development would reach $71 billion in 
fiscal 1995, a rise of $2.5 billion, one of the biggest increases in any 
category of spending. Included in that is money to smooth the transition to 
increased civilian use of high-technology once used only by the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget offers money to help communities cope with military base closures. 
It also steps up spending for research that could spawn new civilian jobs and 
products from work done on aircraft, space vehicles and software for the 
defense establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the normally upbeat rhetoric typically found in every budget message, 
the President was frank about economic challenges: "Layoffs continue as a 
result of the restructuring taking place in American business and the end of 
the Cold War."  
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is this more apparent than in California. Although businesses in the 
state would benefit from a proposed increase in defense-conversion spending and 
boosts in other programs contained in the package, continued cutbacks in 
defense spending would tend to overshadow those gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeatedly, the budget comes back to the need to find uses for the skills and 
talents nurtured during the decades of booming defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "The end of the Cold War provides an opportunity to invest some defense 
industrial, technological and work force capabilities to contribute to our 
nation's economic competitiveness; those who helped us win the Cold War can 
help us compete globally," the budget document says. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-year program to spend $7 billion cuts across several federal agencies 
in an effort to make the transition to the post-Cold War era easier for 
companies, workers and communities. Lessons learned by NASA can help in 
developing improved civilian aircraft, the budget notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers and software produced by military research can be used by the 
Commerce Department in developing the so-called information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's intensive "push for information highways will create jobs 
as we extend our high-speed communications network to every classroom, clinic, 
hospital and library in America," the document says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other research and technology investments will also accelerate technological 
progress and employ scientific and technical workers -- and help to re-employ 
workers from the downsizing defense sector," it says.  
</P>
<P>
 For the majority of high school graduates who won't be attending college, the 
Administration has proposed a new program to combine classroom work with 
apprenticeship training at job sites. Two Cabinet departments -- Labor and 
Education -- would collaborate in the effort.

THE ECONOMY: ADJUSTING TO NEW REALITIES; DOW REGAINS SOME GROUND LOST IN 
PLUNGE; MARKETS: THE INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE RISES 34.90 IN THE WAKE OF FRIDAY'S 
96-POINT DECLINE. BUT THE BROAD MARKET IS WEAK.

<P>
 Blue-chip stocks Monday recouped more than a third of Friday's sharp loss, 
avoiding what some analysts had feared could mark the beginning of a sharper 
selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 But sellers still dominated in the broad market, suggesting lingering concern 
about the Federal Reserve Board's decision last week to tighten credit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 34.90 points to 3,906.32 on Monday, 
with most of the rise occurring late in the day after a sluggish start. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow had plunged 96.24 points Friday after the Fed said it was boosting the 
key federal funds rate from 3% to 3.25%, the first official interest rate hike 
by the central bank since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's increase is aimed at prolonging the economic expansion by assuring 
that the current boomlet in activity doesn't overheat and fuel inflation. But 
on Friday, many investors focused on the negative effects of higher rates -- 
fearing, for example, that more attractive money market yields will eventually 
choke off stock investment. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, however, investors returned to blue-chip industrial stocks that 
should benefit from a continuing economic expansion. Big gainers included 
General Motors, up 1 3/8 to 63; IBM, up 2 1/4 to 54 1/4, and USX-U.S. Steel, up 
1 1/4 to 43 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very good turnaround, surprisingly," said analyst Patrick Davis at Salomon 
Bros. in New York. But he added, "I think it is going to take a little while 
for the market to digest all of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most broader stock indexes closed only marginally higher Monday. The 
Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks, for example, inched up 1.92 
points to 779.20, after plummeting 20.51 points Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling stocks outnumbered winners 15 to 12 on the Nasdaq and 12 to 10 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Volume continued to be heavy but was below Friday's 
levels on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual fund giants Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group both said that 
individual investors showed little reaction to the market's tumult and that 
Monday buying and selling activity was normal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market Monday, interest rates inched up again, still responding to 
the Fed's tightening and to this week's sale of $40 billion in Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, overseas stock markets were broadly lower Monday, reacting to 
Friday dive on Wall Street. By early today in Asia, however, many foreign 
markets were climbing again. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-morning trading today, Singapore's Straits Times index was up 23.63 
points to 2,338.08, after tumbling 46.52 points on Monday. Bangkok's SET index, 
down 99 points to 1,344.81 on Monday, was up 13.41 points to 1,358.22 early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tokyo's Nikkei index, down 287.03 points Monday, jumped 387.64 points to 
20,402.04 early today as the government set long-awaited plans for a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe on Monday, Frankfurt's DAX index plunged 58.85 points to 2,079.40, 
and London's FTSE-100 index slid 56.3 points to 3,419.10. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues rebounding included DuPont, up 1 1/4 to 54 7/8; GE, up 1 
3/4 to 108 1/4; Caterpillar, up 2 3/4 to 105 1/4, and Cummins Engine, up 2 5/8 
to 53 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Metal and general mining stocks also gained. Alcoa jumped 2 to 78 1/8, 
Phelps Dodge rose 1 3/8 to 56 1/4, Reynolds Metals was up 1 3/4 to 52 1/8 and 
Inco added 3/8 to 27 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold mining stocks, however, were sharply lower as bullion prices dropped in 
profit taking. ASA sank 1 7/8 to 48 3/4, American Barrick dropped 1 to 25 3/4 
and Placer Dome tumbled 1 5/8 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among young growth stocks rebounding, America Online surged 5 3/4 to 70 1/2, 
Snapple Beverage leaped 1 7/8 to 28 1/8 and Callaway Golf gained 4 1/4 to 68 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer rocketed 3 1/8 to 36 1/2 on optimism about its upcoming 
personal computer introductions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Biotech leader Amgen shot up 2 1/8 to 44 after Salomon Bros. recommended the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telmex rebounded 1 1/4 to 74 1/4 in NYSE trading. And in Mexico City, the 
Bolsa index ignored the U.S. market's troubles for a second day. The Bolsa 
added 1.42 points to a new record 2,824.40. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields continued to edge higher, as investor nervousness over the Fed's 
rate hike failed to dissipate. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on three-month Treasury bills, which had surged from 3% to 3.28% 
last week in tandem with the Fed's credit tightening, rose to 3.30% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year T-bond yield closed at 6.39%, up from 6.35% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, traders noted that the selling pace in the market slowed somewhat. 
Also, some rise in yields would normally be expected in advance of the 
Treasury's quarterly refunding this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury will sell a total of $40 billion in new three-year, 10-year and 
30-year securities. The sale begins today with the three-year issue. The 
when-issued yield on the new three-year notes was quoted at 4.81% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the federal funds rate was quoted at 3.31%, up from Friday's 3.25%, 
the Fed's new perceived target for the rate. Fed funds is what banks charge 
each other for overnight loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold and silver prices tumbled in heavy profit taking that some traders tied 
to expectations of continued low inflation, thanks in part to the Fed's efforts 
to keep economic growth moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed "has made inflation public enemy No. 1," said Greg Drury, director of 
precious metals trading at Mitsui & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Near-term gold futures plummeted $7.70 an ounce to $378.90 on the New York 
Comex. Silver shed 18.7 cents to $5.23.

SHORT-LIVED STRIKE AGAINST UPS HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON DELIVERIES; LABOR: UNION 
CALLS OFF ITS JOB ACTION AFTER THE COMPANY COMPROMISES ON NEW WEIGHT LIMIT 
RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Teamsters union strike against United Parcel Service that threatened a major 
disruption of the nation's package delivery system ended in its first day 
Monday when the two sides agreed to ease the burden of the company's new 
package weight limit of 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The short-lived strike, which defied a federal court order, had scattered 
impact in Teamster strongholds in Seattle, New York, Boston and Pittsburgh, 
where workers walked off the job in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, UPS workers in most parts of the country, including California, 
remained on the job and service was only mildly affected, the Atlanta-based 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 300 out of about 12,000 union members at UPS operations in Southern 
California and Nevada honored the strike, said Mike Riley, president of Los 
Angeles-based Teamsters Joint Council 42. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a restraining order by the federal courts that said we had to go to 
work," Riley said. "A violation of that order could have had serious 
consequences for our members." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the company's agreement to accommodate the union on the new heavier 
packages enabled Teamsters leaders to claim victory. 
</P>
<P>
 A prolonged strike at UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, would 
have snarled a wide assortment of shipments, ranging from auto supplies to mail 
order lingerie. The privately held company handles an estimated 12 million 
packages and documents a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not enough capacity in the transportation business to fill the hole 
that a nationwide walkout against UPS would create," said Douglas Rockel, a 
transportation industry analyst at Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Teamster President Ron Carey launched the Monday morning walkout to protest 
the big jump in the weight limit, which had been 70 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 UPS said various competitors-including Federal Express -- operated under a 
150-pound limit and that hand carts and customers would help with lifting the 
heavier packages. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Teamsters said increasing the weight limit would also increase 
injuries among its 165,000 UPS members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courage of Teamster members won this agreement," Carey said in a 
statement. "No corporation has the right to break workers' backs just to make 
another buck." 
</P>
<P>
 Until a final negotiated settlement is reached, UPS and the Teamsters agreed 
that union members will be entitled to get help and appropriate equipment in 
lifting packages that weigh more than 70 pounds. Such packages must also be 
labeled by customers. 
</P>
<P>
 UPS also agreed not to discipline any of the strikers and to drop its effort 
to have the union fined and leadership held in contempt for violating the 
federal court order. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly are pleased that we're going to be back to normal" today, UPS 
spokesman Bob Kenney said. "It will be business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Some labor experts characterized the settlement as a victory for the Teamsters 
leadership, even if many locals defied the call to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen I. Schlossberg, a former deputy undersecretary of labor and a former 
general counsel of the United Auto Workers, said it is hard to persuade workers 
to strike over a single issue, particularly when they are only midway into the 
life of their contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reflects well on them that they were able to make a deal," Schlossberg 
said of the Teamsters' leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to this report were staff writers Stuart Silverstein and Greg 
Johnson and researcher Edith Stanley in The Times' Atlanta bureau.

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE ECONOMY: ADJUSTING TO NEW REALITIES; A NEW CYCLE: REAL 
ESTATE UP, MUTUALS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new phase has begun in the economy and financial markets, and an age of 
disinflation and declining interest rates that began with Ronald Reagan in 1981 
and continued through Bill Clinton's first year in office is now over. 
</P>
<P>
 The next phase could see a drop in stock and bond prices but an expansion of 
jobs, public investment in education, police and fire departments, as well as 
business investment in plants and equipment. Indeed, business investment has 
already accelerated -- orders in 1993 for heavy industrial equipment rose 12% 
and increased 28% for computers and other information technology -- according 
to the latest government figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, the new era may not be inflationary, but interest rates will 
rise with economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect is for increases in real estate prices but declines in prices for 
financial assets -- stocks and bonds. In a nutshell, your house may go up but 
your mutual fund may go down. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the considered judgment of sophisticated investment people and 
economists from many sides of the philosophical and political spectrum Monday, 
despite the stock market's rebound from Friday's steep fall in prices. 
</P>
<P>
 That fall was not a fluke but an alarm bell, says Stanley Salvigsen of 
Comstock Partners, an investment firm based in Jersey City, N.J. Salvigsen is 
known for accurate predictions over the last decade that inflated oil, farmland 
and real estate prices would decline. Now, he says, stocks will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "In recent years, stock prices have been rising two to three times faster than 
the economy, and that can't continue," Salvigsen says. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's important to note that Salvigsen, and other investment seers, don't 
see business and corporate profits declining along with stock prices. On the 
contrary, the dominant scenario is that the economy will pick up steam, helped 
by federal policy. 
</P>
<P>
 A change in direction is perceived. Byron Wien, investment strategist for 
Morgan Stanley, titles his weekly analysis "The End of Disinflation." James 
Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, has been saying for months 
that the economy has entered a new cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policies of the federal government toward taxes and interest rates have 
changed, and that strongly influences returns on investment," says John 
Rutledge, head of Rutledge & Co., an investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Through 1993, the policy of the Clinton Administration was to hold down 
interest rates, but now it has "tilted" toward encouraging jobs and tolerating 
some rise in rates. Last Friday's action by the Federal Reserve Board to lift 
the short-term federal funds rate a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.25%, 
was seen as the first of many increases. 
</P>
<P>
 That reading of Administration policy is correct, says economist James Medoff 
of Harvard University, who last month provided analysis of America's job 
picture to Clinton and the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is a lack of demand for workers, says Medoff, leaving unemployment 
and underemployment higher and more widespread in this economic recovery than 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs are not being created in sufficient number at a time when government 
policy most needs them. If Clinton is going to get people off welfare, he needs 
an active economy to provide jobs for them to go to; if he is going to step up 
education and training to equip high school graduates for a competitive world 
economy, he needs an abundance of jobs for the trainees to graduate into. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining interest rates didn't swell the job rolls. As a result of low rates, 
money flowed into the stock market, observes Rutledge, who served in the Reagan 
Administration, and that set up a distorted situation in which corporate 
managers could lift the company stock price by cutting workers and expenses 
more easily than by expanding the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Money also flowed abroad in search of higher returns: Mutual funds, pension 
funds and corporate treasurers invested $32 billion more overseas than 
foreigners invested here in 1992, the latest year for which complete figures 
are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Clinton Administration wants to reverse the trend. There is a 
provision in Clinton's budget for job centers nationwide, where unemployed 
workers can not only file for benefits but also get counseling on jobs in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the budget's constraints, there will be a new emphasis on public 
investment in labor-intensive activities. "Spending on public safety is good 
because jobs for cops are better and higher-paying than retail clerk jobs," 
Medoff says. The same goes for spending on fire departments and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly perhaps, there is little fear of renewed high inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 If business people pull money out of the stock market and invest in expanding 
their businesses, that should be productive, not inflationary, notes Salvigsen. 
</P>
<P>
 And with so little demand for workers, there is no pressure on wages, Medoff 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 And with just about every U.S. business now open to competitive world markets, 
there is no room for price hikes or cost inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet interest rates will rise with economic activity. And it is logical that 
stock prices, which have risen with interruptions since 1982 on expectations of 
falling rates, would now decline. The least you can say is that stock prices 
and price-to-earnings ratios won't expand from here, investment experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are stocks won't fall dramatically. But smart investors know that a 
time of change demands new thinking.

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has unveiled his budget for fiscal 1995 as part of a 
long-term program that aims to restrain spending and cut the deficit. Here are 
some of the budget highlights for business and investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wall Street: Increases fees by $375 million a year on stock trades, 
registration statements, mergers and tender offers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense conversion: Allocates $195 million for displaced defense workers and 
$140 million for communities hurt by military base closures or contract 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pensions: Seeks an increase of $1.6 billion over five years in the amount of 
payments by companies with underfunded pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology: Spends $7 billion in the next five years to develop civilian 
high-tech products. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchasing: Simplifies procedures for obtaining federal contracts worth up 
to $100,000 instead of $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Taxes: Seeks a law that would allow the IRS to use private collection 
agencies to track down delinquent taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Job training: Spends $300 million to give students on-the-job training while 
still in school. 
</P>

RATE STUDY MAY SPUR TOUGHER CABLE RULES; TELEVISION: FCC REPORT INDICATES FEES 
HAVE RISEN FOR 30% OF PEOPLE SERVED BY NATION'S 25 BIGGEST OPERATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A soon-to-be-released government study showing that cable television rates are 
still rising for millions of subscribers is providing ammunition for federal 
regulators to impose tougher pricing rules on the nation's 11,000 cable 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary results from a study by the Federal Communications Commission 
indicate that 10 months of federal cable rate regulation have actually caused 
monthly fees to climb for 30% of the customers of the nation's 25 largest cable 
operators. Rates fell for the other 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 30% is a little more than Congress or the FCC intended," FCC 
Commissioner James Quello said. "I think there will be more action taken to 
lower rates and give the consumer some relief." 
</P>
<P>
 That could complicate ambitious plans announced by many cable companies, such 
as Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner Inc., to spend billions of dollars 
to replace their copper wires with higher-capacity fiber-optic cable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you want to take harsh action that would have a chilling effect 
on the kinds of major investments this industry can make in building the 
information superhighway," said Torie Clarke, a vice president of the National 
Cable Television Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics scoffed at such industry warnings. One FCC official asked, "Does 
that mean we should also let the phone companies charge an unregulated monopoly 
price because they want to get into the information highway business too?" 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about escalating rates and poor service, Congress passed the cable 
act with the intent of mandating improvements in service, lowering prices and 
fostering more competition. When the FCC announced a rollback of cable rates 
last April -- mandated by the cable act -- the agency said its goal was to cut 
cable bills an average of 10% and save consumers $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the failure of the law to lower rates for everyone has led to an uproar 
among consumer groups and congressional calls for tougher enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people voted for the cable act, they weren't voting for 30% of cable 
subscribers to have a rate increase," Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chairman 
of the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee, said through a 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said FCC officials are studying whether to change the so-called 
benchmark rate from which cable operators must base their pricing. Consumer 
groups contend that this rate -- based on prevailing rates charged by cable 
operators in 1992 -- was not set low enough to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a concession to small cable operators, who have long complained that 
they have higher costs, the FCC is considering granting more pricing 
flexibility to operators serving only a few thousand subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, agency sources indicated that the FCC will extend the current 
freeze on cable revenue increases beyond a Feb. 15 deadline. They said the move 
will ensure that prices will not rise during the period before new cable rate 
rules could take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics of cable regulation will present a key test for Reed Hundt, who 
took over as FCC chairman in December. Hundt, a close friend of Vice President 
Al Gore, has a reputation as an aggressive regulator. FCC officials close to 
Hundt said they don't believe FCC rules have financially hurt cable companies 
at all. One official noted that only five cable companies have asked for a 
waiver of federal pricing regulation on the grounds that the rules would cause 
them economic harm. 
</P>
<P>
 The intricate cable rate rules have stirred as much consumer ire against the 
new rules as they have against cable companies, according to a new Louis Harris 
poll conducted for the National Consumers League. The survey of subscribers 
found that 50% reported their rates had gone up since Sept. 1, and more blamed 
it on the new law than on the cable operators.

SEGA SEEKS TO CAPTURE TECHNO TOY MARKET FOR YOUNGSTERS; TECHNOLOGY: THE VIDEO 
GAME GIANT'S FLAGSHIP PRODUCT IS A $160 COMPUTER DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN AS YOUNG 
AS 3. 
</P>

<P>
 Sega of America Inc., the video game giant that has won the hearts and minds 
of many a youngster with its hip image and popular games, is expected this week 
to launch a line of high-tech toys for children and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 By developing and marketing products unrelated to video games for the first 
time since it entered the U.S. market in 1986, Sega hopes to capture a niche 
largely ignored by traditional toy makers as American children's appetite for 
techno toys continues to amaze their often less technologically inclined 
parents.  
</P>
<P>
 Sega Chief Executive Tom Kalinske, himself a former executive at toy maker 
Mattel, said the company expects to generate $50 million in revenue from the 
new products this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our analysis of the industry is that most of the toy companies are avoiding 
high-tech," Kalinske said. "We don't intend to compete with Mattel or Hasbro. 
But we have the R&D capability, and for us, this is a logical way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The flagship product, designed for children as young as 3 years old and 
expected to cost $160, is essentially a simplified computer, with rounded 
edges, a fat stylus instead of a mouse and a storybook-shaped electronic 
drawing pad. 
</P>
<P>
 When the storybook is plugged into the "Pico" -- which runs on a Motorola 
microprocessor -- the screen is activated, and children can interact with a 
variety of early math, reading, spelling and drawing activities. Kalinske said 
both Disney and Paramount plan to develop educational software for the product. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The toy resulted from research showing that while parents may want to 
introduce their children to computers at an early age, they are reluctant to 
subject such costly equipment to the sort of abuse that can come from 
preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when Sega has been criticized for allowing excessive violence in its 
video games, the new Pico may boost the company's image -- while providing it 
with a way to hook into the growing educational software market. But analysts 
say the success of such a product will depend on how easy and intuitive it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could open up a whole new market for personal computers," new-media 
analyst Denise Caruso said. "If they can run rudimentary educational and 
entertainment software on that box that's kids-oriented, that could be a 
massive seller. But . . . you have to make it very, very basic." 
</P>
<P>
 Other products in the new Sega line include an electronic comic book and a 
"personal digital assistant for teen-agers" -- a hand-held device that serves 
as an electronic address book and also allows the user to beam messages via 
infrared transmission to friends on the other side of the room.

U.S. AUTO VALUES HOLD UP BETTER THAN EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rising resale values of American cars are challenging the superior reputation 
of Japanese cars in holding their value, a new study of automobile leasing 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis by Salomon Bros. analyst Jack Kirnan helped to substantiate other 
evidence that American cars are improving in quality.Although Japanese vehicle 
resale value is generally higher, the Americans are catching up. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirnan said demand for low-mileage, late-model used cars and resale values 
higher than estimated when the car was leased the first time also mean that the 
U.S. auto makers make more money per vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 When applied across a broader spectrum of vehicles, Kirnan's study says this 
means resale values of American cars are increasing faster than those of 
Japanese cars. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. auto makers would not comment on leases, but they said the actual resale 
value of these cars is higher than what standard industry measuring sticks say.

JAPAN'S CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS HIT RECORD $131.35 BILLION IN '93 
</P>

<P>
 Japan's current account surplus ballooned 12% in 1993 to a record $131.35 
billion, the Finance Ministry announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The current account is a broad measure of a nation's international financial 
flows and includes merchandise trade, services and tourism.The surplus grew 
from $117.55 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's huge trade surplus continues to be a source of tension between Japan 
and its trading partners. The United States in particular has expressed 
frustration over the lack of progress in trade talks aimed chiefly at creating 
greater access to Japan's markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In dollar terms, both imports and exports rose in 1993 as Japan's economy 
faltered into recession. Imports grew 5.7% to $209.85 billion, while exports 
swelled 6.2% to $351.28 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 When expressed in yen, however, the current account surplus fell 2.0%, the 
ministry said. In 1992, it had jumped 53%. 
</P>
<P>
 The yen's appreciation during the past year has inflated dollar-denominated 
trade figures.

230,000 claims for residential and commercial damage. The estimate does not 
include the far greater cost of destruction to uninsured property, including 
publicly owned infrastructure. Total damage from the earthquake has been 
estimated at as much as $30 billion.

 Consumer Borrowing Up: December holiday shopping helped fuel a late-year surge 
in credit expansion, and consumer borrowing climbed at an 11.2% annual rate 
that month, following a revised 10.7% increase in November, according to the 
Federal Reserve Board. The November increase was originally estimated at 10.6%. 
The increase, the seventh in a row, brought outstanding debt to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of $789.8 billion.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: TASTE OF CHILDHOOD; FOOD MAKERS ZEROING IN ON YOUNG 
PALATES 
</P>

 When a single piece of broccoli is tossed into an otherwise innocuous bowl of 
chopped lettuce, what's left is nothing short of a sabotaged salad. Just ask 
any salad-wise kid. 
</P>
<P>
 But give that same kid a chance to decide what gets glopped onto the lettuce 
-- a pizza-flavored dressing, say -- and suddenly that salad has a prayer of 
passing the kid test. Just ask any kid-wise marketer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mounting battle for the estimated $132 billion in annual product 
purchases that children influence, the country's big food makers are trying to 
entice youngsters to nag their folks for groceries that few kids have cared 
much about -- such as salad dressings, yogurt and luncheon meats. The rub is 
that some marketers are accomplishing this by adding ingredients that kids love 
but which few parents want their children to eat: sugar, fat and salt. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, cereal makers have tried this kids-directed marketing with great 
success, but now it's fast-descending to foods rarely targeted to children. Yet 
there are trade-offs. While the pizza and nacho-cheese-flavored salad dressings 
are fatty, they can coax kids into eating more salad. Several big yogurt makers 
are adding colorful, sugary toppings -- packaged separately and displayed so 
kids can't miss them -- in order to get children to at least consider 
swallowing yogurt. And to attract kids to its newest "lunch kit" of sliced 
meats and cheeses, one food firm recently began slipping in very visible 
packets of candy. 
</P>
<P>
 The food giants say they are simply selling quality products that appeal to 
children. But some marketing experts believe that the food makers may be taking 
the low road to profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can turn anything into a junk food if you work on it," said Alex Molnar, 
professor of education at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. "All these 
marketers ask themselves is this: 'Will it sell?' I'm still waiting for one to 
come out with chocolate-covered broccoli." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, all of this comes when many food companies are increasingly making 
healthier foods for grown-ups who are concerned about more fiber and less fat 
in their diets. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have are food products getting healthier for adults but less healthy 
for kids," said Jayne Hurley, nutritionist at the Washington-based Center for 
Science in the Public Interest. "I don't know why the trend toward healthier 
eating has excluded kids." 
</P>
<P>
 It is one thing to try to attract children by putting cartoon characters on 
the product label, "but if you're making a product less nutritional in order to 
sell it to kids, I call that manipulation," said Dan Acuff, president of 
Glendale-based Youth Market Systems Consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies marketing the new products say they are merely selling what 
consumers tell them they want. 
</P>
<P>
 The maker of the new salad dressings, Hidden Valley Ranch, retained a youth 
marketing expert who went to shopping malls in four cities -- including Los 
Angeles -- and asked 300 children and parents their opinions on salads. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, Hidden Valley, a division of Clorox Co., set up a huge salad 
bar in front of 200 students at a San Francisco elementary school to see which 
of its new dressing flavors -- pizza, nacho cheese or taco -- kids preferred. 
On that day, Pizza Ranch reigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Admitted Kenneth Phan, an 11-year-old who was very careful to keep any trace 
of cabbage out of his salad bowl oozing with dressing: "I like the dressing 
more than the salad." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the high fat content of its new dressings -- some 90% of the calories 
come from fat, according to the label -- executives at Hidden Valley say that's 
beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They encourage kids to eat more salads and vegetables," said Sandy Sullivan, 
brand manager at Hidden Valley, whose new dressings begin national distribution 
this month. "Besides, kids need a certain amount of fat in their diets." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about the high fat content of the dressings, Samuel Gidding, a 
pediatric cardiologist at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, suggests 
that children use only one tablespoon instead of the recommended two per 
serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Some food makers are using packaging as a way to attract kids to products they 
might not otherwise consider eating. Several yogurt makers are attempting that 
by packaging sugary toppings in see-through containers atop the carton. Among 
the most successful is Dannon's, with its Sprinkl'ins brand yogurt with 
rainbow-colored sugar sprinkles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great way to get kids who would not eat yogurt to at least try it," 
said Diana Allwein, associate product manager at Dannon, who said the yogurt is 
aimed primarily at children 6 to 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the added sugar, the company says that's no big deal. "Four grams of 
sugar per package isn't all that much," said Becky Ryan, a Dannon spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Gidding, who also serves on the American Heart Assn.'s nutrition committee, 
said it's far better to add fruit than sugar to yogurt. Most important, he 
said, is to eat low-fat yogurt. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Executives at Oscar Mayer Foods recently decided their "Lunchable Funpacks" -- 
featuring separately wrapped meats, cheeses and crackers -- weren't attracting 
enough business. So they decided to add M&Ms candy. Sales have picked up 
steadily since then, company executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 Gidding has serious reservations about the Lunchables: "It sounds like a 
nutritional disaster," primarily because of the high fat and high salt content, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Mayer executives scoff at that notion. "This is not some big corporate 
plot to fatten up kids. This is what kids want," company spokeswoman Jean 
Cowden said. "There are very few kids out there who will eat rice cakes and 
tofu." Briefly . . .

 Earnings: Time Warner Inc. eked out its first earnings per share since the 
1989 merger that created it, reflecting growth in three of its five businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based entertainment and publishing giant reported fourth-quarter 
net income of $7 million, or 1 cent a share, contrasted with a loss of $93 
million, or 25 cents, a year earlier.Revenue rose 9.6% to $4.12 billion, from 
$3.78 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company has posted net income for five quarters since the merger 
took effect in the first period of 1990, those earnings were wiped out in the 
per-share figures after the payment of preferred dividends. The latest quarter 
was "the best single quarter in the history of Time Warner Inc.," Chairman 
Gerald Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishing, Warner Music Group and theme parks were up; cable and filmed 
entertainment were down. Time Warner's earnings beat the mean estimate of 18 
analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for a loss of 1 cent a share. The 
company's stock gained 12.5 cents a share, closing at $39.75 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner "has made impressive progress in improving their cash flow, 
restructuring their balance sheet and reducing their debt," analyst Alvin 
Mirman of Gruntal & Co. said. "The company is poised for significant growth 
over the next couple of years."

INSIDER TO HEAD DISNEY'S HOLLYWOOD LABEL; MUSIC: THE PROMOTION OF BOB PFEIFER 
IS SEEN BY SOME AS AN INTERIM STEP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of speculation that it would recruit a big-name executive, Walt 
Disney Co. on Monday named a little-known insider to run its languishing 
Hollywood Records unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion of Bob Pfeifer, a former Epic Records executive who has been 
vice president of artists and repertoire at Hollywood since August, is widely 
viewed in the industry as an interim step. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pfeifer shrugged off that suggestion, saying, "I'm running the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Two apsects of Disney's announcement are unusual: Pfeifer's title is merely 
executive vice president, not president of the label, and the company said he 
succeeds former Executive Vice President Wesley Hein rather than Peter Paterno, 
who ran the label as president until last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfeifer said he cannot explain the title discrepancy, but he reiterated that 
he is running the show and said he plans to develop an artists-driven label. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives speculated that the move allows Disney to let Pfeifer 
prove himself while keeping its options open if a better-known executive 
becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives who have worked with Pfeifer said he has good relationships with 
artists, which they attribute in part to his background as a recording artist 
himself. They also credit him with strong creative skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pfeifer: "This is a label run by a musician, which is attractive to 
musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney previously was rumored to be in discussions with some of the industry's 
top executives, including Warner Bros. Records Chairman Mo Ostin. 
</P>
<P>
 One music executive said Disney "put a full court press on Mo" before Ostin 
chose to extend his contract with Warner. Other executives who had been in the 
running include former Capitol chief Hale Milgrim. 
</P>
<P>
 Music executives expressed surprise at Disney's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ain't a Mo," said one. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suggested that Disney is taking a safe route, with little or no 
downside if Pfeifer doesn't work out. "They don't want to be a laughingstock 
twice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Disney President Frank G. Wells said Pfeifer, 38, has "proved 
himself capable of leading Hollywood Records to a strong position in the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's started the company in 1989, choosing the start-up route rather than 
buying an existing company. But Hollywood Records so far has had little impact 
on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has failed to consistently "break" new artists. It also suffered 
from an embarrassing episode in 1991, when a memo leaked out in which Paterno 
trashed his competitors, referred to Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner as "Mr. 
Natural" and acknowledged that the company would lose $25 million that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists signed to the label who proved to be disappointments include Liza 
Minnelli and teen group The Party. Its main success came from revived interest 
in the British group Queen and sales from the "Sister Act" soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood has the soundtrack for the Disney film "The Three Musketeers" 
domestically, which includes the top-selling single "All for Love" sung by 
Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and Sting. Pfeifer said the album has sold about 
250,000 copies, but some industry sources believe it should be doing better. 
Pfeifer said the album should get a boost if the song receives an Oscar 
nomination this week. 
</P>
<P>
 At Epic, Pfeifer was responsible for signing Alice Cooper, Screaming Trees, 
Ornette Coleman, Sepultura and Eve's Plum. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe Pfeifer will try to build Hollywood in the way Interscope Records 
was built -- on the strength of cutting-edge acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've spent a lot of money one way or another, but they've signed the wrong 
acts for whatever reason," industry lawyer Jay Cooper said. "They've certainly 
got more resources than Interscope to put to it."

LET SEN. ROBERTI FINISH HIS JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * State Sen. David Roberti served in the 20th District for just over one year. 
In that time he brought more attention and representation to the district than 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 He addressed the issues affecting the Los Angeles Unified School District 
because parents in the district asked and because the Valley as a whole lost a 
seat on the board. He created a small-business advisory commission that helped 
to secure passage of workers' compensation reform. He fought for equitable and 
low-income housing. He forced the state budget to be passed on time, appointed 
people from his district to statewide commissions and maintained a professional 
course of action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roberti recall initiative is all about revenge and guns, nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponents have displayed a reckless abuse of our political system. All 
their rhetoric about Roberti's political record is just smoke and mirrors. As 
they themselves have said, they are out for revenge, not justice or what is 
right and good for the 20th District. They are angry because they cannot own an 
AK-47. They blame Roberti and want to scare other "political leaders" away from 
following Roberti's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 We need safer streets and an effective political leadership to revitalize the 
state's economy. Political leaders must draw upon their expertise and talent to 
make things happen; vengeance in the form of a recall only promotes political 
gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that voters in the 20th District will join me in exercising their 
rights at the polls and send a message to the gun lobby that responsible people 
do not act this way. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti has helped the 20th District and the state. Let him finish his job.

COYOTES ENDANGER PETS AND CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was deeply disturbed by a letter published Jan. 9 regarding coyote 
trapping. It asserted that it is the responsibility of parents and pet owners, 
not the city, to protect their pets and small children.It implies that the 
hundreds of us who have lost pets or have had their children stalked in the San 
Fernando Valley since the ban are irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 In most of these instances the pets were fenced in, and many of the attacks 
took place in daylight in a densely populated residential area that has existed 
for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 9 at 2:45 p.m., my son Thayer was six feet away from being attacked by 
a coyote in his own back yard despite the fact that the yard is fenced and 
despite the fact that he was being watched by not one but two adults. Michael 
Bell of the Wildlife Protection League has stated that there are no documented 
cases of coyotes attacking humans. In fact, volumes of such documentation 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been claimed that the homeowners are trying to wipe out the whole 
coyote population, when in fact all we are seeking is the trapping of coyotes 
that are creating an imminent danger to our pets and children. 
</P>
<P>
 The coyote is not an endangered species. Statistically the coyote runs less 
risk of meeting an untimely death than does a child in the city of Los Angeles. 
It appears that the commission and groups such as Mr. Bell's, in their zeal to 
be "humane," have lost all sense of humanity.

FEWER GUNS WOULD MEAN LESS CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In a Jan. 4 letter ("Banning Guns Gives Thugs the Advantage"), William O. 
Felsman showed that his gift for rhetoric exceeds his knowledge. Felsman cannot 
see the logic of calling for tighter restrictions on guns after the shooting of 
a high school student. "What's the connection?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 I will explain the connection in simple terms. If we were to impose stricter 
controls on guns, they would be less available and fewer problems would arise. 
Many people argue that criminals obtain their guns illegally, but they ignore 
the fact that many -- perhaps most -- of those guns were once legally owned, 
then were stolen. That is how criminals obtain guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Felsman suggests that banning guns would benefit only criminals. If this is 
the case, why do countries with outright bans or near bans on handguns have 
significantly lower crime rates? 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of gun control like to point to the high murder rate in Washington as 
an example of the failure of gun control. In reality, a study published in the 
Dec. 5, 1991, New England Journal of Medicine reported that the crime declined 
after strict gun control was enacted in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years after the 1976 law was passed, gun-related homicides and suicides 
both declined by about one-fourth (use of other weapons for suicide or homicide 
showed no significant change), while the same figures remained relatively 
unchanged in surrounding areas. Also, the study indicated that homicide and 
suicide rates dropped immediately upon enactment of strict gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if one can ignore the decreases in crime associated with decreased gun 
ownership, private gun ownership causes other problems. Can Felsman deny that 
accidental deaths by handguns would decline if handguns were not easily 
available? And what about the "crimes of passion" where someone gets shot in a 
domestic dispute? Most shooting victims are shot by someone they know, not the 
roving "bands of thugs" to which Felsman refers. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is this: Tighter restrictions on handguns, even to the point 
of outright bans, reduce deaths. We should ban ownership of firearms except for 
use in a well-organized militia, as specified by the 2nd Amendment.

CHARTS WERE WRONG ABOUT RACIAL GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your pie charts on foreign-born residents on pages A1 and A45 (Dec. 19) have 
a gross terminology error.There are three racial categories (black, Asian and 
white), but then there is another category (Latino) which in fact is almost 
entirely a sub-category of the "white" racial group. 
</P>
<P>
 By showing the pie chart the way it is, the impression is left that Latinos 
are some other race. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd strongly suggest changing the categories to include "Latino" and 
"non-Latino white" (or "other white").

CANOGA PARK SHOULD ABSORB WINNETKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Dec. 22 Valley section had a map of the San Fernando Valley on page B2. 
Bordered by Woodland Hills on the south, Canoga Park on the west, Northridge on 
the north and Reseda on the east is the nonentity Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that I can see its boundaries clearly, I find that I live in Winnetka. In 
the 39 years that I have lived in my house south of Vanowen Street, east of De 
Soto Avenue, north of Victory Boulevard and west of Mason Avenue, I have 
thought I lived in Canoga Park. The mailing address has always been Canoga 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 I have tried to figure out why there is a Winnetka. I don't think that anyone 
knows. Since West Hills took a large part of Canoga Park, I can see no reason 
why Canoga Park shouldn't absorb Winnetka. No one knows it is there anyway.

FIRE DISPATCHERS ALSO DESERVE CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * All the media hype regarding the firefighting personnel during the recent 
brush fires in Southern California has gotten my fellow Fire Department 
dispatchers all over the state, including myself, somewhat disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong. They deserve it, and I tip my headset to all of the fire 
suppression personnel who were on the scene of these conflagrations, giving 
their all. But I'd like to point out that there was more to that effort than 
most people know. I'm talking about fire dispatchers. We were there to answer 
the call. And believe me there were many! 
</P>
<P>
 We were the ones that sent out these brave firefighters to fight these fires. 
We were the ones who coordinated this massive movement of fire equipment and 
personnel. We were the ones that worried about them until they returned home. 
We were the ones who had to explain . . . why the Fire Department was not there 
to stop the flames that were within feet of their homes, while the caller 
yelled, cried and cursed us. We were the ones who were left to deal with the 
day-to-day operations with as little as 25%, sometimes less, of our normal 
equipment and manpower because everyone else was on the line at Thousand Oaks, 
and then Altadena, and then Malibu . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We routinely get overlooked -- i.e., we'll get the call of a person not 
breathing, we'll give the informant instructions on how to do CPR until the 
Fire Department and paramedics get there (which is not an easy task in itself), 
the instructions result in saving the patient and who do you think gets the 
thank-you cards, the letters, the pat on the back -- the firefighters and the 
paramedics do. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighting, and all that goes with it, is a team effort. And Fire Department 
dispatchers are part of the team. All we want is a little respect and some 
credit for what we do.

STUDENT DEFENDS SELF-DEFENSE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * My photograph was on the front page of the Los Angeles Times because I took 
a self-defense class with the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought it was a great way to learn how to defend yourself.I learned that 
you could set boundaries for yourself if people were too close. I learned 
targets on the body that could injure a person who was trying to do a bad thing 
to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I think other kids should take this class because they should learn how to 
defend themselves. I think my parents were right to send me and my brother to 
this class. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the Los Angeles Times people who wrote the article should have been 
there longer to see what the class really taught kids.

SMALL EFFORT COULD CURB TRASH PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I found the Valley Focus story by Jeff Schnaufer "Merchants Adopting 
Boulevard Medians," (Dec. 28) sad. 
</P>
<P>
 Sad because of the lack of funds enabling the city to perform the task of 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel there is no excuse for trashing any area. People should pick up after 
themselves. With this small effort, the cities could handle eroding maintenance 
at a minimum cost. 
</P>
<P>
 I appreciate all the merchants' efforts to keep streets from unsightly clutter 
and graffiti. This effort truly reflects an owner's care and pride in the 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 I bypass an unkempt area every time. I look for clean surroundings when I 
shop.

THE AGE OF NIP AND TUCK; PEOPLE HAVE LONG GONE UNDER THE KNIFE TO TRY TO UNDO 
THE EFFECTS OF TIME AND GRAVITY. TYPICALLY, THEY WERE IN THEIR 50S AND 60S. 
NOW, THIRTYSOMETHINGS -- AND -- YOUNGER -- ARE GOING FOR FACE LIFTS, COLLAGEN 
INJECTIONS AND CHEEK IMPLANTS.

 Vanessa was tired of looking old and tired. Staring into the mirror at the 
dark bags under her eyes, she'd place her fingers over the half-moons and 
think, "I'd feel so much better if I didn't have these." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she did something about them. At 34, Vanessa, who requested 
anonymity, had the saggy skin tightened up. 
</P>
<P>
 Having plastic surgery at that age is hardly a shock. But having it at that 
age to look younger is a bit of one. Although surgeons note that 
fortysomethings and under aren't exactly rushing en masse to demand 
appointments, facial rejuvenation surgery, as it's known in the trade, is 
becoming increasingly popular with younger women and men. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 30- to 45-year-old who comes to see me doesn't look old but kind of looks 
weathevr-beaten by being in the sun," says Dr. Michael Niccole, medical 
director of CosmetiCare Plastic Surgery Specialists in Santa Ana and Long 
Beach. "They don't want to look younger, but refreshed, and they want to feel 
good about themselves. It doesn't matter what age you are. If intervention and 
enhancement will build self-image, they want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Dr. Dennis P. Thompson, president of the Los Angeles Society of Plastic 
Surgeons, "I've been in practice for 20 years, and I'm definitely seeing 
patients coming in at a younger age. The average patient when I started my 
practice 20 years ago was a woman in her late 50s or early 60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says his typical facial rejuvenation candidate is 10 to 15 years 
younger. Still, such patients make up "probably less than 5% of the average 
plastic surgeon's practice." 
</P>
<P>
 What do they want? Major and minor procedures, including face lifts, eye 
surgery to lift droopy lids or saggy under-eyes, liposuction to erase double 
chins, removal of fat from chubby cheeks, forehead lifts, collagen injections, 
cheek implants and chemical peels. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems as if our fascination with youth culture is growing, so much so that 
men and women still in or barely out of their 30s are looking for ways to put 
off the natural signs of aging. Plastic surgeons, aestheticians, patients and 
psychologists offer a variety of reasons for the downward curve, from cultural 
pressures to the greater acceptance of plastic surgery, to gaining an edge in 
the youth-tilted job market, to being more attractive date bait, to "Roseanne 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to ask the patient why they want to have the surgery," Thompson 
says. "Somebody can have way-out reasons at 55 or 35. I could say, 'I've got an 
operation that I think will improve your appearance, and there's a good 
risk-benefit ratio.' If someone who's 35 comes to me and says, 'Look at these 
heavy jowls,' and I don't see anything, I'll tell them I don't have an 
operation to prevent them." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone who comes through a surgeon's door merits surgery, doctors say, 
but age isn't usually a disqualifying factor. More important is whether the 
surgeon believes he or she can markedly improve a patient's appearance, and 
whether the patient has reasonable expectations about the outcome. One plastic 
surgeon said he had done an eye lift on an 18-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Frileck, a Brentwood-based plastic surgeon, says he sees more younger 
patients these days, including more men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having plastic surgery earlier to forestall the need for (it) later on is 
something that makes sense to people," he says. "The whole idea of rejuvenation 
surgery is to do it (at a time when) you actually need it, and . . . at a time 
(when) you tend to hold your appearance longer, while those around you are 
aging rapidly. So you look like you've made a pact with the devil. The people 
who are coming in have bought that rationale, understand it, agree with it, and 
that's what they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Niccole, a board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeon, recommends that 
patients be sure their doctor is reputable before undergoing the procedure. 
"It's sad, but in medicine it's buyer beware," he says. "Do your homework." 
</P>
<P>
 Patients should get more than one opinion and ask for patient references and 
photographs of the doctor's work, he says. The doctor should also have 
considerable experience performing the procedure in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients should also seek doctors who are board certified to ensure that they 
have had an additional six to eight years of training in plastic surgery than 
is required. The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons ((800) 
635-0635) gives callers a list of five board-certified plastic surgeons in a 
region. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Having a face or eye lift at 37 doesn't preclude the need for more nips and 
tucks down the road. The skin's elasticity, as well such factors as sun 
exposure, determine how long a procedure lasts. As one surgeon put it: 
"Gravity's working from the minute we take the last stitch out." 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa, who works as an office manager in Los Angeles, went to her surgeon to 
talk about having liposuction on her stomach. When she mentioned how much her 
eyes -- a legacy from her father -- bothered her, the doctor said he could 
excise the saggy skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I had it done (last June), I thought it was great, that I looked much, 
much younger," she says. "For a long time (before the surgery), I'd look in the 
mirror and think, 'I haven't had enough sleep,' and then I realized that after 
two years I still hadn't had enough sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Staring into the mirror and seeing Mom or Dad staring back -- complete with a 
deeply creased forehead or sagging eyelids -- has driven more than a few people 
to the surgeon's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times people will have a family tree that will include a double 
chin," says Dr. Malcolm Lesavoy, professor of plastic surgery at UCLA and chief 
of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. "Now 
liposuction in some younger patients, who have resilient and elastic skin, can 
help very much by reducing the amount of fat (without) having to have a formal 
face lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that people are having more sagging skin at an earlier age," he 
adds, "but more patients at an earlier age are thinking about it. . . . There's 
nothing whatsoever wrong with looking 40. I'm not so sure the bottom line is 
that (people who merit surgery and have it) will actually look younger. It's 
not like they're going to look 18. If they look tired and haggard, they'll 
still look 40 (after surgery), but they'll look better." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the younger rejuvenation patients simply consider age a disease they 
can prevent. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades ago, 40-year-olds were well entrenched in careers and family; today, 
they're changing careers and starting families, says Wanda von Kleist, a Los 
Angeles- and Chicago-based psychologist and lecturer. Armed with copious 
information on the evils of cholesterol, fat, alcohol and tobacco, and the 
benefits of exercise, the baby boomers are light-years ahead of their parents 
in terms of self-improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the psychology of aging, the things that make people feel 
young are excitement for life, flexibility in the body and the mind, muscle 
strength, stamina, and feeling fit physically and mentally," Von Kleist says. 
"But there are people who really buy into the idea that plastic surgery is the 
only way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Images of firm, poreless skin surround us. We spend billions on face creams, 
hair dye, exercise programs and surgery to roll back the clock. We revere 
actresses and models whose beauty is astounding, yet few of us stop to think 
what they may have done to achieve their looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't divorce yourself from the cultural influences," Von Kleist says. 
"We don't have many models of what a healthy, vibrant woman looks like at 30, 
40, 50. We have some -- Hillary Clinton, Jeane Kirkpatrick -- but until you 
have other images of what vitality and beauty look like, it's all in the 
physical realm of a 20-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Von Kleist suggests a way to alter this perception: "We expand our idea of 
what beauty is, to include more dimensions until physical beauty is an aspect 
that has no more weight than any others. We need to develop our fullness as 
human beings, not just physical beings, and to glorify that to the exclusion of 
everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary, 40, is blunt when explaining the reason for his "lower two-thirds face 
lift. The doctor's first question was, 'What brings you here?' and I said, 'In 
a word, vanity.' "  
</P>
<P>
 After losing 45 pounds, the L.A.-based retail manager was unhappy with the 
double chin that stuck around. "I would have had it done five years ago, but I 
didn't have the money then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran into a friend five days after the surgery and he said, 'I can see 
you've got some swelling, but you look so incredible, you look so young!' I did 
look older because of the fat that was hanging. I didn't have wrinkles, but 
that look (of a double chin) does come from age." 
</P>
<P>
 And how does he feel about aging? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that's always bothered me, the thought of getting older. 
There's nothing you can do about it, and who wants the alternative? But if I 
can do something about it, I will." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many men and women in the entertainment industry apparently share that view; 
doctors say they account for much of the under-40 facial rejuvenation set. 
After all, this is a business in which aging can mean being relegated to 
unglamorous roles -- or no roles at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Delany knows the pressures well. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you live in L.A. long enough, you do think about plastic surgery -- it's 
almost impossible not to," says the 36-year-old actress, who has not had her 
visage altered. ("I'm blessed with a young face.") 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had many discussions with friends about it," she says. "They say, 
'Should I do it?' And I've said, 'Should I do it?' Something inside me always 
says 'no.' . . . The Puritan in me says, 'God gave me this face; it's what 
makes me unique.' If I age, I'll have earned every line." 
</P>
<P>
 Delany says she even looks forward to growing older. "I'm dating a younger man 
right now, and it's the first time in my life I've felt older. I've always been 
the younger one in a relationship. I like it. And I much prefer being in my 30s 
than in my 20s, and I think that my 40s are going to be even better." 
</P>
<P>
 Others refuse to go gently into that good night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Klinger is president of Georgette Klinger, whose plush multipurpose 
beauty salon on Rodeo Drive caters to countless clients who have been lifted, 
tucked, liposucked and reshaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she's not against plastic surgery, Klinger is alarmed by the recent 
trend of younger women going under the knife. "Nobody can look that bad in 
their late 30s or early 40s that they need a lift," she says. "I think it comes 
from insecurity and putting too much emphasis on wanting to be perfect. Your 
40s should be your best time; we should have confidence in ourselves and enjoy 
life. But it's contagious -- one person in a group does it, it's follow the 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind seeing some fine lines on myself," adds Klinger, 43. "It doesn't 
bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 Would she at some point consider plastic surgery? 
</P>
<P>
 "Later, sure. But I don't want to have three face lifts in my lifetime."

RELATIONSHIPS: LOVE HURTS, AND IT SHOULD; BROKEN HEARTS MEND STRONGER, SAY 
ORANGE COUNTY THERAPISTS AND OTHER SURVIVORS FROM THE FRONT

<P>
 Just about all of us can recall a time when someone took Cupid's arrow out of 
our heart and walked away. Whether it was three days or 30 years ago, it's hard 
to forget the sound of a heart breaking. After all, trampling elephants are 
loud. 
</P>
<P>
 While most say that breaking a heart isn't as painful as having someone 
shatter yours, it can be pretty unpleasant, too. The experience can conjure up 
troubling emotions, like that pesky one, guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, all of this agony is actually good for us, say mental 
health professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the emotionally healthy person, having your heart broken is a necessary 
part of growth," says Joanie Heinemann, a therapist at Coastline Counseling 
Center in Newport Beach, who does individual and relationship counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't experience a variety of relationships and have your heart broken 
and break hearts, I don't know that you can ever build an intimate, 
understanding relationship with another person," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have been on both sides of the equation are sometimes sadder but 
wiser -- realizing after the fact that the way a heart is broken can make the 
mending easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Broken hearts occur most often in one's 20s and 30s, when people tend to try 
out different relationships before settling down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are especially common from the ages of 28 to 33, when both men and women 
begin heeding the sound of their biological clock and often push relationships 
that just aren't going to work," says Heinemann, who adds that just as many 
women as men break hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 Another positive thing to be said for broken hearts is that they usually show 
you what type of person you don't want to spend the rest of your life with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having your heart broken is a wonderful life lesson that toughens your skin 
and cleans your rose-colored glasses, which helps you realize what you do want 
in a relationship," says Dave, 32, a communications specialist who, like others 
in this story, asked that his last name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "My broken heart experiences led me to my wife, who is my soul mate, and that 
was worth all the pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave's heart was broken a few years ago after a whirlwind romance. "The 
relationship was pretty intense, and we both initially thought that it would go 
far," says Dave, who grew up in Orange County. After a while, though, he 
realized that he had been changing his personality to fit her needs and that 
the two really weren't that compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went away for the weekend, and one morning we just looked at each other 
and without really speaking, we both knew it just wasn't going to work out," he 
says. "It was kind of a mutual decision, but it really broke my heart. The day 
after breaking up, I went on a weeklong road trip to sort out my feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While most who have done some heartbreaking agree it's not a pleasant 
experience, they admit it's less traumatic than being on the receiving end of 
the "it's over" news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having your heart broken is definitely more painful" than breaking someone's, 
says Cynthia, 27, an employment representative for a company in Tustin. "When 
you break up with someone you're in control, but when you have your heart 
broken, you have no control." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because of youthful idealism, the first time someone breaks our heart 
is often the most painful. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia's heart was crushed at the age of 18 by a 30-year-old architect. "He 
was really sophisticated and took me places I'd never been. I was madly in love 
with him," she says. "He could also talk a good line. I had no idea he was 
sleeping with other people until I walked in on him with someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 For Cynthia, the experience was heart-wrenching. "I was devastated," she says. 
"I cried for days while I listened to love songs over and over again. I just 
really wallowed in it. It took me about six months to get over him." 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent broken hearts have been easier but are still difficult for Cynthia, 
whose most recent one came from a relationship with a man she'd been good 
friends with for 10 years. Because they have always gotten along so well, last 
year they decided to try dating, but the results, Cynthia says, were 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we were best friends, we just didn't have any passion," she says, 
"and that broke my heart, because I'd always dreamed about someday marrying 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Today Cynthia says dealing with the risk of having her heart broken again has 
become bearable because she knows that she'll fall in love again. "I remind 
myself that creating great memories is worth the pain in the long run," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Getting over a broken heart varies from person to person and relationship to 
relationship. While some people can't get past the pain, others simply dive 
into work and forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat, 33, an Aliso Viejo health-care industry trainer, survived several broken 
hearts before connecting with the man she married four years ago. She says that 
over the years she reacted in a number of ways to having her heart torn apart. 
"I did everything from read self-help books, to calm myself with visualization 
and meditation, to drink too much wine at times," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat got her first broken heart at 22 when she moved out of state to live with 
her boyfriend. When she found out he was seeing someone else, she was 
devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was naive and blind and had really idealized the relationship," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After discovering how deceptive he was, she told him to move out, but he 
refused. The next time he left the apartment, she threw all his possessions on 
the front porch and changed the locks. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pat, broken hearts haven't always ended in disappointment, though. Her 
husband actually broke her heart when they first started dating. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of months into dating, he wanted to call things off because he 
didn't want a serious relationship," she says. "I was upset, because he was a 
nice, stable guy, with a lot of the qualities I was looking for in a man. When 
he told me he wanted to break up, I didn't freak out. I remained calm and 
logical and told him that I didn't think we'd given the relationship enough 
time. Then we went our separate ways." 
</P>
<P>
 After the breakup, Pat kept occupied with work and other activities and didn't 
expect to hear from him again. So she was surprised when he called a month 
later and asked to see her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I could have told him to take a hike, I thought, what good will that 
do?" she says. "So I agreed to meet him and everything ended up working out 
well. He said that he appreciated me staying level-headed when he broke up with 
me, because it made him take a good look at himself and re-evaluate his 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that having a broken heart is worse than giving one. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave, the communications specialist, says he prefers the pain he felt over the 
end of his whirlwind romance to the horrible way he felt after he broke up with 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm your perpetual nice guy, so breaking up with someone was generally worse 
for me," he says, recalling one particularly gut-wrenching breakup that left 
him feeling like the world's biggest heel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd been dating for about five months, and she started talking about the 
future and how glad she was that I got along so well with her folks," he says. 
"At that point I realized that I would never fall in love with her, so I told 
her that I had no problem continuing the relationship, but I wanted her to know 
that I didn't see a future for us. Although she agreed with me, it soon became 
apparent that she was hoping I'd change my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 To break up with her, he suggested they go for a walk and he told her that he 
couldn't continue to see her. "She broke down in tears, and I felt horrible and 
apologized," he says. "I didn't give her the old line that we could still be 
friends, though." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have broken hearts say that there are do's and don'ts when it comes 
to plucking out Cupid's arrow. 
</P>
<P>
 It's dishonest to prolong the inevitable, they say. For example, if you know 
before a holiday that you're going to break up with a person, don't wait until 
afterward to tell them so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't wait until after Valentine's Day because you want to soften the blow," 
says therapist Heinemann. "Doing so would be dishonest and make the person feel 
even more foolish once you do break up." 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to end a relationship with someone is to be honest and upfront, 
Heinemann says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Use 'I' statements and tell the person that you have really enjoyed his or 
her company and care for the person deeply, but the relationship isn't working 
for you. The secret is to take full responsibility for the breakup, which keeps 
the person's self-esteem intact." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Denise, 33, a human resource manager, has had her heart broken a few 
times, she tends to be the heartbreaker. She agrees that a person's self-esteem 
is the most important consideration.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you break up with someone, emphasize the person's good points and then 
say that you don't wish to continue the relationship," she says. "Make a clean 
break. Don't change your mind, no matter what the person's reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Facing up to the person may not be easy, but it's the best thing for both of 
you in the long run because it gives you a sense of closure, says Denise, who 
speaks from experience. "Unfortunately, I haven't always taken my own advice," 
she says, recalling a time when she abruptly stopped answering calls from a man 
she'd been dating for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had different expectations from the get-go. He was interested in starting 
a family, and I just wanted a companion, so after a while I began to feel 
smothered by him," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 On several occasions she tried to tell him that things weren't going well for 
her, but she couldn't get the words out. Finally, after she returned from a 
two-week vacation out of the country, she simply stopped answering his calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was definitely an uncalled-for thing to do to someone," she says now. 
"He'll always wonder what went wrong. And although that happened almost two 
years ago, to this day I still feel bad. I cringe when I think of running into 
him, because I can't imagine what I would say."

 Brian, a 29-year-old engineer who is now engaged to be married, was late in 
appreciating an open approach in breaking off a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 He ended two relationships when he abruptly stopped calling two women, one 
he'd been dating for 18 months. Through the grapevine he learned that he'd 
broken their hearts but didn't think much of it until he had his own heart 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman who broke up with me was upfront and told me that she was going 
back to her old boyfriend," he says. "Knowing why she wanted to end our 
relationship really helped me deal with the breakup. At that time, I began 
thinking about the women I stopped calling, and I started to feel really bad 
about that. Now I wish I'd been more honest and open." 
</P>
<P>
 There are times, however, when honesty and kindness doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim, 27, an Orange research and development manager, met a woman when he 
graduated from college who fell in love with him on their first date. It didn't 
take him long to realize that they weren't compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had very different interests, and she was much more ritzy than me," he 
says. "I'm more down-to-earth -- like bean burritos -- and she was like 
caviar." 
</P>
<P>
 At first Jim tried to tell her nicely that things weren't working out, but she 
got upset and announced that she was pregnant. When he said he'd go in for 
testing with her, she said she'd had a miscarriage. He then wanted to break if 
off, but she continued to phone him at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I eventually started hanging up on her and not returning phone calls because 
I didn't know what else to do," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one night she followed him to a bowling alley when he was out with a 
friend (who later became his wife). 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend told me to just go up to her and tell her off," he says. "Although 
it's against my nature to be mean, I had really had enough, and I told her so. 
She left, and I haven't seen her since." 
</P>

 Whether you're being dumped or are doing the dumping, we are really durable 
creatures, says therapist Heinemann. Although someone fresh from a breakup may 
scoff at these words, time does indeed heal wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've had your heart broken, let it runs its course," Heinemann says. 
"And if you're going to do the heart breaking, do it right."

 Employees who improve health habits can reduce their company's health care 
costs, according to a nine-year study at the University of Michigan. The 
average age of participants was 44; 75% were men. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on habits and health, participants were classified as high risk or low 
risk and were offered smoking cessation, weight reduction and stress management 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next six years, researchers tracking medical insurance claims found 
that high-risk workers in 1985 who were low risk by 1988 had lower claims from 
1988-90, for an annual savings of $618. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees who remained high risk saw claims rise more than $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-risk employees' costs were the same. But low-risk workers who slipped to 
high risk saw claims more than double.

SERVING UP A TASTE OF BRITAIN IS JUST HIS CUP OF TEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "You must experience the tea," Paul Shelley reminds his customers, as his 
white-gloved hands pour his own special brew from a cozy-covered teapot into 
their floral-patterned Villeroy & Boch china cups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing you do is check the bouquet; next, taste it and make a 
judgment whether we need to add milk or sugar or lemon. But check it out first, 
because this is a tea you haven't had before." 
</P>
<P>
 You can say that again, and not just of Shelley's proprietary blend of teas, 
which he calls "The Butler's Brew," but of the whole shebang of the afternoon 
tea service he presides over at the Dana Point Resort every Friday, Saturday 
and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The resort's Lantern Bay Lounge may be distinctly Southern Californian in its 
Pacific view and clean-swept lack of personality, but under Shelley's guidance 
it becomes an outpost of upper-crust England, where everything stops for tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Tea may be the wan cousin of coffee locally, since gourmet coffee shops have 
been cropping up like slugs after a Seattle storm, but it is tea that is the 
most popular beverage in the world; tea that has a history reaching back 
thousands of years; tea that has been the maker of financial empires, the cause 
of two intercontinental wars, the root of the opium trade in China and one of 
the brewing causes of the American Revolution, leading Colonists to turn Boston 
Harbor into the world's largest teapot in December, 1773. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-ish Shelley isn't British, but he might as well be, given his devotion 
to tea and his adherence to the distinctly British way of putting oneself at 
the service of others. He doesn't need the badge he wears reading Butler to 
define his role. Even when having an off-duty chat with him, if you start to 
take off your jacket, he immediately leaps to his feet and helps. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggest that he relax and just be a normal person for a while, and he 
responds: "This is the way I always am. What you see is what you get. This is 
how I am in my own house." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley says a tradition of service just comes naturally to those raised in 
Boston -- not that I've ever had Ted Kennedy help me with my jacket. He also 
says tea was a part of life while he was growing up there, a twice-a-day 
tradition in his home since he had his first sip at age 5. It set his young 
mind to musing. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a child, I was raised with milk and sugar in tea, and in England many 
people add the milk before they even pour the tea. I was interested in why ? 
Why do we put milk in? Why not take it in its original form, namely tea, black? 
Why do I have to put milk in tea? Do you put it in some, not in others? What 
does it do to the tea? In my childhood I would ask, why do you put milk in it?" 
</P>
<P>
 So, why do people put milk in tea? 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, the china was very delicate, and if you put hot, scalding, 
boiling water into the cup, it might crack. So what they did was, they would 
put cold milk in it first," Shelley says. Remember, you heard it here first. 
</P>
<P>
 Between sips, he attended the New England Conservatory of Music and Boston 
Conservatory of Music. He has taught music at both the college and elementary 
school level, but cutbacks left him available three years ago to create the 
position of butler at the resort, originating and managing the afternoon tea. 
</P>
<P>
 He stresses: "Here we serve afternoon tea as opposed to high tea. 
Historically, high tea was for the commoner. It was more in the early evening, 
and they would have lots of hot foods, bacon, sausage, crumpets and the like. 
Afternoon tea was for the aristocrats and the affluent." 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, that means afternoon tea isn't the place to pig out, although one 
doesn't exactly go hungry either. Shelley offers a choice of the $6.25 spread 
-- a pot of tea, a splendid scone, cream, jam and berries -- or the $11.25 one, 
which has the aforementioned goodies along with finger sandwiches and two 
dessert pastries, which, like the scone, are skillfully made in-house. There is 
a choice of several teas, along with Shelley's Butler's Brew, a balanced 
full-bodied tea with no aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
 However good he might be at blending tea leaves, Shelley's true skill lies in 
getting people to mix.  
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, tea was a time when ladies and gentlemen would get together and 
they would share gossip. What we try to do here is set the theme of gossip in a 
friendly way. My philosophy in the tearoom is whatever you share with us, if 
it's dull we spice it up, and then we talk about you." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually what passes for gossip is stultifyingly innocuous. On this particular 
afternoon, three sweet elderly ladies visiting from the Midwest share that they 
are planning to drive to Hearst Castle and want to know how long it would take. 
One tea drinker tells them it might take three hours, while another says six, 
proving, if nothing else, that sobriety isn't all it's cracked up to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley says most of the "gossip" is like that, friendly tips on where to shop 
or what to eat, or light tales from customers' work day. There have been 
exceptions, though, such as the time he set a group of female ministers to 
gabbing. "The gossip got so heated I had to leave. I'm amazed at what comes out 
of the mouths of women," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He started the gossip policy shortly after he began the tea service at the 
resort. "I'd noticed a pair of guests sitting alone had been at the resort for 
a week. I reasoned that, like anyone who spends a lot of time together, they 
must eventually run out of things to say. Every time I'd come over, they'd 
start talking, and when I'd leave there would be silence. So I started getting 
the guests to talk to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give the guests the option to either share or keep a low profile. I'm 
sensitive to the needs of the guest. If they want solitude, so be it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul gets people interested in talking to each other, like a tour director, 
blending people," says regular customer Kathy Martino of Dana Point, taking tea 
with her mother. "Paul's wonderful. He takes an interest in the people who come 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd gone to tea at the Ritz (Carlton), and it was real stiff. They wouldn't 
let me in wearing shorts, and everyone was sitting up real prim and proper. 
It's not relaxing. Coming here is just like coming home, but being treated 
well. It gives a little bit of specialness to your everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley says that's his goal. "When people come in here, I want them to 
experience tea. Traditional tea is a time to relax, to read a book by yourself 
or to share with others. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see someone come in who's having a bad day, I try to turn them around, 
to help them leave feeling more positive than when they came in. Tea in parts 
of Europe was something set aside from the day that no one interfered with. At 
tea time everything stopped, and people sat down and relaxed. I'd like to see 
that happen again here."

MIRACLE MUSCLES; STRENGTH FROM A PILL? SOMEDAY, EXPERTS SAY. AND ATHLETES WON'T 
BE THE ONLY WINNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pump iron for a month and, presto, your muscles get stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 Take to your La-Z-Boy for a month and your muscles go soft. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows this happens, but no one knows exactly why. Why should you have 
to work to keep your muscles in shape? Why can't you relax and take a pill that 
duplicates the effects of two hours at the gym? 
</P>
<P>
 The surprising answer is: One may be on the way. Depending on which scientist 
you ask, it's just around the corner or it's 40 years away. But researchers 
agree they that are closing in on the most basic, biological processes by which 
muscles decide whether to become stronger or weaker, quicker or slower. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers are already beginning to manipulate the process. One chemical 
administered to laboratory rats duplicates some effects of daily workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean that someday couch potatoes can look like Arnold 
Schwarzenegger? Probably not, says Kenneth M. Baldwin, professor of physiology 
and biophysics at the University of California, Irvine and a leading researcher 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does mean that the muscles of people with cancer and AIDS may not 
become so debilitated. And it might mean that ordinary people, who typically 
become sedentary and start weakening about age 60, can enjoy a stronger, less 
accident-prone life. 
</P>
<P>
 But first in line to benefit are the people who have paid for so much of the 
research: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early days of space flight, they and their Russian colleagues have 
been trying to prevent the weakened muscles caused by the zero gravity of 
space. Early Soviet OK cosmonauts, the first to be aloft for long periods, 
sometimes could not even stand up after returning to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial-and-error experiments with muscle-taxing spacesuits and exercise 
equipment have yielded only slight gains. Baldwin -- who has a 10-year NASA 
research grant and serves on three NASA science advisory committees -- and 
other researchers have taken a different approach. They are studying how 
muscles work at their most basic level in hopes of isolating the process that 
keeps human muscles strong so they can duplicate it with safe drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they are closing in. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have discovered that muscles react not only to the amount of stress 
placed on them, but to the type of stress -- rapid or slow. Somehow these 
distinctions are transmitted to the genes in muscle cells, which then produce 
the appropriate kinds of muscle fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 The muscles become not only stronger or weaker but can change their very 
character. They may switch, say, from muscles with stamina and efficiency to 
muscles that provide short bursts of power and speed. Research is concentrating 
on just what signals make these changes take place; to find the answers, 
researchers are looking down to the level of the muscles' molecules. 
</P>
<P>
 You know what your muscles look like if you have ever examined a beefsteak. 
Muscles are not a solid mass but a dense package of thin, fleshy layers. 
</P>
<P>
 View one of these layers through a very high-powered microscope and you can 
see the engines of the muscle -- the millions upon millions of muscle 
filaments. Each is composed of short chains of protein molecules called myosin 
and actin, which together provide the muscle's movement and force.  
</P>
<P>
 The actin chain lies atop the myosin chain like a sliding hatch. When the 
muscle fiber is relaxed, the hatch lies "open," and the two chains are at their 
greatest combined length. But when the myosin receives the power command, it 
pulls the hatch "closed." That shortens the combined length of the two chains 
and provides the filament's tiny share of the muscle's contraction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This filament's force is all or nothing, Baldwin says. It always applies the 
same amount at the same speed. Equivalent types of filaments are identical in 
Michael Jordan and Mother Teresa. But there the resemblance ends. 
</P>
<P>
 The filaments are bundled into muscle fibers about the size and shape of a 
thin hair a few millimeters to a few centimeters long. Jordan's fibers are 
perhaps twice as thick as Mother Teresa's, because physical conditioning and 
testosterone have added more filaments for additional strength. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 to 500 fibers are wrapped together like a package of spaghetti to 
form a "motor unit," the smallest muscle unit that can be controlled 
individually. When Jordan shoots a basketball (or swings a baseball bat), his 
brain calculates just how many and which motor units are required in various 
muscles and activates only them. If the calculation is correct, Jordan scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Your genes may not have endowed you with a professional athlete's muscle 
makeup, but you make similar calculations every time you lift a box or open a 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 The brain's orders reach the muscles because a nerve from each motor unit is 
plugged into the spinal cord like a telephone is plugged into a wall socket. 
But unlike the telephone, if you unplug the muscle, it still works. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is that muscles take orders from more than the brain, Baldwin says. 
Some nerves from motor units go to the spinal cord and up to the brain, but 
others loop back and connect to other motor units, to the skin and to other 
body tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 Through these loop-back circuits, muscles and skin can communicate among 
themselves, allowing muscles to react faster than the brain can. The classic 
example is touching a hot surface. Your skin sounds the alarm, and the muscles 
pull your hand away before the news even reaches your brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar, routine reactions are happening in your body every waking instant. 
The fact that you can, without thinking, stand on two legs or hold your head 
erect is because of direct communication among muscles assigned to oppose 
gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some tasks are easier to do if you keep your brain out of it. 
Cocktail servers are taught to balance their drinks on a tray supported by the 
palm of one hand and to avoid watching it. Even the most top-heavy trays rarely 
spill, because the arm and hand muscles balance the tray continually and 
automatically. But start watching the tray and the brain will almost always 
over-correct and spill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This back-door communication is the key to why our muscles change, Baldwin 
says. Through this system, signals flow to muscles and prompt quick 
adaptations. 
</P>
<P>
 Muscles can change because they are constantly being built and rebuilt, 
Baldwin says. In only seven to 14 days, half of the protein in your muscle 
cells has been broken down, discarded and replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if you had a contractor constantly tearing down the rooms in your 
house and rebuilding them with new materials," Baldwin says. "After a month, 
you've got a brand-new house. Next month you'll have another brand-new one." 
</P>
<P>
 What every bodybuilder knows is that increased stress on muscles -- lifting 
more weight than you did last week -- somehow signals cells to build bigger, 
and therefore stronger, muscles. (Bigger muscles are always stronger, Baldwin 
says.) 
</P>
<P>
 But what more recent studies discovered is that a further change takes place. 
The character of the stress was changing the character of the muscle fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 Marathon runners were developing a type of slow-moving but high-stamina fiber, 
named Type I or "slow twitch." Sprinters and power lifters were developing a 
type of high-speed, high-output fiber -- a group called Type II or "fast 
twitch." 
</P>
<P>
 The typical person has half one type, half the other throughout the body. But 
when muscle cells are somehow informed of the type of unusual activity the 
muscle is performing -- slow-moving or fast, long-lasting or intense -- some 
muscle fibers change character to the appropriate type, Baldwin says. 
</P>
<P>
 The change begins quickly, says Baldwin's research associate, Vince Caiozzo, 
assistant professor of orthopedics at UC Irvine's College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have rats that pump iron. It sounds funny, but they aren't standing up 
curling weights. They take their feet and push against an object. The whole 
thing is computerized, so it can simulate every aspect of you going to the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have them do about two minutes of weight training a day, within two 
days we begin to see changes in the (muscle fiber types) they are producing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five of Baldwin's rats went up on a space shuttle last November to determine 
just what was happening to muscles in space. On their return, Baldwin 
discovered that being in zero gravity for 14 days had converted a large portion 
of their muscle fibers from Type I, which is particularly suited to opposing 
gravity, to Type II. 
</P>
<P>
 Muscles, freed from the effects of gravity, were merely adapting to their new 
environment, normally a good thing. "When they're up in space, they no longer 
need their legs to balance and control gravity," Baldwin says. "They can float 
around from one location to another with just fingertip force." 
</P>
<P>
 But astronauts return to Earth suddenly, where zero-gravity adaptation 
instantly becomes a liability. They found that not only were the muscles that 
helped them stand weakened, but the nervous system that operated their muscles 
had become lazy in weightlessness. So had the astronauts' breathing and blood 
circulation systems. In some cases, the astronauts could not stand without 
fainting. 
</P>
<P>
 This is merely an inconvenience when returning to Earth. With the flight over, 
the astronauts can spend several days or even weeks to work back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 But it could be a major problem on a long mission to another planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's take Mars; that's where they plan to go next," Caiozzo says. "It's 
projected to take 1 1/2 years just to get there. The problem is, when they land 
on Mars (and once again encounter gravity), are they going to be able to 
function?" 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Baldwin says, exercise programs in space using treadmills, cycles and 
bungee cords have not solved the problem. The solution, he says, is more likely 
to be a combination of physical stress and drugs that either prevent the change 
in muscle fibers or deceive the muscle cells into thinking that they have been 
exercising. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests on Baldwin's rats have shown that a chemical called beta 
guanidinopropionic acid acts to deplete muscles of a naturally occurring 
substance called phosphocreatin. Normally, this substance is used up when 
muscles work. Baldwin believes that artificially depleting it makes cells react 
as if the muscles had been through a workout. So far, rats have reacted to the 
chemical by converting some Type II muscle fibers to Type I fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing the thyroid hormone from circulation seems to block the conversion of 
muscle fiber that occurs in zero gravity, Baldwin says. This shows the process 
can be regulated chemically, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing or maintaining muscle size is a different matter, Baldwin says. 
Researchers believe that the simple brute force generated by muscles serves to 
signal how much muscle mass is needed. The muscle builds up or shrinks 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not been able to unlock a chemical that would act in place of force, 
but we think we have some clues," Baldwin says. A substance called insulin-like 
growth factor is being studied. It seems to work directly on muscle cells to 
increase their size, Baldwin says. Unlike steroids, the increase in size occurs 
without exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 (It appears that steroids only allow a person to exercise more strenuously; it 
is the increase in exercise that increases muscle size, Baldwin says. Steroids 
administered to a couch potato would probably have no muscle-building effect, 
but this has not been scientifically tested.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another researcher -- Frank Booth, professor of physiology at the University 
of Texas Medical School, Houston -- believes that the answer may be genes 
rather than drugs. Injecting certain genes into muscles, like a vaccination, 
could promote production of desired substances within the muscle that would 
maintain muscle fiber without exercise, he says. Something that could be used 
by people is only five to 10 years away, he estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm describing will be possible on a very limited scale for a very few 
people," Booth says. "I don't think it would be used by the normal population. 
It would probably be used very selectively. I think it would be costly and not 
applicable in all cases." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he adds, subsequent advances "may take it to the general public." 
</P>
<P>
 Another researcher, V. Reggie Edgerton, professor of physiological science at 
UCLA, says he is concentrating on the nervous system. It is known that the 
efficiency of a body's nervous system plays a role in how much force its 
muscles can apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Within certain bounds, a person with smaller muscles but a better nervous 
system can be effectively stronger than the person with the opposite 
attributes. Edgerton and others say the typical person cannot voluntarily exert 
all the potential force of his or her muscles. But some scientists disagree, 
and the point remains controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgerton says the nervous system may by itself play a role in determining how 
muscles will change, but adds: "We're pretty far away from knowing all the 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Humans have been wanting to believe there's an easy way for a long time. Do 
you remember that book about how to stay fit with only 30 minutes of exercise a 
week? It stayed on the bestseller list for months. It just told everybody what 
they wanted to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10 years ago, muscle biologists thought every property of muscles was 
determined by the muscle's activity. Now it's now plain that's not true, 
Edgerton says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we could easily get to the point where we could minimize some of the 
negative effects of aging" by controlling the chemistry of muscle cells.

 Muscles consist of bundles of fibers connected to the brain by nerves. The 
nerves carry messages telling the muscles when to contract and how much 
exertion is needed. Almost all muscles move the bone connected to the joint 
just below the muscles affected. A look at the muscle system when the lower arm 
is raised: * Origin: Where muscle attaches to bone that does not move with each 
contraction of the biceps. * Muscle pairs: Biceps and triceps work together. As 
one contracts, the other relaxes. * Biceps: As it contracts, elbow bends. * 
Triceps: As it contracts, elbow straightens. * Insertion: Where muscle attaches 
to bone that moves with that muscle's contractions. * Forearm: Muscles flex and 
extend the hand and fingers. The Inside Story 
</P>
<P>
 Filaments are the muscle's engines. Each filament is composed of chains of 
proteins, myosin and actin. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide movement, myosin pulls actin toward it. When resting, the 
myosin-actin interaction is inhibited and tension is relaxed. Pulling the 
Weight 
</P>
<P>
 Humans have 700 muscles comprising about 50% of body weight. On an average 
day, muscles work as hard as if they were placing 2,400 pounds on a 
four-foot-high shelf. Eye: Fastest contracting muscles in the body. Ear: 
Smallest muscle; steadies bone in middle ear. Tongue: Almost all muscle; fibers 
provide complex movement. Face: It takes 14 muscles to smile. Heart: Muscle 
with greatest endurance; beats about 100,000 times a day. Back: Moves spinal 
column; strained back is second highest cause of lost work days. Buttocks: 
Largest combined muscle group in body. Thigh: Potentially strongest -- yet 
least used -- muscle in the body.

SOLID SUPPORT AFTER 'SHATTERED TRUST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shari Karney, a lawyer and child rights activist who was abused as a child, 
and actress Melissa Gilbert, who portrayed Karney in a TV movie, were honored 
at a fashion show/fund-raiser for the Orange County Chapter of Childhelp USA. 
</P>
<P>
 Karney and Gilbert received Childhelp's Children's Friend award before 600 
guests at the "For the Love of a Child" benefit at the Hyatt Regency Irvine 
last week. The $60-per-person luncheon, which included a fashion show staged by 
Saks Fifth Avenue, was expected to net $80,000 for Childhelp, an organization 
that combats child abuse. A Painful Past 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, Karney was a 29-year-old attorney defending an incest victim 
when a real-life courtroom drama triggered memories of her painful past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was cross-examining a man accused of sexually abusing his 3-year-old 
daughter, and I (tried to) strangle him," Karney said. "Nine months later I 
uncovered memories of my own sexual abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 A victim of incest by both her father and brother, Karney began sharing her 
story and worked to change California legislation to extend the statute of 
limitations in child molestation cases. That led to numerous television and 
radio appearances, followed by the NBC Movie of the Week "Shattered Trust: The 
Shari Karney Story," starring Gilbert as Karney. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone plays you, it's like they have a piece of your soul," Karney 
said. Beyond 'Little House' 
</P>
<P>
 Karney and Gilbert hugged and chatted like old friends when the actress 
arrived at the hotel with fiance Bruce Boxleitner. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, an actress and model since age 2 who later portrayed Laura in the 
"Little House on the Prairie" television series, said playing Karney was her 
toughest role. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very gut-wrenching experience," Gilbert said. "I felt like I had a 
tremendous responsibility. I generally play people who existed in the past (or 
in fiction). She was actually there on the set the whole time . . . . She was 
very open, very honest. It was wonderful to have her there." 
</P>
<P>
 After the movie aired in September 1993, Childhelp's toll-free hot line ((800) 
4-A-Child) was inundated with calls from child abuse victims, according to Anna 
Petruzzelli, president of Childhelp's Western regional board. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we were really inspired by Melissa," Petruzzelli said. Food and 
Fashion 
</P>
<P>
 Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Fedderson were two actresses performing for troops in 
Tokyo 35 years ago when they founded Childhelp (originally International 
Orphans Inc.) to help Japanese American orphans -- the children of U.S. 
servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an unpopular cause, but we were only thinking of the children," 
Fedderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group changed its focus to the prevention, treatment and research of child 
abuse in 1974. In addition to the hot line, Childhelp runs foster homes and two 
Childhelp Villages to house child abuse victims. The village in Beaumont serves 
80 children from Southern California, and another opened recently in Culpeper, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
 In honor of Childhelp's overseas origins, event co-chairwomen Tani Stevens and 
Jana Shuler turned the hotel ballroom into an Asian garden. A rickshaw stood in 
the hotel lobby, and kimonos adorned the walls. Inside the ballroom, tables 
were decorated with simple Asian-style floral arrangements while the stage had 
panels painted with Chinese letters. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lunch of Chinese fare, the fashion show began with a dancing Chinese 
dragon that did everything but breathe fire. Models paraded down the runway in 
fun sportswear from Nine O Two Six Five and lots of flowing pants and loose 
tunic tops from Isda Funari, a San Francisco-based designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were honorary chairman Efrem Zimbalist Jr.; Barbara Ganahl, 
Orange County chapter president, and Orange County Supervisor Thomas Riley and 
his wife, Emma Jane, past chapter president. Other guests included Denise 
McNeil, Nancy Whitlock, Patty Edwards, Claire LaBerge, Mary Allyn Dexter, 
Sabrina Enright, Ruth Phillips, Rebecca McCarthy, Martha Fleener, Eileen Saul, 
Carol Packard, Tina Schafnitz, Gene Howard, Gary San Filippo, Betty Lou 
Lamoreaux, Jeanie Ming, William Steiner and Gemma Wolf. KATHRYN BOLD

PHARM REPORT / KATHLEEN DOHENY: WORKING MEDICINES INTO YOUR WORKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You hate to miss your workout but can't stop sneezing. So you pop a cold pill 
and head to the gym. But should you pump iron with that load of decongestants 
in your system? 
</P>
<P>
 You rarely have trouble falling asleep, but last night was the exception. You 
took an over-the-counter sleep aid and snoozed away the night. Now it's 6 a.m. 
and you're raring to run. But should you? 
</P>
<P>
 Do over-the-counter medicines and exercise mix? It depends, the experts say, 
on how much medicine you took (and what kind) and the extent of your workout. 
(Consult your physician regarding prescription drugs.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even among pharmacists opinions vary. There is usually no problem taking cough 
and cold medicines right before a moderate workout, contends Alan Martin, 
president-elect of the California Pharmacists Assn. and owner of Economy Drug 
in San Luis Obispo. Other experts suggest that some medicines are best taken an 
hour or two before exercise and that some are best taken after a workout. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cold Medicine and Exercise: Cold and cough medications that aim to decongest 
usually contain stimulants. If you exercise soon after taking a dose, you might 
feel a rush of energy followed by fatigue as the drug wears off. You could also 
experience a fast heart beat, nervousness, shakiness and a headache. Consider 
waiting an hour or two, says Sylvia Curry, director of pharmacy at Century City 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Cough and cold medicines can also include antihistamines, which act as 
sedatives. (Don't count on them canceling out the stimulant effects of the 
decongestants, Curry says, noting that everyone responds to medicine 
differently.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's best to pick a cough syrup without alcohol, Curry says. But Martin 
counters that there is not enough alcohol in most over-the-counter cough syrups 
to have much effect on exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 When taking cough and cold medicines with stimulants, though, it is wise to 
reduce caffeine intake to minimize that "hyped up" feeling, says Dr. Kenneth 
Landis, director of pulmonary medicine at Centinela Hospital Medical Center, 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Allergy Medicine and Workouts: Most over-the-counter allergy medicines contain 
antihistamines, which can make you drowsy, slow reaction times and impair 
coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait at least two hours after a dose to exercise, Curry suggests, or work out 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OTC Sleeping Aids: "Over-the-counter sleep aids usually wear off in four to 
six hours," says Martin, making morning exercise likely to be free of 
side-effects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cramp Pills: Take "menstrual relief" medicine (such as Midol, Pamprin) after 
exercise, experts say, because the drugs act as a diuretic, perhaps making it 
difficult to get through an entire workout without a bathroom stop. Be sure to 
eat potassium-rich foods (bananas, orange juice) to replenish potassium lost 
with increased urine production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pain Medications: Taking pain medicine such as aspirin, acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen before exercise might mask pain and set you up for serious injury, 
some say. 
</P>
<P>
 But it can also reduce inflammation in an injured area and allow you to ease 
back into exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Formula Options: The "time-release" formulas of over-the-counter medicines are 
probably a better option if you plan to exercise after taking them, Landis 
says. "Slow-release forms are less likely to increase your heart rate and 
elevate your blood pressure," he says. Ask your pharmacist which forms are 
slow-release because not all may be labeled as such. 
</P>
<P>
 The Common-Sense Factor: People with a tendency to anxiety or who have chronic 
conditions such as asthma should be especially careful about mixing 
over-the-counter medicine and exercise, Landis says. Listening to your body is 
wise, too. "People's response (to medicine) is variable," Landis says. Someone 
who rarely takes medicine might be more sensitive to the sedating effects of 
antihistamines, for instance. Regular exercisers often have a 
better-than-average ability to listen to their bodies and are likely to 
recognize side effects promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Natural Remedies: Consider natural routes to relief if your cough or cold 
isn't too bad. Use a humidifier to decongest. Drink lots of water and get more 
rest to relieve congestion. Exercise itself might improve congestion, at least 
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Caveats: Exercisers should make their physicians and pharmacists aware of 
their workout routines, especially if a new medicine is ordered. When buying 
over-the-counter medicines or filling prescriptions, ask the pharmacist what 
effect, if any, a dose will have on your regular workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Know when to stop self-treatment. "Don't take a cough or cold medicine longer 
than five to seven days without seeing a doctor," Curry says.

SCR UP FOR 10 DRAMA AWARDS; THEATER: IT GETS MORE CRITICS CIRCLE NODS THAN ANY 
OTHER COMPANY, BUT THE MOST-HONORED PRODUCTIONS ARE FROM L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa has snagged 10 of this year's Los Angeles 
Drama Critics Circle award nominations -- more than any other theater company. 
Meanwhile, the giant-sized "Sunset Boulevard" at the Shubert Theatre and "The 
Tavern" at the intimate Matrix Theatre, both in Los Angeles, were the most 
honored single productions, with seven nominations apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Five different productions contributed to the South Coast Rep nominations, 
announced Monday. And, SCR produced the play that won this year's Ted Schmitt 
Award for an outstanding world premiere -- Roger Rueff's "So Many Words," 
presented on its Second Stage last April. 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe also received a special award on the occasion of its 30th birthday, 
"for its growth from a grass-roots operation to a leading American resident 
theater, committed to new plays and to sustaining an uncommonly versatile 
company of artists." 
</P>
<P>
 The Center Theatre Group in Los Angeles, whose productions at the Taper and 
Doolittle theaters dominated last year's nominations, received only eight this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County productions also dominated this year's writing awards: The only 
nominations given were to Rueff for "So Many Words" and to Carol Wolf for 
"Monsieur Shaherazad," staged by now-defunct GroveShakespeare in Garden Grove. 
"Shaherazad" was also nominated for lead performance, by Ron Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 SCR received three nominations for lead performance (Kandis Chappell and Dakin 
Matthews for "Shadowlands" and Richard Doyle for "Intimate Exchanges"), one for 
featured performance (Douglas Rowe for "Great Day in the Morning"), two for 
scenic design (Cliff Faulkner for "Hay Fever" and Gerard Howland for "Great Day 
in the Morning"), one for lighting design (Peter Maradudin for "Great Day in 
the Morning"), two for costume design (Ann Bruice for "Hay Fever" and Walter 
Hicklin for "Great Day in the Morning") and the one for writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the troupe did not receive a nomination for outstanding 
production or direction. Similarly, although "Sunset Boulevard" tied "The 
Tavern" for the most nominations for a single show, "Sunset" was not nominated 
for outstanding production. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominees for that award were "The Tavern," "Crazy for You" (the musical that 
preceded "Sunset Boulevard" at the Shubert) and the West Coast Ensemble's 
revival of "Equus." 
</P>
<P>
 Director nominations went to Jules Aaron for "Equus," Marilyn Fox for the 
Pacific Resident Theatre Ensemble's revival of "Ondine," Todd Nielsen for 
"Rags" at the Colony Studio Theatre, Tony Giordano for "The Tavern" and Trevor 
Nunn for "Sunset Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Resident Theatre Ensemble won the Margaret Harford Award for 
continuous achievement in the small theater. J. Kent Inasy will receive the 
Angstrom Award for career achievement in stage lighting. And Artists 
Confronting AIDS will take home another special award for presentations that 
"memorably dramatize an urgent health care crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 The winners in the competitive categories will be announced next month and the 
awards will be presented April 10 in Studio City. The occasion will mark the 
25th anniversary of the critics' organization, which includes 18 critics from 
12 different publications.

LEARNING TO LIVE WITH THE FLAWS; TELEVISION: FORMER 'PERFECTIONIST' BALLERINA 
GELSEY KIRKLAND MAKES HER ACTING DEBUT ON AN EPISODE OF 'L.A. LAW.' SHE TAKES 
THE RISK IN STRIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her kiss-and-tell-all autobiography, "Dancing on My Grave," onetime ballet 
star Gelsey Kirkland painted herself as a tormented perfectionist. Published in 
1986, the book took the sheen off the pristine world of classical dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland seems much more relaxed now, as she talks of her approaching acting 
debut Thursday as a guest star on "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as you become afraid to make a fool of yourself, you're in trouble. I 
decided I may as well just see if I can live with myself making millions of 
mistakes and learn something from it," Kirkland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often, when you've reached a very high level of achievement, you almost 
become paralyzed by the idea that anything you might do might be imperfect. 
Perfection is just the striving, the effort, the struggle, but it's hard to 
remember that. . . . This was one way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as one of her generation's greatest dramatic ballerinas, Kirkland, 
41, will appear on "L.A. Law" in a non-autobiographical role as an aging, 
veteran ballerina who sues her Svengali-esque choreographer-boss for breach of 
contract: He's not casting her anymore. She dons leotard and leg warmers for 
two brief dancing scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, the diminutive dancer made her last major appearance eight years 
ago in England, where she briefly guest-starred with the Royal Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 That fall, she published her autobiography detailing her teen-age ascent to 
principal status with New York City Ballet, her subsequent coupling, on-stage 
and off, with Mikhail Baryshnikov at American Ballet Theatre, and her 
near-fatal descent into drug addiction and bulimia. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, she put out her second book, "The Shape of Love," describing the 
Royal Ballet stint during which she began teaching and coaching, work she's 
been pursuing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully choosing her words during a phone interview from a Manhattan dance 
studio, Kirkland was nonetheless affably forthcoming about her acting debut, 
noting that she had just begun acting classes when the "L.A. Law" offer came in 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, she said, the oddest part of filming was hitting the marks, as 
it's called in Hollywood: Without looking, the actor must walk to, then stop 
at, an exact spot marked on the floor in front of the camera in order to appear 
in focus and properly lit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose it's equivalent to knowing where you are on stage without looking," 
Kirkland said, but "at one point, I said, 'Do you have some sort of neon tape 
that will glow?' Of course, they came up with something for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The short time span allotted to develop her "L.A. Law" character was likewise 
disconcerting, said Kirkland, who was known for meticulously investigating the 
psychology of every Giselle or Juliet she danced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly did the best I could to fill (the character) out," she said. "But 
I really wasn't comparing it to dancing. I just concentrated on what I had to 
concentrate on, which is all you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 During her dancing days, Kirkland also was known for her combustible 
temperament, which led to fights with management, and, in her perfectionistic 
artistic quest, a fearlessness at challenging choreographers. But she showed 
"not a hint" of any of that on the set and was open to guidance, according to 
"L.A. Law" director Dennis Dugan. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's well aware of the performer-director relationship, and was very 
respectful of it," Dugan said. "She's a hard worker, and she did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland said she took up acting in the first place because she'd like to 
direct a ballet company. "The more you know in terms of theater, the more you 
have to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said she hopes the lessons will hone her coaching ability, as she 
believes today's ballet lacks "a sense of theater" or attention to dramatic 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a future on the small or silver screen, the "L.A. Law" offer was "first 
and last so far," she said with a laugh, and, while she wouldn't sniff at 
others, her more immediate concern is learning "to become a decent actress." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny because a lot of people say, 'but you already are an actress.' In 
a certain sense that's true, but with this you have another instrument you have 
to develop. . . . I didn't get to speak with my toes this time, I had to use my 
diaphragm more." 
</P>
<P>
 Making a movie or miniseries out of her books is another possibility, but 
there's "nothing definite" to report, said Kirkland, who published her third 
book, a children's story, last fall. Like the previous two, she wrote "The 
Little Ballerina and Her Horse" with her husband of almost nine years, Greg 
Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, watching herself in a rough cut of Thursday's "L.A. Law" drew the 
same reaction she always had when watching herself dance on video. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see the flaws . . . and it takes a while before you can take in the whole 
picture." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she said, it took her about seven years before she could savor the 
televised production of ABT's "Nutcracker," a holiday perennial in which she 
stars opposite Baryshnikov.

 Los Angeles County has tentatively settled a wrongful death lawsuit, agreeing 
to pay $450,000 to the family of a teen-ager who was fatally shot in 1991 by a 
sheriff's deputy at the Ramona Gardens housing project in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement brought an abrupt end to a 2 1/2-week-old trial against former 
sheriff's Deputy Jason Mann, now retired, and the county in the shooting of 
Arturo (Smokey) Jimenez, whose death touched off a disturbance at the housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a secure resolution that will give the family a chance to start a new 
life," said R. Samuel Paz, who represented Jimenez's mother. "She wanted her 
son's life to mean something for her family and this will help." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement must be approved by the County Board of Supervisors. Under 
details of the settlement, the parents, Elva and Javier Jimenez, agreed not to 
criticize the deputy or the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jimenez's parents had harsh words for the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not happy," said Elva Jimenez, who is separated from her husband and has 
five surviving children. "It's not good. There is no justice." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not interested in the money," said Javier Jimenez, a native of 
Guadalajara, in Mexico. "I'm interested for justice for Mexican people. And in 
this case, I'm sorry to say, there is no justice for la raza, for Mexicans, in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the impression that there is more justice in dog bite cases than in 
cases involving Mexicans in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 When the shooting occurred, "there was a tremendous outcry from the community 
and a mural was erected at the site of the shooting and is still remembered 
with sadness," Paz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 1:35 a.m. on Aug. 3, 1991, after Mann and his 
partner, Dana Ellison, chased a car into the Ramona Gardens complex. They said 
the car was speeding. According to authorities, the deputies' vehicle was 
struck by a beer bottle as it passed a group partying near Evergreen and 
Lancaster avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said that when the deputies left their vehicle to investigate the 
bottle throwing, Jimenez grabbed Ellison's flashlight and struck him on the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the official account, Mann ordered Jimenez to drop the 
flashlight. When he ignored the order and continued to swing the metal 
flashlight, Mann shot Jimenez three times in the chest. Mann claimed his 
partner was knocked unconscious by the blows from Jimenez. Witnesses said 
Jimenez, who was identified as a gang member, argued with the deputies but 
never struck anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Paz said the shooting was not justified. He said the county decided 
to settle after Ellison contradicted Mann's account of the incident. "He said 
he was never knocked out," Paz said. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal Sheriff's Department investigation had concluded that the deputies 
acted within department guidelines for the use of deadly force during the 
confrontation. The two deputies were cleared by the district attorney's office 
and the county grand jury.  
</P>
<P>
 The $450,000 was the same amount the two sides had initially settled on until 
the county backed out and decided to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is not totally happy with the settlement, but that is why it's a 
settlement," said John A. Daly, a private attorney who represented the county. 
</P>
<P>
 He later he told jurors he was preparing to introduce evidence that would have 
revealed that Jimenez was on PCP.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; ANTI-CRIME GROUPS TO INCLUDE DISASTER READINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Impressed by the way some San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Watch groups coped 
with the Northridge earthquake, police and city officials want to turn the 
local anti-crime groups into full-fledged emergency preparedness teams for the 
next disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the lessons of the quake was that the suburban neighbors who had banded 
together under police supervision in the Neighborhood Watch groups were much 
better at dealing with the disaster than the rest of the city, police and city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some checked for gas leaks while others knew where to find the elderly and 
children that might need help. While some scurried about sizing up their 
neighborhood's problems, others relayed that information to police and city 
officials through assigned liaison officers. 
</P>
<P>
 And because they knew each other, Neighborhood Watch members shared their 
pantries and homes with the less fortunate among them.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the wake of the deadly quake -- and in preparation for other 
calamities -- police have quietly begun transforming the Neighborhood Watch 
program in the West San Fernando Valley from a vehicle for monitoring crime 
into a full-fledged, disaster response system, encouraging residents to be as 
self-reliant as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step, they said Monday, will be to try to expand the program 
citywide. That way, when police and firefighters are busy handling the most 
critical problems, many residents will be capable of fending for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time is right, based on our recent experience," said West Valley Police 
Capt. Val Paniccia, who has ordered the expansion of the Neighborhood Watch 
groups in his division. "The real key in any major disaster is being able to 
survive the first few days. And as a group you can survive a lot longer and 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 The police, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick and the city Fire 
Department have pledged to work jointly to get West Valley neighbors together, 
and to train them in first aid and other emergency response techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can turn a disaster into an opportunity to do things better," said Chick, 
whose office came up with the idea about the same time police did. "Now this is 
an ASAP priority thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Neighborhood Watch program, residents meet regularly on a 
block-by-block basis to discuss crime issues, and keep watch for criminal 
activity. Block captains keep track of what happens on their streets, reporting 
to police community representatives -- citizens who stay in contact with 
authorities and the City Council member's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the hours after the Jan. 17 jolt, something unexpected happened on 
those West Valley streets organized under the Neighborhood Watch system. Even 
before the sun rose, residents met with neighbors and canvassed their areas, 
checking to see if everyone was OK, helping those who were not and locating gas 
leaks and other hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh God, did it ever work -- it was wonderful," said Marilyn Robinson, 49, a 
Neighborhood Watch leader for the Bassett Street group in Quimby Park. "You 
know names, you know who to look for. We shared our water. We made coffee. We 
even met neighbors who just moved in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Neighborhood Watch apparatus enabled the 274 members of the Quimby Park 
group to do much more than share food. Within a day, they had compiled a list 
of residents who wanted city building and safety inspectors to check their 
homes for damage, and Robinson forwarded it to her field representative in 
Chick's office. "We had them out within two days," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her block captains, Robinson also was able to spread important news, 
such as that a water tank had been brought into the parking lot at Canoga Park 
High School. Watch members patrolled the area day and night, looking for 
looters and other signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, groups such as Robinson's are anticipating expanding into disaster 
response teams. At a Feb. 2 meeting at West Valley police headquarters, about 
50 Neighborhood Watch leaders met with police, and had their pictures taken and 
made into identification cards. Quimby Park and the nine other Neighborhood 
Watch groups in the immediate area will send a representative to an emergency 
preparedness class scheduled to start Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "God forbid, in case the (phone) lines are down and we can't get through, we 
would know what to do," Robinson said. "When you have a disaster you can band 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Based on their experience in the Northridge quake, police and city officials 
acknowledge that many residents will be on their own in the event of another 
major disaster, especially during the critical first hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But having residents who can care for themselves and secure their 
neighborhoods will be important in the days and weeks after a major disaster, 
they said, when food and water will be scarce and lines of communication will 
be down. 
</P>
<P>
 As planned, the groups would have checklists of how to respond to each 
disaster -- floods, earthquakes, fires -- and specific tasks for each person. 
Residents would know where to report for duty, and central command posts could 
be established where people could meet and get their bearings, Paniccia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could take tallies of damage in their areas, and get better police 
response," Paniccia said. "And it's an automatic anti-looting patrol. They will 
know who belongs and who doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Paniccia said he is looking into finding ways each neighborhood can be 
provided with a shed containing a master list of residents, search and rescue 
tools, food and water, water purification systems, a comprehensive first aid 
kit and other important equipment.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; HUNDREDS LABOR TO REOPEN COLLEGE 
</P>

 Struggling with what Cal State Northridge officials say has become the worst 
disaster ever to strike a major U.S. university, hundreds of workers labored 
around the clock in the rain Monday to ready the campus for its scheduled 
reopening next week. 
</P>
<P>
 From a rented recreational vehicle that has been her office since the Jan. 17 
quake damaged virtually every building on the 353-acre campus, Cal State 
Northridge President Blenda Wilson predicted that the university will meet its 
Feb. 14 reopening deadline, but only by using a patchwork of about 250 modular 
classrooms and holding many classes at off-campus sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "No university in the United States has ever suffered the degree of disaster 
we have experienced," Wilson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the damage will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, far 
exceeding the next highest sum she knows of, the estimated $11 million in 
damage at the University of Miami in Florida from Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 She urged students and faculty members to be patient with what will be a 
difficult recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the week, a contractor work force of about 300 will be rushing to 
set up the modular classrooms. Progress was slowed by Monday's storm, and only 
about 70 of the 250 units have been erected. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no official estimate of the damage yet, but calculations by campus 
administrators have ranged as high as $350 million. Bill Chatham, associate 
vice president for facilities, said engineers believe all of the campus's 
damaged structures -- even parts of its collapsed 2,500-space parking structure 
-- can be repaired. But the work could take years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said 250 modular classrooms and about 30 other portable 
buildings are being towed in from throughout California under the direction of 
J.A. Jones Construction of Los Angeles, the main contractor for the project. 
The month-to-month rentals alone are expected to cost the university about $5.5 
million over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The university's most prominent building, the Oviatt Library, is not expected 
to reopen until mid-March. Starting next week, the university plans to operate 
shuttles seven days a week between the Northridge campus and libraries at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials applauded news that preliminary enrollment figures for 
the spring semester show nearly 23,000 students -- only about 2,000 fewer than 
for a typical spring semester. But students will be able to drop and add 
classes for another several weeks, and Cal State Northridge officials are not 
sure how many of those registered actually will wind up attending the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the classes that had been offered before the earthquake still 
will be available, university Provost Louanne Kennedy said, the extensive 
damage to buildings has forced a drastic reshuffling of the class schedule. The 
result is that class times will range from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., and some will 
meet on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all lecture classes will be held in modular buildings on campus. But 
most specialized and laboratory classes will be held elsewhere, including at 
California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks; Mission, Pierce and Valley 
community colleges in the San Fernando Valley; UCLA; Glendale Community 
College, and even a Department of Water and Power building in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hardest-hit divisions was the School of Science & Mathematics. 
Based in a four-building complex, it was not only structurally damaged in the 
quake but suffered chemical contamination. Dean Donald Bianchi said one of the 
buildings may be available in several months, but the other three probably will 
not be used for the entire semester.

SALVOS INTENSIFY IN ROBERTI RECALL; CAMPAIGN: SENATOR'S FOES SAY THEY'RE 
GRASS-ROOTS POLITICAL REFORMERS. HE CALLS THAT LABEL A COVER FOR VINDICTIVE GUN 
FANATICS. 
</P>

 Depending on who's talking, the leaders of the effort to recall State Sen. 
David A. Roberti (D-Van Nys) are an eclectic coalition of madder-than-hell 
good-government proponents or a secretive bunch of vindictive gun nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall advocates claim to be grass-roots reformers who see Roberti, who was 
the powerful state Senate president pro tempore for 13 years, as epitomizing a 
political system gone haywire with soft-on-crime liberalism, corruption, 
arrogance and deal-making. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberti, who last week became the first state lawmaker in 80 years to be 
forced into a recall election, has rejected attempts to characterize his foes 
as anything other than vengeful -- and potentially dangerous -- gun fanatics 
angry with him for his bill that led to a 1989 assault-weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what this is all about," Roberti said at a news conference last month 
as he held up an outlawed Uzi assault weapon.  
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said recall leader Bill Dominguez, who accuses Roberti of demonizing 
his foes to avoid dealing with their charges that he is a carpetbagger who 
tolerated the political corruption that has scandalized the Legislature in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dominguez also has acknowledged that the recall leadership has had a 
political marriage of convenience with gun activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we called them (gun activists) for financial help, it was almost a 
situation of them being ready to mortgage their houses," Dominguez said. "But 
call up someone and ask them to contribute to a movement to stop corruption in 
government, and they'd say, 'That's nice -- we'll get back to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But while Dominguez, 43, a systems analyst with Transamerica Insurance Group 
and candidate in the recall election, denies that gun issues are the driving 
force behind his own political activism, he nevertheless shares with 2nd 
Amendment enthusiasts the belief that gun control is liberalism's failed 
substitute for getting tough on criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I've been hanging around these 2nd Amendment people too long," 
Dominguez said recently, joking about their influence. Dominguez, whose father 
was a political refugee from Castro's Cuba, also ran against Roberti in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall movement has paid a price for its alliance with the 
anti-gun-control forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Such ties have handed Roberti valuable ammunition in his bid to paint his foes 
as single-issue activists. Handgun Control Inc., sponsor of the federal Brady 
bill, has jumped to Roberti's defense. Roberti aides have said they hope to 
turn the recall, scheduled for April 12, into a national referendum on gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the recall movement cannot be easily dismissed as merely a puppet of 
the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, among the five official proponents of the recall are Glenn 
Bailey, 38, an Encino educator and longtime environmental activist; Hans 
Rusche, 63, an engineering company executive and local leader in Ross Perot's 
United We Stand movement, and Dolores White, 59, a real estate broker and 
veteran activist in county and state Republican party circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusche said recently: "This gun thing has been played up too much by Roberti 
and the media. There's no question these people are involved. But the NRA 
(National Rifle Assn.) hasn't supported us with money." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Rusche said, he applauds Roberti's assault-weapon ban. "Such 
high-tech weapons belong on the battlefield, not on our streets," he said in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bailey and White ran against Roberti in 1992. White and seven others, 
including Dominguez and a Canoga Park gun dealer, filed this week as candidates 
to replace Roberti if the recall succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on Monday, state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, who has represented the 
Westside for two decades in Sacramento, announced that he will run in the 
regular election this spring for the Senate seat now held by Roberti. Roberti's 
current term expires in December, and due to term limits he is ineligible to 
run for reelection. In effect, if he is recalled, Roberti's successor in the 
April 12 election would serve only until December. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal faced a difficult reelection campaign because the 1990 
reapportionment radically changed his constituency. His surprise decision to 
run for the 20th District seat held by Roberti was quickly endorsed by the key 
leadership of the political organization run by U.S. Reps. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City) and Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 But critics swiftly likened the Rosenthal decision to Roberti's own 
controversial move to the San Fernando Valley -- from Hollywood -- in 1992 and 
predicted that it would help the recall movement by fueling the community's 
anger against over-the-hill politicians trying to set up shop in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Roberti revisited," White complained. 
</P>
<P>
 In more recent weeks, the recall has captured the support of a number of 
taxpayer, victims' rights and government watchdog advocates. They include Ted 
Costa, president of People's Advocate, a group founded by the late tax fighter 
Paul Gann; Ralph Morrell, a state capital gadfly, and Kevin Washburn, a leader 
in the "three strikes and you're out" anti-crime initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Roberti camp claims such views and diversity are the exception and not 
the rule in a movement spawned by the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Roberti thesis got a major boost when the media obtained a lengthy 
confidential memo, laden with sinister, threatening rhetoric, written to the 
NRA by recall advocate Russ Howard, a South Bay resident. In the memo, Roberti 
is graphically described as the target of the anti-gun control movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beast is wounded," the memo says in one section, a reference to Roberti's 
costly 1992 struggle to win election to the Valley-based seat of former state 
Sen. Alan Robbins. "It's time to go in for the kill before he can run for 
something like attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard has justified the memo's strident anti-gun control language as a 
natural part of a sales pitch to lure official NRA support for the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's involvement with the recall also stems from his participation in a 
failed 1990 campaign to block the reelection of former state Sen. Mike Roos. 
Howard said he joined the anti-Roos campaign because of the 1989 assault 
weapons ban, which Roos co-authored. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Dominguez and Howard say they have gotten no help from the 
NRA for their current recall drive. "I would have killed to have gotten their 
mailing list (of 350,000 California members)," Dominguez has admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall advocates say the success of their recall petition drive proves that 
theirs is not a single-issue campaign. More than 20,000 registered voters 
signed the recall petitions that outlined -- as required by law -- the 
proponents' five-point argument for recalling Roberti (only the last mentions 
gun control), as well as the senator's rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, a stockbroker who holds an MBA from UCLA, says he resents being 
portrayed as a gun fanatic. He points to the fact -- confirmed by other sources 
-- that he was the first research director for the Proposition 174 school 
voucher campaign. He also claims to have been an avid precinct worker for the 
campaign to oust former California Supreme Court Chief Justice Rose Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, 37, a lifetime NRA member, insists that it is Roberti's alleged 
political abuses that have motivated his drive to oust the senator. It was in 
1990 that Howard met Dominguez and joined Californians Against Corruption, a 
group that was organized around the effort to defeat Roos. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, based in Signal Hill, was founded by Dominguez and Richard L. 
Carone, a Rancho Palos Verdes resident and president of Finley Oil Well 
Services, an oil drilling maintenance firm that has publicly reported revenues 
of $5 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most controversial member of the activist group has been Cuban 
emigre Manuel Fernandez, who once told The Times that the "whole purpose of the 
recall of Roberti is retribution" for his assault-weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Fernandez was convicted of illegally owning a machine gun.  
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the Fernandez conviction, Roberti campaign press secretary Staci 
Walters said this week said: "This is just another example of the fact that the 
recall proponents have clear motives to wreak revenge on Sen. Roberti because 
of his leadership on banning assault weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 With or without Fernandez, Californians Against Corruption is little more than 
a front for the NRA, according to Roberti. His backers have filed complaints 
with the state Fair Political Practices Commission, alleging that the group 
violated state law by failing to disclose a $5,000 contribution received in 
1990 from the NRA.

COUNTY CLEARS 2 OFFICERS IN SHOOTING DEATH; PROBE: DESPITE FLAWS IN POLICE 
ACCOUNT, DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE SAYS KILLING OF DARRELL HARTS DID NOT MEET 
THE STANDARDS FOR FILING CRIMINAL CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 County prosecutors announced Monday that they had decided not to file criminal 
charges against two Los Angeles police officers who shot and killed an off-duty 
security guard in April in an incident that has created controversy in 
Southeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers said they shot Darrell Harts, 30, after he fired at them near 
93rd and Main streets shortly before 8 p.m. on April 5. The officers, who were 
in the neighborhood in an unmarked car on a drug stakeout, said they approached 
Harts after hearing gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 They officers said they shouted out that they were policemen, but that Harts 
fired a pistol first, setting off a gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, however, Harts' family and friends have challenged the police 
account, saying it is inconceivable that he would have shot at police because 
he was friendly with many officers and was trying to become a police officer 
himself. Harts' supporters formed a committee and held numerous vigils at the 
Southeast Division police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite finding some inconsistencies in the stories of Officers Bruce Nelson 
and Brett Richards, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said the 
case did not meet the standards for filing criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because this claim of self-defense cannot be effectively or completely 
refuted, we conclude that it cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt . . . 
that the shooting of Darrell Harts was criminal under the circumstances," wrote 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard M. Goul, who headed the office's investigation into 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of our review of the evidence . . . and our legal analysis, we will 
take no further action in this matter and consider the case closed," Goul wrote 
to the Board of Police Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goul's report said aspects of the incident remained a mystery, and that 
"The details of the circumstances of his (Harts') death may never be known." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the report raises questions about the conduct of the two officers, 
saying that Richards and Nelson changed the account they initially gave police 
investigators -- after the investigators visited the scene and found that Harts 
had not fired as many shots as the officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also noted that some neighbors said they had not heard the officers 
identify themselves to Harts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discrepancies in the number of shots and issuance of police warnings 
could result from faulty recollection or willful deceit," Goul wrote. "But the 
self-defense doctrine does not require that the officers were fired upon 
repeatedly, nor does it require that they issue any warning before shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "More importantly, two civilian witnesses said that Darrell Harts fired his 
gun prior to being fired upon. Forensic tests determined that three shots were 
fired from Mr. Harts' gun." 
</P>
<P>
 The report concluded that the early evening confrontation was set off when 
Harts shot his neighbor's pit bull, drawing the officers' attention. The dog's 
owners told police they saw Harts shoot the dog, and other neighbors said they 
had heard Harts issue threats about the pit bull, which had attacked his dog 
three months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But family and friends described Harts, who was returning from his job as a 
guard, as a model citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the county coroner's office found no gunshot residue on Harts' hands 
when they examined him, which increased the family's suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's report, however, gave a possible explanation for the earlier test 
result. It states that personnel at Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital, where 
Harts was treated after the shooting, found gloves, along with other 
possessions, on his gurney. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, LAPD criminalist Leonard Henkhaus concluded that 
"particles unique to gunshot residue were detected on both the right and left 
gloves as well as the right sleeve of Mr. Harts' jacket," the report added. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither paramedics nor officers at the scene could remember if Harts was 
wearing the gloves, according to Goul's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very disappointed" in the district attorney's decision, said Cameron 
Stewart, an attorney who represents the Harts family. "I think that there are a 
lot of questions that have not been answered. I have talked to Darrell's family 
and they told me he never wore gloves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The family filed a claim for damages with the city, which was denied in 
November, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police spokesman Lt. John Dunkin said he had not seen the report, which was 
sent to Chief Willie L. Williams and the officers, and thus was unable to 
comment on it.  
</P>
<P>
 In September, the FBI disclosed that it had opened a federal civil rights 
investigation into the shooting of Harts, who was black. The officers are 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI spokesman said Monday that the investigation is ongoing.

SCOTT HARRIS: A NEW LIFE DAWNS AFTER HER CLOSE CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On her 33rd birthday, her fiance broke off their engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 At the junior high school where she works as a teacher, she counseled seven 
students who had contemplated suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a tough year," Linda Victor says. 
</P>
<P>
 She says this with a smile, having acquired a certain perspective. She knows 
she's better off without that old boyfriend. And though counseling troubled 
adolescents can be frustrating, it's far better than attending their funerals, 
as she had done the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, because she came so very close to attending her own, Linda Victor, 
one of the luckiest survivors of the earthquake disaster at the Northridge 
Meadows Apartments, says she can't help but be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people know what life has to offer," she says. "There's so much 
you can do -- and I'm here to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's strange how life works out. For a week or so, Linda Victor didn't want to 
talk to anybody but family and friends about her ordeal. Now she is effusive, 
sharing a scrapbook filled with newspaper clippings and photographs of the 
ruins where 16 of her neighbors died. 
</P>
<P>
 She refers to a graphic of the apartment that appeared in The Times. "That was 
my apartment," she says, pointing to apartment No. 126. 
</P>
<P>
 The three closest units are No. 127, No. 124 and No. 123. The residents in 
each were killed, trapped in the collapse of the three-story structure. Linda 
Victor's apartment was as flattened as theirs, yet she emerged with only a 
small cut on her left leg. "It's healed already," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Linda Victor survive? Even she still wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 She woke up with a bed moving like a roller coaster. Linda, who grew up in the 
San Fernando Valley, thought of running for the door but the motion was too 
violent. She was on her knees, riding the bed in the darkness. Suddenly she 
felt herself choking, unable to breathe. Why, she isn't sure. Then something 
hit her on the head. What, she isn't sure. Then she was outside in the frigid 
night air, wearing only a T-shirt and underwear. How she got there, she isn't 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some phenomena that may be fathomed only in retrospect, and even 
then it's just guesswork. Perhaps she was choking on dust and plaster -- or was 
it the sensation of the walls and ceiling closing in? Was she struck by a lamp, 
a book -- or the ceiling itself? There is little doubt that she escaped through 
a window. The earthquake itself, it seems, pitched her toward the opening just 
as the walls collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceiling now rests flat on her bed. The window that provided her escape is 
now a tiny opening in the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 Dazed and shivering, she joined other survivors. She could hear the cries of 
neighbors trapped inside -- "Help me! Please, help me!" She worried, 
especially, about Ruth Wilhelm, the lonely widow who lived next door in No. 127 
with whom she had formed a neighborly friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really nice. She was widowed last year. She was a lonely lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Many victims would die of suffocation, crushed in their beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Victor remembers a girl named Sharon who lived on the second floor. 
Sharon had climbed onto her balcony. "I could reach up and help her down," 
Linda recalls. "Later it hit me. I could reach her because the people below 
were crushed." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a few hours before Linda's parents would find her. Their own home, the 
home Linda grew up in, incurred the kind of damage that seems typical -- fallen 
walls, chimney damage, broken plumbing. "It took two days just to pick up 
things so you could walk around that house," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Only later would Linda think about her material losses. Firefighters retrieved 
a TV, a VCR, a lamp, some clothes. But the old blue Cadillac her father had 
given her was crushed. The English teacher who collected 3,000 books, including 
"everything Somerset Maugham ever wrote," was left with none. The kitchen whiz 
lost valuable cooking ware and dozens of cookbooks. She'll never be able to 
replace the vase that a friend had given her while traveling in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something else she hasn't recovered -- a small item she'd picked up 
the day before the quake. Linda Victor thought it might spruce up the place and 
help her out of her funk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had really hit a low point, with all this suicide counseling, after the 
holidays," she recalls. "The kids would tell me horrible stories, really 
tragic." Linda Victor was thinking about a new career -- or at least a new 
school. "I just knew I needed a change." 
</P>
<P>
 To cheer herself up she bought some welcome mats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so excited," she says, laughing now at the thought. "I had just put 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
 So now Linda Victor thinks of the possibilities. She could travel. Maybe 
she'll leave Southern California. Perhaps a new career. She has always thought 
it would be nice to have her own bakery . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But before the possibilities come the responsibilities. And last Thursday, as 
classes resumed at San Fernando Middle School, she was back in the usual 
classroom, back to being "Miss Victor." 
</P>
<P>
 A few students already knew her story: "I saw you on the news, Miss Victor!" 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first chores for teachers was to remind students of the earthquake 
drill -- that students should duck under their desks for protection. Miss 
Victor warned her first period class that she, for one, would go outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few minutes later, an aftershock measuring above 4.0 put everybody to 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Victor, as promised, went out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she adds with a smile, it wasn't as if she panicked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked smoothly."

<P>
 Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey said Monday that they are upgrading the 
magnitude of the Northridge earthquake from 6.6 to 6.7, based on their analyses 
and the results of digital seismographs from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 An official announcement of an upgraded magnitude is also expected this week 
from the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., a Geological 
Survey spokeswoman said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE; 
70 ANTI-SEMITIC FLYERS FOUND IN SCHOOL LOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department is investigating the stuffing of 70 anti-Semitic 
flyers into student lockers at two La Canada Flintridge schools over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 flyers were found Monday morning at La Canada High School and 30 
flyers were discovered at the Ability Plus School, a private elementary school, 
said sheriff's spokesman George Ducoulombier.The flyers contained caricatures 
of Jews, talked about deadly violence against Jews and listed a telephone 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 James E. Stratton, principal of La Canada High, said the student lockers are 
outside the school buildings and are accessible to anyone who trespasses onto 
the unguarded campus. Stratton said it is impossible to patrol the school 24 
hours a day, but he visited each classroom Monday to express his revulsion at 
the flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not something that the school in any way condones," Stratton said.

PRICE OF BIRD'S FREEDOM: 18 MONTHS IN PRISON FOR QUARANTINE OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nan Crandall, the bird lover, got 18 months in prison Monday. All that time 
because of the rare yellow-tailed black cockatoo. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge William Byrnes said he did not want to give her that stiff 
a sentence, that it was too much considering the crime, but he had no choice 
because of the state's mandatory sentencing laws. He said a first-time bank 
robber would get less time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I'd never laid eyes on that bird," said the 62-year-old Crandall who, 
until the cockatoo caper, was never out of sorts with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Crandall was convicted of accepting gratuities -- read that five 
birds -- from commercial dealers in exchange for releasing their shipments from 
quarantine early when she worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She 
swears she did not know it was a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 But the incident that began the march to the courtroom was when she let the 
cockatoo out of federal quarantine too early at the behest of a federal 
undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, an agent with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, posing as a dealer, 
asked if she could expedite the 30-day quarantine requirement for the 
yellow-tailed black cockatoo he was importing from New Zealand. Crandall 
complied, later saying she feared that the bird would contract the deadly beak 
and feather disease that had infected the quarantine area months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents discovered during their investigation that she had accepted five birds 
from other dealers for whom she had eased the quarantine requirements. Because 
she was a government employee, parts of the mandatory sentencing applied to her 
case that did not to others caught in the sting operation. Byrnes called the 
sentence "absurd" but said there was nothing he could do. 
</P>
<P>
 Her court-appointed lawyer, David R. Reed of Beverly Hills, described the 
sentence as being "like dogs piling on a rabbit." J. MICHAEL KENNEDY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; STATE'S 
QUAKE DAMAGE ESTIMATE TO BE DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson said Monday the state's estimate of total 
damage from the Northridge earthquake, which the governor said would be 
announced by now, has been delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a huge disaster," said Paul Kranhold, a gubernatorial press aide. 
"New things keep popping up all the time. We will have the damage estimate as 
soon as we can, probably sometime later this week. It's a big job. We had a 
huge aftershock last week. Now we have bad weather." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said earlier he believed that quake damage would run between $15 
billion and $30 billion and that a more exact estimate would be made by Monday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EMERGENCY 
FOOD STAMP PROGRAM ENDS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County welfare workers will stop accepting applications for emergency food 
stamps after today, an official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 After today, "earthquake victims could possibly qualify for the regular food 
stamp program," said Mary Robertson, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public 
Social Services."It would depend on their income and expenses."  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture authorized the emergency program for 15 
days only. The use of food stamps as disaster relief is unprecedented, 
Robertson said. "As of Saturday, it was 213,000 (applications)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 People who never received food stamps could qualify for the special program if 
they suffered earthquake-related losses. Applicants must have been living in 
Los Angeles County at the time of the quake and had to meet income eligibility 
requirements. According to officials, the lines at 16 application centers have 
shortened, and the application process has quickened. County workers are giving 
priority to elderly and disabled people waiting in line. 
</P>
<P>
 Those physically unable to go to application centers can name an authorized 
representative to apply on their behalf. The representatives must bring 
personal identification and identification of the person for whom they are 
applying. They must know the household's circumstances and bring a letter 
naming them as the authorized representative.

BOARD TO FIGHT ANTI-IMMIGRANT MOVES

 The Los Angeles Board of Education voted to oppose any effort by the state 
Legislature to deny free public education to children who are illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Leticia Quezada said any move to remove those children from 
public schools would be "incredibly abhorrent."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK; AIRPORT ASKS 
FAA TO OK $3 PASSENGER SURCHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to jump-start funding and construction of a new terminal, Burbank 
Airport officials Monday asked the federal government for permission to impose 
a $3 fee on all outbound passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport authority commissioners hope the levy -- which could begin by summer's 
end -- would raise about $6 million a year to subsidize improvements that would 
accompany a larger terminal.The "passenger facility charge" would automatically 
be added onto ticket prices for anyone flying out of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 If the authority's request is approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, 
as is expected within six to nine months, Burbank would join other area 
airports, including Los Angeles International and Ontario, in assessing the $3 
surcharge, the maximum allowable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other Southern California airports, including Long Beach, San Diego 
and John Wayne International in Orange County, do not charge facility fees, 
according to their representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Blueprints call for a new terminal to cover 670,000 square feet, four times 
more than the current building. Officials say a larger terminal is necessary to 
handle the 10 million passengers projected to come through Burbank Airport 
yearly by 2010.

COLISEUM WARNING UNHEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Dec. 2, 1992, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission unanimously 
approved a "project description" for its $15-million Coliseum renovation for 
1993 that stated that no "permanent seismic retrofit or seismic strengthening 
work" was to be done on the facility, according to official minutes released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote came a year after Nabib Youssef, a structural engineer working for 
the commission's architects, HNTB of Kansas City, Mo., submitted a report 
warning that the Coliseum did not meet the city's seismic safety code and could 
be subject to severe damage if a large earthquake struck.  
</P>
<P>
 But the commission president at the time, labor leader Bill Robertson, and the 
chairman of its renovation committee, attorney N. Matthew Grossman, now say 
they and other commissioners did not see that report and knew nothing of the 
seismic risk. The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday will consider ordering 
an investigation of whether anyone is liable for not showing the report to the 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban on a seismic retrofit was incorporated in the renovation contract with 
the Tutor-Saliba Co. and approved by the commission. The renovation, completed 
last August, lowered the playing field and put in thousands of new seats close 
to the action.  
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Coliseum has sustained major damage in the Jan. 17 quake and 
ensuing aftershocks, some suggest that the failure to alert commissioners to 
the seismic risk could lead to a lawsuit. The 1991 Youssef report was not 
turned over to the commission until last week -- 16 days after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs said the inquiry would "find out who knew the 
information about the danger when, and then, legally, was there a duty to 
disclose it? 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Youssef nor the architect at HNTB who directed the preparation of 
Coliseum renovation plans, Terry Miller, returned telephone calls inquiring why 
the report was not turned over. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Coliseum's private manager, Spectacor Management Group, has 
backed off from earlier statements that a copy of the report had been submitted 
to it but not turned over to the commission because it was viewed as only a 
"preconstruction" document. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Spectacor, Cindy Rubin, said Monday: "No one at SMG 
remembers getting the report. . . . It was done for HNTB. We're trying to find 
out who they gave copies to." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Hagerman, a Spectacor employee who became Coliseum general manager in 
1993, said: "We are currently working to put together a complete chronology of 
events to determine who received copies." 
</P>
<P>
 Spectacor, he said, gave up its role in Coliseum renovation in August, 1992, 
and "since that time, we have not had access to information relating to the 
renovation." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's renovation project manager, Don C. Webb, said Monday he too 
was kept in the dark about Youssef's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb and others said the Los Angeles Conservancy, a preservationist group, 
suggested the ban against a seismic retrofit.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the group said they wanted to forestall work that would change 
the appearance of the Coliseum, a national historic landmark, without an 
environmental review.  
</P>
<P>
 The officials said they would not have opposed a retrofit had they been told 
it was necessary.

 A former Jewish Defense League activist was sentenced to life in prison Monday 
for his role in the 1980 mail bomb death of a secretary at a Manhattan Beach 
computer company. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Manning, 42, fought extradition from Israel for nearly two years before 
he was returned to Los Angeles and convicted Oct. 14 of mailing the explosive 
package that killed 32-year-old Patricia Wilkerson. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian cited the "callous" and "hideous" nature 
of Manning's crime in sentencing him to the maximum term. Manning will be 
eligible for parole in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Manning, in this court's opinion, is clearly a danger to society," 
Tevrizian said, adding that the life sentence is commensurate with Manning's 
"utter disregard for the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was sentenced, Manning denied involvement in what he called a 
"horrible crime" and asked the judge to recommend that he be imprisoned in 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is sickening to me," Manning said. "I wouldn't have anything 
to do with this sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning's attorney, who had asked at the start of the court session to be 
removed from the case, told Tevrizian after the sentence was pronounced that 
his client should be eligible for parole after 10 years. Attorney Richard 
Sherman said the federal statute in place in 1980 called for a maximum term of 
30 years, with a parole date in one-third that time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tevrizian refused to revise his sentence, telling Manning and Sherman that 
they could appeal the conviction and the sentence if they believed it was 
wrongly imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Also accused of complicity in the murder and scheduled for trial in July are 
Manning's wife, Rochelle, 53, and former real estate agent William Ross. 
Rochelle Manning is fighting extradition from Israel. Ross was recently 
returned to Los Angeles after fleeing to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're elated with the sentencing, and we feel it closes a chapter in this 
horrendous case," said Michael Ahern, acting chief postal inspector in charge 
of the Los Angeles division, whose agents investigated the bombing. "We're 
looking to the trials of the remaining two defendants." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahern and his agents doggedly pursued Manning and his wife and fought for 
their extradition from Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have said that Ross was embroiled in a real estate dispute and 
lawsuit with Wilkerson's employer, Brenda Crouthamel-Adams, who ran the 
computer firm ProWest with her husband. Ross enlisted the Mannings to build and 
mail the bomb, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouthamel-Adams was too busy to open the cardboard box when it arrived, so 
she left it on Wilkerson's chair, prosecutors said. When Wilkerson unwrapped 
the package later in the day, she found a metal device, prosecutors said. 
Accompanying it were instructions to plug it into an electrical outlet to hear 
a recorded message. Wilkerson plugged in the device, triggering a blast that 
killed her and destroyed the ProWest offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Manning also has been named by federal authorities as the prime suspect 
in the 1985 bombing death in Santa Ana of Alex Odeh, head of the American-Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee's western office. Manning has not been charged in 
that case. And he is a suspect in several other bombings linked to the late 
Rabbi Meir Kahane, a militant Jewish leader assassinated in New York in 1990, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Odeh's death, the Mannings moved to Israel. Meanwhile, investigators in 
this country found the couple's fingerprints on the carton in which the bomb 
that killed Wilkerson had been sent. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1988, Rochelle Manning returned to the United States, where she and 
Ross were tried in the Wilkerson killing. Both were released after a jury was 
unable to reach a verdict. Rochelle Manning then returned to Israel.

QUAKE UNLEASHES BARRAGE OF LEGISLATION; RECOVERY: COUNTY, CONGRESS SEEK TO HELP 
VICTIMS CLEAR DEBRIS, WITHDRAW IRA FUNDS WITHOUT PENALTY AND SAVE MONEY ON 
TAXES. OTHER STEPS TARGET RESPONSE IN FUTURE EMERGENCIES.

<P>
 Now that the Southland has survived the earthquake, its attendant gas fires, 
blackouts and bad water, here comes the predictable landslide -- of legislation 
that is. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors and Congress are weighing in with a wide 
variety of proposals to aid the affected, haul away the debris, cut taxes, 
figure out what went wrong -- and right -- and begin preparations for the next 
natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks after the quake struck, the supervisors have half a dozen 
proposals on their agenda for this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Deane Dana is asking county officials to develop a "mutual aid" 
network for social service workers, to work like the existing network of fire 
and law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich has asked for a list of rules and regulations that 
have been ignored in the interests of rapid response. He then wants to 
eliminate or modify those rules "that make our county slower or less 
effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke is seeking to establish a program called 
Project: Good Neighbor, a sort of Peace Corps for county workers who could 
donate their "time and talents in special volunteer projects to assist disaster 
recovery efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Washington, lawmakers have also begun to introduce bills to 
assist victims of the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), announced at a North Hollywood news 
conference Monday that he was introducing legislation to allow victims of the 
earthquake and other natural disasters to deduct 100% of their losses when 
preparing their federal income taxes. "Present tax law is clearly inadequate 
when it comes to disasters of this magnitude," said Berman, whose northeast San 
Fernando Valley district suffered widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Current law allows taxpayers to deduct uninsured property losses only after 
they exceed 10% of adjusted gross income. Berman's bill would be applicable to 
federally declared disaster losses occurring on or after Jan. 17, 1994 -- the 
date of the magnitude 6.7 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), whose Ventura County district also 
suffered some hardship, has introduced a bill to allow the victims of natural 
disasters to withdraw funds from their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) to 
pay for repairs without facing the usual penalty for such withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly's measure would waive the withdrawal penalties for any region 
designated a federal disaster area in the wake of an earthquake, flood, 
hurricane or other natural calamity. It would cover withdrawals in Southern 
California made after Jan. 17.

MAN RECEIVES 4 LIFE TERMS IN QUADRUPLE SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old man was sentenced Monday to four consecutive life terms without 
the possibility of parole for the execution-style murders of four men during a 
robbery in which he netted virtually nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 David Brinson was convicted in October of shooting Robert Marks, a 59-year-old 
retired tavern owner, and three other men on June 12, 1990, in Marks' garage 
apartment on South Burnside Avenue in the Mid-Wilshire district. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinson faced the death penalty, but the jury could not agree on the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution agreed not to retry the penalty phase in exchange for 
Brinson's promise not to appeal his case. Superior Court Judge George Trammell 
sentenced Brinson on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will save the taxpayers a lot of money" that otherwise would have to be 
spent on impaneling a new jury, Deputy Dist. Atty. Teri Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The families of the victims were satisfied with the arrangement, Schwartz 
added, because "they know he won't be getting out of prison in this life." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the murders, Marks' neighbors told police that the retiree had 
lived quietly in the neighborhood for years, but had recently begun to have 
streams of visitors. They suspected he had begun selling drugs, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses testified that Brinson thought Marks was a high-level cocaine dealer 
and went to his apartment with a gun and two accomplices seeking money and 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brinson ransacked the residence and found only a small amount of 
marijuana, the witnesses said, he shot each of the four men in the back of the 
head as they lay face down on the floor of a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The other victims were Marks' roommate, Gene McCullars, 28, and visitors 
Celedinio Ligtas, 33, and William Terry, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 They had gathered at the apartment to watch a basketball game on television. A 
fifth man who arrived later found the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said she too thought Marks may have been selling drugs but not on the 
level that Brinson imagined.

MONEY SKILLS FOR FINANCIALLY LITERATE CHILDREN OF ALL AGES

 Some guidelines for teaching children about money: 
</P>
<P>
 * Preschool: By the time they're toilet-trained, most children are already 
familiar with the rudimentary workings of money -- that it's needed to buy 
stuff and that some coins and bills will buy more stuff than others. Young 
children are also beginning to pick up attitudes about money from their parents 
as they observe them shopping for groceries, paying bills or just talking at 
dinner. Bonnie Drew, author of "Money Skills: 101 Activities to Teach Your 
Child About Money," recommends making a game out of teaching preschoolers money 
skills, like creating a pretend toy store with a play cash register and play 
money, or making picture flash cards of money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Grade school: Most children are ready for weekly allowances when they start 
school. Experts discourage tying allowances to regular household chores but 
encourage paying extra for additional work. How much is doled out depends on a 
child's needs and the household income. According to Zillions, the kids' 
version of Consumer Reports magazine, the average is a dollar a week for each 
grade a child is in. Experts suggest paying in single bills or coins. Drew 
suggests having the child divide an allowance into three parts for spending, 
saving and sharing. Neale S. Godfrey, author of "The Kids' Money Book," 
proposes slightly different categories -- spending, short-term saving and 
long-term saving -- and even recommends setting some money aside for "taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 * Junior high and high school: By age 12, many children are earning money 
outside the home -- baby-sitting or mowing lawns, for example. Experts suggest 
raising allowances at this point to teach youngsters how to budget each month 
for things like clothes, movies and school supplies. It's important to have 
them stick to that budget, they say. "They'll learn that they can buy those 
expensive designer clothes, but they may not be able to buy much else," says 
Godfrey. Some parents phase out allowances by the time their children turn 16 
and are getting regular paychecks from part-time jobs. Teen-agers should be 
encouraged to open a savings account and to consider investments. Some banks 
offer special accounts with low fees, while a few mutual funds let investors 
get started for as little as $250. 
</P>
<P>
 * College: Living within a budget is especially important now, as many 
students will be out on their own for the first time. If they haven't learned 
the concept by now, there are a number of self-help and personal finance books 
available today. Students will need to open a checking account, but experts are 
split on whether a credit card is necessary. Proponents say credit cards allow 
young adults to build a credit history while handling emergency expenses. But 
opponents say they only entice students to spend more than they have. Godfrey 
suggests getting a secured card with a $500 or $1,000 deposit that can be used 
for emergencies.

BETHLEHEM STEEL CHIEF HOPES TO BREAK CYCLE OF LOSSES; INDUSTRY: A SYMBOL OF 
SMOKESTACK AMERICA, THE COMPANY IS A SHELL OF ITS FORMER SELF, BUT THIS YEAR IS 
EXPECTED TO BE PROFITABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Curtis H. Barnette joined Bethlehem Steel Corp. when it still made money and 
paid dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter-century later, the company's chairman and chief executive is hoping 
to break a cycle of losses and restructurings at Bethlehem, one of the nation's 
best-known steelmakers and a symbol of smokestack America. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethlehem today is a shell of its former sprawling self, but like other 
companies in the American steel industry, it has grown smarter and more 
efficient, learning the hard lessons of complacency in a global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is taking on small, nimble competitors and exploring such new and 
largely untapped steel markets as residential construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnette also has taken a lead role in fighting for what the domestic steel 
industry regards as its vital interests. He is considered an articulate and 
influential critic of foreign steelmakers, who in his view are undermining the 
global steel market with unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 While it hasn't paid a dividend since December, 1991, Bethlehem did report a 
profit in the third quarter last year after 11 consecutive unprofitable 
quarters. In the fourth quarter, the company went into the red again from the 
onetime cost of revamping its structural products business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect that Bethlehem will be profitable for the year 1994," Barnette said 
in releasing the final quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 When extraordinary adjustments to Bethlehem's balance sheet aren't included, 
the company made $47 million in the fourth quarter, exceeding most analyst 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was impressive, but my concern is still industry fundamentals," said Vahid 
Fathi, metals analyst for Kemper Securities, a Chicago investment firm. He 
projects earnings of $1.15 to $1.50 a share for 1994, below the consensus of 
$1.80. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the European steel companies are gearing up production to flood our 
market, because the U.S. market is the only bright spot as far as demand is 
concerned," Fathi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnette said the company does not expect a disruptive surge of imports, but 
he has learned to assume nothing in the tough world of steelmaking. "It would 
be regrettable if we saw a surge of unfair trade," he said. "We are prepared to 
deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan Estra, who follows Bethlehem for Merrill Lynch & Co., said he foresees 
better than expected earnings over the next year or two and believes the 
company's stock is a bargain at its current price in the low $20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that they are continuing to remake the company under Barnette's 
leadership to focus on quality products, catering to an ever more fussy 
customer base," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethlehem was founded in 1904 by Charles M. Schwab, one of Andrew Carnegie's 
top lieutenants. The company's only losing years through 1981 were in 1932, 
1933 and 1977. But starting with 1982, the company has rung up only three 
annual profits -- in 1987, 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The dividend to shareholders, a usually sacrosanct corporate expense that 
management cuts only as a last resort, was suspended for 15 quarters from 1985 
to 1989 and again since the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnette, 59, said he's cautious about predicting a sustained profit for 
Bethlehem, which has shrunk to a shadow of the behemoth that made a ship a day 
during World War II and made the steelwork for landmarks from Rockefeller Plaza 
in New York to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very cyclical business," he said in a recent interview from the 
company's hometown of Bethlehem in eastern Pennsylvania. "I tend at this early 
point to do this one step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnette said his goals are to create a more efficient and quality-conscious 
company while seeking new markets for Bethlehem products. "I predict that we 
may see steel as the material of choice in the housing industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, only about 2% of homes are framed with steel, said Michael 
Carliner, an economist with the National Assn. of Home Builders in Washington. 
"But there is a lot of interest in steel among home builders," he said, citing 
sharp rises in wood prices as a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnette also expressed optimism about steel's role in rebuilding the nation's 
infrastructure. "Bridges and roads and a lot of the water systems throughout 
America -- that's a building opportunity, a steel opportunity, whose time has 
come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney by training and a former Army counterintelligence officer, 
Barnette succeeded Walter F. Williams as chairman and chief executive in 
November, 1992, after serving as general counsel and senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 During his first year as chief executive, Barnette presided over a 
reorganization that turned four divisions into separate business units -- Burns 
Harbor, Sparrows Point, Bethlehem Structural Products Corp. and Pennsylvania 
Steel Technologies Inc. The move was intended to give local managers more 
accountability for marketing, production and financial performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, Bethlehem has been the most bureaucratized of all the traditional 
steel companies," said John Jacobson, an independent management consultant 
based in Swarthmore, Pa. "Over the long haul, this is what's going to make or 
break the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Bethlehem also reached a new six-year labor contract with the United 
Steelworkers that freezes wages for three years and allows the company to 
impose more flexible work rules while the union gets to nominate a member of 
the company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Veritas Capital Inc., a New York investment firm, agreed in December to buy 
the former Bar, Rod & Wire Division in Johnstown, Pa., and Lackawanna, N.Y. A 
new corporation formed by Veritas and union members, BRW Steel Corp., plans to 
put 1,100 people back to work at the mills within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethlehem, which employed 131,000 people in the late 1960s, has exited several 
businesses and cut its work force to about 21,000 today. Barnette said he 
foresees employment closer to 18,000 as the company gets even leaner. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been very difficult years and there are some difficult years ahead," 
Barnette said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is never an end to your search to do things better."

CSUN CREWS RUSH TO REOPENING; EDUCATION: WITH WORKERS TOILING IN RAIN AND 
AROUND THE CLOCK, PRESIDENT BLENDA J. WILSON SAYS THE CAMPUS WILL MEET MONDAY 
DEADLINE FOR START OF CLASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Struggling with the wreckage of what Cal State Northridge officials say has 
become the worst disaster ever to strike a major U.S. university, hundreds of 
workers labored around the clock in the rain Monday to ready the campus for its 
scheduled reopening next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in a rented recreational vehicle that has become her office since the 
Jan. 17 Northridge quake damaged virtually every building on the 353-acre 
campus, CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson predicted that the university will meet 
its Monday reopening deadline, but only by utilizing a still-developing 
patchwork of about 250 modular classrooms and holding many classes at 
off-campus sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "No university in the United States has ever suffered the degree of disaster 
we have experienced," Wilson said Monday. "There has been no other incident 
that anyone knows about in which the entire campus of a university has been 
affected by a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the CSUN damage will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, 
making it "surely the costliest disaster to a major public higher educational 
institution in the country." She said the loss will far exceed the largest 
prior amount she could determine, an estimated $11 million damage to the 
University of Miami from Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 She urged students and faculty members to be patient with the difficult 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the week, a crew of about 300 people will be working 24 hours a day to 
set up the modular classrooms that Wilson said will probably become the 
university's primary shelters for the coming semester. But progress was slowed 
by the storm's winds and rain, and only about 70 of the 250 units were erected 
as of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no official estimate of the damage yet, but unofficial estimates by 
CSUN administrators have ranged as high as $350 million. However, CSUN 
Associate Vice President for Facilities Bill Chatham said engineers estimate 
that all of the campus' damaged structures -- potentially even parts of the 
2,500-space parking structure that collapsed -- can be repaired. But the work 
could take years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said the 250 modular classrooms and about 30 other 
portable buildings are being towed in from throughout California under the 
direction oA. Jones Construction of Los Angeles, the main contractor for the 
project. The month-to-month rentals alone are expected to cost the university 
about $5.5 million during the coming six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The university's most prominent building, the Oviatt Library, is not expected 
to open until mid-March because of damage and because the quake dumped an 
estimated 600,000 volumes, about half of its collection, onto the floors. 
Starting next week, the campus plans to run seven-days-a-week shuttles to take 
CSUN students to libraries at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials applauded news that preliminary enrollment figures for 
the spring semester show nearly 23,000 students -- only about 2,000 fewer than 
a typical spring semester. But students will be able to drop and add classes 
for another several weeks, and CSUN officials are not sure how many of those 
registered will actually attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the classes that had been scheduled before the earthquake 
still will be offered, said university Provost Louanne Kennedy, the extensive 
damage to university buildings has forced a drastic reshuffling of the campus's 
class schedule that will spread out more classes into early morning hours and 
nights -- from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. -- and even Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all lecture classes will be held in modular buildings on campus. But 
most specialized and laboratory classes are being sent elsewhere, including Cal 
Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks; Mission, Pierce and Valley community 
colleges in the San Fernando Valley; UCLA; Glendale Community College, and even 
a Department of Water and Power building in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the heaviest hit divisions was the School of Science and Mathematics, 
which is based in a four-building complex that not only was structurally 
damaged in the quake but also suffered chemical contamination. Dean Donald 
Bianchi said one of the buildings may be available in several months, but the 
other three probably will be out for the entire semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the contractors have only begun to erect the modular buildings, 
administrators are unable to provide students with the exact locations where 
their classes will be held. They hope to do so through a newspaper supplement 
planned for this weekend and by having guides and distributing the supplements 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Class information isn't the only item on campus that's hard to come by. CSUN's 
main source of on-campus student housing, University Park Apartments, is not 
due to begin reopening until this Thursday, and then students will be allowed 
to move in only in small numbers at first, university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The university's Matador Bookstore did open for the first time since the quake 
Monday, but drew only small numbers of students on a rainy morning compared to 
the crowds and long lines that typically form just a week before the start of 
classes. But for the few students who braved the rain and increasingly muddy 
campus, the ease of buying books was a pleasant change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time we didn't have to fight to get our books," said Helene 
McNeil, 30, a senior political science major from West Hills. She and friend 
Lisa Vaccaro, 31, a senior health education major from Van Nuys, arrived an 
hour before the 8 a.m. opening hoping to beat the crowd that never came. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected a line, but it's like a ghost town," Vaccaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so pleasant for students has been the earthquake-induced freeze on 
financial aid payments, the pair said. It is probable that no payments will be 
made until next Tuesday because the earthquake knocked out a computer system, 
and about $8 million in loan checks for students were recovered from the 
damaged administration building only last Friday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the financial crunch, the university is offering students up to 
$500 in emergency loans using $250,000 in funds from the Cal State system and 
allowing students to begin attending classes before making all their payments, 
officials said. But students said those arrangements do little to cover rent 
payments and other obligations.

VALLEY INTERVIEW / TARI WEISS; HOMEOWNER SAYS QUAKE-PROOFING EFFORTS WORKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowner Tari Weiss survived the Jan. 17 earthquake with practically all her 
possessions intact, unlike some of her neighbors in Calabasas Park. It wasn't 
luck. In November the real estate agent earthquake-proofed the two-story 
Mediterranean house where she lives with her husband, Gary, a commercial real 
estate broker, and their daughter, Bronte. She used an earthquake-preparedness 
firm, one of several listed in telephone yellow pages in the San Fernando 
Valley area. Weiss was interviewed by Times correspondent Kay Hwangbo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How did you get through the earthquake?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I knew that a lot of the large pieces in my daughter's bedroom had 
been bolted down, so I knew that there weren't going to be large pieces that 
were flying. She'd be OK, if we could just get to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the shaking stopped, we went downstairs to a place where we'd been told 
was probably the safest place in the house to be, and that's where we had this 
huge duffel bag filled with earthquake paraphernalia. We pulled out the 
flashlights, got the radio on and got the batteries into the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole time we were doing this the house was violently shaking. Plus, when 
it's dark, you're all that more at the mercy of whatever's happening. It's hard 
to prepare yourself at the time, so that's why you're prepared ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What prompted you to earthquake-proof your house?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I received a card in the mail from a girlfriend who was having, it sounds 
kind of strange, but an earthquake party. We couldn't make it. We were going 
out of town. So I had the man's name for months, and I don't know why, I just 
decided that I just needed to give him a call. Everybody keeps on asking me, 
"Why? How did you know? Are you a psychic?" It's just one of those things that 
somehow you just get a feeling to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 He came in the last week of November, and he came back like a week later and 
bolted everything in. He also secured the water heater. Later, his guy came out 
and put this auto gas-valve shut-off in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. A lot of people have heard about bolting or strapping down heavy appliances 
and furniture. How is this done exactly, and does it entail unsightly fastening 
devices?  
</P>
<P>
 A. With all the big, heavy furniture he took an L-bracket and he screwed it to 
the wall and to the furniture itself. Within the armoires where the televisions 
were, there is this industrial 3-D Velcro, and it's incredibly strong. And he 
secured it on the armoires and attached it to the TVs. And the same with all 
the artwork. There are special attachments that attach to the wall and also to 
the art itself. It's placed inside the pieces so that it's held even stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 You really can't see anything unless you look for it. I'm sure there are ways, 
if you really wanted to, to hide it. You can see some of the straps inside the 
armoire, but if you didn't point it out I don't think anybody would really 
notice it. It's not something that's going to aesthetically change how your 
house looks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What can be done to protect dishes, crystal and ornaments on shelves or 
side tables?  
</P>
<P>
 A. There is a product called Quake Hold. It looks similar to Silly Putty, and 
it is a way to secure small items like figurines, crystals, collectibles, 
knickknacks, stuff like that. You adhere it onto your collectible, and then you 
do a little twisting motion onto a surface like a desk or a mantelpiece or 
wherever you're going to put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I have a child, a 17-month-old, I had my whole house child-proofed, 
which means I have latches on all of my drawers. And that saved my entire 
kitchen. The only china that I had break were pieces that were display pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Can the Velcro, putty and bolts that you use do damage to woodwork or to 
the walls?  
</P>
<P>
 A. The bolting, yes. It goes through your plaster and your Sheetrock or 
whatever. But who cares? It's behind the piece of furniture that you're 
protecting. So when you move, you pull it out and you replaster if you want to 
change it. This Quake Hold says it's not supposed to cause any damage. But then 
it does say it may leave an oily residue on some surfaces. But you can clean it 
with lighter (fluid) or dry-cleaning fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 Look, you have a choice of either trying to save the item or save a tiny mark 
on a piece of furniture that it's adhered to, so I guess everybody has to make 
that decision for themselves. You put it underneath the glass, and you're going 
to see it, if it's on a glass shelf, but, ultimately on glass it's going to 
come off, so . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You mentioned the automatic gas shut-off valve. How does that work?  
</P>
<P>
 A. It's a small piece, and there's a ball bearing, and it's held up in some 
way, in a certain position. When the earth shakes at a large magnitude, the 
ball will drop, and when the ball drops, it runs the length of the valve and 
turns the valve off automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I understand that the Gas Co. does not recommend these shut-off valves, 
saying they unnecessarily turn off the gas in many cases.  
</P>
<P>
 A. The earthquake person told me that outside of the earthquake itself, most 
homes are damaged by fire because of gas leaks. He said that it's a good idea 
to have the gas shut off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What provisions did you lay by, in preparation for an earthquake, and which 
items did you find particularly helpful?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I purchased the largest duffel-bag kit. It's for five people, three days. 
It's like the super deluxe package. It's got the food and water, batteries and 
these extended-life flashlights and 12-hour candles and a Swiss army knife and 
a whistle, and it has things I can't even pronounce. Truck-pull ropes and hard 
hats and gloves and tape. This is for when you have major structural damage or 
if you've got doors that are jammed that you can't lift. There's rope, and 
there's kind of a pulley system you can put together. And of course a first-aid 
kit and Listerine and things. 
</P>
<P>
 When I told my friends that I had purchased this, I've never been so harassed 
in my life. I've got to tell you, after it hit everybody wanted to be at my 
house. I also bought water supply for a month and a kit for my husband's car 
and my car. There's just a certain element of emotional strength that you get 
when you feel somewhat prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How did the earthquake affect your neighbors?  
</P>
<P>
 A. My neighbor on this side of me had major damage. He also had a lot more 
collectibles in his home. He had artwork slip off the walls and crystal and 
china just go crashing out of his china cabinets. He had crystal lighting 
fixtures just pop out of the walls. All his TVs crashed, his armoires moved, 
his fireplace is cracked and lifted. He had a lot of furniture. If he would've 
bolted it down, half the stuff might not have come crashing down. Nobody was 
hurt, thank God. 
</P>
<P>
 I have neighbors who lost TVs and stereos and artwork and furniture because 
they weren't secure. Lots of china. A house three blocks away moved an inch or 
so, I was told, off its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How much did it cost to earthquake-proof your house?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I think I spent close to $1,000. I got a lot of harassment from my friends 
and my family, and I do have the tendency of overindulging at times, but it was 
definitely worth it. There probably wasn't much more I needed to do outside of 
the things that I did and everything I did seemed to work. Since the 
earthquake, everybody's gotten prepared. I know a lot of people who have bought 
the L-brackets and they're doing stuff themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I understand that most renters do not have the right to use fastening 
devices in their homes without the consent of the landlord. What would you 
advise them to do to make their homes safer?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I would have that put in the terms of my lease. Because we live in an area 
that's susceptible to earthquakes, and we're just seeing the incredible damage 
that comes, I would put it in the terms that the house needs to be 
earthquake-proofed as best as it can be. If the lessee comes in and wants it 
done, he should be allowed to do it and pay for it. Or maybe the cost is 
shared. The point is that nobody should have the right to tell somebody that 
they can't secure their home.

TANGLED PERMIT CASE IS 'WEIRD,' JUDGE SAYS; COURTS: COUPLE IS ACCUSED OF 
ILLEGALLY ERECTING HOME. AT A HEARING, THEY CALL AN OFFICIAL DISHONEST. AND A 
KEY WITNESS HAS DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The judge took one look at the case and said with all the wisdom of his 28 
years in criminal justice: "Something weird is going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Rendered almost speechless by its weirdness, he told the opposing parties that 
"when you see a case like this, you say, 'Oh my God.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And that was before the Northridge earthquake knocked his court out of 
commission and a key witness died, apparently of an alcohol overdose, three 
days before he was to testify that he paid $75,000 in bribes to county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A pretrial hearing in the case got started last week with two days of 
testimony from the first of 20 witnesses who are to be called in a highly 
unusual motion to dismiss a misdemeanor zoning case. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, a Topanga couple charged with 14 counts that accuse them of 
building a 700-square-foot rental house without permits, allege in their 
defense that they are being prosecuted in retaliation for blowing the whistle 
on a dishonest county employee. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, they are being allowed to hold a sort of trial-within-a-trial, a 
hearing at which they can lay out their defense accusing county officials of 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hearing which continued Monday, Kathleen Kenny and Art Starz are 
attempting to convince Santa Monica Superior Court Judge James A. Albracht that 
they are being harassed by a building official who they say they exposed in a 
newsletter mailed to 3,000 Topanga residences. 
</P>
<P>
 During two days of strained testimony last week, Kenny recounted her 
three-year dispute with county officials in such expansive detail that Albracht 
frequently interrupted in frustration, at one point saying he didn't need to 
know the "Gone With the Wind panorama" of every incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny and Starz contend in court documents that they spent thousands of 
dollars trying to get a building permit, but that it was withheld because they 
refused to pay bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, why didn't they get the permits?" the couple's attorney, 
James Fosbinder, asked Albracht in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We maintain it's because they didn't make the payoffs that were attempted to 
be extorted from them. . . . They have been tortured and harassed by a crooked 
building inspector," Fosbinder continued. 
</P>
<P>
 The county employee they are accusing, district engineering associate Grant 
Lawseth, is expected to be called as a witness this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fosbinder said he will also call Lawseth's wife to explain a trail of 
complicated real estate transactions. In an earlier court hearing, Fosbinder 
said the transactions showed that she and her husband apparently received 
"discounted real estate or gifts of real estate" from individuals seeking 
building permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawseth has declined to answer any questions about the assertions made against 
him, saying he was precluded from discussing the case while it is being tried. 
But he angrily denounced the couple and their lawyer, saying their accusations 
are false. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable," he said in a telephone interview. "It's really incredible 
that people can make these allegations. Who is this guy who's all of a sudden 
coming up here and manufacturing these stories? 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is this clown? None of the stuff he is saying is even reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 The case, originally filed in August in Municipal Court, was elevated to 
Superior Court after several Municipal Court judges declined to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-hour pretrial hearing Dec. 16, Albracht said it appeared to him the 
case had "grown so far out of proportion that, as a person involved in the 
criminal justice system for 28 years, I say to myself something weird is going 
on here. Something very weird is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately though, Albracht approved calling all but 9 of the 33 witnesses 
Fosbinder wanted to subpoena in his attempt to establish the defense argument 
that Lawseth is part of an extortion enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was scheduled to begin Jan. 18, but was postponed when the Santa 
Monica courthouse was closed due to damage from the Northridge earthquake. It 
finally got started on Jan. 31 in a makeshift courtroom in the basement of the 
Malibu courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first day on the witness stand, Kenny said she believed that she was 
solicited for a bribe by a county health inspector, Arnold Fielding, during 
hours of rambling conversations, parts of which she tape-recorded. She said 
Fielding introduced himself to her on the first of 16 visits by saying, that 
"the winds were all blowing up" and he had been sent "to nail her." 
</P>
<P>
 Reading from a two-inch-thick stack of transcripts of those tape recordings, 
Kenny quoted Fielding as telling her that her house was fine, but that he was 
being forced by others to pressure her. 
</P>
<P>
 According to her transcripts, Fielding told Kenny, "Jump in the boat. . . . I 
can protect you and assist you and help you if you don't put barriers in the 
way." Kenny testified that he told her: "I'd be more than glad to get Grant 
(Lawseth) down here to look at your property and say, 'Hey, what can we do?' "  
</P>
<P>
 Another time, she testified, Fielding asked her: "So you can't figure out a 
way to generate some cash?" 
</P>
<P>
 Noting, however, that she did not say that Fielding ever specifically asked 
for money, the judge said in court that he found the relevance of Kenny's 
testimony "tenuous." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fosbinder argued that after 16 visits in which Fielding never cited the 
house for any violation, it was a reasonable conclusion that he was waiting for 
Kenny to offer money. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, which will probably continue at least through this week, offers a 
preview of the testimony Fosbinder plans to present in a separate racketeering 
lawsuit he has filed in federal court against Los Angeles County on behalf of 
Kenny and Starz. That case, seeking civil damages under the U. S. Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, was filed shortly after criminal 
charges were brought against the couple by county officials, acting on a report 
by Lawseth. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have suggested Fosbinder filed the racketeering suit as part 
of a defense strategy, but Fosbinder said he informed Lawseth that he was 
preparing it long before the criminal charges were initiated. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases arise out of a three-year battle between Kenny and Starz on the one 
side, and the Calabasas office of the Los Angeles County Division of Building 
and Safety on the other, over the couple's plans to develop three tiny lots in 
the Fernwood Pacific area of Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple lives in a 600-square-foot house they built on one of the lots with 
proper permits. They are now constructing a house on a second lot after winning 
a court order requiring the county to issue them building permits. 
</P>
<P>
 On the third lot, they refurbished a pre-existing structure in 1990 without 
taking out permits. They contend they received oral permission from county 
officials to proceed with the improvement under the "continuing maintenance" 
rule of the Building and Safety Code. 
</P>
<P>
 Their problems began, they say, after they spoke at a community meeting in 
favor of an unpopular development proposal called Canyon Oaks Estates. Over the 
next few weeks, they were visited by inspectors from about 15 government 
agencies responding to complaints about them, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1992, the county building authorities summoned the couple to a 
hearing before Deputy Dist. Atty. Joan Clay Manley, at which they were ordered 
to obtain the required permits for the improvements. Manley filed criminal 
charges a year later when they still had not obtained permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny and Starz contend that they provided everything that was asked at the 
hearing, spending $8,000 on application and professional fees. They say the 
county has no reason to deny the permits because the house, which had been 
completed without permits, meets all legal standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley said that's not the issue. It should not have been built at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you build a structure, remodel a structure or alter a structure, building 
permits are required," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked by the judge last month what penalty she would demand if she 
prevailed, Manley said the house should be torn down and the defendants ordered 
to pay the cost of prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny and Starz, meanwhile, saying their application for a building permit was 
in order, had begun to focus on Lawseth, the assistant supervisor in the 
Building and Safety Division's Calabasas office, as the source of the delays. 
</P>
<P>
 They voiced their growing suspicions in several issues of a newsletter called 
"The Balance Sheet," which they bulk-mailed to every residence in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 The March, 1993, issue led with an article titled, "Who is Grant Lawseth?" It 
described two real estate purchases for which, it said, records show Lawseth 
paid about $875,000. It also listed dozens of recent building permits issued 
"without the usual three-year delay," including a new house "in an active 
landslide zone, in less than 90 days from the date of application." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Fosbinder cited the newsletter story in the hearing before Albracht, 
saying in court that the couple's research uncovered a pattern of wrongdoing 
and precipitated the filing of charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley said that she has made no independent attempt to investigate any 
allegations against Lawseth, who has accompanied her to numerous court hearings 
on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's merely hearsay, unsubstantiated by any facts," she said. "Right now I 
am gathering the evidence and straightening out the Starz and Kenny case." 
</P>
<P>
 Fosbinder said during last month's hearing that he would submit "a volume of 
evidence of real estate transactions that appear to involve permits for favored 
individuals in exchange for discounted real estate or gifts of real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a set of handwritten documents recorded with the Los Angeles 
County registrar-recorder indicates that a Wendy Adams -- who is later 
identified in the documents as a single woman and then as Grant Lawseth's wife 
-- received property in Agoura from a James Melvin Adams, listed as her 
husband. A half-interest in the property was later transferred to Grant 
Lawseth, and the two of them ultimately sold it as husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Fosbinder said in a previous hearing on the case that the hand-writing 
throughout the documents never varies, suggesting to him that the same person 
filled out all the deeds. He said he didn't know precisely what the documents 
mean, but planned to ask Wendy Lawseth to explain them this week in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The already convoluted case took a new twist when prospective witness Alan 
Pacella, a Topanga property owner who alleged that county officials extorted 
money from him, was found dead in his West Los Angeles apartment three days 
before the hearing was scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's federal court racketeering suit said that Pacella would testify 
that the extortion began after Lawseth ordered a halt to grading work that was 
necessary to conduct soils testing in preparation for building a house. The 
federal complaint said Pacella would testify that he paid Lawseth a combined 
$75,000 on behalf of himself and two friends who owned lots next to his to have 
several stop-work orders lifted. None of the houses was ever completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Pat Anguiano of the LAPD's Pacific Division said homicide is not 
suspected in Pacella's death, but that the investigation remains open pending 
determination of the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner said a preliminary finding that 
Pacella died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and possibly other drugs must 
be confirmed by toxicology tests that have not been completed.

STATE SENATOR TO RUN FOR VALLEY SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, a Democrat who has represented a mostly 
Westside district for two decades, announced Monday that he will run this 
spring for the Van Nuys-based Senate seat now held by David Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal's decision was quickly endorsed by a long list of elected officials, 
including Roberti himself, but also damned as a galling example of political 
imperialism by others who cited the senator's lack of experience in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old Rosenthal, a West Los Angeles resident, said in an interview 
that he dropped his plans to retire later this year after becoming convinced 
that an experienced lawmaker was just what was needed to help the San Fernando 
Valley get back on its feet after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen too many new members come to Sacramento who may have new ideas, but 
who don't know how to work the system," Rosenthal said. "The Valley needs 
advocates in Sacramento who will fight for its survival and who have the 
legislative experience to get things done. This is no time for on-the-job 
training." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal's surprise decision to run for the 20th District seat was endorsed 
by the key leadership of the political organization run by U. S. Reps. Howard 
Berman (D-Panorama City) and Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), by state 
Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-Van Nuys), whose district makes up half of 
the Roberti district, and by Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, now 
running for the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosenthal's decision was criticized by others as yet another attempt by 
carpetbagging Sacramento insiders to impose themselves on Valley residents. 
Critics likened the Rosenthal decision to Roberti's own controversial move to 
the Valley -- from Hollywood -- in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti now faces an April 12 recall spawned in large part by anger over the 
senator taking over the Valley-based 20th District seat -- even as he resides 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Roberti revisited," complained Dolores White, a veteran Republican 
activist and leader of the Roberti recall movement. 
</P>
<P>
 As an outsider, Roberti found it difficult to win election in his adopted, 
Valley-based district in 1992 and spent more than $2 million on his campaign. 
Still, after winning election, Roberti tried to make himself welcome by 
supporting the breakup of the Los Angeles school district, a popular Valley 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal said Monday that he had opposed Roberti's school breakup measure and 
had supported instead a less ambitious state Assembly plan. 
</P>
<P>
 By throwing his hat in the ring, Rosenthal has become the instant front-runner 
in this year's regular election for the 20th District; the primary will be held 
in June, the general election in November. Also eyeing the 20th District is Los 
Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's still thinking about it," said Korenstein political adviser Parke 
Skelton. "I don't think Herschel would be invulnerable in this district." 
</P>
<P>
 But several others who had been considering running for the 20th District said 
Monday that they would not challenge Rosenthal. The district is predominantly 
Democratic in registration and both the state Assembly members who represent 
parts of it are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, reapportionment dealt Rosenthal the 22nd District, with a 46% Latino 
population and an East Side orientation far different from the predominantly 
Jewish, Westside constituencies that Rosenthal has represented since he was 
first elected to the state Assembly in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the problem, Rosenthal ran in 1992 for the 23rd District, one 
heavily anchored on the Westside, but was defeated by Sen. Tom Hayden, whose 
campaign was run by Skelton. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he did not have to give up his seat to run for the 23rd District, 
Rosenthal has remained in office, serving out the remainder of his four-year 
term as the senator for the 22nd District. But his term expires this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bid to still expected criticism, Rosenthal aides noted that Rosenthal has 
represented parts of Studio City, Sherman Oaks, Encino, Tarzana and Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynette Stevens, Rosenthal's chief deputy, said her boss has been active on 
Valley legislative issues. He co-authored legislation to fund a day-care center 
at the Sylmar Metrolink railroad station and opposed development of an arts 
park in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Rosenthal developed a reputation as a frequent traveler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rosenthal is one of the biggest gift-takers and travelers in Sacramento," 
said Skelton, who ran the Hayden campaign against him in 1992. "He was always 
taking trips paid for by special interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal said Monday that such trips are a thing of the past because new 
ethics rules have sharply limited them. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat William Dominguez, a leader of the Roberti recall movement, 
complained that Rosenthal is another carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lost his race against Hayden, his current term expires this year, and now 
he needs another ticket to Sacramento and he sees the Valley providing it to 
him," Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez, a Democrat, predicted that Rosenthal's move will help the recall 
movement by providing fresh ammunition about how Sacramento politicians try to 
use the Valley. "I think it's probably going to help," he said. Both Dominguez, 
a Democrat, and White are candidates to replace Roberti in the April 12 recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal's announcement prompted several would-be candidates to pull out of 
the race for the 20th District seat, including Deputy City Atty. Gary Geuss and 
attorney Robert Hertzberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the Valley being the happy hunting ground for politicians from 
the metro area," Geuss said. "But unfortunately he's got bigger guns than I 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 If Roberti is recalled, his successor, who would be chosen at the same time, 
would serve out the remainder of Robert's term, which ends in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the person elected in November as part of the regular election cycle 
would take office. Rosenthal is not a candidate in the recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal, who has never before lived in the Valley, said he has rented an 
apartment in Studio City, located in the 20th District. "My wife and I have 
already spent a couple of nights there," he said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; TRAFFIC AT REOPENED LIBRARY INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When librarian Judith Babka walked into her branch in San Fernando the day 
after the Northridge earthquake, she found microfiche machines dangling by 
their cords and paperbacks spit out of their exploded revolving racks. 
Bookshelves had collapsed and books were strewn everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a tornado had gone through. There was nothing like it," Babka 
said. "Most of it was just books everywhere -- books, videos, two or three feet 
deep in the library." 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members of the county branch library opened the doors to the public Feb. 
1, but only after spending seven days cleaning up.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a task," said library assistant Diane Gavin. "It's overwhelming 
when you see all the books back on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that it's open, the library is getting more than its normal 200 to 300 
daily customers. Babka estimated at least 1,000 books are being returned or 
checked out daily, with many more coming in than going out. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many city libraries closed, including the closest in Sylmar and 
Pacoima, people are returning books to the county branch, which will send the 
books to the main city library.  
</P>
<P>
 Four days after the Jan. 17 quake, after the library building was deemed 
structurally sound, workers started putting in 10-hour days. Three windows had 
shattered and others were loosened from their frames, shaking whenever an 
aftershock occurred.  
</P>
<P>
 "They are floor-to-ceiling windows," Babka said. "It was a little unsettling." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Babka estimated the book collection at about 30,000 to 32,000 volumes. She 
said she and seven others picked up about 20,000 volumes from the floor -- plus 
the library's collections of audiotapes and videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 While staff was putting the library back in order, borrowers worried about 
late fees arrived in a steady stream. Babka, however, said late fees will not 
be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them have more to think of than bringing back their library 
materials," Babka said. REBECCA BRYANT

VALLEYWIDE: AID STILL NEEDED IN WEEKS TO COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Images of the tent cities may fade from television screens and life for some 
may come a little closer to normal in the coming weeks. But aid workers say 
help will still be needed for those who were dealt physical and emotional blows 
when their homes or belongings were destroyed in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a long haul," said Jim Stratton, director of community services for 
Catholic Charities. "We think this emergency distribution of water isn't going 
to be needed a week from now. Food, maybe a couple of weeks. But where are 
these people going to live? That's the question. There was a shortage of 
affordable housing before the earthquake. This isn't going to go away in a few 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Charities, the huge nonprofit group that serves the poor in centers 
across Los Angeles County, is one of many organizations asking for donations of 
time, goods or money in the wake of the Northridge quake. It needs volunteers 
in Glendale to help victims complete federal disaster assistance forms. 
Bilingual volunteers -- speakers of Spanish, Russian, Armenian and other 
languages -- are especially in demand, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, Canoga Park and the San Fernando area, volunteers are needed 
to sort and distribute food, water, clothing and blankets, and to load and 
unload trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization is also taking donations of diapers, blankets, non-perishable 
food, adult absorbent undergarments and cash, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; CITY DENIES REQUESTS FOR FREEWAY SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Agoura Hills City Council has denied requests from 13 business owners who 
want to keep their pole-top advertising signs in place despite a ban on them 
supported by a majority of voters. The denials marked the first time the 
council has taken action in support of the ban since it was scheduled to go 
into effect two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the last step the city had to take," said Agoura Hills Director of 
Planning David Anderson. "Now the ball is more or less in (the business 
owners') court." 
</P>
<P>
 Within several weeks, Anderson said, the city will send notices of the City 
Council's Jan. 26 decision upholding a 9-year-old law requiring the removal of 
about 30 signs on the basis that the towering, lollipop-style advertisements 
near the Ventura Freeway are an eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 sign owners who asked for exemptions contended that the ban would hurt 
their businesses in a way unique from the effect on other merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants will have 90 days to remove the signs, although some of the 13 who 
objected have threatened lawsuits to block enforcement of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of the (business owners) feel we're going to wait for the city 
to take down the signs and then file lawsuits on our own," said Terry Herrick, 
owner of a Jack-in-The-Box restaurant in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would lose a substantial amount of business by removing our signs." 
</P>
<P>
 Other owners have said they will remove their signs, said Councilwoman Fran 
Pavley. 
</P>
<P>
 The pole sign ban, approved in 1985, sparked the costliest and, perhaps, 
ugliest political battle in the city's 12-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 As the seven-year grace period for removing the signs approached in 1992, a 
group of business owners hired a political consultant and lobbied against the 
ban, eventually raising about $100,000, mostly from parent companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcement of the ban was postponed while city officials and business owners 
worked toward a compromise. But late last year, the talks degenerated into 
squabbles and eventually ended. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 2, voters in Agoura Hills rejected by a 3-1 margin two measures that 
would have allowed pole signs to remain in place at their current height or 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made our job easy," Pavley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That vote showed we did the right thing by our constituents." KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; RESIDENTS GROUP WILL BE RESURRECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time the Sun Valley Residents Assn. met in July, only two people 
showed up, a disappointing turnout that the group's president, Jan Liptak, said 
was an example of the fractured nature of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, I said I was not willing to put that much effort into it," said 
Liptak, who complained then that Sun Valley, where she has lived for 17 years, 
lacked cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last six months, there have been a few changes, said Liptak, who 
has since begun working for the United Way in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a real sense that there's a core group of leadership beginning to 
form," said Liptak, who has decided to resurrect the residents' association. 
The first meeting will be March 7 at Sun Valley Park. "I feel there's a lot of 
things happening in the community, and the only way to have a voice is to be 
organized." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that helped the community was the election of new 7th District City 
Councilman Richard Alarcon, a native of Sun Valley, Liptak said. "He has put a 
spotlight on Sun Valley," she said. But she added that community consciousness 
also has grown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sun Valley has been discovered," Liptak said. She pointed to the application 
for a federal neighborhood initiative program that could mean $16 million to 
renovate the community, as well as a planned mural project for San Fernando 
Road to be painted by local children with an artist hired by the community 
venture council. ED BOND

TEEN-AGER HELD IN SHOOTING OF STORE OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 48-year-old jewelry store owner was shot and wounded in a holdup Monday and 
a suspected robber was arrested shortly afterward, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedros Bidrusian of Glendale was in serious condition with a wound in the 
abdomen at County-USC Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect him to survive," Glendale Police Sgt. Lief Nicolaisen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old Los Angeles boy, arrested on suspicion of robbery and attempted 
murder, is believed to have been one of two robbers who held up Bidrusian 
Jewelry, situated in a strip mall at 1102 1/2 S. Glendale Ave., about 11:30 
a.m., Nicolaisen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidrusian, who was alone in the shop, raised his hand and was immediately shot 
by one of the robbers, Nicolaisen said. Police declined to say whether the 
youth in custody was suspected of the shooting. The weapon had not been 
recovered as of Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that they saw two or three males leaving the jewelry 
shop in a 1992 Buick Century. That vehicle, which police learned had been 
stolen, was found abandoned in the 1200 block of Romulus Drive, Nicolaisen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old was arrested at 12:15 p.m. after police followed a slate gray 
pickup truck containing people who matched the robbers' description, he said. 
The teen-ager was dropped off near a McDonald's Restaurant and was caught in 
the 1500 block of Kent Place, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Monday night were looking for the pickup's driver -- described as 
heavyset and between 28 and 30 years old -- and a 25-year-old man who was 
dropped off on East Colorado Street, Nicolaisen said.

BILL WOULD LET QUAKE VICTIMS DEDUCT FULL VALUE OF LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) said he will introduce a bill in 
Congress today allowing victims of the Northridge earthquake to deduct the full 
value of their property losses on their federal income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which has seven California co-sponsors, would particularly benefit 
"middle-class taxpayers who suffered substantial damage to their homes or 
personal belongings but who will not qualify for or choose to seek FEMA 
assistance, HUD grants and loans or other federal relief programs," Berman said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Current law permits taxpayers to deduct casualty losses only to the extent 
that they exceed 10% of their adjusted gross income. Berman's legislation would 
amend the Internal Revenue Service Code to allow full casualty loss deductions 
for federally declared disaster losses occurring on or after Jan. 17, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers hit by the Northridge quake could elect to deduct such losses 
against either 1993 or 1994 income, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is being co-sponsored by California Reps. Buck McKeon (R-Santa 
Clarita), Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), Carlos 
Moorhead (R-Burbank), Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), Julian Dixon (D-Los 
Angeles) and Robert Matsui (D-Sacramento).

YEARLY DISASTER DRILL PROPOSED EACH JAN. 17; PREPAREDNESS: MOCK EMERGENCY, 
INCLUDING INJURIES AND MEETINGS, WOULD BE HELD ANNUALLY TO COMMEMORATE THE 
NORTHRIDGE TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council today will consider a proposal to hold a massive 
citywide emergency earthquake drill every Jan. 17 -- a date chosen to 
commemorate the devastating Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal by City Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of an ad-hoc earthquake 
recovery committee, would call for a full-scale emergency quake drill -- 
complete with fake injuries and emergency meetings -- on the date of the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the city held emergency drills on an annual basis, usually in April 
to correspond with an earthquake-preparedness month. But the exercises have 
been canceled for the past two years because real emergencies -- riots, floods, 
fires and volatile trials -- have eliminated the need. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are running people through the real thing every few months, you 
don't have a need to put them through the exercise," said Bob Canfield, an 
emergency preparedness coordinator for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual exercises have used imaginary disaster scenarios, written by city 
emergency coordinators, to test the response of police, fire and other city 
departments, as well as some private businesses that volunteer to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's last full-scale earthquake exercise was held in April, 1990, when 
an imaginary 7.3-magnitude temblor hit along the Newport-Inglewood fault. City 
officials, some faking broken limbs, established an emergency command center in 
the parking lot of Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 A smaller exercise was held the following April. 
</P>
<P>
 But the emergency exercise scheduled for April, 1992, was canceled due to the 
riots. Since then, the city's Emergency Operations Center has been put on alert 
for five other declared disasters, including the floods and wildfires last 
year, Canfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Canfield credited the annual exercises and the recent real-life emergencies 
for honing the response skills of local emergency agencies for the Northridge 
quake. "The response has been quite good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake drills, like those proposed by Bernson, are a major annual event in 
Japan, where thousands of citizens are mandated by the government to 
participate in mock emergency exercises on the anniversary of the 1923 Kanto 
quake that killed almost 100,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson aide Greig Smith said the councilman wants the city to launch 
full-scale emergency exercises every Jan. 17, specifically to practice the 
response of emergency crews to a major earthquake. The January exercise would 
replace the April drills. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was told that the full-scale exercises had been eliminated because 
of cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Smith said, the improved emergency response skills that will result from 
the exercises are well worth the added cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Borden, the Los Angeles Fire Department's chief of training, agreed, 
saying "it's a good idea to bring back the exercise in a large scale." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city has held smaller drills, in which city agencies are simply 
asked how they would respond to a particular emergency. But Borden said it is 
important to annually test the departments to see how they respond in a 
simulated emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Mattingly, chief analyst for the city's office of emergency 
management, said she too supports annual full-scale exercises. But because the 
exercises are a "massive undertaking," she said she would like to be able to 
cancel the annual drill if a real disaster puts the city's emergency response 
to the test.

BURBANK AIRPORT SEEKS OK FOR PASSENGER TAX; FINANCES: THE LEVY OF $3 PER PERSON 
WOULD GO TOWARD PAYING FOR LAND AND IMPROVEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW 
TERMINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to jump-start funding and construction of a new terminal, Burbank 
Airport officials Monday asked the federal government for permission to impose 
a $3 fee on all outbound passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport Authority commissioners hope the levy -- which could begin by summer's 
end -- will raise about $6 million a year at current passenger levels to 
subsidize improvements that would accompany a larger terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 The "passenger facility charge" would automatically be added to ticket prices 
for those flying out of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 If the authority's request is approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, 
as is expected within six to nine months, Burbank would join other area 
airports, including Los Angeles International and Ontario, in assessing the $3 
surcharge, the maximum allowable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other Southern California airports, including Long Beach, San Diego 
and John Wayne International in Orange County, do not charge facility fees, 
according to their representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 By imposing the levy, Burbank Airport would forfeit half of an annual 
$2.5-million federal grant it receives for infrastructure projects, controller 
Dios Marrero told commissioners, who voted unanimously to submit the request. 
But the airport would still net close to $5 million, which could be applied 
toward runway refurbishment and acquisition of land for the new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Blueprints call for the terminal to cover 670,000 square feet, four times the 
size of the current building. Officials say a larger terminal is necessary to 
handle the projected 10 million passengers using Burbank Airport annually by 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
 The Airport Authority initiated the surcharge process in December by notifying 
its carriers that it intended to apply for permission to impose the new fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, airlines have opposed passenger facility charges -- which are 
tacked onto ticket prices at point of purchase -- because customers tend to 
consider them part of the air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 But spokeswoman Heather Elley of Southwest Airlines, Burbank's largest 
carrier, said her company supports the authority's move because of the 
advantages that would spring from a larger, improved terminal and expanded gate 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it would be unfortunate that our customers would have to incur the 
cost, and it does impact us as well, we feel it would be beneficial for Burbank 
Airport," Elley said. "We can see those funds going to a good cause, and we 
hope to educate our customers to that fact too." 
</P>
<P>
 On Southwest, an unrestricted round-trip fare between Burbank and Oakland now 
costs $138, including a 10% federal ticket tax. But with Oakland Airport's 
surcharge, passengers pay $141, which would increase to $144 if Burbank's 
request is approved.

FBI ARRESTS 2 IN 1993 ROBBERY OF CANYON COUNTRY BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal agents arrested two suspects in the robbery last June of a Canyon 
Country bank in which nine people were held hostage overnight at the home of a 
bank officer who was forced by gunmen to open the bank's vault, the FBI 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Yepes, 25, of Valencia and Chad Pelch, 24, of Saugus were arrested 
Saturday in Las Vegas, according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (Los Angeles area) is the bank robbery capital of the world, so there is 
nothing unusual about a robbery occurring, but this one was particularly 
traumatic for the victims because their homes were invaded, and they were 
subjected to a night of captivity," said Charlie J. Parsons, special agent in 
charge of the FBI office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges of armed bank robbery with forced accompaniment were filed on Jan. 14 
in U. S. District Court in Los Angeles, said FBI spokesman Ron Twersky. 
</P>
<P>
 Yepes and Pelch were two of four men sought by federal agents in the June 11, 
1993, robbery of TransWorld Bank on Soledad Canyon Road, in which bank officer 
Toula Demosthenous and eight others, including five children, were held hostage 
overnight by five gunmen at Demosthenous' Canyon Country home. One suspect was 
arrested earlier, and the fourth man remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the gunmen drove Demosthenous to the bank the next morning and forced 
her to open the vault, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Demosthenous and the other hostages -- friends, family members and colleagues 
-- were not injured, according to records filed in U. S. District Court in Los 
Angeles. The robbers fled with $107,689. 
</P>
<P>
 A confidential informant contacted FBI Special Agent William M. Ayers on June 
15 and told him that he had seen between $15,000 and $20,000 in a red toolbox 
at Pelch's home, according to an affidavit by Ayers included in the criminal 
complaint. The following day, Pelch drove to Las Vegas with two friends and 
returned with a new Ford Ranger pickup truck, according to the court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayers received a tip on June 21 from another source who said he had heard 
Yepes admit taking part in the robbery with Pelch and his brother, Brett Pelch, 
who remains at large, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to this informant, Yepes said that he got away with more than 
$100,000 and that he subsequently spent $12,000 on a 1990 Ford Thunderbird, 
which the FBI later confirmed, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents learned early in the investigation that Yepes and the Pelch 
brothers had fled to Las Vegas after the robbery, Parsons said. Chad Pelch and 
Yepes were arrested Saturday after federal agents spotted a car matching a 
description of one their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents arrested Darren Patrick Towers, 25, of Saugus in December as a 
suspect in the TransWorld robbery, as well as the Sept. 17 robbery of a Coast 
Federal Bank in Northridge. Towers subsequently pleaded guilty to conspiracy, 
armed bank robbery with forced accompaniment and use of a firearm during a 
crime of violence, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Coast Fed robbery, a group of men invaded a Canoga Park home and held 
bank officer Terry Duranso and four others hostage at gunpoint. The next 
morning, the gunmen forced Duranso to open her bank's vault. 
</P>
<P>
 Towers confessed to his role in events leading up to the Coast Fed robbery 
during a Dec. 6 interview with FBI Special Agent Jo A. Deatherage, according to 
an affidavit. Towers told the agent that he had been recruited by a friend to 
commit a bank robbery that involved taking hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 Towers said that when he arrived at the Duranso home about midnight Sept. 17, 
he found five hostages lying on the floor and that he stood guard over them for 
the remainder of the ordeal, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of his colleagues drove Duranso to the bank and by 8:15 a.m. they had 
completed the robbery, from which Towers received $4,000, according to the 
affidavit. Bank officials said that more than $100,000 was taken in that 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Towers, who is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 28, faces a maximum sentence of 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U. S. Atty. David Fields declined to comment on whether additional 
charges will be filed against Chad Pelch and Yepes in the Northridge robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, federal agents are still seeking Brett Pelch, 26, in the case. 
Formerly of Valencia, Brett Pelch may still be in the Las Vegas area and is 
considered armed and dangerous, agents said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; METROLINK STATION EXPECTED TO CUT CROSS-TOWN 
TRAFFIC; TRANSIT: NEW STOP IS IN CANYON COUNTRY. PASSENGERS IN SANTA CLARITA 
VALLEY NO LONGER HAVE TO DRIVE TO SAUGUS TO TAKE THE TRAIN.

 Monday's opening of a second Metrolink train station should result in a 
significant reduction in cross-town commuter traffic, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new station is on Via Princessa west of Sierra Highway in Canyon 
Country.Until the station opened, many Metrolink passengers in the Santa 
Clarita Valley had to drive to Saugus to take the train to Los Angeles and 
other destinations south. City officials said this cross-town commute was 
clogging surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is really going to make a difference," city spokeswoman Gail 
Foy said of the new station. "In fact, we counted 275 cars out there this 
morning -- so it's already had an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-bound trains will depart from the station weekdays at 5:30 and 
6:11 a.m., Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has also increased local bus service, adding 18 routes timed to 
provide increased access to the two Metrolink stations during the morning and 
afternoon commutes. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Jan Heidt said she hopes that the increased popularity of 
mass transit will not disappear with the hours-long commutes motorists still 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 "The is a real opportunity to get people on the train and to keep them there," 
Heidt said. "That's what we need to try to do."

3 EX-WORKERS ACCUSED OF FRAUD AT AIR FORCE BASE; CRIME: AUTHORITIES SAY THE 
TRIO CREATED 13 FICTITIOUS RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES AND KEPT THEIR PAYCHECKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three former workers at a firm that ran a restaurant at Edwards Air Force Base 
and another military installation have been accused of creating fictitious 
employees and taking the wages for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Edward Jones, 50, Edward E. Brown, 51, and Amelia Cunanan Johnson, 40, 
were arrested on charges of mail fraud, conspiracy and making false claims 
against the federal government, the Los Angeles office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three worked for Oakland-based Kass Management Services Inc., which ran 
the Joshua Tree Inn dining hall at Edwards AFB and dining halls at the Defense 
Language Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Payroll checks that Johnson had prepared for the nonexistent employees were 
deposited into the personal checking accounts of Jones, Brown and Johnson, 
according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides creating 13 ghost employees at the two locations between Jan. 1, 1989, 
and Aug. 31, 1991, Jones and Johnson are also accused of submitting false 
claims for meal expenses at the Joshua Tree Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, according to the indictment, submitted falsified register tapes and had 
employees "create false supporting documents to conceal the scheme." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones also sought government reimbursement for $10,000 in labor costs for 
maintenance of equipment at the restaurant that was never performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a former resident of Lancaster now living in Hawaii, was arrested Jan. 
7 and released Jan. 28 on a $50,000 bond. Seaside resident Brown was arrested 
Jan. 14 and released on a $25,000 bond while Johnson, a former Rosamond 
resident, was arrested Jan. 25 in San Francisco and released on a $75,000 bond. 
A trial date has not yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was investigated by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations at 
Edwards Air Force Base, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in Oakland, 
the Army Criminal Investigative Division in San Francisco, and the FBI.

DISTRICT PROPOSES ATTENDANCE SHIFTS; EDUCATION: PARENTS WILL BE ABLE TO REVIEW 
THE PLAN TO PUT 1,300 STUDENTS INTO TWO NEW WILLIAM S. HART UNION SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 More than 1,300 teen-agers this fall will funnel into the William S. Hart 
Union High School District's two new schools, and hundreds of others will shift 
to different campuses for the first time, under a plan announced Monday to 
alter attendance boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents will review and comment on the draft proposal at community meetings 
this month; the first is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. today at Sierra Vista Junior 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a fairly large number of people who are going to be affected by 
this who may have concerns," said Supt. Walt Swanson. "I'm going to guess there 
are an equal or larger number who are very happy with this decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The new boundaries are to accommodate the fall openings of Valencia High 
School in Valencia and La Mesa Junior High School in Canyon Country and prepare 
for two other campuses expected to be added by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Both new schools are being opened for their lower grades this fall -- seventh 
at La Mesa, and ninth and 10th at Valencia. The upper grades will be added in 
subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart officials surveyed more than 800 parents during a series of January 
community meetings and attempted to reflect their comments. The 470 responses 
from parents indicated a strong desire to reduce school populations, keep 
students together when they move from elementary to junior high school and 
junior high to high school, as well as cut travel time to and from campus 
whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed boundary changes are influenced by those of Santa Clarita's three 
elementary school districts, allowing students that attend the same primary 
school to move as a group into the Hart district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't separated any elementary school area that isn't already 
separated," said Lew White, district facilities director. "Elementary school 
students should be able to continue together in junior high." 
</P>
<P>
 Based upon enrollment projections for the fall, the adjusted boundaries call 
for shifting 267 students who live in Castaic and Val Verde from Saugus High 
School to Valencia High School. About 180 of their neighbors would continue to 
attend Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia High would also draw students from the Summit housing community, many 
living around Rio Vista, Valencia Valley and Valley View elementary schools and 
a few from the Northbridge housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of students going into La Mesa Junior High School live near Rio 
Vista, Pinetree and Valencia Valley elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart officials have also suggested giving the two new schools different hours 
of operation so additional school buses won't have to be purchased to transport 
students. District classes normally begin at 8 a.m., but class would start half 
an hour earlier at Valencia High and an hour later at La Mesa Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 11,000 students are enrolled in the district's six schools, 37% more 
than the capacity of the existing buildings. Generally, a junior high school 
houses 900 to 1,000 students and a high school houses 1,600 to 1,700 students. 
District officials believe few juniors and seniors will want to transfer to a 
new school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who disagree with where they're slated to attend school will be 
allowed to take classes at a different campus under open enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Bill 1114 took effect this year and mandates that all California 
districts allow students to attend the school of their choice.

SAGA OF APPLE'S EX-CHIEF TAKES AN UNUSUAL TURN; BUSINESS: JOHN SCULLEY QUITS AS 
SPECTRUM CHAIRMAN, ALLEGING DECEIT. HE SUES EXECUTIVE WHO HIRED HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may have been one of the worst career moves of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, John Sculley -- having worn out his welcome at Apple Computer -- 
joined a small, unproven, communications company called Spectrum Information 
Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, he resigned -- and filed a lawsuit against the executive he says 
recruited him to the job under false pretenses. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bizarre, tragicomic saga that may permanently blacken the reputation of 
one of the nation's most prominent business executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a year ago, Sculley was basking in his friendship with Hillary Rodham 
Clinton -- he sat beside her during the President's first State of the Union 
Address, symbol of the technological prowess of American business -- and being 
mentioned as a possible secretary of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 But a series of events since then, involving both his departure as chairman 
from Apple and his four-month odyssey at Long Island-based Spectrum, have 
critics questioning Sculley's judgment and credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors seem to be questioning Spectrum's future as well. The company's 
stock lost nearly two-thirds of its value in very heavy trading Monday, closing 
at $2.25, down $3.31 in NASDAQ trading. It now is selling at just one-fifth its 
price shortly after Sculley's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Spectrum denied misleading Sculley. But the firm also restated its 
earnings for two quarters of last year, with slight profits becoming large 
losses. Spectrum claims to have patents on important wireless communications 
technologies but has a history of weak financial results and legal and 
regulatory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculley was unconcerned about such issues when he took the job last October, 
after a whirlwind courtship by Peter Caserta, then chief executive and now 
president of Spectrum. At the time, Sculley said he wanted to join a small 
company where he would have "a substantial equity position," comparing Spectrum 
to Intel and Microsoft -- two of the giants of the worldwide technology 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Few in the industry saw such potential, though, and many were mystified as to 
why Sculley would join a company with such a dubious reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent answer emerged several weeks later: an extraordinary compensation 
package that included a $1-million annual salary and stock options potentially 
worth tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, though, analysts suggested that Sculley had not done his 
homework. 
</P>
<P>
 When questioned about some of Spectrum's past run-ins with securities 
regulators -- which included a delisting from the NASDAQ market -- Sculley told 
the New York Times: "It sounds like you know more about it than I do at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit he filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Sculley 
alleges that Caserta deliberately concealed negative information about Spectrum 
-- especially the company's use of questionable accounting practices and the 
existence of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into possible 
stock manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caserta's representations were knowingly false and misleading," the lawsuit 
charges. "There were material legal, regulatory, financial and other problems 
regarding Spectrum of which Caserta was aware, but which he did not disclose to 
Sculley." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks at least $10 million, plus punitive damages. Sculley had no 
comment Monday on his future plans. 
</P>
<P>
 In a press release issued late Monday, Spectrum said: "Prior to and during his 
term at Spectrum, Mr. Sculley was fully aware of the circumstances he now cites 
as his reasons for departing." The company said it learned of Sculley's plans 
only "moments before" he issued a press release announcing his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Caserta could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome of the litigation, the situation appears certain to 
damage Sculley's reputation as a first-rank executive, a standing he honed 
first at Pepsico and then at Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people would not sue on something like this, because it says as much 
about their judgment as anything else," said Gary Knisely, chief executive of 
the executive search firm Johnson Smith & Knisely Accord in New York. "I would 
think he would have done more due diligence; he was in a position to question 
them about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Richard Shaffer, a principal at a New York consulting firm now looking 
for someone to replace Sculley as a speaker at a conference next month: "He 
took a big risk and he lost. His reputation as a business leader is damaged. Is 
it unsalvageable? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, Sculley's attorney, Arnold I. Burns, had every reason to be suspicious 
of Spectrum. Burns was the lead attorney for ICN Pharmaceuticals in its 
successful proxy battle with controversial stockbroker Rafi Khan -- and Khan 
had been a major backer of Spectrum stock. Indeed, Caserta at one point was on 
Khan's slate of proposed ICN directors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burns said Monday that before joining Spectrum, Sculley had been concerned 
mainly about the firm's patent position, not its regulatory standing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He spent a lot of time looking at the scope and strength of those patents. On 
the other subjects, he looked Caserta straight in the eye and said: 'Is there 
anything I should know about? I don't want to come if there are problems.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Caserta's alleged dishonesty was "a very painful experience for John," Burns 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spectrum fiasco followed a messy finish to Sculley's 10-year reign at 
Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer company had begun to run into financial troubles early last year. 
In June, it abruptly announced that Sculley would step down as chief executive 
officer but remain as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple board members and Sculley all said the change had been Sculley's idea -- 
that he wanted to spend more time on big-picture issues while his successor, 
Michael Spindler, focused on day-to-day operations. Sculley insisted he had 
every intention of remaining actively involved at Apple. "This is not my swan 
song," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, though, sources at Apple disputed the official version of the 
events. A lawsuit by former Apple director Albert Eisenstat alleged that 
Sculley was ousted by a board unhappy over his growing involvement in politics 
and other outside activities. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Sculley did not last long at Apple after he left the CEO 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a six-week sabbatical, interrupted only for the introduction of his 
pet project, the Newton personal digital assistant -- a product that flopped in 
the marketplace. Shortly after, Sculley resigned to become chairman of 
Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 His announcement sent Spectrum's stock soaring. Company insiders cashed in -- 
including Caserta, who exercised stock options and then sold slightly less than 
half his stake for a profit of $8.4 million, according to CDA/Investnet, a Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., firm that tracks insider activity. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lawsuit, Sculley alleges that Caserta induced him to join the company 
with the express intent of collecting a windfall profit on stock sales. The 
sales also torpedoed the settlement of previous shareholder lawsuits against 
Spectrum and prompted the filing of additional shareholder suits last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculley also alleges that he was unaware the company was using a questionable 
method of accounting for revenue from its patent licensing agreements. In 
essence, the suit contends, Spectrum was counting money it had not yet 
received. The Career Path of John Sculley

BUDGET OFFICE'S HEALTH RULING CALLED DAMAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office plans to rule that the entire Clinton 
Administration health reform package should be treated as a new government 
program, not a private insurance plan, dealing the White House a potentially 
devastating political setback, Administration and congressional sources said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by CBO Director Robert D. Reischauer, to be announced in 
congressional testimony today, has been the subject of feverish speculation and 
intense Administration lobbying for more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Since late last week, a host of senior White House officials have contacted 
Reischauer and his top aides to try to talk him out of his position, White 
House aides said, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 By characterizing the White House health intiative as a government program 
that must be reflected in the federal budget, the CBO will make it easier for 
congressional Republicans and other critics to characterize the Clinton plan as 
a form of socialized medicine controlled by government bureaucrats rather than 
private firms and their insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would have done anything to avoid this -- anything," said one senior 
Senate aide who has been in close contact with the White House. "They tried 
like hell." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complication," acknowledged a senior White House official. "Whether 
it's a sustainable complication or not, I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said late Monday they were still uncertain precisely 
what Reischauer would say in his testimony but were hopeful that they had won 
some points. In particular, they hope he will announce that CBO's analysts 
basically agree that the Administration's numbers add up. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an endorsement would lend credibility to the Administration's claim that 
its plan, which is based on a requirement that all companies buy insurance for 
their workers, would finance itself without new taxes beyond the tobacco tax 
increase Clinton already has requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, White House aides said they believe that Reischauer will 
not call the required premium payment that employers and their workers would 
make under Clinton's plan a "tax," but instead would choose the less 
politically damaging moniker of "receipt." 
</P>
<P>
 Those points, however, are secondary to the major impact of the CBO testimony, 
which is to politically demolish Clinton's argument that his plan establishes a 
completely private program, not a new government spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials had said from the beginning of their efforts to come 
up with a health care plan that they would not propose a Canadian-style, 
government-run plan because the public would not support something that 
appeared to be such a major expansion of government. Under the CBO's ruling, 
Clinton's plan now suffers from the same liability. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gigantic contortion of a bill was done simply to avoid what Reischauer 
is saying tomorrow," said the Senate aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the CBO interpretation, the money paid by employers to insure their 
workers would be considered a government receipt. Spending for health insurance 
would be considered a government expenditure. The effect would not widen the 
federal deficit if the plan pays for itself as the Administration argues it 
will, but it would dramatically increase the apparent size of federal 
government -- boosting the budget by $330 billion, or roughly 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like having the L.A. earthquake and the Midwestern floods at the same 
time," the Senate aide said. "This means the plan is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials and other congressional aides were more sanguine, 
insisting that the proposal could survive the blow. "This is February, not 
August," said one senior House aide, noting that the process has many 
complicated turns to take before congressional votes even begin. 
</P>
<P>
 But even White House officials conceded that, at a minimum, key parts of 
Clinton's proposal would have to be rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fundamental conviction is that this is going to be worked out," said 
Clinton senior adviser George Stephanopoulos. But he admitted that "I can't say 
exactly how." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanopoulos and other Administration officials insisted that the CBO 
decision is essentially a technical matter involving the arcane rules governing 
the "score-keeping" of the federal budget. "I can't believe the American people 
are going to allow a scorekeeping issue to stand between them and getting 
guaranteed private insurance for everyone," Stephanopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, officials conceded that the political damage will be serious. As 
word spread of the CBO decision, Republicans were quick to seize it and argue 
that it makes Clinton's plan unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they are going to have to throw out two-thirds of their plan. (The 
President) is in terrible shape," said Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield), 
ranking minority member of the House Ways and Means health subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politically, (Reischauer) has just said you have to play the game by the 
rules. I don't think (Clinton) can win if he has to play by the rules," Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on its precise wording, Reischauer's ruling could affect some 
Republican alternative reform plans as well. For example, the plan offered by 
Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), and sponsored by Thomas in the House, avoids a 
mandate that employers pay for insurance, but would require all individuals to 
buy insurance. That mandate, too, might be considered an "on-budget" receipt 
under the CBO rules. 
</P>
<P>
 One immediate political impact of the ruling is to give far more leverage to 
congressional leaders, such as Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and key House committee Chairmen Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), 
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who avoided 
locking their legislative positions in place before the CBO acted. Over the 
next several weeks, those legislators will likely begin rewriting the reform 
legislation in ways that will meet CBO's rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials made no secret of their disagreement with Reischauer. 
Putting the health plan on the budget "makes no sense," insisted White House 
aide Gene Sperling. "It would be the same as saying that private auto insurance 
the state makes a person pay to a private auto insurer should also be on the 
budget and considered a tax. Nobody would ever imagine auto insurance being 
considered that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, an Administration official said, the White House has little 
choice now except to swallow its pride and head back to the drafting table. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not rocket science. There are rules," the official said.

CRIME SUMMIT OPENS WITH CALL FOR TOUGHER PENALTIES; LAW ENFORCEMENT: GOVERNOR 
BEGINS WITH EMOTIONAL MEMORIAL TO VICTIMS. SESSIONS HAVE POLITICAL OVERTONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Surrounded by the mothers and fathers of murdered children, Gov. Pete Wilson 
opened his crime summit Monday at a Hollywood church by renewing his call for 
increased penalties for violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit began with an emotional memorial service in the chapel of Hollywood 
Presbyterian Church, where photographs of more than 100 murder victims, most of 
them children, lined the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "This summit is to bring change, to make this state the safe and civilized 
place it was once and can be again," Wilson said at the memorial. "We have a 
right, each one of us, to never become a crime victim." 
</P>
<P>
 While the topic is a familiar one, the governor's crime summit is an 
unprecedented gathering of the state's highest officials, experts and victims 
of crime to discuss the best ways to prevent and punish criminal behavior. 
Wilson moderated panels on crime against women and children, school violence 
and crime prevention. More sessions are scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was rife with political overtones, as the subject of the conference 
coincides with one of the major themes of Wilson's campaign for reelection. A 
Wilson aide said the governor's campaign will purchase a videotape of the 
publicly funded event, presumably for use in television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the crime victims who appeared at the governor's side have been 
involved in past anti-crime efforts, including the 1986 campaign to unseat 
California Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an election year," said James Steyer, executive director of Children 
Now, an advocacy group that favors prevention programs over punishment. Steyer, 
a member of one of the panels, said in an interview, "The governor, shrewd 
politician that he is, read the public mood, and he captured the issue by 
saying how tough he was going to be. Now we've got Democrats and Republicans in 
a bidding war to see how tough they can be. But it's all rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, among the officials who traveled 
from Sacramento to attend the event, defended Wilson's decision to convene the 
summit, which was labeled by the governor's Democratic challengers as a 
campaign event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a campaign event, but I don't think that's inconsistent with substance 
coming out of it," said Brown, who convened an economic summit last year and is 
convening his own education summit in San Francisco next week. 
</P>
<P>
 There were repeated calls for passage of the "three strikes and you're out" 
initiative headed for the November ballot and other tough anti-crime bills, 
including a truth-in-sentencing measure that would reduce credits inmates earn 
for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants called for "zero tolerance" of guns and violence in school, 
requiring children to wear school uniforms and withholding a portion of welfare 
payments to parents whose children break the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Daniel Lungren, noting that he gains a "tremendous clarity of 
vision" when he views crime through the eyes of crime victims, repeated his 
call for legislation requiring the public release of names, photos and 
descriptions of all paroled child molesters. In Lungren's proposal, the 
information would be available in public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the talk of tougher criminal penalties, Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys) made a renewed call for gun control. He referred to mass killings at 101 
California Street in San Francisco last year and at Cleveland Elementary School 
in Stockton in 1989, and noted that neither killer had a significant criminal 
history. Both would have been on the streets whether or not there were laws 
providing for life sentences for habitual criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those victims can only be saved if we reduce firepower and make sure that the 
nuts in our society don't have the firepower to kill the kids," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams, who attended the 
conference along with Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, tempered some 
of the politicians' law-and-order proposals for tougher sentences by calling 
also for "treatment, rehabilitation and education." 
</P>
<P>
 "They absolutely must be part of any comprehensive crime package," Williams 
said. "If we don't provide some meaningful rehabilitation while people are in 
jail, we're going to have the same problem when they come out." 
</P>
<P>
 At the first panel discussion, which focused on violence against women and 
children, a San Diego County judge said that imposing life sentences on child 
molesters, which Wilson has proposed, could backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Harry Elias said he feared that long sentences could 
cause a decline in prosecutions because people would be more reluctant to 
report the crime, particularly involving family members, if they thought the 
perpetrator would be put away for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mistake to put everyone in the same cookie-cutter scenario," Elias 
said. "Kids are going to get hurt by it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the day's overriding theme was struck at the morning memorial to murder 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The service took on the tone of a convention of crime victims and their 
surviving family members. Several of them wept during the memorial, and members 
of Justice for Murdered Victims, Parents of Murdered Children, Justice for 
Homicide Victims and other groups wore yellow ribbons in remembrance of those 
they have buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Collene Campbell, whose son, Scott, was murdered in 1982 and whose brother 
also was murdered, introduced Wilson as "our friend, our champion." Campbell 
noted that Wilson's grandfather, a Chicago police officer, was killed in the 
line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who is mayor of San Juan Capistrano, was preceded by four other 
parents of murdered children, all of whom lauded the governor for his long 
involvement in anti-crime efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Lloyd Ogilvie of Hollywood Presbyterian Church opened the ceremony with 
a call for tougher sentences, more prisons and a limit on death penalty 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enough! Enough! Enough!" Ogilvie said in a booming voice. "We will not live 
with tyranny." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, meanwhile, used a speech at the Simon Wiesenthal Center on Monday 
night to propose several new measures to fight hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor suggested increasing penalties for hate crimes, developing 
hate-crime curriculum for schools and establishing a special system to track 
crimes motivated by prejudice or bigotry.

CLINTON'S BUDGET TOPS $1.5 TRILLION, REDUCES RED INK; ECONOMY: THE PLAN CUTS 
115 PROGRAMS AND TRIMS DEFENSE AND DOMESTIC SPENDING. IT INCLUDES A DEFICIT OF 
$176 BILLION, DOWN FROM PROJECTIONS OF $302 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Monday unveiled an austere federal budget for fiscal 1995 
that calls for elimination of 115 long-established programs, significant 
reductions in defense and domestic outlays and only slight increases for the 
Administration's top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's $1.52-trillion budget is designed to advance the 
President's agenda within the modest bounds permitted by tough new spending 
caps while still meeting the deficit reduction targets included in the economic 
plan passed by Congress in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the funding shifts and program curtailments it proposes are certain to 
provoke bitter struggles among affected interest groups and their allies in 
Congress. Liberal Democrats already are accusing Clinton of failing to honor 
his campaign promises to reverse the effects of 12 years of Republican rule and 
reinvigorate social spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, speaking to a business group in Houston, said that the budget 
demonstrates that "we mean business" about bringing down the federal deficit. 
"It's the toughest budget on spending cuts that Congress has yet seen," the 
President declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House estimates that its budget will leave the government with a 
deficit of $176 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, down from $235 
billion this year. Next year's projected shortfall is far below the 
$302-billion estimate made a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers could change yet again: The budget reflects very little of 
Clinton's health care and welfare reform initiatives, which will be dealt with 
in separate legislation. Those programs could significantly alter the spending 
and deficit outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon E. Panetta, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, 
said that the bulk of the reduction in the projected 1995 shortfall is 
attributable to passage last year of Clinton's economic plan, which raised 
taxes and cut spending in an effort to improve the long-term health of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most consistent deficit reduction effort in 40 years," Panetta 
said during a White House press conference. "This is a budget intended to keep 
the nation, our economic recovery, and the investment strategy the President 
began last year on track." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the President and his lieutenants outlined their budgetary objectives 
in expansive terms, Clinton's second budget really represents a standstill 
spending plan for a government caught in an ever-tightening fiscal vise. It 
proposes about $30 billion in cuts in discretionary domestic outlays in 1995, 
partly offset by $16 billion in new spending on other domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, to find money for such priorities as the Head Start preschool 
program, the hiring of thousands of new police officers and an expanded job 
training and youth apprenticeship initiative, Clinton wants to reduce funding 
for mass transit systems by 25%, sharply scale back energy assistance for the 
poor and stop funding construction of public housing units. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the net savings projected by Clinton's budget would come from 
reductions in the defense budget as the Pentagon continues to adjust to the 
realities of the post-Cold War world. Domestic departments, in contrast, would 
use most of the funds generated by cuts in some of their programs to pay for 
increases in others. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been forced by the spending caps in last year's deficit agreement 
to draft a budget that calls for a slight decline in total "discretionary" 
outlays for defense and domestic programs. Discretionary spending, at $542 
billion, accounts for roughly a third of the total federal budget. The 
remaining two-thirds, about $976 billion, is allocated to "mandatory" spending: 
benefits paid under Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other entitlement 
programs and interest on the national debt. Those outlays are not subject to 
the annual appropriation process and will continue to grow under Clinton's 
spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Administration officials said their new budget provides fresh 
evidence that health care costs are now the main culprit in driving up the 
deficit, underscoring the need for comprehensive health care reform. They said 
that they believe the looming battle over health care reform will dominate the 
budgetary and economic agendas for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration did not include the cost of its health care reform plan or 
its welfare reform initiative in the 1995 budget. Critics argue that once those 
big programs are passed by Congress, Clinton's budget -- and the federal 
deficit -- will balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Administration is not proposing any broad new taxes, the budget 
battle in Congress is expected to be less brutal than last summer's struggle 
over Clinton's five-year economic plan. Still, the 1995 budget contains a few 
revenue-raisers: Clinton wants to quadruple the federal cigarette tax to 99 
cents a pack to help pay for health care reform, and he is proposing $1.5 
billion in new fees paid by gun dealers, national park visitors and other users 
of federal services. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if taxes do not dominate the debate, Republicans and moderate Democrats 
are sure to attack the White House for not imposing deeper spending cuts. 
Another vote on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is scheduled in 
Congress this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been hoping to shift gears this year from deficit reduction to new 
spending on long-neglected domestic and social problems, and his budget offers 
a road map of the ideas and initiatives he wants to pursue: education reform, 
job training and apprenticeship programs, Head Start and childhood 
immunization, and high-technology initiatives such as development of the 
"information superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, almost all of the initiatives and ideas Clinton wants to 
emphasize fall short of his Administration's initial goals, revealing what has 
become the central dilemma of his presidency: Each time Clinton has had to 
reconcile deficit reduction with "investment" spending, cutting the deficit has 
carried the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department is a good example: Forty-six small programs, mostly in 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, would be eliminated or 
sharply scaled back. Yet the department's budget would go up 18% to provide 
funds for the White House technology initiative, defense conversion and 
development of the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am one of the few Cabinet members with a smile on my face this morning, 
given the release of this budget," observed Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The caps imposed by last year's economic plan will take a real bite out of 
federal spending next year. In fact, Clinton's budget calls for an overall 
decline in discretionary spending deeper than the cuts imposed by President 
Ronald Reagan following his first year in office. From 1981 to 1982, the Reagan 
Administration reduced discretionary spending by $6.6 billion; Clinton's budget 
shows a $17.7-billion decline in discretionary domestic and defense outlays 
from fiscal 1994 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta insisted that the Administration's budget-cutting effort will be 
credible, with no "gimmicks or smoke and mirrors." Still, to preserve some key 
initiatives while cutting spending, the government will have to engage in some 
questionable accounting practices. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Clinton and Congress are so anxious to use the savings resulting 
from the elimination of 118,300 federal jobs in 1995 that they essentially have 
double-counted the money; the Administration counts it toward deficit reduction 
while the Senate says it should go to help pay for Clinton's $2.7-billion crime 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a more detailed look at the direction the Clinton agenda will take 
over the coming year. Health 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's budget of $673 billion, up 6.5%, targets investments in three 
broad priority areas -- health prevention, children's programs and customer 
service -- at the expense of other areas within the department, according to 
Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for Head Start would grow 21% to more than $4 billion. Childhood 
immunization would increase 28% to $888 million. Funding would jump 15% to more 
than $1 billion for child care and development block grants, which allow 
parents to work or participate in job training. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlays for the National Institutes of Health would increase 4.7% to $11.4 
billion, with $2.7 billion targeted for AIDS research, prevention and 
treatment, a 6% increase. Defense 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is trying to walk a tightrope with his 1995 Pentagon budget. 
He is seeking to speed up the planned cutback in defense spending without 
sacrificing military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's proposal for $264 billion in military spending marks the start 
of a five-year Pentagon budget plan that cumulatively will slash $103 billion 
more than the one proposed by the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the budget for 1995 technically marks a slight increase from the 
current year's figure of $261 billion, it actually amounts to a 1% cut after 
accounting for inflation. Crime 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department is at the top of the list of budgetary winners, with a 
1995 spending plan that grows by 24%, or $2.7 billion, to $13.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs would put more police on the streets, place more violent 
criminals in prison, combat juvenile violence and develop "boot camps" for 
young offenders, along with other punitive and rehabilitative measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget provides $1.7 billion to hire police officers. When combined with 
local matching funds, the money would put 50,000 officers on the street, 
Justice officials said. Science 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is proposing $71 billion in research and development, an 
increase of $2.5 billion, or 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Science Foundation, which supports university-based science and 
engineering research, would receive a 6% increase, to $3.2 billion. The Human 
Genome Project, a massive effort to decode the chemical building blocks of 
life, would receive a 21% increase, to $241 million. Transportation 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said that his department's 
$39.7-billion budget, up 2% over last year, would shift funds to highway and 
transit programs. It proposes to finance, for the first time, a $1-billion 
Maritime Security Program aimed at revitalizing the U.S. commercial fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 While operating subsidies for urban mass transit systems would decrease by 
25%, Pena said that $2.2 billion targeted for longer-term capital spending 
would provide state and local governments with an overall increase of $3.6 
billion for capital programs. Labor 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department budget includes more money for programs that the 
Administration believes will help young Americans prepare for a changing work 
force and help displaced workers find new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is requesting $150 million for its school-to-work initiative, 
up from $50 million in 1994. The new funds would be combined with another $150 
million from the Education Department and used as seed money to encourage 
states and cities to create apprenticeship programs that combine on-the-job 
training with school-based learning. Environment 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration promised to ensure renewed emphasis in the areas of 
pollution control, technology development and job creation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's budgets for the Environmental Protection Agency and the 
energy and Interior departments total $35.2 billion. That represents a boost of 
$1.6 billion, or about 5%, over fiscal 1994 levels.

RAIN TRIGGERS SLIDES ON DENUDED HILLSIDES; STORM: BUSINESSES ALONG VENTURA 
BOULEVARD SCRAMBLE TO COVER QUAKE-DAMAGED WALLS AND ROOFS WITH PLASTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Intense downpours from the most powerful storm of the winter lashed the 
fire-denuded hillsides of Southern California on Monday, loosing mudslides that 
surged through beachfront houses in Malibu and briefly trapped a dozen 
residents in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds gusted to 50 m.p.h. as the main force of the storm marched onshore, 
rocking outlying areas with thunder claps. A waterspout was reported off Santa 
Barbara, and cyclonic winds touched down in Sunland and in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter traffic -- already crippled by earthquake detours -- slowed to a 
crawl in many areas as low-lying intersections flooded and vehicles skidded 
into one another on rain-slick streets. Officials warned that several major 
mountain highways -- such as those used as detours through the San Gabriels by 
Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley commuters to bypass quake bottlenecks -- 
probably would be blocked with heavy snow by dawn today. 
</P>
<P>
 Cloudbursts drenched work crews laboring around the clock to repair 
quake-damaged freeways and the battered Cal State Northridge campus. Rain 
soaked through temporary patches on roofs battered by the Jan. 17 temblor and 
made life a little more miserable for earthquake refugees still huddled in 
temporary shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,200 homes lost power for three hours in portions of Sunland, Sun 
Valley, Granada Hills and North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The potent core of the storm began moving onshore about 2 p.m., and within an 
hour, hillsides that were stripped bare in last fall's devastating brush fires 
began to give way. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, water, mud and rocks coursed down canyons to the sea, invading 
homes and blocking portions of Pacific Coast Highway between Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard and Malibu Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A delta of debris washed out of Big Rock Canyon Road and across the Pacific 
Coast Highway, sloshing up against about a dozen houses and scattering half a 
dozen cars and trucks like sandbox toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and emergency crews struggled through the muck, trying to erect 
makeshift dikes with sandbags. But despite their efforts, the mud seeped into 
the shorefront homes and about 15 houses farther inland at Big Rock and in Las 
Flores Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 residents were forced to evacuate -- some of them after being 
plucked from their roofs, where they had taken refuge from the rising mud and 
water, in the bucket of a Caltrans skip-loader. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people who didn't want to leave "had to be removed forcibly," 
according to Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Scott Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 One who left willingly was Greg Powers, whose beachfront house was invaded by 
tree trunks, uprooted shrubbery and almost four feet of mud and water. Powers 
said his Jeep was carried away by the torrent that hit his home about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I might move," he said. "I'm tired of this. First it was the fires, 
then the earthquake, now this." 
</P>
<P>
 As Powers surveyed the damage, he carried his two yowling cats around with him 
in a soggy cardboard pet carrier. "They're kind of upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, which bore the brunt of last month's earthquake, 
businesses big and small along Ventura Boulevard scrambled to cover damaged 
walls and roofs with huge sheets of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 One office in a three-story building in Sherman Oaks had been left completely 
open to the elements, and although workers covered the open area with plastic 
sheeting, water seeped down through cracks and damaged office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The supplies were left in "the one part of the suite that we thought would be 
safe," said Elsie Bowker, 50, owner of a Sherman Oaks property-management 
company that once occupied the damaged suite. "We didn't know that it was the 
room that the rain would come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming so soon after the quake, the storm added "insult to injury," Bowker 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
 At Century Bank in Encino, it was the timing of the rain that caught bank 
employees off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were somewhat prepared for the rain, but frankly I forgot about one 
damaged part of the roof, and the rain leaked in there," said Albert Sage, a 
Century vice president. Sage estimated the storm would add $10,000 to the 
$250,000 damage the bank suffered in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,200 customers in North Hollywood, Granada Hills, Sun Valley and 
Sunland were left in the dark when the rains and wind knocked out five main 
circuits in the area. Service was largely restored by about 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds described by witnesses as "cyclonic" knocked down trees and electrical 
lines in Sun Valley, leaving traffic signals and a train crossing gate without 
power. An area just north of the Burbank Airport was particularly hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 3:40 p.m., Crockett Street resident Sandra Morales heard a loud thud 
outside her home. "I looked out the window and there was garbage in the air, 
but I didn't see my car," said Morales, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went outside, I saw the tree was lying on my car." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, at the busy intersection of San Fernando Road and Sunland Boulevard, a 
sign broke off the El Mexicano Taco Stand, shattering in the street. The 
windows of the drive-in stand also blew out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The glass shattered and went into the food," said cook Max Alcaraz, 17. "But 
we just heated up more and kept it going." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Valley, the rain overwhelmed storm drains, creating small 
rivers that slowed traffic on many boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Above Malibu, basketball-sized rocks crashed down onto Old Topanga Canyon 
Road, and sheets of mud and gravel covered stretches of the pavement. The 
persistent rains were beginning to warp wooden signs erected to thank 
firefighters for their efforts during the hellish fires that burned through 
Topanga Canyon last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Sandler returned from work Monday night to find her Malibu house filled 
with four feet of mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bedroom has been washed away into the ocean," she said. "It was like a 
river running through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The muck spilled off her back porch like a waterfall, splattering down into 
storm-driven waves that swirled around the pilings supporting her home. 
Although some of the sand around the pilings was washing away, all the homes 
appeared to be standing fast Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same thing happened" more than 20 years ago, said neighbor Monique Marti, 
who said she probably would spend the night with friends in Santa Monica. "But 
you hate to go away from your home," she said. "Because you don't know what it 
will look like when you get back." 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Smith slogged her way to safety after her Mercedes-Benz was trapped in a 
mudflow near Big Rock Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I looked to make the next curve, there was this huge bank of mud coming 
toward me," she told a KABC-TV crew. "Unbelievable, unbelievable. Things you 
see in the movies -- and it was happening to me." 
</P>
<P>
 In Altadena, mud, rocks and debris from about 600 acres burned in last fall's 
fire slid down onto Pasadena Glen Road during a short but intensive cloudburst, 
isolating about 20 hillside homes and damaging some of them. Most of the 
residents had already fled or were away at work, but about a dozen were cut off 
from escape as the mudslides continued to threaten their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 After about an hour, county firefighters slogged through mud up to four feet 
deep to reach the stranded people and escort them to safety. There were no 
reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Altadena slide cut another street, Old Grove Road, but the residents there 
were able to use alternate routes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, cyclonic winds touched down near an industrial area and 
carved a swath to UC Irvine, blowing down trees and power lines, shattering 
windows and damaging a roof, police and fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach hillsides ravaged in the Oct. 27 fire were holding up pretty 
well, according to Bill Reiter, public works operations manager for the 
county's Environmental Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiter's office was coordinating the efforts of about 50 workers -- including 
24 prison inmates -- on hand to monitor the situation and help shore up the 
hillsides in case of mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said the heavy rain 
should have tapered off well before dawn today, with a few showers -- and 
possibly some more thundershowers -- predicted until about noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be partial clearing by the afternoon as the storm system 
continues moving inland," he said. "After that, it looks like it should be 
pretty dry for the rest of the week." 
</P>
<P>
 By 5 p.m. Monday, 0.51 of an inch of rain had fallen at the Los Angeles Civic 
Center, raising the total for the season to 3.21 inches. The normal season's 
total for Feb. 7 is 8.61 inches. By this time last year, the city had received 
18.83 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Other rainfall totals as of 5 p.m. Monday included 1.73 inches in Santa 
Barbara, 1.58 in Long Beach, 1.30 in Santa Ana, 1.01 at Los Angeles 
International Airport, 0.88 in Palm Springs, 0.71 in Newport Beach, 0.63 in 
Monrovia, 0.41 in San Diego and 0.08 in Bakersfield.

NEW DISASTER ROLE SOUGHT FOR NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Impressed by the way some San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Watch groups coped 
with the Northridge earthquake, police and city officials say they now want to 
turn the local anti-crime groups into full-fledged emergency preparedness teams 
for the next disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the lessons of the quake was that suburban neighbors who had already 
banded together under police supervision in the Neighborhood Watch groups were 
much better at dealing with the disaster than the rest of the city, police and 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some checked for gas leaks while others knew where to find the elderly and 
children who might need help. While some scurried about sizing up their 
neighborhood's problems, others relayed that information to police and city 
officials through assigned liaison officers. 
</P>
<P>
 And since they all knew each other already, Neighborhood Watch members shared 
their pantries and their homes with the less fortunate among them. Others in 
the city had to scramble for help from strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the wake of the deadly quake -- and in preparation for the Big One or 
one of the many other calamities that could befall the city -- police have 
quietly begun transforming the Neighborhood Watch program in the west San 
Fernando Valley from a simple vehicle for monitoring crime into a full-fledged, 
disaster response system, encouraging residents to be as self-reliant as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step, officials said Monday, will be to try to expand the program 
citywide. That way, when police and firefighters are busy handling the most 
critical problems in the next emergency, many residents will be capable of 
fending for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time is right, based on our recent experience," said West Valley Police 
Capt. Val Paniccia, who has ordered the expansion of Neighborhood Watch groups 
in his division. "The real key in any major disaster is being able to survive 
the first few days. And as a group, you can survive a lot longer and better." 
</P>
<P>
 The police, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick and the city Fire 
Department all have pledged to work jointly to get West Valley neighbors 
together, and to train them in first aid and other emergency response 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can turn a disaster into an opportunity to do things better," said Chick, 
who represents the southwestern Valley and whose office came up with the idea 
about the same time police did. "Now this is an ASAP priority thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Neighborhood Watch program, block residents meet regularly to 
discuss crime issues and to organize themselves to keep watch for possible 
criminal activity. Block captains keep track of what happens on their streets, 
reporting to PCRs -- or police community representatives -- citizens who stay 
in contact with authorities and the local City Council member's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the hours after the first jolt Jan. 17, something unexpected happened 
on those streets organized under the Neighborhood Watch system. Even before the 
sun rose, neighbors met with neighbors and canvassed their areas, checking to 
see if everyone was OK, helping those who weren't and locating gas leaks and 
other hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, God, did it ever work -- it was wonderful," said Marilyn Robinson, 49, a 
Neighborhood Watch leader for the Bassett Street group in Quimby Park. "You 
know names, you know who to look for. We shared our water. We made coffee. We 
even met neighbors who just moved in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Neighborhood Watch apparatus enabled the 274 members of the Quimby Park 
group to do more than just share food. Within a day, they had compiled a list 
of residents who wanted city building and safety inspectors to check their 
homes for damage. Robinson forwarded it to her field representative in Chick's 
office. "We had them out within two days," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her block captains, Robinson also was able to spread important news, 
such as that a water tanker had been brought into the parking lot at Canoga 
Park High School. Watch members patrolled the area day and night, looking for 
looters and other signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, groups such as Robinson's are already anticipating expanding into 
disaster response teams. At a Feb. 2 meeting at West Valley police 
headquarters, about 50 Neighborhood Watch leaders met with police and had their 
pictures taken for identification cards. Quimby Park and the nine other 
Neighborhood Watch groups in the immediate area will send a representative to 
an emergency preparedness class scheduled to start Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "God forbid, in case the (phone) lines are down and we can't get through, we 
would know what to do," Robinson said. "When you have a disaster, you can band 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on their experience in the Northridge quake, police and city officials 
acknowledge that many residents will be on their own in the event of another 
major disaster, especially during the critical first hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Having residents who can care for themselves and secure their neighborhoods 
will be important in the days and weeks after a major disaster, they said, when 
food and water will be scarce and lines of communication will be down. 
</P>
<P>
 As planned, the groups would have checklists of how to respond to each 
disaster -- floods, earthquakes, fires -- and specific tasks for each person. 
Residents would know where to report for duty, and command posts could be 
established where people could meet and get their bearings, Paniccia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could take tallies of damage in their areas, and get better police 
response," Paniccia said. "And it's an automatic anti-looting patrol. They will 
know who belongs and who doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Paniccia said he is looking into finding a way to supply each neighborhood 
with a shed containing a master list of residents, search-and-rescue tools, 
food and water, water-purification systems, first-aid supplies and other 
important equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 On a visit to Japan in 1988 as a member of the state's Seismic Safety 
Commission, Councilman Hal Bernson -- who represents the northwestern Valley -- 
found that Japanese citizens had been trained in emergency preparedness. 
Impressed, he pushed for a program that has trained several thousand Los 
Angeles residents in emergency response techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's budget has been slashed, but Bernson plans to ask that funding 
be reinstated, said his chief of staff, Greig Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Ronald Jackson, who oversees the Fire Department's community response 
team unit, said firefighters could easily train Neighborhood Watch groups in 
disaster techniques such as light search-and-rescue and basic first aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be easy for us to go to their meetings and teach them, so they have 
this knowledge under their belts. And they're more likely to stay together as a 
team," Jackson said. "It's a great idea." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, police and Chick's office will be looking for ways to get the 
program off the ground and expand it into areas in which Neighborhood Watch 
does not yet exist. Many people who have shied away from Neighborhood Watch 
because of its emphasis on police activities may welcome an opportunity to 
respond to natural disasters, Paniccia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The walls that came down in the earthquake weren't just masonry and wood; a 
lot of people came out and began talking to each other for the first times in 
their lives," Paniccia said. "We want this communication between neighbors to 
continue and expand and grow, so that when they put the walls back up, the 
communication will still be there."

SOUTHWEST APT TO IGNITE O.C. AIR FARE WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines, which is expected to gain approval today for 17 daily 
flights at John Wayne Airport, will probably ignite a price war this summer 
that could cut fares for Orange County travelers by more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's leading low-cost carrier will be allowed four daily flights after 
April 1 and 13 more in June if the Orange County Board of Supervisors approves 
Southwest's request at a meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 The carrier already operates two of those flights -- a pair of Orange 
County-to-Salt Lake City routes run by Morris Air. It purchased Morris Air in 
December and continues to operate it as a subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Blanchard, an aide to county Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, said Monday 
that he knew of no opposition to Southwest's proposed entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most people are excited about it," Blanchard said. "This could mean 
lower fares and increased service. I'm sure the competition is watching." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, say industry experts and Southwest itself, the Dallas-based carrier 
usually offers fares that are 50% to 75% lower than the rates available before 
it comes to town. Airlines that fly similar routes typically start offering 
their own specials and deep discounts -- or they abandon those routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest hasn't said yet where possible Orange County flights might go, but 
industry sources have said it will probably compete with both low-fare carriers 
like America West Airlines and leading airlines like Delta Air Lines on flights 
to major cities in the Southwest and the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 America West, based in Phoenix, is bracing for the competition, even as it 
prepares a plan to bring itself out of bankruptcy after more than a year of 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're well aware of the possibilities and we're looking at a variety of 
options," said spokesman Dick Dikshimizu. "Southwest is a very tough 
competitor, but we've been competing with them since we started up in 1983." 
</P>
<P>
 As it has in other markets it has entered, Southwest also is expected to be a 
boon to related airport businesses as it attracts many more customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The carrier, for instance, started a Chicago-Louisville, Ky., flight and, 
within a month, quadrupled the number of travelers for that route. That 
translated into more parking fees and more purchases from food vendors and 
other stores in the terminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County would benefit if the same holds true here because the county 
government takes a cut from nearly all services at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very good for Orange County," said Thomas Nulty, president of 
Associated Travel Management in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and other travel agents warn prospective customers not to expect big 
changes in the prices of long-distance travel. Southwest is strictly a 
short-haul carrier, providing no-frills service mainly to regional airports 
that are typically no more than 500 to 600 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southwest does go to Baltimore (-Washington International Airport) but it 
takes 9 1/2 hours to get there," Nulty said. "You have to change planes twice 
and make two additional stops. And even doing that, the prices are not that 
much cheaper than major airlines that offer super-saver fares that you buy 14 
days in advance." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Southwest's alluring prices typically bring out the leisure travelers 
as well as the thrifty business flyer looking for less expensive flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they went into Baltimore three months ago, they advertised $39 tickets 
(one way) to Cleveland," said Cleo Manuel, a spokeswoman for the National 
Consumers League in Washington. "With prices like that, one of my colleagues 
couldn't pass it up and went for a day to see the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, that was a special price for traveling in off-peak hours, said 
Southwest spokesman Ed Stewart. The normal Baltimore-Cleveland fare is $49 one 
way. "Before we came in, the price for an unrestricted ticket was $300 one 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, Southwest started serving San Jose with flights to Burbank at $69 
one way and to Las Vegas at $79 one way. Other carriers had been charging $220 
and $260, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest previously had sought a large number of flights from John Wayne 
Airport under the county's complicated formula for allocating departure slots. 
It was put on a waiting list for new carriers in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But things began to move quickly after it announced in mid-December that it 
would acquire Morris Air in Salt Lake City, another low-fare carrier. Among 
Morris' routes were two Orange County-Salt Lake City flights. With the 
acquisition completed at the end of December, Southwest became an incumbent 
carrier at John Wayne entitled to be among the first bidders for open slots. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides assuming Morris Air's slots on April 1, Southwest is expected to get 
two more slots at the same time. They will have those departures through 2005. 
The remaining flights would be available after June 1 for year-to-year 
renewals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport is pleased that we have a low-cost carrier that wants to serve 
with some frequency and with one of the quietest airplanes available," said 
Courtney Wiercioch, the airport's special projects director. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest excels in smaller markets mainly because there is so little 
competition there and carriers that do serve those areas charge premium fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that airlines in non-competitive markets typically charge 
20% more for tickets than they would at competitive airports, said Geraldine 
Frankoski of Aviation Consumer Action Project, a Ralph Nader organization in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its start in 1971, Southwest has targeted smaller markets with a plan 
that has brought it 21 consecutive years of profits in a volatile industry 
often racked with losses and financial collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 It keeps costs low by using only one type of aircraft, a Boeing 737, to fly 
only short trips mainly to secondary airports, like Chicago's Midway, though it 
also serves Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Its planes are in the air longer than any others, refueling and taking on new 
passengers quickly. And passengers take seats on a first-come, first-served 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has refused to join airline consortiums that handle reservations and 
that transfer baggage to other airlines, thus saving sizable fees while trying 
the patience of travel agencies and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what Southwest has over everyone is their labor agreements -- they have 
none," said Thomas A. Jackson, president of World Travel Bureau Inc. in Santa 
Ana. "Their success shows that people are willing to accept a lower level of 
service."

CRIME SUMMIT OPENS WITH CALL FOR TOUGHER PENALTIES; LAW ENFORCEMENT: GOVERNOR 
BEGINS WITH EMOTIONAL MEMORIAL TO VICTIMS. SESSIONS HAVE POLITICAL OVERTONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN and DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surrounded by the mothers and fathers of murdered children, Gov. Pete Wilson 
opened his crime summit Monday at a Hollywood church by renewing his call for 
increased penalties for violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit began with an emotional memorial service in the chapel of Hollywood 
Presbyterian Church, where photographs of more than 100 murder victims, most of 
them children, lined the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "This summit is to bring change, to make this state the safe and civilized 
place it was once and can be again," Wilson said at the memorial. "We have a 
right, each one of us, to never become a crime victim." 
</P>
<P>
 While the topic is a familiar one, the governor's crime summit is an 
unprecedented gathering of the state's highest officials, experts and victims 
of crime to discuss the best ways to prevent and punish criminal behavior. 
Wilson moderated panels on crime against women and children, school violence 
and crime prevention. More sessions are scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those gathered were a number of Orange County officials, including Rudy 
Castruita, Santa Ana Unified School District superintendent, and San Juan 
Capistrano Mayor Collene Campbell, who offered gripping testimony about her 
personal losses due to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was rife with political overtones, as the subject of the conference 
coincides with one of the major themes of Wilson's campaign for reelection. A 
Wilson aide said the governor's campaign will purchase a videotape of the 
publicly funded event, presumably for use in television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good that the governor's campaign kicked off with a crime summit," 
said Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), a likely candidate for state 
attorney general. "But I don't know how many minds will be changed as a result 
of this. I didn't hear Wilson say any new things. That's a bit disappointing 
but not unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was the political significance lost on Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach), an official of Wilson's own political stripe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of what everybody is saying here is known by everybody in California who 
still is breathing," Ferguson said. "The only real good that comes out of these 
things is politicians are apt to make statements that they'll have to follow 
through on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that crime is finally being taken seriously," Ferguson said. "But a 
meeting like this probably wouldn't be happening if it weren't for crime 
getting into places like Beverly Hills and Newport Beach. That's sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the crime victims who appeared at the governor's side have been 
involved in past anti-crime efforts, including the 1986 campaign to unseat 
California Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an election year," said James Steyer, executive director of Children 
Now, an advocacy group that favors prevention programs over punishment. Steyer, 
a member of one of the panels, said in an interview, "The governor, shrewd 
politician that he is, read the public mood, and he captured the issue by 
saying how tough he was going to be. Now we've got Democrats and Republicans in 
a bidding war to see how tough they can be. But it's all rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, among the officials who traveled 
from Sacramento to attend the event, defended Wilson's decision to convene the 
summit, which was labeled by the governor's Democratic challengers as a 
campaign event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a campaign event, but I don't think that's inconsistent with substance 
coming out of it," said Brown, who convened an economic summit last year and is 
convening his own education summit in San Francisco next week. 
</P>
<P>
 There were repeated calls for passage of the "three strikes and you're out" 
initiative headed for the November ballot and other tough anti-crime bills, 
including a truth-in-sentencing measure that would reduce credits inmates earn 
for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants called for "zero tolerance" of guns and violence in school, 
requiring children to wear school uniforms and withholding a portion of welfare 
payments to parents whose children break the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Daniel Lungren, noting that he gains a "tremendous clarity of 
vision" when he views crime through the eyes of crime victims, repeated his 
call for legislation requiring the public release of names, photos and 
descriptions of all paroled child molesters. In Lungren's proposal, the 
information would be available in public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the talk of tougher criminal penalties, Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys) made a renewed call for gun control. He referred to mass killings at 101 
California Street in San Francisco last year and at Cleveland Elementary School 
in Stockton in 1989, and noted that neither killer had a significant criminal 
history. Both would have been on the streets whether or not there were laws 
providing for life sentences for habitual criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those victims can only be saved if we reduce firepower and make sure that the 
nuts in our society don't have the firepower to kill the kids," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams, who attended the 
conference along with Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, tempered some 
of the politicians' law-and-order proposals for tougher sentences by calling 
also for "treatment, rehabilitation and education." 
</P>
<P>
 "They absolutely must be part of any comprehensive crime package," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first panel discussion, which focused on violence against women and 
children, a San Diego County judge said that imposing life sentences on child 
molesters, which Wilson has proposed, could backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Harry Elias said he feared that long sentences could 
cause a decline in prosecutions because people would be more reluctant to 
report the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mistake to put everyone in the same cookie-cutter scenario," Elias 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the day's overriding theme was struck at the morning memorial to murder 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The service took on the tone of a convention of crime victims and their 
surviving family members. Several of them wept during the memorial, and members 
of Justice for Murdered Victims, Parents of Murdered Children, Justice for 
Homicide Victims and other groups wore yellow ribbons in remembrance of those 
they have buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, whose son, Scott, was murdered in 1982 and whose brother also was 
murdered, introduced Wilson as "our friend, our champion." Campbell noted that 
Wilson's grandfather, a Chicago police officer, was killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Lloyd Ogilvie of Hollywood Presbyterian Church opened the ceremony with 
a call for tougher sentences, more prisons and a limit on death penalty 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enough! Enough! Enough!" Ogilvie said in a booming voice. "We will not live 
with tyranny." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, meanwhile, used a speech at the Simon Wiesenthal Center on Monday 
night to propose several new measures to fight hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor suggested increasing penalties for hate crimes, developing 
hate-crime curriculum for schools and establishing a special system to track 
crimes motivated by prejudice or bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the Los Angeles crime meeting coincided Monday with the first 
gathering of local officials following Orange County's gang violence summit 
held in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg, a member of the Orange 
County Gang Prevention Alliance Executive Committee, said the group will meet 
every month in an attempt to formulate successful anti-gang and anti-crime 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a group assembled that will check the egos at the door," 
Lowenberg said. "This issue is too important." 
</P>
<P>
 In its first meeting, committee members reviewed notes submitted by delegates 
to the November summit, many of whom expressed concern about the lack of 
parental responsibility and the overall operation of the state criminal justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The criminal justice system hasn't worked in a long time," Lowenberg said. 
"Whether (the breakdown) is real or perceived, people see police arresting 
criminals only to see them back out on the streets in a very short time. People 
know there is something wrong. I've seen it deteriorate for years."

STORM UNLEASHES MUD ON DENUDED HILLSIDES; WEATHER: SLIDES HIT MALIBU, BUT 
LAGUNA FARES OK IN INTENSE DOWNPOUR. CYCLONIC WINDS RIP THROUGH IRVINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Intense downpours from the most powerful storm of the winter lashed the 
fire-denuded hillsides of Southern California on Monday, setting loose 
mudslides that surged through beachfront houses in Malibu and cyclonic winds 
that ripped through Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds gusted to 50 m.p.h. as the main force of the storm marched onshore, 
rocking outlying areas with thunder claps. A waterspout was reported off Santa 
Barbara, and the tornadolike winds cut a swath through part of Orange County, 
snapping trees, blowing out windows and snatching patches of roofs from 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, water, mud and rocks coursed down the canyons to the sea, invading 
homes and blocking portions of Pacific Coast Highway between Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard and Malibu Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A delta of debris washed out of Big Rock Canyon Road and across Pacific Coast 
Highway, sloshing against about a dozen houses and scattering half a dozen cars 
and trucks like sandbox toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and emergency crews struggled through the muck, trying to plug 
makeshift dikes with sandbags. But despite their efforts, mud began seeping 
into shorefront homes and about 15 houses farther inland at Big Rock and in Las 
Flores Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 residents were forced to evacuate. A big Caltrans skip-loader was 
used to pluck several of them from their roofs, where they had taken refuge 
from the rising mud and water. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, two people suffered cuts and bruises when struck by falling 
trees, said Kathleen Cha, spokeswoman for the County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage was reported as far south as MacArthur Boulevard in Newport Beach and 
as far north as Foothill Boulevard in Cowan Heights, but the most havoc hit 
Irvine, as the winds whipped north along Von Karman Avenue from Santa Ana 
Heights to the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station about 6:45 p.m. Power outages 
dotted Irvine and Tustin as trees large and small littered streets, blocked 
driveways and covered cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden we heard kind of a boom, and I looked outside the window and 
there was just a white sheet of water," said Michele Herbel, a Rancho Santa 
Margarita resident who was working late at her office at Von Karman and 
Barranca when the winds hit. "It was dark outside but there was a flurry of 
white splashing water outside the window and you could not see. It seemed to 
last forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the National Weather Service and WeatherData, Inc. could not 
say Monday night what caused the winds nor whether there had in fact been a 
tornado. Cha called it a "tornado-like event" but said she was unsure whether 
the winds had been 75 m.p.h., which is the threshold for a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't a tornado it was pretty darn close," said Marine Col. Bill 
Hammerle, who was watching television with his 4 1/2-year-old son when it went 
black as the winds whipped through the Tustin base. 
</P>
<P>
 At the base, roofs leaked and shingles fell from several residences, the roof 
of the fire department was partially blown off, and trees had crashed around 
the grounds, Hammerle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Beres, who works at a Tustin gas station on Red Hill Avenue near the 
freeway, said the winds shattered his station's windows, scattered debris, 
twisted a fence and moved an 80-pound sign across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain was coming down in sheets," he said. "Then I saw the freeway sign, 
which is gone now, go flying by." 
</P>
<P>
 The damage appeared most severe south of the marine base, in Irvine, where the 
winds sped along Von Karman Avenue through a light-industrial park, according 
to Irvine Sgt. Tom Hume. 
</P>
<P>
 Police closed Von Karman between Main Street and Barranca Parkway for much of 
the evening. Throughout the area, windows had been shattered, roofs ruined and 
trees thrown to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day Monday, the storm caused snarling traffic and power outages 
in Orange County and revived jitters among residents of South County's coastal 
communities already heavily damaged by earlier fires and mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Laguna Beach, hillsides ravaged in the Oct. 27 fire were holding up 
pretty well, according to Bill Reiter, public works operations manager for the 
county's Environmental Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiter's office was coordinating the efforts of about 50 workers -- including 
24 prison inmates -- on hand to monitor the situation and help shore up 
hillsides in case of mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, however, the mudslides brought chaos and confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people who did not want to leave "had to be removed forcibly," said 
Capt. Scott Smith of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 One who left willingly was Greg Powers, whose beachfront house was invaded by 
tree trunks, shrubbery and almost four feet of mud and water. Powers said his 
Jeep was carried away by the torrent that hit his home about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I might move," he said. "I'm tired of this. First it was the fires, 
then the earthquake, now this." 
</P>
<P>
 As Powers surveyed the damage, he carried his two yowling cats around with him 
in a soggy cardboard pet carrier. "They're kind of upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monique Marti, who lives several houses away, said that more than 20 years 
ago, "the same thing happened." She said she probably would spend the night 
with friends in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you hate to go away from your home," she said. "Because you don't know 
what it will look like when you get back." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Sandler returned from work Monday night to find her house filled with 
four feet of mud. "The bedroom has been washed away into the ocean," she said. 
"It was like a river running through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The water spilled off her back porch like a waterfall, splattering down into 
storm-driven waves that swirled around the pilings supporting her home. 
Although some of the sand around the pilings was washing away, all the homes 
appeared to be standing fast Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Smith slogged her way to safety after her Mercedes-Benz was trapped in a 
mudflow near Big Rock Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I looked to make the next curve, there was this huge bank of mud coming 
toward me," she told a KABC-TV crew. "Unbelievable, unbelievable -- things you 
see in the movies. And it was happening to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Above Malibu, basketball-size rocks crashed down onto Old Topanga Canyon Road, 
and sheets of mud and gravel covered stretches of the pavement. The persistent 
rain was beginning to warp wooden signs thanking firefighters for their efforts 
during the hellish fires that burned through Topanga Canyon last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In Altadena, mud, rocks and debris from about 600 acres burned in last fall's 
fire slid onto Pasadena Glen Road during a cloudburst, isolating about 20 
hillside homes and damaging some of them. Most of the residents already had 
fled or were away at work, but about a dozen were cut off as the mudslides 
continued to threaten their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 After about an hour, county firefighters slogged through mud up to four feet 
deep to reach the stranded people and escort them to safety. There were no 
reports of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said the heavy rain 
should taper off well before dawn today, with a few showers -- and possibly 
some more thundershowers -- predicted until about noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be partial clearing by the afternoon as the storm system 
continues moving inland," he said. "After that, it looks like it should be 
pretty dry for the rest of the week." 
</P>

DIP IN CRIME TIED TO EXTRA POLICE PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the aftermath of last month's earthquake, thousands of police officers, 
sheriff's deputies and National Guard troops helped keep criminals off the 
streets in record numbers, according to internal police records. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-by-day records gathered by the Los Angeles Police Department and obtained 
by The Times show that so-called "repressible crime" -- those crimes that 
experts say can be deterred by uniformed police officers -- dropped 21.5% 
during the second half of January, the period after the Jan. 17 earthquake. The 
biggest drops were recorded in the San Fernando Valley, but the statistics 
reveal that decreases were logged in 17 of the LAPD's 18 geographic areas, some 
of which sustained relatively little earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Southwest area, a South Los Angeles community that saw some of the 
worst rioting in 1992 but which was far from the area hardest hit by the 
earthquake: Repressible crime there was down 14.6% during the last two weeks in 
January. And in the LAPD's South Bureau, one of America's most violent areas, 
even homicides took a holiday: The bureau, which usually averages more than a 
murder a day, enjoyed a six-day hiatus from homicides, the first time in recent 
memory that the area has gone for so long without a killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some extremely significant drops in crime throughout South Bureau," 
said Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker, who recently was put in charge of the LAPD's 
operations in South Los Angeles. "It really makes the point that there's no 
limit to what we can do with additional officers." 
</P>
<P>
 The repressible crime statistics -- which include murders, most aggravated 
assaults, robberies, burglaries, thefts from cars and auto thefts -- bolster 
the lower arrest numbers released by the department during the days after the 
earthquake and help dispel any suggestion that arrests were down only because 
the LAPD was busy performing other duties rather than arresting suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, although some decreases in reported crimes are almost certainly 
attributable to the outpouring of goodwill that followed the 6.7-magnitude 
quake, the breadth of the crime drop suggests to many analysts that the 
department's mobilization, which put thousands of additional officers on the 
streets, had a marked impact on crime in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a significant increase in uniformed visibility, it does have an 
impact on repressible crimes," Police Chief Willie L. Williams said Monday. 
"Those are crimes where visibility can take away the opportunity for someone to 
commit a crime or at least raise the stakes of them doing it and getting away 
successfully." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and other department officials noted that a similar drop in 
repressible crimes occurred during the weekend after last year's federal 
verdicts in the Rodney G. King civil rights case. The LAPD mobilized for the 
end of that trial, and its increased presence helped thwart crime during that 
period, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar mobilization was activated within hours of the earthquake, as 
officers throughout the department were ordered to work 12-hour shifts. In 
addition, the department canceled days off and, because many courts were closed 
for a few days after the quake, officers who would have been required to 
testify in cases also were on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although advocates of a bigger Police Department say more officers could deter 
a variety of crimes, uniformed police are especially effective at discouraging 
"repressible property crime" -- burglary, theft from cars and auto theft. Those 
crimes are generally committed in public, and it is those crimes that generally 
showed the greatest reduction in the aftermath of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of the quake, property crime throughout the city dropped 
precipitously. Many observers place little long-term emphasis on that drop, 
however, as so many residents were scrambling to assess damage to their homes 
and apartments that few -- even criminals -- had time to go about their 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 More significant, Police Department officials say, is the fact that property 
crimes remained relatively low during the next week or so, while extra patrols 
roamed the streets of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 18 and Jan. 19, nearly 5,000 police officers, sheriff's deputies and 
National Guard troops patrolled the city. For those two days, an average of 350 
repressible property crimes per day were reported, compared to more than 500 on 
a typical day. 
</P>
<P>
 For the week as a whole, the citywide average after the earthquake was 400 
property crimes a day. As the deployment began to ease back, property crime 
gradually rose to its normal levels: Between Jan. 24 and Jan. 30, with the 
National Guard pulling out of the city and the LAPD scaling back its 
mobilization, criminals committed an average of 549 repressible property crimes 
per day. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this does present the city is a challenge," Williams said of the 
numbers, "a challenge to come up with a reasonable way to put more people on 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Mayor Richard Riordan have been stumping for such a plan, one 
that would expand the Police Department by 2,855 officers in five years. The 
problem is money, and Williams conceded that other city services may suffer to 
make room for such a dramatic expansion of the 7,600-officer force. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of expanding the LAPD has attracted widespread backing, winning 
support from longtime police critics such as the American Civil Liberties 
Union. But Paul Hoffman, legal director of the Southern California ACLU, 
cautioned against reading too much into the earthquake statistics and warned 
against the LAPD moving too quickly to expand its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU "believes that you need more police officers," Hoffman said. "They 
just have to be trained and disciplined in the right way." 
</P>
<P>
 As the department statistics make clear, the connection between deployment of 
additional police officers and lower crime is not perfect. About a week after 
the earthquake, with thousands of extra officers and Guard troops still on the 
street, property crimes began rebounding. Although homicides temporarily 
dipped, 27 people were murdered citywide in the two weeks after the earthquake, 
exactly the number killed in the two weeks prior to the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a few exceptions, large numbers of police officers on patrol and low 
crime went hand in hand after the quake. And that, department officials say, 
demonstrates that making Los Angeles safer depends on having more police in the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone can discount the importance of the increased presence 
that the department had," said Police Commission President Gary Greenebaum. 
"This was a citywide mobilization, and we saw the results citywide. People ask 
the question: 'Will more police on the street mean less crime?' I think the 
answer is clearly yes."

U.S. CONSIDERS ULTIMATUM ON SARAJEVO ARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration and its European allies are moving toward a 
decision to lift the siege of the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, by demanding the 
removal of all artillery from the city and surrounding territory and enforcing 
the demand with military power, senior U.S. and European officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's top foreign policy advisers have prepared a U.S. proposal 
for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that centers on an ultimatum to all 
forces in the Sarajevo area to give up their heavy weapons, including the 
Serbian artillery that has pounded the city for months, killing hundreds of 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which also includes options for air strikes and other military 
action to enforce the ultimatum, was presented to President Clinton late Monday 
night in Shreveport, La., by National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, a White 
House official said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton approves the plan, as his aides expect, the United States will 
present it at a NATO meeting in Brussels on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In another step toward military action, Britain -- which had argued against 
NATO air strikes -- said that it is now convinced that some use of force is 
probably necessary. "The balance of risk and benefit has changed," Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd said, adding that the allies have moved "a step forward 
toward using force." 
</P>
<P>
 France and Germany also joined in support of air strikes or other action 
against the Serbian guns. The European Union, which includes most of NATO's 
European members, declared that the alliance's goal should be "the immediate 
lifting of the siege of Sarajevo using all means necessary, including the use 
of air power." 
</P>
<P>
 But Canada, another NATO member, said Monday that it is opposed to air 
strikes. So did Russia, which is a member of the U.N. Security Council but not 
of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. proposal does not call for immediate retaliation against the Serbs 
for Saturday's attack -- an idea officials considered but rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Security Council would formally demand that the Muslim-led 
Bosnian government and the Bosnian Serbs remove all "heavy weapons," including 
tanks and artillery, from Sarajevo and its surroundings, one official said. 
NATO would develop plans to remove or destroy any heavy weapons that remained 
past a deadline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to end the siege, and the main instrument of the siege has been 
the heavy weaponry," he said. "The main difficulty is figuring out how to 
remove the weapons in a way that is effective and remains effective." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan includes a proposal to provide U.N. forces in Sarajevo with advanced 
U.S. radar devices, which can pinpoint sources of artillery fire and direct air 
strikes or other fire against the guns. 
</P>
<P>
 If those devices are provided, they apparently would be manned by European 
troops, not by Americans. "We have not changed our policy of not putting U.S. 
troops on the ground," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate spur for the accelerated discussion of allied military action 
was Saturday's artillery attack against an outdoor market in Sarajevo that 
killed 68 civilians and injured 200. But officials said that the tragedy was 
merely another step in a long escalation of Serbian bombardments that have made 
a mockery of the Western powers' frequent warnings against attacks on Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, during a speech in Houston, decried the shelling of the marketplace 
as "an outrageous attack on innocent civilians." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our government is talking with our allies about what steps ought to be taken 
in response not only to this outrage but to the possibility of future attacks 
on innocent civilians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President urged the allies to be ready to enforce their warnings with 
action. "I don't think we should have any more empty threats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters that NATO will "decide on 
a course of action, on an overall strategy, within the next few days." And 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry, at the Pentagon, said the United States 
will give NATO "a concrete set of proposals." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry noted that military planners believe bombing raids are often ineffective 
against artillery but added, "We're trying to consider it in ways that minimize 
the problems and the limitations of air strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. intelligence experts told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the 
artillery shell that hit the marketplace Saturday appeared to have been fired 
from a Bosnian Serb battery, based on its type and trajectory. "I'm no expert, 
but from what they showed us it looks like Serbs" were to blame, Sen. Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.), the committee's chairman, said after an intelligence 
briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher and Hurd said that it is not necessary to pin down 
responsibility for the attack to move ahead with a plan to lift the siege. "I 
can't say with authority where this particular attack came from . . ," 
Christopher said, "but I am quite confident the pattern over the last several 
weeks has been a pattern of Serbian shelling (of) the Muslim areas of 
Sarajevo." 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's opposition could be a problem for NATO. Canada has 2,000 troops on 
the ground in Bosnia, and Canadian officials have said they fear that Serbian 
forces might retaliate against them if the allies mount air strikes. "An air 
strike is the very last resort," Canadian External Affairs Minister Andre 
Ouellet said in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 And Russia's position could make action difficult in the Security Council, 
where it is a permanent member. Russian Foreign Minister Andrei D. Kozyrev said 
that bombing Serbian positions is the "least acceptable option" for responding 
to the weekend attack and warned that air strikes "would lead to an escalation 
of the conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and its allies hope to meet those objections by stressing 
that the NATO plan would apply equally to Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Serbs and 
would give them a chance to remove their heavy weapons before any military 
action is ordered, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 They said that if air strikes are launched, they will not be as retaliation 
for Saturday's artillery attack or any other action but as a means of enforcing 
the heavy-weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. proposal also includes a pledge by the Clinton Administration to 
become more active in negotiations toward a peace agreement among Bosnia's 
Muslims, Serbs and Croats -- something the Europeans had been seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace talks sponsored by the United Nations and the European Union have come 
close to agreement on a three-way partition of Bosnia, but European nations 
said that without U.S. participation it is impossible to bring the talks to 
completion. The Administration had refused to join fully in the talks, partly 
because it did not want to appear to be pressuring the Bosnian Muslims toward 
accepting an unpalatable partition plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Richard Boudreaux in Moscow, Tyler Marshall in Brussels, 
Stanley Meisler at the United Nations, Paul Richter with Clinton in Houston and 
Shreveport, and Michael Ross and Robin Wright in Washington also contributed to 
this report.

STORM UNLEASHES MUD ON MALIBU, ALTADENA; WEATHER: BIGGEST DOWNPOUR OF WINTER 
INTENSIFIES TRAFFIC HEADACHES. MUCK POURS INTO HOMES, WINDS BATTER COAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intense downpours from the most powerful storm of the winter lashed the 
fire-denuded hillsides of Southern California on Monday, setting loose 
mudslides that surged through beachfront houses in Malibu and briefly trapped a 
dozen residents in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds gusted to 50 m.p.h. as the main force of the storm marched onshore, 
rocking outlying areas with thunderclaps. A waterspout was reported off Santa 
Barbara, and cyclonic winds touched down in Sun Valley and in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter traffic -- already crippled by earthquake detours -- slowed to a 
crawl in many areas as low-lying intersections flooded and vehicles skidded 
into one another on rain-slicked streets. Officials said several major mountain 
highways probably would be blocked with heavy snow by dawn today. 
</P>
<P>
 Cloudbursts drenched Caltrans crews laboring around the clock to repair 
quake-damaged freeways, soaked through temporary patches on roofs battered 
during the Jan. 17 temblor and made life a little more miserable for the 
earthquake refugees still huddled in temporary shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 The potent core of the storm began moving ashore about 2 p.m., and within an 
hour, hillsides that were stripped bare in last fall's devastating brush fires 
began to give way. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, water, mud and rocks coursed down the canyons to the sea, invading 
homes and blocking portions of Pacific Coast Highway between Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard and Malibu Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A delta of debris washed out of Big Rock Canyon Road and across Pacific Coast 
Highway, sloshing against about a dozen houses and scattering half a dozen cars 
and trucks like sandbox toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and emergency crews struggled through the muck, trying to plug 
makeshift dikes with sandbags. But despite their efforts, mud began seeping 
into shorefront homes and about 15 houses farther inland at Big Rock and in Las 
Flores Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 residents were forced to evacuate. A big Caltrans skip-loader was 
used to pluck several of them from their roofs, where they had taken refuge 
from the rising mud and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people who did not want to leave "had to be removed forcibly," said 
Capt. Scott Smith of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 One who left willingly was Greg Powers, whose beachfront house was invaded by 
tree trunks, shrubbery and almost four feet of mud and water. Powers said his 
Jeep was carried away by the torrent that hit his home about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I might move," he said. "I'm tired of this. First it was the fires, 
then the earthquake, now this." 
</P>
<P>
 As Powers surveyed the damage, he carried his two yowling cats around with him 
in a soggy cardboard pet carrier. "They're kind of upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monique Marti, who lives several houses away, said that more than 20 years 
ago, "the same thing happened." She said she probably would spend the night 
with friends in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you hate to go away from your home," she said. "Because you don't know 
what it will look like when you get back." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Sandler returned from work Monday night to find her house filled with 
four feet of mud. "The bedroom has been washed away into the ocean," she said. 
"It was like a river running through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The water spilled off her back porch like a waterfall, splattering down into 
storm-driven waves that swirled around the pilings supporting her home. 
Although some of the sand around the pilings was washing away, all the homes 
appeared to be standing fast Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Smith slogged her way to safety after her Mercedes-Benz was trapped in a 
mudflow near Big Rock Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I looked to make the next curve, there was this huge bank of mud coming 
toward me," she told a KABC-TV crew. "Unbelievable, unbelievable -- things you 
see in the movies. And it was happening to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Above Malibu, basketball-size rocks crashed down onto Old Topanga Canyon Road, 
and sheets of mud and gravel covered stretches of the pavement. The persistent 
rain was beginning to warp wooden signs thanking firefighters for their efforts 
during the hellish fires that burned through Topanga Canyon last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In Altadena, mud, rocks and debris from about 600 acres burned in last fall's 
fire slid onto Pasadena Glen Road during a cloudburst, isolating about 20 
hillside homes and damaging some of them. Most of the residents already had 
fled or were away at work, but about a dozen were cut off as the mudslides 
continued to threaten their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 After about an hour, county firefighters slogged through mud up to four feet 
deep to reach the stranded people and escort them to safety. There were no 
reports of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Altadena slide blocked another street, Old Grove Road, but the residents 
there were able to use alternate routes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, which bore the brunt of last month's earthquake, 
businesses big and small along Ventura Boulevard scrambled to cover damaged 
walls and roofs with huge sheets of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 One office at a three-story building in Sherman Oaks had been left completely 
open to the elements, and although workers covered the open area with plastic 
sheeting, water seeped down through cracks and damaged office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The supplies were left in "the one part of the suite that we thought would be 
safe," said Elsie Bowker, 50, owner of a Sherman Oaks property-management 
company that once occupied the damaged suite. "We didn't know that it was the 
room that the rain would come in." 
</P>
<P>
 At Century Bank in Encino, it was the timing of the rain that caught bank 
employees off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were somewhat prepared for the rain, but frankly I forgot about one 
damaged part of the roof, and the rain leaked in there," said Albert Sage, a 
Century vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,200 power customers in North Hollywood, Granada Hills and Sun Valley 
were left in the dark when the rains and wind knocked out five main circuits in 
the area. Service was largely restored by about 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclonic winds knocked down trees and electrical lines in Sunland, leaving 
traffic signals and a train crossing gate without power. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, similar winds touched down Monday night near an industrial 
section of Irvine and carved a swath to UC Irvine, blowing down trees and power 
lines, shattering windows and damaging a roof, police and fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach hillsides ravaged in the Oct. 27 fire were holding up pretty 
well, according to Bill Reiter, public works operations manager for the 
county's Environmental Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiter's office was coordinating the efforts of about 50 workers -- including 
24 prison inmates -- on hand to monitor the situation and help shore up 
hillsides in case of mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 8,000 businesses and households in Orange County experienced 
temporary power outages, Southern California Edison officials said. The bulk of 
the problems were in Seal Beach and Westminster, although there were scattered 
reports of service interruptions countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said the heavy rain 
should taper off well before dawn today, with a few showers -- and possibly 
some more thundershowers -- predicted until about noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be partial clearing by the afternoon as the storm system 
continues moving inland," he said. "After that, it looks like it should be 
pretty dry for the rest of the week." 
</P>
<P>
 By 5 p.m. Monday, 0.51 of an inch of rain had fallen at the Los Angeles Civic 
Center, raising the total for the season to 3.21 inches. The normal season 
total for Feb. 7 is 8.61 inches. By this time last year, the city had received 
18.83 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Other daily rainfall totals as of 5 p.m. Monday included 1.73 inches in Santa 
Barbara, 1.58 in Long Beach, 1.30 in Santa Ana, 1.01 at Los Angeles 
International Airport, 0.88 in Palm Springs, 0.71 in Newport Beach, 0.63 in 
Monrovia, 0.41 in San Diego and 0.08 in Bakersfield.

PROSECUTORS CITE FILM'S THEME IN THEATER SHOOTING; VIOLENCE: GUNMAN TOLD 
INVESTIGATORS HE OPENED FIRE DURING 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' CHASE SCENE 'TO TEST 
GOD.' DEFENSE CONTENDS WEAPON WENT OFF ACCIDENTALLY.

 Calling it a disturbing case of life imitating art, prosecutors said Monday 
that a man who shot a woman in the back during a showing of "Schindler's List" 
told investigators he pulled the trigger "to test God" and protect Jews from 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 James Michael Kirby, 45, critically wounded Ellen Campbell, 40, as she sat at 
the Horton Plaza theater in downtown San Diego on Jan. 6. He fired one round 
from a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the movie, Nazis were chasing Jews down the street," Campbell testified at 
Kirby's preliminary hearing, where he was bound over for trial. "And they were 
shooting them in the back. And at that time, I was shot in the back." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting left Campbell with a 14-inch scar, a partially collapsed lung and 
a terror at traveling in public alone, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby remains jailed on $300,000 bail, booked on felony assault with a 
semiautomatic weapon and carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when Congress is debating the effect of television and movie 
violence on real violence, prosecutors said Kirby's actions offer a graphic 
example that, at times, even the best of films offer a platform for violent 
imitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie definitely factored into it," Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Lamborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is being watched closely in Hollywood, where Marvin Levy, marketing 
director for director Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, said Monday that 
the Kirby shooting appears to be an isolated case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If ever a movie speaks against things like that, it's this film," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the shooting occurred at a point in the film when Nazi 
troopers were liquidating a Jewish ghetto in Krakow, Poland, and that Kirby's 
actions appeared to mimic the footage unfolding in front of him, which moments 
earlier depicted gunshots to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 They say that although Campbell was a victim of circumstance, the movie -- 
Spielberg's critically acclaimed epic about the Holocaust -- triggered a 
shooting that was clearly deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Vecchio, Kirby's attorney, argued Monday that the shooting was 
accidental. His client admits pulling the trigger, Vecchio said, but thought 
the safety mechanism was positioned to keep it from firing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not expect the gun to go off," Vecchio told the judge, adding that 
Kirby feels "profoundly guilty, embarrassed and upset" and that his actions 
were "horribly irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 He brought the gun only to protect him and his mother, Vecchio said, after 
hearing reports of recent gang violence at the Horton Plaza shopping center. 
She accompanied Kirby to the 11:30 a.m. matinee. 
</P>
<P>
 But police offered a different account of Kirby's explanation, saying that, 
shortly after fleeing the theater, he was arrested alone in nearby La Mesa, 
where he then made statements about wanting to test God and protect Jews in 
general from harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that he had changed his religion from Catholicism to Orthodox 
Judaism," said San Diego Police Detective Ronald Thill, who interviewed Kirby. 
"He said, 'I feel for these people so much. I know a lot of Jews, and they're 
all beautiful people. To see that happen (the slaughter of Jews on screen), I 
just took out my gun from my back pocket and began squeezing the trigger.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Morris Casuto, regional director of the San Diego chapter of the 
Anti-Defamation League, said Monday that, despite Kirby's claims of converting 
to Judaism, he had never heard of him, nor of his bizarre claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense called as its only witness a forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Mark 
Mills, who despite saying that Kirby appeared "compulsively honest" and 
remorseful for the shooting, called him a paranoid individual who was not 
clinically insane but "clearly an odd duck."

CLINTON'S SPENDING PLAN DOESN'T FILL WILSON'S BUDGET GAP; FINANCES: GOVERNOR

 Setting the stage for another government fiscal crisis in California, the 
Clinton Administration's $1.5-trillion budget released Monday targets virtually 
no federal funds to pay specifically for services to illegal immigrants.

 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson was counting on an unprecedented $2.3-billion 
federal bailout of immigration costs to balance his proposed 1995 state budget. 
Without federal assistance to cover education, emergency medical care and 
imprisonment costs associated with illegal immigration, Wilson said California 
will be forced to raise taxes or make even deeper budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little surprised and disappointed," said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos 
(D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. "Without getting 
that (federal) money, the state will have to declare bankruptcy. There doesn't 
seem to be much option except to do that. I don't have any idea how we put the 
budget together now." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials stressed that, although their budget 
blueprint contains no money to reimburse states for providing services to 
illegal immigrants, it does include nearly $3 billion to provide health care 
and education to indigent Californians, many of whom are illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials had no estimates late Monday of how much of that money might 
go for services to illegal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, California stands to benefit from several new spending proposals 
submitted by the Clinton Administration while suffering its share of pain from 
nearly $20 billion in Defense Department cuts, reductions in domestic outlays 
and the elimination of 115 long-established government programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton budget proposes spending $4.8 billion for defense conversion 
programs ranging from worker retraining to the development of civilian-use 
technology by defense contractors. About one-fourth of such money went to 
California last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Metro Rail project is slated to receive $184 million for the 
route extending from Hollywood to North Hollywood. But the Transportation 
Department budget also calls for more than $400 million in unspecified cuts in 
highway demonstration programs across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pilot program that would be funded for the first time by the federal 
government, the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation proposes $10 
million to devise ways to recycle water that is used, treated and normally 
dumped into Santa Monica Bay. Under the program, $5 million would be spent on a 
project in the San Gabriel basin and another $5 million on a project in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Immigration and Naturalization Service, criticized by state officials as 
woefully underfunded, is in line for $2.1 billion, a 22% increase over 1994. A 
two-year "border initiative" announced last week would reduce illegal 
immigration, deport illegal immigrants from state jails, step up enforcement of 
employer sanctions and make it easier for 8 million immigrants to become 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortage of funds for illegal immigrants during a tight fiscal era comes 
as little surprise. Wilson last month announced the heavy reliance on federal 
reimbursement without any assurances the state would receive the funds. Last 
year, Wilson asked for $1.4 billion from the federal government; Congress 
approved only $324 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Administration officials criticized the Clinton budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's deeply disappointing and simply unacceptable to the people of 
California," said H. D. Palmer, assistant director of Wilson's Department of 
Finance. "This budget would deprive California taxpayers of needed services 
because the federal government is forcing the state to shoulder the costs of 
these federally mandated programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials accused Wilson of trying to shift blame for 
the state's financial woes -- during an election year -- to the 
Democrat-controlled Congress and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like the governor is doing some political posturing on what's 
really in the budget," said Tom Epstein, White House liaison for California 
issues. "Gov. Wilson never even bothered to ask President Bush for this 
reimbursement. Here, he is getting a lot more than he ever got under the prior 
Administration, but he is still not satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials estimated that their budget contains $2.2 billion in 
Medicaid funds for indigent health care and $700 million for disadvantaged 
students that would pick up portions of the illegal immigrant tab in 
California. Budget Director Leon E. Panetta also promised last week to make 
reimbursement for the incarceration of illegal immigrants a top priority this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think by the end of this legislative session we will be able to make 
substantial progress in helping states with the cost of illegal immigrant 
prisoners," Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Jerry Gillam in Sacramento and James Bornemeier and 
Melissa Healy in Washington contributed to this story. What's Next for the 
Budget 
</P>
<P>
 The likely timetable: 
</P>
<P>
 * Spring: The House and Senate budget committees approve a budget resolution, 
a non-binding outline of the year's plans for spending and revenue collections. 
It does not require the President's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 * Summer, probably into fall: Congress will work on Clinton's health care 
package, which includes a higher tobacco tax and savings in Medicare and 
Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fall: Congress' appropriations committees will consider the 13 annual bills 
that actually govern agency spending. The goal, to finish before the Oct. 1 
start of the new fiscal year, is almost never met.

JACK KIRBY, CREATOR OF SUPER-HEROES FOR MARVEL COMICS, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Kirby, highly respected comic book artist who helped to create and 
humanize such super-heroes as Captain America, Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four 
and the Incredible Hulk, has died at age 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby died Sunday at his home in Thousand Oaks of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
 He was known for drawing the square jaw and rippling muscles that became the 
prototype for the comic book hero, and for the perspective that made fists seem 
to fly off the page in dramatic battles. Unlike many contemporaries, he gave 
his characters changing expressions and made them human and vulnerable despite 
their super-human abilities to thwart evil. 
</P>
<P>
 "He created not only artwork, but ideas," said Tom Christopher of Kirby's 
longtime publisher, Marvel Comics. "Another person of his particular talent and 
innovation is not going to come along again." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Eastman, a Kirby fan who helped create "Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles" 
and last year funded publication of a book about Kirby's work, has called Kirby 
the "comics artist's artist." 
</P>
<P>
 During his career, Kirby churned out 20,318 pages of published art, 1,385 
comic book covers, 600 characters and 2,600 stories, according to that book, 
"The Art of Jack Kirby" compiled by Ray Wyman Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comics constantly move," Kirby told The Times last year. "To me, a comic has 
to be like a good movie. There's no way of making it move like a movie, so I 
let the characters do it for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Jacob Kurtzberg on Manhattan's Lower East Side, the slightly built Kirby 
taught himself to draw and got his first job drawing animated Betty Boop 
cartoons. But he quit, hoping "to create rather than duplicate." 
</P>
<P>
 "We sat at rows of tables and got paid very little," he said of the Boop days. 
</P>
<P>
 He adopted the surname Kirby from a comic book character, Rip Kirby, and set 
himself up as a free-lance comic book writer and artist. His work helped move 
comics from short strips in newspapers into magazine-type books. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1940, working with partner Joe Simon, Kirby developed the heroic Captain 
America with "the strength of a thousand soldiers" for his publisher Atlas (the 
forerunner of Marvel Comics) to compete with DC Comics' new hero, Superman. 
Kirby's captain was soon selling 900,000 issues a month, rivaling Superman. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby, inspired by his short but scrappy matinee idols, Edward G. Robinson and 
James Cagney, created Captain America in his own image -- a small New York 
youth who got picked on by bigger guys. The comic book story described Steve 
Rogers, rejected by the Army because he was underweight, who volunteered for a 
top-secret government experiment in which he took a serum that magnified his 
strength and agility. A favorite villain was Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Captain America hit really big," Kirby told The Times in 1986. "It was then 
that my publisher knew that super-heroes were going to be a big commodity. . . 
. It was also when I really started to enjoy life." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Simon also succeeded with another wartime comic, Boy Commandos. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Kirby got drafted. As an infantryman, he fought the Germans and wound up 
in a Paris hospital with frozen feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiences prompted more war story comics before Kirby shifted to 
creating Westerns and romance comics. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, he offered Marvel a list of comic book character ideas that included 
Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, the Fantastic Four and the Avengers -- 
characters that led a resurgence in comic books in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The new characters were reminiscent of his Captain America -- Spider-Man, also 
known as Peter Parker, is a youth bitten by a spider who gains the 
proportionate strength of a spider; the Fantastic Four is the story of four 
young people who are bombarded by cosmic, radioactive particles on a trip to 
the moon and achieve superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby is survived by his wife, Rosalind; three daughters, Susan, Barbara and 
Lisa; son, Neal, and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are scheduled at 11 a.m. Wednesday at Pierce Brothers Griffin 
Mortuary in Thousand Oaks, with interment at Valley Oaks Memorial Park in 
Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Jack Kirby 
Educational Fund, Temple Etz Chaim, 1080 Janss Road, Thousand Oaks, Calif. 
91360.

 Vietnam turned over to the United States what are believed to be the remains 
of 12 more Americans missing from the Vietnam War, four days after President 
Clinton lifted the U.S. trade embargo against the Southeast Asian nation.An 
honor guard saluted the fallen men during a ceremony at Hanoi's Noi Bai 
International Airport as the remains were put aboard a transport plane. They 
were flown to Honolulu for further analysis and positive identification. The 
remains were either excavated by U.S. specialists or turned over by villagers 
in December and January during the biggest joint search effort since the end of 
the war.

 Guerrillas killed four Israeli soldiers and wounded five in an ambush that 
drew retaliatory air and artillery strikes.The Israeli military said its jets 
attacked "Hezbollah terrorist targets" and scored "accurate hits" after the 
ambush in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon. There was no immediate word on 
casualties among the guerrillas. The Israeli victims were the first Israelis 
killed in Lebanon in almost two months. Israel's military command said in a 
statement that five soldiers were wounded in the confrontation between its 
troops and "a terrorist force" and were evacuated by helicopter to Israel. 
Security sources in Lebanon had put the number of wounded at three.

HOPES FOR PEACE RISE AS ARAFAT, PERES BEGIN A NEW ROUND OF PRIVATE TALKS; 
MIDEAST: PLO LEADER DECLARES THAT AGREEMENT ON PALESTINIAN AUTONOMY IS NEAR. 
SECURITY ISSUES REMAIN UNRESOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to break through more than a week of bickering and recriminations that 
have stalled the Middle East peace process, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres began another round of private 
negotiations Monday night, and officials were optimistic they would make some 
headway on an agreement for Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, several days of charges and countercharges had raised questions 
about whether the two sides, deadlocked over a plan for Palestinian autonomy in 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip, even had anything to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came with the best of intentions, to write an agreement. We didn't come to 
bargain, to argue. We feel very responsible, and may I say that we have made 
progress and we intend to go ahead," Peres said after meeting with Arafat for 
more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat said he was optimistic that a full agreement can be reached during the 
current round of talks "or very soon after." 
</P>
<P>
 "The talks will resume between our two teams; they will continue their work. . 
. . We are on our way to reach an agreement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders, along with their delegations, were scheduled to continue 
informal discussions through the night and again today. They announced the 
appointment of two small working groups, each made up of three delegates from 
each side, to begin plowing through the remaining points of dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir Moussa said it appeared the two sides made 
progress on the deadlock that has delayed the scheduled withdrawal of Israeli 
troops from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be days away, but it could also be a little longer, because there 
are a lot of details to work out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, who had initially threatened not to come because of the slim prospects 
for an agreement, met first with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who had 
urged the Palestine Liberation Organization leader to at least try to make some 
headway toward breaking the deadlock, even if no final agreement is signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kamel, a senior PLO official in Cairo, predicted that the two sides will 
at least initial an agreement on several points, if not on the most difficult 
security issues that have raised grave doubts in Israel in recent weeks over 
proceeding with the Declaration of Principles signed with the Palestinians in 
Washington on Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the continuing conflict, senior Israeli and PLO officials 
said, are the same security issues that prevented Arafat and Peres from signing 
a highly detailed document during their last round of talks a week ago in 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no hint of compromise from Jerusalem on Monday afternoon. The 
decision that Peres would meet Arafat was not announced until the eleventh 
hour, and it came against a backdrop of sharp internal debate about the Israeli 
army's security concerns in the future Palestinian autonomous zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who predicted last week that no final 
agreement would be reached for several more weeks, has spent much of the past 
week closeted with his top military commanders. And Monday, Peres joined in the 
discussions, which reportedly addressed strong military concerns -- shared by 
Rabin -- about tentative security arrangements that Peres and Arafat agreed to 
set up at international border posts and on key highways leading to Jewish 
settlements in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 The military's role in the stalled process was so visible that it spawned 
criticism and debate within the Israeli Parliament and even in Rabin's Cabinet, 
where the prime minister and his chief of staff defended themselves against 
charges that their involvement in the peace talks blurred Israel's traditional 
division between political and military authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, criticism was even sharper from Palestinian leaders, who heaped 
blame for the delay squarely on Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Faisal Husseini, the appointed head of Arafat's Fatah wing in the West Bank 
and a member of the delegation traveling with Arafat to Cairo, suggested that 
Rabin is using the security concerns as "a pretext" to avoid withdrawal. 
Husseini charged that "Rabin's distrustful and rebellious nature" as a former 
military commander is blocking the more general agreement he endorsed on the 
White House lawn in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody believes that any of the steps taken to implement Gaza-Jericho could 
form a threat to the state of Israel," added another Palestinian source close 
to the talks. "This is absolutely inconceivable now." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin has insisted in several recent speeches that the issue of border 
crossings and settler roads is fundamental to Israel's security and that 
lengthy, additional negotiations are needed to guard against an influx of arms, 
refugees and "terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Palestinians, the border-control issue is equally fundamental. Arafat 
has insisted that Palestinian control of international borders is essential to 
autonomy, and he has stressed the symbolic importance of such details as 
whether Palestinian border police will be permitted to wear uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat also faced strong internal pressure during the week between sessions. 
He too waited until the last possible moment to decide whether to come to 
Cairo. His advisers said he was torn between his hopes for concluding a deal 
and the appeals of his advisers in Tunis, Tunisia, who insisted the trip would 
be a mistake if there was no promise of a final deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres gave no such indications Monday morning, saying only that Rabin had 
authorized him to reach "a general agreement" with Arafat if the PLO leader 
agreed to attend the scheduled meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Arafat and Peres last met, the two sides had been trading copies of 
various draft agreements by telephone and fax, hoping to pave the way for a 
meeting with Arafat and Rabin. But the attempt broke down when Israel failed to 
send a security delegation to Cairo early last week as promised. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli strategy had embittered some in the Palestinian delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Rabin and his army are responsible for the delay," said Nabil Shaath, the 
PLO's chief negotiator in Cairo. "They thought they alone should dictate the 
terms of the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath added that Rabin further angered the PLO with his widely publicized 
prediction last week that it could take up to a year to implement even the 
initial troop withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "First he said three months, then six months, and now we're hearing a year?" 
Shaath complained. "If he's talking about a year, then he should find other 
partners to deal with. We have other things to do during that year." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy reported from Cairo and Fineman from Jerusalem.

WHITE RADICALS ARRESTED IN S. AFRICA BOMBINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under pressure to stem a mounting terror campaign, police arrested five white 
members of far-right militant groups Monday in connection with a wave of at 
least 32 bombings in the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent attack, late Sunday night, destroyed a day-care center for 
black children in Warmbad, a right-wing stronghold north of Pretoria. A 
powerful bomb blew the roof off, destroyed windows and furniture and damaged 
surrounding buildings and homes, police said. The center was unoccupied at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous targets have included offices and homes of the black-led African 
National Congress, railway lines and electric pylons. Most are in rural areas 
or small farming towns in the Western Transvaal and Orange Free State, where 
armed white extremists have vowed to use violence to sabotage the nation's 
transition to democratic elections and black majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Cotze, spokesman for the Ministry of Law and Order, called the pre-dawn 
arrests of the five men in the archconservative towns of Orkney and Welkom "the 
first real breakthrough we've had" and promised more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned "We shouldn't be under any illusion this is going to end the 
terror campaign. It may disrupt it, but we'll see. We're running hot on the 
trail at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 During the arrest in Orkney, police said, one of the men fired a shotgun at 
police. An officer was hit in the chest but was wearing a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 Under South African law, the five may be held 48 hours before charges are 
filed. Cotze declined to release the suspects' names or those of their 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Niehaus, spokesman for the ANC, said the arrests were welcome but 
overdue. "After 32 bombings, it's taken long enough," he said. "There's never 
been much doubt who was responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Niehaus said the ANC was forced to send out special security teams to protect 
campaign sound trucks and other gear because of right-wing threats. 
</P>
<P>
 But Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel insisted that the ANC was unfairly 
blaming the police. "These arrests, and many others before them, explode the 
myth cultivated by Mr. (Nelson) Mandela and the African National Congress that 
the South African police is soft on right-wing terrorism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect right-wingers are using the bombs to try to intimidate the ANC 
and their supporters in the run-up to the April 26-28 elections. The far right 
hopes either to derail the elections or to win the right to create a self-ruled 
white homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also announced the arrests of seven people, including five suspected 
members of a black militant organization who allegedly fired 70 shots with 
assault rifles into a swimming pool filled with white children in Richards Bay, 
in Natal province.

 For the third time in 15 years, voters of island Venice and mainland Mestre 
have rejected a proposal that would have split the two cities into separate 
municipalities.A referendum calling for the divorce was defeated 56% to 44%, 
according to final returns. Center-right forces close to the corruption-scarred 
political parties that have dominated postwar Italy supported the separation, 
arguing that Venice needs a down-home government to deal with its singular 
municipal problems. Opponents of the call to divide the cities, yoked 
administratively in 1926, mostly came from the political left. They insisted 
that common problems such as lagoon pollution and tourism are better addressed 
jointly.

OUTLOOK BRIGHTER FOR EVERGLADES RECOVERY; CLINTON ASKING MILLIONS MORE TO SAVE

 When Everglades National Park ranger Alan Scott leads visitors down the 
Anhinga Trail, he points out the alligators cruising by, the long-legged wading 
birds stalking mosquito fish and the saw grass, razor-sharp from here to the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 But invariably Scott also stops alongside a depth gauge poking up out of the 
slough so that he can make a point about the lifeblood of the Everglades -- 
water. "There are only two seasons here, wet and dry," he recently told an 
attentive covey of tourists from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water goes up and down naturally with the rainfall, and for thousands of 
years that has determined the life cycles of the plants and animals. But a lot 
of what affects the flow of water now happens outside the park boundaries. And 
that has caused problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the national park lands in the United States, none is closer to a major 
urban area or more beset with problems than the Everglades, a shallow, 
50-mile-wide river of grass that flows south from Lake Okeechobee to Florida 
Bay. For more than a generation, this fragile natural wonder has been held 
hostage by a web of special interests -- farmers, sportsmen and about 6 million 
South Florida residents in need of drinking water and flood control -- that is 
as complex as the ecosystem itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The national park is 1.4 million acres, but that is just one-fifth of the 
wetlands ecosystem, and the destiny of lands inside and outside the park are 
linked. Pollution from agricultural runoff and a vast network of dikes and 
canals that has disrupted the natural flow of fresh water have pushed about 16 
species of plants and animals onto the endangered list and plunged the whole 
Everglades system into crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Everglades is a laboratory, and the whole world is watching how we do 
with the experiment going on here," says environmentalist Joe Podgor of Friends 
of the Everglades. "The issues include toxic ground water, biodiversity, 
preservation of wetlands, endangered species, coral reefs and others. And there 
is a great sense of urgency." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has promised to make saving the Everglades a priority. In 
the budget presented Monday, he recommended doubling, to $57 million, the 
amount the Interior Department will spend on science and restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Most scientists now agree on the plans for replumbing the Everglades to 
restore the natural sheet flow of water from the Kissimmee Valley, north of 
Lake Okeechobee, to Florida Bay. The Army Corps of Engineers has begun to free 
the Kissimmee River from the concrete channel to which it was confined 25 years 
ago, and an increase in water being pumped through the national park will 
eventually reduce the salinity of Florida Bay, an estuary where 100,000 acres 
of sea grass and millions of fish have died in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, one of the state's biggest sugar companies, Flo-Sun, last 
month agreed to pay $100 million over the next 20 years to help finance a 
cleanup estimated to cost $700 million. The company also agreed to refrain from 
further litigation blocking an earlier cleanup agreement between Big Sugar and 
the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials hope the Flo-Sun agreement will persuade U.S. Sugar 
and about 40 smaller growers to go along with the cleanup plan. The growers 
backed out of an earlier deal, saying it would take too much farmland out of 
production and cost up to 50,000 jobs. A trial on several farmers' lawsuits 
blocking a cleanup plan is set for April 25. 
</P>
<P>
 But many environmentalists argue that the Administration is being too soft on 
Big Sugar, the source of phosphorous-based fertilizers that have encouraged the 
spread of exotic plants in the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sugar has had everything it wants in the Everglades," says Jim Webb, a former 
assistant U.S. secretary of the interior who now heads the Wilderness Society's 
Everglades office. "The system has been operated so that the water tables suit 
agriculture, and they don't even have to pay for it. The money (to run the 
water management system) comes from property taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt climbed down from an airboat 
after a whirl through the Everglades, and in response to critics who accused 
him of caving in to Big Sugar, he sighed: "I'm a mere mortal. Maybe someone 
else can solve all the problems sooner . . . but nobody can expect to get 100% 
of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Out in the field, Scott says he sees evidence of the Everglades' plight every 
day. In the deep pools where alligators congregate, exotic fish such as talapia 
and oscars outnumber the native bass and gar. Wading bird populations are down 
as much as 90% from when the park was created in 1947. "It's frustrating," 
Scott says. "There have been a lot of studies, a lot of talk, a lot of money 
spent and very little seems to have changed. Yet the Everglades are getting a 
lot of attention from various agencies, and even the visitors are pretty well 
up on the problems here. That's encouraging. So we'll see."

SARAJEVO BURIES OVER 40 WHO DIED IN MARKETPLACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sarajevo buried its dead from a market massacre with stony silence Monday, 
laying to rest more than 40 friends and relatives killed in the Saturday 
shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Funerals were rushed for fear of sniper fire. Some took place under the gloomy 
cover of dawn. Even the few tears shed seemed to fall more in anger than in 
sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to say to America that if you saw this, then please open your 
eyes and open them well," Muhamed Srnja, 48 told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Srnja leaned on a homemade crutch, nursing a sniper wound to his leg. He had 
come to mourn his sister-in-law, killed with 67 others when she went to the 
market Saturday to trade cigarettes for flour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Srnja funeral and four others took place at the old Muslim cemetery on 
Visnjik Hill. The only sounds were of earth thudding onto coffins and artillery 
or machine-gun fire rattling from across the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim funerals traditionally are silent. But a similar quiet reigned at 
earlier burials for Serbs and Croats in a soccer-field-turned-graveyard in 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The silence doesn't mean we feel less emotion," Srnja said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I blame most those who should have removed the weapons from the hills around 
Sarajevo," he said. "Despite all resolutions, nothing has been done. Just 
words." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Sarajevans, he placed no faith in the decision Sunday by U.N. 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to request permission from the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization to authorize air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government insists that the shell that struck Sarajevo came from 
Bosnian Serb guns. Bosnian Serb commanders and leaders deny this. 
</P>
<P>
 And the toll from the Bosnian war mounted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Zenica, shells slammed into the government-held city northwest of Sarajevo, 
killing two women and a 14-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelling was a graphic illustration that Bosnia's troubles are not limited 
to the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirsad Mesic, chief of Zenica civil defense, charged that the mortar bombs 
were fired by Croatian forces in Busovaca, seven miles to the south, in a 
Croat-held pocket that is under heavy pressure from Bosnian government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Zenica has come under increased shelling by both Serbs and Croats recently.

PENTAGON WARY OF RISKY BOSNIA AIR RAIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and its NATO allies have virtually completed military 
planning for air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but the Pentagon remains leery 
of such a move because of the serious risks involved, U.S. officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry confirmed that air strikes are "among the 
options" being considered by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But he 
added, "We're trying to . . . minimize the problems and the limitations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon, acting on a request from the White House, drew up a full-fledged 
mission plan in August, defense analysts said. It included a list of aircraft 
and crews that would be needed and a wide choice of targets, depending on the 
military objective. 
</P>
<P>
 Those targets range from Serbian troops and artillery now surrounding the 
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo to Serb-controlled artillery bases, ammunition 
dumps, command centers and logistics depots. U.S. planners have coordinates for 
each and update them constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The allies already have hundreds of warplanes at the ready -- most of them 
equipped with nighttime radar -- on the aircraft carrier America and at air 
bases in Italy and Turkey. The Army also has air controllers at the ready to 
help locate Serbian artillery. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that the bombers could be ready to go "within an hour" of 
any decision by NATO leaders to proceed with the attacks. The NATO Advisory 
Committee, a high-level planning panel, is slated to meet in Brussels on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert W. Gaskin, a former Pentagon war planner, said that any air 
operation would entail an estimated two weeks of grueling, round-the-clock 
bombing with conventional weapons -- a far cry from the precision, 
down-the-chimney bombing seen during the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Gaskin and other military experts warned that air strikes would pose 
some serious risks, in terms of both the hazard to Bosnian civilians and the 
threat of drawing the allies into a protracted war. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the considerations: 
</P>
<P>
 * It can be difficult to determine which of the warring factions -- the Serbs, 
Croats or Muslims -- is manning a specific artillery post. The forces are in 
close proximity and, as Saturday's shelling of a crowded marketplace in 
Sarajevo showed, it can be difficult to tell who did the firing. 
</P>
<P>
 * The risk of killing civilians would probably be high. Many of the Serbian 
mortars are hidden in civilian homes in the Sarajevo suburbs. Attacking them 
would destroy the homes and probably harm civilians as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite the sophistication of the allied aircraft, weather and terrain would 
pose a major problem. The mountainous landscape and winter's heavy fog spell 
danger to pilots and make locating targets extremely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 * Attacking Serbian positions almost certainly would bring retaliation against 
U.N. peacekeeping troops. The United Nations now oversees 28,000 mostly 
British, French, Spanish and Canadian troops in Bosnia. U.S. pilots also would 
be vulnerable to shoulder-fired missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * The question of what the allies would do after the initial round of attacks 
ended remains unanswered. If the Serbs chose to continue their fight, the West 
could find itself locked in a protracted war with heavy casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Military experts said that the Pentagon might want to consider some steps 
before beginning air strikes. It could, for example, bring in artillery 
detectors that can pinpoint guns and mortars within seconds after they have 
been fired. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO planners also must improve their command-and-control capabilities in 
Bosnia. The allies need a fourth command center in the area to coordinate their 
attacks more effectively, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaskin, now a vice president of Business Executives for National Security, a 
Washington research group, said that NATO forces could "shut the place down" 
within two or three weeks but added: "What would we do after that? It's a 
question to ponder."

JAPAN'S PREMIER BOWS TO SOCIALISTS AND SCRAPS TAX HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE and DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa today bowed to Socialist demands to 
temporarily scrap a tax hike intended to pay for a $49-billion income tax cut 
to boost the sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The move averted a collapse of Hosokawa's 6-month-old coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa will now be able to meet President Clinton on Friday with a 
substantial tax cut proposal and an overall $140-billion economic stimulus 
package in hand. Washington had urged both measures to stimulate Japanese 
consumer spending and shave Japan's politically nettlesome trade surplus, 
estimated at about $55 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was not clear whether the measures will satisfy Washington, as 
unconfirmed reports indicated today that the tax cut may last only one year. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen earlier had said that a temporary tax cut 
would be unsatisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was the quickly encroaching U.S.-Japan summit that forced parties 
here to break their political deadlock and end the turmoil that had paralyzed 
this nation since Hosokawa made his surprise tax proposal last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, the prime minister abruptly announced at a 1 a.m. news 
conference that the tax cut would be financed by a new 7% "people's welfare" 
levy on goods and services. Outraged Socialists, the coalition's largest group, 
promptly threatened to quit the government, and the ensuing public outcry sent 
the popular Hosokawa's approval ratings plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S.-Japan summit can be characterized as the savior of the Hosokawa 
administration," said Minoru Morita, a political analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the typical family will get a tax cut of about $1,300, but 
whether Japanese consumers will spend it or save it amid the nation's grimmest 
recession in two decades is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though a certain portion of this tax cut will certainly be saved, I 
think it will have a beneficial effect on consumer demand," said Kunio 
Miyamoto, chief economist at Sumitomo Life Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that despite the political infighting, Hosokawa should be given 
credit for making difficult policy decisions -- from opening the rice market to 
political reform to the tax issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo stock exchange responded well to the tax agreement. In midafternoon 
trading, the Nikkei index was up by 306 points, or 1.5%, to 20,320. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this tips the balance to a recovery," said Geoffrey Barker, an 
analyst with Baring Securities Ltd. Barker predicted an economic growth rate of 
2% in the fiscal year beginning April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision marked an extremely rare triumph of politics in Japan, a nation 
controlled by unelected bureaucrats. In accepting Socialist demands to scrap 
the tax hike for at least a year, Hosokawa and his coalition partners defied 
mandarins of the Ministry of Finance -- commonly regarded as Japan's strongest 
political power. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance bureaucrats had adamantly opposed cutting taxes without securing a way 
to pay for the cut at the same time. The government also wants to reduce its 
dependence on income taxes in favor of consumption taxes to cushion its 
national treasury when the number of retirees begins to mount. Japan's society 
is aging faster than any other in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of Japanese in several recent polls seemed willing to accept a tax 
hike to pay for a tax cut and the aging society. But they hotly objected to the 
imperious way the program was suddenly pushed on them with virtually no debate 
or explanation.

SPIRITS DIP IN RUSSIA AS VODKA DISTILLERY SHUTS DOWN FOR 2 WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Squeezed by high taxes and cheap imports, Russia's biggest vodka distillery 
shut down for two weeks and sent 900 workers on unpaid vacation Monday, adding 
to the country's recession and choking one of its main sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Kristall distillery here said they hope that the temporary 
closure, the first in its 99-year history not caused by war, will persuade the 
government to cancel a liquor tax increase. They said the new tax is 
counterproductive, pricing Russian vodka out of its native market. 
</P>
<P>
 Reportedly invented by Russian monks in the 15th Century, vodka is Russia's 
leading source of drunkenness and a symbol of its chronic inefficiency and 
despair. With its production under state control since czarist times, vodka is 
also the source of about 10% of government income. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the stakes in this latest of Russian economic crises are especially 
high for Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, whose government is under 
pressure to provide subsidies to boost heavy industry out of a long recession 
while raising taxes to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The near-collapse of the vodka industry in recent weeks indicates how hard it 
will be for the government to do both. Industry sources predict a $640-million 
shortfall in anticipated vodka tax revenue, from Kristall and other crippled 
distilleries, for the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Dec. 27, the state took 85% of the vodka industry's profits in taxes, 
leaving the rest to distillers to maintain aging equipment. That day the tax 
rose to 90%, cutting the distillers' cut by a third and creating an 
industrywide crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost millions in profits during the New Year's holiday," Kristall's 
general director, Vladimir Yamnikov, complained in an interview with the 
newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda. "We were saving the government's good name, as we 
knew that a sharp increase of prices for alcohol at that time would have 
provoked a social explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-January, government support was not forthcoming, so Kristall and other 
distilleries raised prices by the 40% they said was necessary to offset lost 
profits. But that priced them out of the domestic market, so they cut 
production to fulfill export contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Kristall's popular brands, Stolichnaya, sells for 3,500 rubles for a 
half-liter bottle, or $2.20, up from 2,800 rubles before New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Moscow, which consumes 1 million bottles of vodka daily, Stolichnaya is 
hard to find. The liquor sections of kiosks are dominated by Finnish, German, 
Czech, Polish, Ukrainian and Belarussian vodka, which are cheaper than local 
brands despite Russian import duties of 150%. Some of the imported vodka is 
smuggled in to avoid the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course Russian vodka is the best," said a Moscow pedestrian who staggered 
out of the Tsvetnoi Boulevard subway station. "But if I want to get drunk, I'll 
drink anything, even after-shave." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian vodka brewed by unregistered distillers in their apartments is also 
turning up more often in stores, retailers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Distilleries in Tula, St. Petersburg, Kaluga and Irkutsk had shut down 
temporarily before Kristall did so Monday.

FDA ALLOWS LABELS FOR MILK FROM COWS NOT GIVEN HORMONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stores and dairies can label milk as coming from cows not treated with a 
controversial new hormone, but the labels can't suggest the milk is any safer 
than that from treated animals, the government said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In guidelines to be published today, the Food and Drug Administration said 
companies may label milk, ice cream and other dairy products as coming from 
"cows not treated with" recombinant bovine somatotropin. 
</P>
<P>
 But the label also would have to carry a statement like, "No significant 
difference has been shown between milk derived from rbST-treated and 
non-rbST-treated cows," the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 The genetically engineered version of the naturally occurring hormone went on 
the market Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said labels could not carry the claim that milk is "bST-free" 
because the hormone occurs naturally in milk.

QUICKER 'CLOT-BUSTERS' USE URGED IN HEART ATTACK CASES; HEALTH: EMPLOYING THE 
DRUGS WITHIN 30 MINUTES OF PATIENTS' ARRIVAL AT HOSPITAL WILL HELP TO SAVE 
LIVES, FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heart attack patients should be treated with so-called "clot-busting" drugs 
within 30 minutes after they arrive at emergency rooms, federal health 
officials recommended Monday in new guidelines designed to reduce death by 
heart attack, the leading killer of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Therapy using clot-busting -- or thrombolytic -- drugs works by dissolving 
blockages in the arteries and restoring coronary artery flow. Among the most 
popular are the expensive t-PA and streptokinase, a less costly alternative. A 
debate continues over which is most effective; the guidelines issued Monday 
endorsed no drug by name. 
</P>
<P>
 While not every patient is a candidate for the drugs, "too few patients are 
being treated (with them)," said Dr. Costas Lambrew, head of the cardiology 
division at Maine Medical Center in Portland and co-chairman of the National 
Heart Attack Alert Program, which issued the guidelines in a report. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, many heart attack patients who are treated with the drugs often 
do not receive them early enough to achieve the most benefit, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speeding up delivery of thrombolytic drugs was one recommendation in a report 
released by the Heart Attack Alert Program, a coalition of 39 national, 
scientific, professional, governmental and voluntary organizations. The program 
is administered by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, part of the 
federal government's National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was published in the February issue of the journal Annals of 
Emergency Medicine and represents the most comprehensive analysis to date of 
the major sources of delay in treating heart attack patients in hospital 
emergency rooms, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the estimated 1.25 million individuals who suffer heart attacks annually, 
nearly 500,000 will die. Of these deaths, more than half will occur outside a 
hospital, within an hour of the onset of symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 But even those victims who arrive at emergency rooms too often do not receive 
treatment quickly enough, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of thrombolytic therapy, for example, the drugs often are not 
administered for an average of 60 to 90 minutes after a patient arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, the report said, the treatment should begin for every eligible heart 
attack patient within one hour after the first symptoms occur -- or within 30 
minutes after arriving at an emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 With treatment time crucial to a patient's survival, "we challenge emergency 
departments across the country to identify barriers to prompt treatment of 
heart attack patients and to take steps to reduce those barriers," said Dr. 
Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The report identified numerous barriers to early treatment, including the 
patient's own reluctance to seek help and glitches in emergency room 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Mark Smith, chairman of the group and head of the department of emergency 
medicine at George Washington University Medical Center here, said emergency 
departments need to reduce the time between arrival and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "But shortening only that time interval won't be enough," he said. "We have to 
reduce all of the delays from the very first symptom to the time of definitive 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a patient arrives at an emergency room, he or she must undergo a series 
of steps before drug treatment begins. It is during this process that delays 
often result, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the causes are outdated emergency department procedures for identifying 
heart attack patients; a long lag-time between patient registration and triage 
-- evaluation of symptoms and setting of treatment priorities; slow access to 
an electrocardiogram machine; poor coordination between the emergency 
department and other hospital departments, such as the pharmacy, and turf 
disputes among medical staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommended that procedures be established to evaluate patients 
rapidly based on an explicit list of "chief complaints" that would require 
immediate assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the group said that electrocardiograms should be administered 
within five minutes after they are ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital staff responsible for treating heart attack patients should develop 
guidelines for initiating thrombolytic therapy, the group said. Moreover, 
emergency physicians "should have delegated authority to order such therapy 
without having to obtain prior consultation," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the report recommended that thrombolytic drugs be stored in the 
emergency department to avoid delays that occur when drugs must be transported 
from the pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The drugs are generally considered safe and studies have shown them to be very

 Not everyone can take them, however. They are not recommended for pregnant 
women, individuals with active internal bleeding, uncontrolled high blood 
pressure, a history of stroke and several other conditions.

$1-MILLION PRIZE IS OFFERED FOR WAYS TO TEST FOR 2 SEX DISEASES

<P>
 The Rockefeller Foundation Monday announced a $1-million prize -- one of the 
largest in medicine -- for development of an easy, low cost diagnostic test for 
two sexually transmitted diseases which strike more than 75 million people 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The diseases, chlamydia and gonorrhea, can be cured relatively easily with 
antibiotics if discovered, but can lead to serious complications, including 
infant blindness, if left untreated. Current methods of diagnosis are 
unsuitable because they require equipment unavailable in many areas of the 
world, and cost about $12 a patient, a prohibitive price in developing nations, 
the foundation said in announcing the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Entries for the prize will be accepted for five years or until a winner is 
named.

SEN. HUTCHISON PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO ETHICS CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) pleaded not guilty Monday to criminal 
ethics charges stemming from her former post as state treasurer, during a day 
of court proceedings interrupted by a bomb threat in an unrelated case. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge John F. Onion Jr. called a postponement 30 minutes after he began 
considering pretrial motions because a caller had claimed that a bomb was 
planted in the Tarrant County Criminal Justice Center, said Sheriff's Lt. G. M. 
Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat involved a trial of anti-abortion protesters, Hendrix said. All 
nine floors were evacuated and side streets were blocked while the building was 
searched. No bomb was found and the building reopened before noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchison maintains that the charges are a political attack by Democrats to 
ruin her reelection attempt this year. Prosecutors have denied any political 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Indictments allege Hutchison, 50, used state funds, state employees and state 
computers for her political campaign, and then altered records as part of a 
cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchison was state treasurer from January, 1991, to June, 1993. Last June, 
she won in a landslide special election for the remaining Senate term of Lloyd 
Bentsen, who was appointed President Clinton's Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Onion denied requests from Courtroom Television Network and the Ft. Worth 
Star-Telegram to allow cameras inside the courtroom. Both organizations said 
they would appeal.

DISCOVERY GIVES UP ON LAUNCH OF SATELLITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After three frustrating days, Discovery's crew gave up Monday on casting a 
satellite into space, one of the main purposes of the shuttle mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronaut Ronald Sega, who is in charge of the trouble-plagued satellite, had 
little to say when Mission Control informed him that flight directors were 
calling it quits.But the tone of his voice said it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we copy," Sega said quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sega and Discovery's five other crew members, including Russian cosmonaut 
Sergei Krikalev, had been trying since Saturday to deploy the Wake Shield 
Facility, a $13.5-million steel disk on which physicists hoped to manufacture 
pure semiconductor film. Researchers said high-quality samples, if obtained, 
could have led to more advanced electronics, including faster computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew encountered one problem after another: glare from the sun, radio 
interference and, finally, a failed guidance sensor. After hours of debate by 
flight controllers over whether to release the Wake Shield as is, time ran out. 
Monday afternoon was NASA's last chance; the shuttle mission is scheduled to 
end Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Controllers could not be certain the Wake Shield would remain steady in 
flight, given the bad horizon sensor. An unstable satellite would jeopardize 
whatever growth of gallium arsenide film could be achieved and possibly prevent 
the crew from retrieving the craft for the trip home. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Wake Shield shelved for this voyage, Discovery's crew turned to other 
experiments: U.S.-Russian medical and radiation tests, Earth observations, 
laboratory work and another satellite release. A German science satellite is to 
be deployed Wednesday; six metal balls also are to be ejected for tracking by 
space debris experts on the ground.

ELDERS BACKS BAN ON SMOKE IN U.S. PUBLIC BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and five of her predecessors added their 
endorsement Monday to a Clinton Administration-backed plan to protect Americans 
from the dangers of second-hand cigarette smoke by severely restricting smoking 
in most of the nation's public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation introduced by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) would prohibit 
smoking in non-residential buildings used regularly by more than 10 people 
unless separately ventilated rooms are provided for smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has been roundly denounced by the tobacco industry, which 
contends that it is based on studies that misrepresent the effects of 
second-hand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman's subcommittee on health and the environment -- part of the House 
Committee on Energy and Commerce -- conducted a hearing Monday on the bill, 
known as the Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, an Environmental Protection Agency study identified second-hand 
smoke as a deadly carcinogen and blamed it for 3,000 lung cancer deaths 
annually in adults and as many as 300,000 cases of bronchitis and pneumonia in 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA Administrator Carol Browner testified that the bill could save from 5,000 
to 9,000 lives of nonsmokers annually and save from $1.5 billion to $3 billion 
in medical costs and lost wages each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering of Elders and the former surgeons general -- Antonia Coello 
Novello, C. Everett Koop, Julius B. Richmond, S. Paul Ehrlich and Jesse L. 
Steinfeld -- marked the first time that they had met to support a single piece 
of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a question of the human or civil right to do what you want, when 
you want," said Elders. "This is a question of protecting our children from an 
out-and-out peril." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Koop, an ardent campaigner against smoking in the Administration of 
former President Ronald Reagan: "It is my judgment that the time for delay is 
past. . . . Measures to protect the public health are required now." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tobacco Institute consultant Charles O. Whitley said that testimony 
favoring a ban on smoking in public buildings is based on old reports and 
questionable EPA studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such massive federal intervention in the private lives and choices of 
one-quarter of our adult population recalls the extremism of Prohibition, the 
last national crusade against a supposed social evil," Whitley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced last November, the bill is in the early stages of subcommittee 
debate. Waxman expressed confidence that the bill eventually will pass, despite 
heavy lobbying by the tobacco industry.

PLAN IS CRITICIZED BUT EXPECTED TO SURVIVE; REACTION: DOLE OBJECTS TO ABSENCE 
OF HEALTH AND WELFARE REFORM COSTS. BUDGET PROPOSAL WINS DEMOCRATIC PRAISE FOR 
ITS RESTRAINT AND CUTBACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many congressional Democrats swallowed hard Monday as they contemplated parts 
of President Clinton's 1995 budget, while leading Republicans charged that the 
cost of his health care and welfare reform plans are "missing in action" from 
the $1.5-trillion blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reaction indicated, however, that the broad outline of the President's 
budget would survive as it winds its way through Congress, despite expected 
guerrilla warfare over some of the 115 programs he targeted for elimination and 
the 300 others marked for sharp cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The budget the President sent us is one of the most penny-pinching budgets 
we've had in years," said Sen. James Sasser (D-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee. Even so, Sasser predicted that Congress would live within the 
overall budgetary constraints to help pay for Clinton's priority programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be some mixing and matching under those (budget) caps but those caps 
are here to stay," observed Rep. Martin O. Sabo (D-Minn.), chairman of the 
House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the rhetorical blasts from Republicans did not suggest major changes in 
Clinton's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most budgets are quickly forgotten but this one will be remembered for what 
it doesn't contain -- most of the President's health care plans and cuts needed 
to finance comprehensive welfare reform," said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John R. Kasich (R-Ohio) said that Clinton lacks the courage to make major 
reductions in mandatory benefit programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, adding: 
"To say that a $176-billion deficit is a reason to pop the champagne corks 
shows we are almost anesthetized by deficits now." He was referring to the 
Administration's new estimate of next year's funding shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 While GOP lawmakers grudgingly credited Clinton for suggesting termination of 
federal programs and reductions in others, they deplored the fact that roughly 
half of the savings would be diverted to increased outlays for Clinton's new 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clinton budget is an intricate shell game in which money from one program 
is transferred to another," complained Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.). "The 
President should have used spending cuts to reduce the deficit, not to pay for 
more programs." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the budget knife is being wielded too deeply for some 
members of the President's party, who objected to proposed cuts in 
long-entrenched programs such as grants to help low-income residents pay home 
heating bills and modernization of public housing. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said that 
Mitchell is "disappointed" by the proposed cut of $1.2 billion in home heating 
payments and will do all he can to see that the program has sufficient funds. 
Before the budget was submitted, 51 senators from cold-weather states asked the 
President to spare the popular program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rival groups of lawmakers disputed whether Clinton cut too much, or not 
enough, from military spending, setting up future floor battles in both the 
House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland), chairman of the House Armed Services 
Committee, argued that the request for $252.8 billion in new funding 
authorization for the Pentagon is "an enormous commitment of scarce economic 
resources that may not be justified by our national security needs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Floyd D. Spence (R-S.C.), ranking Republican on the panel, contended 
that Clinton plans to cut $9 billion in outlays from current defense spending 
levels in a way that is "unacceptable." Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) said that 
Clinton is reducing military spending "too far and too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Capitol Hill observers said that they believe the President managed to 
preempt deeper new cuts in federal outlays, while making room for his own 
priorities in early childhood education, job retraining, crime prevention and 
technology development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has a middle ground he can probably sustain," said Thomas E. Mann, a 
specialist in Congress at the Brookings Institution. "It's painful, but it 
shows the seriousness of the effort. If Democrats want to do new things, 
they'll have to do less of the old ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last year, when the President's budget survived by a single vote in 
dramatic showdowns in both the House and Senate, the fights this year will be 
waged primarily in the lower-profile appropriations committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers know that if they reject one of the cuts proposed by Clinton, they 
will have to come up with another reduction to replace it because of the "hard 
freeze" Congress has enacted on defense, domestic and international spending. 
The spending cap is about $542 billion for the 1995 fiscal year starting Oct. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for some members of his own party, the President was not bold enough with 
his proposed budget. As Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) put it: "I would have 
preferred even deeper spending cuts in this budget. Elimination of the 
Selective Service system and the space station should be targeted as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the chorus, former Democratic Sen. Paul E. Tsongas and former GOP Sen. 
Warren B. Rudman, co-chairs of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan 
organization concerned about federal budget deficits, said that the Clinton 
budget is disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal should be a zero deficit within six years," Tsongas said. "With or 
without savings from health care reform, the Clinton budget never gets on the 
path to zero. . . . That's unacceptable."

 WEIGHT GAIN 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's 1995 budget is a much heftier tome than his 1994 fiscal 
document -- almost four pounds heavier and an inch-and-a-half thicker. That's 
because this year, his wish list is spread among five books instead of 
consolidated in one. Clinton's 1995 proposal costs contains 22 times as many 
charts and three times the number of tables.

 BIG THINKERS 
</P>
<P>
 Former budget director Richard Darman compared the federal deficit to Cookie 
Monster, the voracious Sesame Street muppet, in one of his Bush-era budgets. 
With Clinton and Budget Director Leon E. Panetta, we've graduated to Plato. 
"The first step, as you know, is always what matters most, particularly when we 
are dealing with those who are young and tender," the budget book says, quoting 
from "The Republic." Fast forward from the 4th century B.C. to the waning years 
of the 20th century A.D. "Several millennia later, numerous scientific studies 
confirm Plato's suppositions about the importance of investing in our 
children," says the budget book, seamlessly segueing into proposed increases in 
Head Start, immunization and nutrition programs.

BOWLING BALL IS DROPPED ON CAR, KILLS BABY 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bowling ball dropped from an overpass slammed through the front window of a 
car and fatally injured an 8-month-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby, riding in the back seat of the car with her 3-year-old brother, was 
struck in the face Sunday night and died in surgery at a Newark hospital 
Monday, said Ed DeFazio, the first assistant prosecutor in Hudson County. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity of the baby and her family wasn't immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying someone intended to kill someone, but the level of 
intelligence we're dealing with is amazing," DeFazio said. "It's really tragic. 
We're all very upset about this." 
</P>
<P>
 DeFazio said the bowling ball was dropped from an elevated portion of a 
highway near the Holland Tunnel.

GUNS-FOR-GOODS SWAP CALLED OFF IN CONNECTICUT; PROFITEERING CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials Monday called off a week-old guns-for-goods swap program that 
was overwhelmed by profiteers who bought cheap weapons and then traded them for 
gift certificates worth up to $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program has been suspended," said Atty. Gen. Richard Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Connecticut officials were shocked by the number of weapons turned in, 
and acknowledged that profiteering was a factor and that abuses were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, a man whose name was not released turned in 39 Chinese-made 
rifles worth about $70 each and received certificates worth $100 for each one 
-- realizing a profit of about $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun shop owners said they had seen a run on cheap pistols, so-called Saturday 
night specials, which retail for about $59. Buyers were apparently buying the 
guns just minutes before turning them over to police -- and realizing profits 
of about $40 for each gun. 
</P>
<P>
 In all more than 3,000 guns, including rifles, handguns and semiautomatic 
assault weapons, were surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 A network of business owners and schools pledged to honor gift certificates 
worth up to $500 for each gun that was surrendered. Police would give 
certificates worth at least $100 for every gun. Certificates worth $500 were 
given for assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Blumenthal said the program was a success despite the abuses, because it 
resulted in weapons being taken out of the hands of civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we accomplished in four days what we had hoped to accomplish in 
about four weeks," Blumenthal said. "We have run out of the resources and 
commitments for goods to pay for the surrendered weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the program could be reinstated if more resources were made available, 
but said there were no immediate plans to revive it.

CLINTON PLAN CONTAINS MONEY FOR THE VALLEY; FINANCES: BUDGET ALLOTS $5 MILLION 
FOR SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS LAND ACQUISITION AND $184 MILLION TO EXTEND METRO 
RAIL TO NORTH HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton's $1.52-trillion budget unveiled Monday contains $5 million 
for land acquisition in the Santa Monica Mountain Recreation Area and $184 
million for extension of the Metro Rail system to North Hollywood, according to 
congressional staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed parkland funds are particularly welcome because the 
Administration budgeted no money last year for the purchase of additional 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is very often broad differences between what the Administration 
recommends and what Congress appropriates (for land acquisition)," said Melissa 
Kuckro, legislative director for Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). 
"We do not put too much stock one way or the other at this point. While this is 
no indicator of the final outcome, this is very helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The subcommittees really go their own way on dividing the money among 
projects," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuckro and other congressional staffers said that a visit to the park by 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in June played an important role in getting 
the money earmarked. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt toured parts of the recreation area with Beilenson and Rep. Howard L. 
Berman (D-Panorama City) and seemed to take a personal interest in the park, 
Kuckro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows that the Administration really wants to keep building the park," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area is a relative newcomer to the 
federal system, having been authorized in 1978. Since that time land prices 
have been so high in California that Congress has often directed 10% to 20% of 
the national parkland acquisition budget to the purchase of more land in the 
Santa Monicas. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20,000 acres have been acquired so far for the park, and the federal 
government would like to purchase 16,000 more, Kuckro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional staffers spent the day poring over the weighty budget document, 
trying to gauge its net effects on the Valley. California stands to benefit 
from new programs proposed by the Clinton Administration but will suffer cuts 
in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most aides Monday found it impossible to render an accurate verdict until the 
various federal departments supply more detailed budget breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Metro Rail system is in line to receive $184 million to 
continue construction on a third leg -- which will include a segment from 
Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street to North Hollywood. The proposed allotment 
is $14.3 million more than last year's budgeted amount, staffers said. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Rep. Berman reported that $250,000 for the William O. Douglas 
Outdoor Classroom was included in Clinton's proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is very good news," said the aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature center in Topanga Canyon used to be private, but Berman was able to 
get legislation passed allowing the federal government to offer continuing 
assistance. Under the funding scheme devised by Berman, the center will 
eventually be donated to the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 No specific request was made to continue work at the Hansen Dam Recreation 
Area. But Berman aides were not surprised -- or alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army Corps of Engineers, which is working to complete a boating and 
swimming lake at the dam, rarely makes specific requests for recreation 
projects at this point in the budget process, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 An appropriation for additional work at the dam will be developed later in the 
session, staffers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley, awash in struggling defense and aerospace firms, also got some 
good news on the defense conversion front. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton budget sets aside $4.8 billion for conversion programs, ranging 
from worker retraining to the development of dual-use technology by Pentagon 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Technology Reinvestment Project is slated to receive $625 million, and the 
Advanced Technology Program is budgeted to get $450 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs help provide financial, research and marketing assistance for 
technically advanced high-risk enterprises, many of which are in the process of 
adjusting to post-Cold War markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman aides were also optimistic over Calstart -- the Burbank-based 
consortium of private companies, utilities and government agencies working on 
advanced transportation technologies. A 14% increase in the research and 
development budget of the Commerce Department bodes well for Calstart, the 
staffers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has also proposed $2.1 billion for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, a 22% increase over 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 As the state has struggled with a lingering recession, the problems of illegal 
immigration have been magnified. 
</P>
<P>
 Many politicians have toughened their rhetoric on the issue and have called on 
the federal government to give the Border Patrol -- part of the INS -- adequate 
funds for more agents and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has already budgeted an unprecedented $2.3-billion in federal 
funds in his proposed 1995 state budget to bail the state out of soaring costs 
of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Without substantial federal assistance to cover the cost of providing 
education and emergency medical care to undocumented residents and imprisoning 
illegal immigrants, California lawmakers will be forced to raise taxes or make 
even deeper budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials stressed that, while their budget blueprint 
contains no money to reimburse states for delivering services to illegal 
immigrants, it does include about $3 billion to provide health care and 
education to indigent people in California, a vast majority of whom are 
undocumented residents.

STORM, COURT DELAY MEDFLY SPRAYING FURTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court decided Monday it needs more time to determine if aerial 
spraying of the insecticide malathion can begin over Corona and Norco, giving 
opponents of aerial application a temporary victory. 
</P>
<P>
 State agriculture officials had hoped to begin the first round of aerial 
spraying Monday night to eradicate the Medfly in an 18-square-mile area before 
it spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 But those plans were scuttled Monday -- first by heavy rains that would make 
the aerial spraying ineffective, and later by a three-judge panel of the U.S. 
4th District Court of Appeals in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court said it did not have time to rule directly on Corona's 
arguments before the scheduled start of spraying. Instead, it prohibited the 
spraying until it had time "to review the voluminous records" in the appeal, a 
court clerk said.

STATE'S POPULATION INCREASES ONLY 1.4%; DEMOGRAPHICS: YEAR-TO-YEAR GROWTH RATE 
IS LOWEST SINCE EARLY 1970S. THE SLIGHT GAIN TO 31.7 MILLION IS ATTRIBUTED TO 
THE EFFECTS OF THE RECESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Reflecting the stubborn recession, California's population totaled 31.7 
million last July, posting only a 1.4% increase from a year earlier, the 
smallest gain in two decades, state demographers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 That trend was reflected in Orange County, where a 1.7% increase was the 
smallest since state demographers began doing annual population surveys in 
1960. In 1991-92, the county grew by 2.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 California's addition of only 442,000 people adhered to a pattern of declining 
growth rates that started with the recession in 1990, demographers said. It was 
the lowest growth rate since the economically troubled early 1970s and the 
smallest numerical change since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report of changes from mid-1992 to mid-1993, demographers of the 
Department of Finance also said that of the growth that did occur, 319,000 
people, or about three-quarters of the total, were immigrants from other 
countries, a 5% increase over 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, 252,000 people left the state, the second consecutive year that more 
people moved away than arrived from other states. However, there was still a 
total gain in people moving to California of 67,000, as a result of arriving 
foreigners. The rest of the increase was accounted for by births outstripping 
deaths, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department said it earlier had anticipated an upsurge in population 
growth, but only slight growth occurred "due to the severity and duration of 
the economic recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's population rose from 2,533,200 in mid-1992 to 2,576,000 in 
1993, an increase of 42,800. There were 51,132 births and 14,600 deaths, 
demographers estimated, and 6,268 people migrated into the county from 
elsewhere. In 1991-92, the county's population swelled by 57,400. 
</P>
<P>
 The population figures, which vary from U.S. Census estimates because 
different measuring methods are employed, are used by government policy-makers 
and businesses for making budget and financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing a trend, the Gold Rush country of Northern California remained the 
fastest-growing region at 2.7%, followed by the San Joaquin Valley at 2.6% and 
Southern California at 1.2%. The overall statewide rate was 1.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Rural counties grew at the fastest rate, starting with tiny San Benito in 
Central California at 4.9%, Mono at 4.8% and Imperial at 4.5%.

MARINE SHOOTS SELF AFTER KIDNAPING, 2 KILLINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Marine who kidnaped his estranged wife, and killed two people who tried to 
intervene, shot himself in the head Monday after freeing his wife, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bloody 18-hour string of events ended at noon, when Lance Cpl. Timothy 
Clemons, 22, of Chicago put a gun to his head after being confronted by 
military police at his old barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Debra Hearn, who two weeks ago was granted a temporary restraining 
order against Clemons, apparently persuaded him to release her after he 
abducted her Sunday night and drove to Mexico, said Carlsbad Police Lt. Michael 
Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
 The two returned by bus to Carlsbad on Monday morning. Hearn called her 
parents while Clemons went to the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemons' condition was not immediately released. He is expected to be 
transferred from a hospital at Camp Pendleton to the Naval Hospital in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday evening, Clemons shot to death two of Hearn's friends outside the 
Carlsbad shopping mall where she worked, Shipley said. 
</P>
<P>
 As horrified bystanders looked on, Clemons confronted Hearn as she left work 
about 6:30 p.m. When the two friends waiting to drive her home tried to 
intervene, Clemons shot both, Shipley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manique Mejia, 18, Hearn's roommate, died in surgery at Palomar Medical 
Center. A 21-year-old man, whose name was not released Monday, was pronounced 
dead at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemons grabbed his wife and took off in his car, Shipley said. On Monday 
morning, after driving to Tijuana and threatening his wife, he agreed to take a 
bus back to Carlsbad, a San Diego suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving Hearn at the bus station, Clemons returned to the barracks where 
he had lived before marrying, authorities said. Someone at the barracks called 
police. When an MP approached with a gun and ordered Clemons to surrender, 
Clemons shot himself, a spokesman said.

MAN SOUGHT IN ATTACKS KILLING 2, WOUNDING 1

<P>
 An Upland man was at large late Monday night after killing a woman and a 
business partner in San Bernardino County and critically wounding another 
partner in a Santa Ana parking structure, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana shooting occurred just before noon in the 1500 block of North 
Tustin Avenue.Police said John S. Hanna, 56, shot Greg Lawyer, 51, twice in the 
upper body. Lawyer was taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, where he 
was reported in critical but stable condition Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred outside Lawyer's office at North Canadian Marketing, a 
subsidiary of the Calgary-based North Canadian Resources, which builds 
electrical power stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer and Hanna had been partners in another venture called North American 
Cogeneration. The corporation was suspended in 1991 on the recommendation of 
the state Franchise Tax Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Hanna came to North Canadian's suite and asked for 
Lawyer. The men walked to a parking structure, where the sound of loud voices 
was followed by several shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer gave police the names of several other partners in the venture who 
might be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Upland went to Hanna's home, where a woman's body was discovered. 
She had been shot. Police would not say whether the victim was Hanna's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Police tried unsuccessfully to reach another partner, Herbert Roy Ratch, 54. 
Ratch's wife told police she had dropped him off Monday morning for a meeting 
with Hanna in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino County sheriff's investigators in Chino Hills found Ratch's 
body just after noon in a grain storage lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Another business associate, Bernard F. Kolanowski, told authorities that he 
had heard a shot outside his Carlsbad home about 2 p.m. He said he saw Hanna 
walk past his window. He called police and hid, authorities said.

INVESTORS FILL BANKRUPTCY HEARING OF FRAUD SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A hundred and fifty investors and their lawyers filled to overflowing a 
hearing Monday on the bankruptcy of Kenneth E. Sarvak and Lincoln Mortgage & 
Loan Co. of Newport Beach, accused by the state Department of Corporations of 
defrauding hundreds of elderly investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Through second trust deeds, Sarvak loaned millions of their dollars to 
homeowners hard up for cash.Many of the investors say Sarvak promised them that 
their investments were secure. Many of them say now that, if they can't get 
their money back, they are ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarvak says he didn't defraud anyone; he merely fell victim to bad investments 
of his own and the real estate recession in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearings like Monday's session, held in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, 
allow creditors to question under oath people or companies that file for 
bankruptcy. Several dozen investors or their lawyers questioned Sarvak, 68, in 
sometimes tense and angry interchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers grilled Sarvak, too, about whether he diverted investors' money to 
his children or their business; and whether he had lied when he allegedly 
promised investors that their money was recorded in county records and secured 
by trust deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the hearing were three lawyers for the Department of Corporations, one 
of whom questioned Sarvak. The state agency goes to bankruptcy court Thursday 
to ask that control of another Sarvak company, Washington Trust Deed Corp., be 
returned to a receiver picked by the Corporations Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarvak put that company, too, into bankruptcy.

BRIEFCASE: HEALTH CARE; FHP ADDS CHILD CARE TO LIST OF BENEFITS FOR 
HEADQUARTERS WORKERS 
</P>

 FHP executive Ria Carlson has found a new baby-sitter for her 2-year-old 
daughter, Alexandra: her employer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the health maintenance organization added its newest employee 
benefit -- a company-subsidized child care center where FHP workers can leave 
their preschool kids while they head off to their jobs at the firm's Fountain 
Valley headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 So far so good, said Carlson, FHP's director of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really ideal," said Carlson, who gave up her expensive live-in nanny 
in favor of the services of the newly established FHP Child Care Center, 
located in the old Fountain Valley library next to the city's police station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess that makes it pretty safe," she quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 With women making up more than 60% of FHP management, the FHP Child Care 
Center was considered a necessity, Carlson said. It became reality after more 
than a year of study renovating the former city library at a cost of $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Child care operator Bured & Assoc., which operates child care centers for 
Pacific Gas & Electric and Disneyland, was hired to run FHP's center. 
</P>
<P>
 On its first day of operation, more than 50 children were enrolled, at costs 
ranging from $120 a week for infants to $90 a week for 3- to- 5-year-olds, 
Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, Carlson said, the center's social and educational 
environment contributes to improved child development through the use of 
educational games and interaction with other children, which often is 
unavailable at home under a nanny's tutelage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see my daughter blossoming in just one day," Carlson said, quickly 
adding: "Of course, she's the smartest kid in the class."

HOUSING JOBS EXPECTED TO AID ECONOMY; RECESSION: ECONOMIST SAYS THAT BY NEXT 
YEAR, EMPLOYERS WILL ADD 15,000 FULL- AND PART-TIME POSITIONS TO COUNTY 
PAYROLLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The long-suffering residential development industry will lead Orange County 
out of recession late this year as increased demand for housing spurs building 
activity and new jobs, according to a major regional consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth won't show up in 1994 figures, said Walter Hahn, a Newport Beach 
economist who is director of real estate consulting for Kenneth Leventhal & 
Co.'s Orange County operations. But by next year employers, led by 
building-related businesses, will add 15,000 full- and part-time jobs to their 
payrolls, Hahn predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 His annual forecast, which he compiles for local development industry clients 
like William Lyon Co. and the Irvine Co., generally agrees with earlier 1994 
prognostications by economists at Cal State Fullerton and Chapman University. 
But Hahn is more enthusiastic about job growth than Chapman's Center for 
Economic Research, which said in December that it expects Orange County 
employers to add 85,300 jobs to their payrolls by the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said he thinks the economic recovery here will be even more robust and 
suggested that local employment could grow by 130,000 jobs during the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn sees the county's job situation remaining static this year -- which he 
interprets as good news because it follows several years of substantial losses. 
Orange County employers slashed 70,400 jobs from their payrolls between June, 
1990, the month before the recession officially began, and the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn calls 1994 a "turning point" for Orange County, a year in which the 
groundwork will be laid for employment and other economic gains through the 
rest of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other regional economists, he doesn't expect the county's economy to be 
upset by the earthquake that rocked Ventura and Los Angeles counties last 
month, though he does expect it to add to Los Angeles County's economic woes 
and to help keep L.A.'s economy in recession through much of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Orange County, he said, home sales have been picking up in recent 
months, the gains generated by relatively low prices, low interest rates and 
pent-up buyer demand after nearly four years of poor sales activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Because home construction is one of the most powerful drivers of the county's 
economy -- creating not only construction jobs but employment and spending in 
other segments of the economy such as engineering services, building materials, 
even carpet, drapery and home furnishing retailers -- Hahn said he expects his 
predicted 15% building increase "to be a major force in improving the county's 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the 1994 level of 7,000 new homes and apartments, Hahn predicts that 
housing demand will support construction in the range of 15,000 to 18,000 new 
units a year from 1996 through 1998 -- when, he said, a new national recession 
will start damping down the economy.

IRVINE'S CMS CUTS STAFF, SHUTS BRANCH; COMPUTERS: ITS ANYBUS COMPONENTS 
SUBSIDIARY IS BEING CLOSED AND THE FIRM'S NEW NAME IS AMERIQUEST TECHNOLOGIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a bid to become a national distributor of computer products, CMS 
Enhancements Inc. said Monday it has closed a division, has laid off 25% of its 
staff, and will change its name. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is shutting down its Anybus personal-computer components 
subsidiary and taking a charge against earnings of $4.8 million to $5.2 million 
for its second fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, said Stephen Holmes, chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybus is not consistent with the strategy," Holmes said. "It was a venture 
outside of our core capability." 
</P>
<P>
 The charge, which covers costs related to inventory, engineering and personnel 
cuts, will result in a net loss of about $5 million, or $1 to $1.10 a share, on 
quarterly sales of $20 million to $21 million, Holmes said. For the same period 
a year earlier, the company reported earnings of $100,000, or 1 cent a share, 
on sales of $18.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25% of the parent company's 180 employees have been dismissed, Holmes 
said, most of them from the headquarters in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 CMS' new management team, which replaced its co-founders two months ago, will 
change the company's name to AmeriQuest Technologies Inc. to emphasize plans to 
grow into a national distributor. In contrast to general-purpose PC 
distributors like Ingram Micro Inc. in Santa Ana, the new company will focus on 
high-end computer products. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold L. Clark became chief executive after a private group bought a 
controlling interest in the company in December. Jamshed (Jim) Farooquee, 
co-founder and chief executive, and Jimmy D'Jen, co-founder and executive vice 
president, gave up their titles when Clark came aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Clark, the company has acquired two regional computer distributors as 
part of an ambitious proposal to create a concern with annual revenue of $500 
million by 1996 -- nearly seven times its revenue for fiscal 1993. Additional 
acquisitions are planned, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a distributor, the company will spend more time shipping products made by 
other companies than developing its own. However, Holmes said, the company will 
continue to develop enhancements for computer components such as improved mass 
storage systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidiary developed a technology that was designed to maximize the flow 
of data through any personal computer, regardless of the future technical 
advances by industry component makers. The company had planned to license it to 
other computer manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Rusert, president of the Anybus unit, in 1992 touted the technology as an 
opportunity for CMS to recover from a disastrous attempt at manufacturing 
complete PC systems in a joint venture with a South Korean company. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holmes said Monday that the subsidiary was losing $100,000 a month and 
generated little of CMS' $73 million in revenue last year.

FORMER TOP EXECUTIVE HITS BALDWIN BUILDERS WITH LAWSUIT; LITIGATION: 
EX-DIVISION PRESIDENT IS SEEKING AT LEAST $35 MILLION IN HIS FRAUD AND BREACH 
OF CONTRACT ACTION AGAINST THE NEWPORT FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what promises to become an acrimonious and embarrassing lawsuit, a former 
top executive of Baldwin Builders is seeking at least $35 million in a breach 
of contract and fraud claim against the company and owners James and Alfred 
Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert B. Burns, a corporate vice president and head of Baldwin's Los 
Angeles-Ventura division since it was formed late in 1988, maintains in the 
suit that the Baldwin brothers repeatedly made verbal assurances that he was a 
10% partner in all company projects within his division but unilaterally voided 
the agreements in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns was one of three division presidents and all three have left the company 
in the last 45 days: Burns and Orange County Division President Geoff Fearns 
resigned and San Diego County division president Greg Smith was terminated, 
according to the suit, which was filed Jan. 25 in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns could not be reached for comment but an associate who asked not to be 
identified said the executive has vowed to "conduct a scorched earth campaign" 
against the Baldwins. 
</P>
<P>
 In support of that assertion, Burns alleges in the suit that the Baldwins 
attempted to engage Fearns and Smith in a scheme to avoid federal income tax 
payments in 1993 and intentionally failed to disclose Burns' partnership 
agreement to investors in a successful $155-million bond issue that the company 
sold last year. Fearns' partnership agreement and at least one of Smith's 
partnership pacts were disclosed, however. 
</P>
<P>
 If Burns' claims are upheld, Baldwin's failure to disclose that Burns had a 
claim to 10% of the profits from projects in his division could be grounds for 
suits against the company by bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearns, now an executive with Lowe Enterprises, a Los Angeles pension fund 
management company, declined to offer specifics about his decision to leave 
Baldwin but said Burns' suit "speaks very well for itself." The suit says that 
James Baldwin told Burns in November that he and his brother had begun 
"papering Geoff Fearns' file" with reprimands and complaints in order to 
establish grounds to fire him for cause and void his partnership interests. 
Fearns resigned before he could be fired, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith could not be reached for comment and officials at Baldwin did not 
respond to a request for comment on Burns' allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Burns does not offer a reason for the company's alleged actions, 
Baldwin revealed its substantial financial problems -- including defaults on 
more than $100 million in debt -- in conjunction with its July bond offering. 
The company is privately held and doesn't file regular financial statements, 
but reportedly used almost all of the money raised in the bond offering to 
repay bank debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In his suit, Burns claims that the Baldwins recruited him from his position 
with a Boise, Idaho, law firm in 1988 by promising, among other things, to make 
him a 10% partner in the projects under his control. Similar partnership 
agreements, the suit says, already had been extended to Fearns and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Baldwins repeatedly put off executing a formal, written 
partnership agreement, however, and in January told him that a 10% partnership 
and profit participation "was excessive compared to industry standards." 
Instead, the suit says, Burns was offered a 4% "discretionary" bonus and was 
told that instead of being a partner he was considered an employee who could be 
terminated at any time with no claim on the profits from projects in his 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of his 10% profit participation in the seven large housing projects 
in Baldwin's Los Angeles-Ventura division, Burns alleges in his suit, is at 
least $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 John Olson, a Newport Beach attorney representing Burns, said he and 
co-counsel Gary Waldron, also of Newport Beach, intend to seek double damages 
under a section of California's labor code that provides for doubling a claim 
if it can be shown that an employer used false promises to cause someone to 
quit a previous job and to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said neither he nor Burns has talked to the Internal Revenue Service 
about the alleged attempt to avoid taxes that is detailed in the suit. "We 
haven't done that, but we are anxious to use discovery to find out more about 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, Burns claims that the Baldwin brothers had asked Fearns and Smith 
to participate "in a sham tax transaction" that involved the Baldwins 
transferring to the two certain properties that had been used to secure large 
loans. In exchange, Fearns and Smith were to sign over their partnership 
interests in the company projects within their divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Burns' suit maintains, the Baldwins and their companies "would be 
able to avoid (reporting) substantial taxable income" but would later regain 
ownership of the properties by foreclosing on the loans they secured. Fearns 
and Smith, the suit continues, would have been "allowed to continue secretly to 
retain their partnership interests in the projects within their divisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns claimed in the suit that such an alleged effort to cheat the IRS is an 
example of actions that made Burns decide that his bosses "were untrustworthy, 
dishonest and would be willing to break any promise to employees for their own 
immediate gain."

 Cardiovascular Dynamics Inc. may not be able to sell its innovative new 
product in the United States at this time, but it now has assurances that no 
one else will either. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine medical device developer said that it just received a patent on a 
new twist to a widely accepted cardiac treatment called balloon 
angioplasty.Balloon angioplasty is a procedure in which a surgeon slips a thin 
catheter into the coronary artery of a heart patient whose suffers from clogged 
arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgeon then inflates a small balloon, opening up the artery by pushing 
out the clogging plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiovascular Dynamics is working on FDA approval of an angioplasty balloon 
that not only inflates but is porous enough to allow clot-dissolving drugs to 
pass through its thin skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company's balloon catheter is currently selling in Europe, it is 
at least two years away from being approved for sale in the United States, said 
spokesman Michael Crocker. 
</P>
<P>
 The patent, however, will protect the company's investment until it is ready 
for sale.

FEWER BUSINESSES LURED BY PITCH TO LEAVE STATE; RELOCATION: RECRUITERS FROM 
DOZENS OF STATES AT THIS YEAR'S TRADE SHOW FIND FAR FEWER COMPANIES WANTING TO 
BE WOOED. 
</P>

<P>
 Recruiters from dozens of other states, hoping to lure businesses away from 
California, were met with sparse attendance at a relocation trade show Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with last year's show, "there aren't any people here," said Gary 
Cook, a real estate broker from Carson City, Nev. Behind him, in his company's 
booth, a sign read, "Tired of California?" 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes and brush fires notwithstanding, people attending the Trends 2000 
show at the Anaheim Marriott, which ends today, said they believe fewer 
companies are anxious to move out of Southern California, compared with last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while, it was, 'I'm getting out of California, I'm tired of it' " said 
Ronald R. Kitchens, director of economic development for the city of Warsaw, 
Mo. "Now, it's much more an expansion mentality, versus relocation." 
</P>
<P>
 Preregistered attendance was 215 companies and 300 individuals, about the same 
number as last year, said Dennis Carruth, a Carlsbad businessman who has 
produced the trade show independently since July, 1992. But few of the 
registered participants were apparent on the trade show floor as of 
mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the rain, we're doing OK," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Governor Wilson's office was not content to let interest in relocation wane on 
its own. A handful of protesters from Team California -- a coalition of public 
and private interests organized under the Department of Trade and Commerce -- 
picketed the show briefly in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The picketers called themselves a "briefcase brigade" and pointed out positive 
changes in the state's business climate: reduction of red tape on the state 
level, so-called "red teams" organized to help persuade a company to stay and 
recent legislation to lower worker's compensation premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, California is being much more proactive," said Scott S. Nelson, a 
marketing coordinator for the state trade and commerce agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California has scored some successes in the last year in persuading 
businesses to stay put. A large division of TRW Inc. decided to remain in 
Orange; Loral Aeronautic will move from Newport Beach to Rancho Santa 
Margarita; Lockheed Corp. has decided to stay in Calabasas and a red team is 
working to keep Taco Bell in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California has lost 552,700 jobs to recession and business departures 
since mid-1990. A recent study by UC Irvine surveyed businesses about their top 
woes. Scoring highest were transportation problems, lack of affordable housing, 
land and building costs, cumbersome environmental regulations and difficulty in 
finding skilled labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking up on those themes, economic development agents from Kentucky to 
Arizona to Oregon advertised their states' tax incentives, low land costs, 
English-speaking labor and uncongested highway systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending the conference for the first time were representatives of Baja 
California and its cities. They said that the North American Free Trade 
Agreement makes Mexico a springboard for learning to trade with other countries 
in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been living with free trade with obstacles for years," said Enrique 
Mier y Teran, president of the economic development council in Tijuana. "The 
restrictions are already less. (NAFTA) is happening, it's on." 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitors came also from other California counties for a bit of intrastate 
raiding. They said they offer freedom from graffiti, crime and other phenomena 
endemic to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Lassen County had an earthquake, that would really be unusual," said 
Sonjia Edwards, a loan officer with the Northern California county's department 
of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed to a photo of six deer standing in a green field, saying, "That's 
my friend's back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 However, if Southern California did not have its attractions, such as beaches, 
warm weather and a cosmopolitan atmosphere, it would not have lured as many 
people as it has through the years, said Steven K. Nelson, a manager with 
Southern California Edison. The utility was hoping to counsel businesses at the 
show on how to save energy and meet air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "These other states are here trying to get people to move out," he said. 
"That's why they're here, because people don't live there to begin with."

MCGAW CHARIMAN SWEENEY RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 McGaw Inc. said Monday that James Sweeney, who bought the firm in 1990 and 
arranged its pending sale to a Florida generic drug manufacturer, has resigned 
his post as chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney, 52, who took the Irvine-based provider of intravenous products public 
last year, was replaced by McGaw President Norwick (Wick) Goodspeed "in 
anticipation of McGaw's merger," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation was effective immediately, said McGaw spokesman Lawrence 
Watts. Sweeney was traveling to Florida on Monday and was unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 McGaw announced last month that it had signed a $440-million agreement to be 
purchased by IVAX Corp. in Miami. The merger is expected to close next month. 
At that time, McGaw will become a wholly owned subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts said that Goodspeed was only taking over Sweeney's chief executive 
title. The chairmanship of McGaw will remain unfilled during the transition 
period. At the close of the merger, McGaw's board of directors will be 
dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts did not say what Sweeney's plans were, but he did not rule out a future 
slot on IVAX's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Sweeney expects to "go on to do more entrepreneurial things," Watts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney began his career in health care at age 15, when he worked after school 
at a local hospital. He later became a pioneer of the modern home health care 
industry, starting up Irvine-based Caremark Inc., one of the nation's first 
home health agencies specializing in so-called infusion therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Caremark was eventually purchased by Illinois-based Baxter International, the 
giant medical products firm, where Sweeney once worked as a marketing 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wish him well," Watts said.

O.C. COMPUTER FIRMS ENTER MULTIMEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Multimedia computers are in vogue for computer manufacturers looking to boost 
revenues. On Monday, two Orange County computer makers launched low-priced PCs 
that can run multimedia software, which combines text, audio, video and 
graphics in a single presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced Logic Research Inc. in Irvine said it will sell its Multimedia 
Express computer for $1,995. Meanwhile, Canon Computer Systems Inc. in Costa 
Mesa said it has launched its Innova Vision multimedia desktop computer as well 
as six other computer models. Both companies say their machines sport the 
latest in multimedia equipment, including speakers, CD-ROM drives, monitors and 
sound cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Innova Vision will sell for an estimated $1,850 to $1,950. Consumers have 
been buying machines with the extra multimedia components in about half of 
their new PC purchases now that prices have tumbled.

PROPERTY VALUES: RECESSION MAKES REAL ESTATE APPRAISALS A TOUGHER TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Real estate appraisals have always included an element of judgment -- or 
guesswork. Today's shaky property market is making it harder to come up with 
accurate appraisals as borrowers often square off with lenders about the "real" 
value of a property. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem with appraisals today is the lack of comps, said Philip 
Lipp, president of Allwest Mortgage Co. in North Hollywood and president of the 
3,000-member California Assn. of Mortgage Brokers. "Sometimes appraisers just 
scratch their heads and are unable to file comps," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comps" are the sale prices for comparable homes in the neighborhood. 
"Appraisers today have slim pickings. . . . Many of those comps are also stale 
or are from foreclosure sales." 
</P>
<P>
 It's harder, however, to assess value when it comes to appraising a property 
for the purposes of refinancing. "There is a certain margin of leeway on most 
of these appraisals," Lipp said. "If the property is in better condition, the 
appraiser may be able to give it more value. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do everything in our power to best represent the borrower," he said. "I 
get my own data sources and also ask borrowers to provide their input about the 
amenities. . . . We are trying to get the best possible value that we can." 
</P>
<P>
 All this shouldn't be misinterpreted to suggest that loan brokers are 
improperly trying to influence the appraisers they usually hire, Lipp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The appraiser can only legitimately raise the value according to the 
available comps," he said. "We wind up hurting ourselves in the long run with 
bad appraisals. It's not likely that an inflated appraisal will pass the 
lender's reviews." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing a lot more homework up front before I take a loan application," 
said Ben Hunnicutt, president of Southland Financial Network Inc. in Woodland 
Hills. The first step is to call an appraiser and ask whether it's feasible to 
"bring in" an appraisal within a certain range. If the answer is yes, Hunnicutt 
said, then he'll go ahead and start looking for a loan to match with the 
borrower. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunnicutt said he makes it a point to inform the appraiser about anything that 
may help boost the value of a property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may call the client and ask for an additional list of amenities that 
distinguish a property from other properties in the neighborhood that have been 
sold," he said. "It's not finagling, but there's pressure for appraisers to be 
aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Aggressive, perhaps -- but only to a point. Lenders will do a so-called desk 
review of the appraisal when the borrower is retaining lots of equity. When the 
loan is a refi or the prospective borrower is low on equity, lenders may do 
their own field review of the appraisal and lower the market value accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 It's illegal to improperly influence an appraiser, said Shelly Klimusko, 
senior loan officer at Metrociti Mortgage Corp. in Encino. "Appraisers have to 
sign a statement in every appraisal that they haven't been influenced by 
anyone," she said. Still, there are ways to get appraisers to boost their 
appraisals of value. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always bring up the points that make the house more valuable," Klimusko 
said. "We've had all-out yelling and screaming battles -- in a business-like 
manner, of course -- with appraisers. There are times that they'll come back 
and change something and other times when they won't." 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, Klimusko recalled, "I had a big argument with an appraiser 
one day about landscaping. The appraiser said that house isn't landscaped, but 
it was in (the) process of being landscaped. My client wasn't going to get the 
loan. . . . We had a heated argument and finally settled on a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 While it's possible to argue about appraisals, the lenders have the final say. 
Appraisers that come up with inflated appraisals get taken off the list of 
approved appraisers at various institutions around town, Klimusko said. And 
lenders are routinely reducing appraisals by about 5% in areas where property 
has been declining -- and that's almost everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Appraiser John H. Monroe has been asked to raise his appraisals, but said he's 
never done so. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you come in with a low appraisal, you inevitably get calls," said 
Reseda-based Monroe, who is a past international president of the American 
Society of Appraisers. "The appraiser's job is to be impartial, however. That's 
why we have licensing and certification." 
</P>
<P>
 "There will always be pressures put on you. You have to deal with those; it's 
part of the business," said John Robertson, a Woodland Hills appraiser with 33 
years of experience. "Many appraisal procedures follow a scientific process, 
but the appraisal business is an art; it's not a science. Every time you make 
an estimate, you make an error, no matter how good the estimate." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a tough market to be doing residential appraisals, Robertson conceded. 
"The ideal is to have sales that occurred yesterday and next door as 
comparables." Today's appraisals don't always have many recent sales as a basis 
for comparison, however. The result is that today's appraisals are both less 
certain and have a shorter shelf life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a market is changing rapidly, it would tend to diminish your confidence 
level in your answer," Robertson said. "A number that's six months old may not 
be right today." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, changing property values are a way of life in the San Fernando Valley. 
The median price of a single-family house sold in the Valley in December was 
$190,000, down about 10% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The business of appraisals has become much more professional in the last few 
years with new regulations, including the federal Uniform Standards of 
Professional Appraisal Practice, said Frank Virtue, owner of Frank Virtue & 
Associates in Ventura and an appraiser with 32 years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 More documentation doesn't mean that appraisals are more factual, however. "An 
appraisal is not a fact; it's an opinion of value," Virtue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial properties are easier to evaluate, he said, because value is mostly 
based on the ability of the commercial property to generate income. "A house is 
very difficult to appraise because you have to read human nature, and there are 
a lot of variables," he noted. A really beautiful house with an ugly kitchen 
may have a tough time selling to one type of buyer and an easy time selling to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, there's the story a homeowner in the West Valley told me about 
when he recently refinanced and almost got stopped because the appraisal came 
in $15,000 below the minimum required by the lender. Some neighbors had 
recently sold their house and it had driven down the neighborhood "comps." So 
this fellow's mortgage broker got on the phone and magically the next day, the 
appraisal got bumped up $15,000.

FLIGHT PLANS CHANGE; HOBBYISTS TO MEET ON PROPOSAL TO CLOSE PARK SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remote-control model airplane enthusiasts don't want to be left up in the air 
over county plans to develop the hobby area of Mile Square Regional Park, so 
they are banding together to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, the county's Harbor, Beaches and Parks office plans to 
solicit private development proposals for the triangular-shaped 137 acres used 
by the hobbyists, which will eventually force them to find another place to 
tinker with their scale-model airplanes and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The county-owned park is the county's only public meeting place for builders 
of hand-crafted, remote-controlled aircraft. Other hobbyists use the area for 
their radio-controlled cars and all-terrain vehicles. Rockets are no longer 
allowed at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 In efforts to unite hobbyists who use the park and discuss the county's future 
plans, a meeting will be held tonight at 7 at MacArthur Fundamental 
Intermediate School, 600 W. Alton Ave., Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're enlisting the help of modelers in the area to join our organization and 
work with us," said Bruce L. Moore, president of the Orange County Assn. of 
Model Clubs, which is sponsoring the meeting. The association has members from 
seven clubs in the county, with a total estimated membership of 600, Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mile Square is the only public park in the county that has an area set aside 
for remote-controlled model airplane and car hobbyists, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who is also president of the Flying Falcons of Saddleback Valley, a 
model airplane club, said his group has developed a private flying field in 
Trabuco Canyon for its members. He estimated that there are as many as 18,000 
remote-control modelers of all ages in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to acquire numerous flying sites throughout the county so the 
sport can be enhanced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take away Mile Square Park, you certainly wouldn't have room for 
everybody," since the Trabuco Canyon airfield couldn't accommodate all the 
hobbyists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert G. Fisher, director of Harbors, Beaches and Parks, said Monday that the 
county is pursuing development of a revenue-generating source for the 
triangular piece of land in the center of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had our eye on the center triangle for many years," Fisher said.  
</P>
<P>
 The 137 acres, which was once used by the Marine Corps as an airstrip for 
helicopters, has been used for years by hobbyists. The county took over the 
parcel in 1991 in a land swap with the federal government. The county wanted to 
keep the Marine Corps from building housing there, Fisher said. In exchange, 
the county bought 41 acres in Tustin from the Irvine Co. for $33 million and 
gave it to the Marine Corps for housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously have a very heavy investment in the land, and we don't believe 
it justifies leaving it just the way it is," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said the county has not identified a particular development plan for 
the park. Two golf courses and city-operated recreation facilities are located 
within the 633-acre park. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said the county is looking for "creative ideas -- ideas that don't 
impact the surrounding neighborhood negatively. But we would like it to be 
revenue-producing, some sort of commercial recreation." 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the 137 acres is expected to be put to traditional park uses, 
such as baseball facilities, Fisher said. He added that closing the area to 
hobbyists is at least a year away. 
</P>
<P>
 David S. Greenfield, 74, of Dana Point, who has had a love affair with model 
airplanes since he was a teen-ager, said he is not pleased about the imminent 
closing of the hobby area. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come from all over to fly here," Greenfield said. "It's a crying 
shame. . . . Now they're trying to take this away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenfield, navigator of a B-17 bomber in World War II who has been flying 
model planes at Mile Square Park since the late 1940s, long before it became a 
public park, said his hobby has helped him medically and physically. 
Greenfield, who was shot down over Austria and became a prisoner of war, spends 
hours building his aircraft, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's made my life happy," he said. "It's made my life fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Judson, president of the 120-member Orange Coast Radio Control Club, has 
been flying model planes at the park for more than 20 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible that they want to turn it into a moneymaking thing. We need a 
place where the modelers can come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be catastrophic for me to have them close the park down," said 
Judson, who lives in Fountain Valley. "I think it's unconscionable. Granted, 
the county needs money, but this is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said that while some hobbyists are angry they may be losing Mile Square 
Park, he hopes they will join together to work with the county to find a new 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty percent of the people who participate at Mile Square have accepted that 
they cannot fight the county," he said. "The other 50% are hanging on to a 
glimmer (of hope) that the site won't close. But it's our feeling that working 
with the parks and county officials, we're going to get a lot more that way 
than trying to fight them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said the county plans on helping the hobbyists find a new site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've invited them to tell us what they would need and want in a substitute 
location so we could use our resources to find a place," he said. "We would 
like to help them relocate. After all, we are in the recreation business. We 
care what they are doing." Hobbyist Hubbub

2 KILLED, PARTNER SOUGHT; CRIME: POLICE SEARCH FOR EX-CEO, BELIEVED TO HAVE 
GONE ON A DAYLONG SHOOTING SPREE. ANOTHER BUSINESS ASSOCIATE IS WOUNDED IN 
SANTA ANA; POLICE WARN A THIRD MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police are searching for a man they believe went on a daylong shooting spree 
Monday, killing a woman and a business partner in San Bernardino County and 
critically wounding another partner in a parking structure here. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, 56-year-old John S. Hanna of Upland, is considered armed and 
dangerous, according to Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana shooting occurred just before noon in the 1500 block of North 
Tustin. Police said Greg Lawyer, 51, was shot twice in the upper torso. He was 
taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he was reported in critical 
but stable condition, undergoing surgery Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting took place outside Lawyer's office at North Canadian Marketing, a 
subsidiary of the Calgary-based North Canadian Resources Inc., which builds 
electrical power stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer, Hanna and the others had been partners in another venture called North 
American Cogeneration Inc., which Helton described as "failing." That 
corporation was suspended by the California Secretary of State on July 1, 1991, 
on the recommendation of the State Franchise Tax Board. The company listed 
Hanna as its chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Hanna came to North Canadian's suite and asked for 
Lawyer. The two men walked from the office to an adjoining parking structure, 
where the sound of loud voices was followed by several shots. Lawyer was 
carried to the building's lobby, where he was treated by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer gave Santa Ana police the names of several other partners in the 
venture who he said might be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were only two names he was able to mention to us in the emergency room, 
just before surgery," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in several jurisdictions around Southern California then attempted 
to contact the partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Using witness reports of Hanna's license plate, police in Upland went to 
Hanna's home, where a woman's body was discovered. She had been shot, police 
said. They would not say whether the victim was Hanna's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Police tried unsuccessfully to reach another of Hanna's business partners, 
54-year-old Herbert Roy Ratch. Ratch's wife told police that she dropped him 
off Monday morning for a meeting with Hanna in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino sheriff's investigators in Chino Hills found Ratch's body just 
after noon in a grain storage lot in the 17000 block of Pomona Rincon Road in 
Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence indicates that Ratch had been murdered," said Det. John Ginter, 
probably some time after 10 a.m. Ginter would not say whether Ratch had been 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said Santa Ana police were able to reach another business associate, 
Bernard F. Kolanowski, in Carlsbad, to let him know about the earlier 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 2 p.m., Kolanowski said he heard a shot at the front of his home, 
in the area of his locked gate in the 800 block of Heather Lane, and 
immediately called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolanowski, 57, said he saw Hanna walk past his window and ring his doorbell, 
according to Carlsbad Police Lt. Greg K. Fried. Kolanowski then said he hid in 
his garage, awaiting police. Fried said that as police arrived, a second shot 
was heard from the rear of the house, but they did not find Hanna. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolanowski told police that he was due in court today in Riverside in a case 
involving Hanna. 
</P>
<P>
 North American Cogeneration had a Santa Ana mailing address, Helton said, but 
the company was actually based in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna is described as white, 6 feet tall, 170 pounds with gray hair. He was 
last seen driving a dark blue, 1991 Buick, California license plate number 
3CTP294.

BATTENING DOWN IN LAGUNA; WEATHER: RESIDENTS OF FIRE-SCARRED AREA FACE STORM BY 
STACKING SANDBAGS AND KEEPING WATCH. NO MAJOR DAMAGE, INJURIES ARE REPORTED IN 
MONDAY'S DOWNPOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jenifer Burge sighed in relief as a downpour subsided during the persistent 
rainstorm Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually love it when it rains out here, but we have a different outlook 
now," Burge said. "Ever since the fires, we are constantly reminded of the 
threat of a flood." 
</P>
<P>
 Burge, a longtime resident of the Canyon Acres community, said she has 
perfected what's become a ritual in this flood-prone canyon area. Part of her 
family's storm preparation list includes stacking sandbags, parking cars off 
the street for safe keeping and maintaining vigils with other worried 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Burge's neighborhood streets were slick with mud, no major damage or 
injuries were reported in what weather forecasters were calling the worst storm 
of the season so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing windy gusts up to 35 miles per hour and periods of heavy rain, the 
storm failed to cause significant problems in a community that has learned to 
prepare for disaster since the Oct. 27 fire rampaged through, destroying 366 
homes and leaving barren hillsides ripe for mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 When the storm first struck late Sunday, Burge and her Canyon Acres neighbors 
gathered in the darkness outside their homes, checking the streets for mud or 
flooding, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gathered on the street and helped each other," Burge said. "We moved 
sandbags and drank coffee. It's a great way to meet your neighbors, out in the 
street in the middle of the night." 
</P>
<P>
 Burge now leaves a pair of boots on the porch outside the front door, "so I 
can just slip into them when the rain starts." 
</P>
<P>
 While residents did their best to protect their homes, firefighters staffed 
the city's emergency operations center, which during rainstorms becomes a hub 
of activity for dispatching emergency workers to troubled areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseeding programs since the fire, which scarred nearly 17,000 acres, have 
restored only some burned areas with patches of young grass, mitigating the 
flood danger, said Laguna Beach firefighter Patrick Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan was one of five firefighters who staffed the emergency center at 9 
p.m. Sunday and remained through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is on the second floor of a bank building in the downtown area. The 
center serves as a logistic and communications headquarters. Its walls are 
crowded with maps and charts on logistics for staging equipment and crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part houses the technical support team where Brennan works collecting 
weather data information. Using a computer that hooks into the National Weather 
Service, Brennan said he doesn't forecast the weather, but is able to measure 
actual amount of rainfall with the help of a second, sophisticated system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We also tie into a system that's used by flood control agencies," Brennan 
said. "They have 400 gauges that collect rain information from Point Conception 
to the north to Point Loma in San Diego County. This actual information is best 
for determining when we have to order evacuations." 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said it began raining in Laguna Beach at 11:35 p.m. Sunday. When the 
storm intensified to half an inch of rain, the Fire Department went to an alert 
stage about 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alert stage allowed us to bring in additional equipment, such as a 
lifeguard swift-water rescue team, municipal services and EMA," the county 
Environmental Management Agency, Brennan said. "The public works crews have 
backhoes and graders and we stage them on Laguna Canyon Road near Canyon 
Acres." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials beefed up the emergency operations center with weather 
information after an intense rainstorm dumped nearly two-thirds of an inch in a 
short time, causing flooding and mudslides on Nov. 11, two weeks after the 
devastating fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a hydrologist's report, Brennan said Laguna Beach has a soil saturation 
time of only 15 minutes. That means, Brennan said, that from the beginning of a 
storm with a potential to dump more than half an inch of rain, the city can 
expect flood conditions within 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had one storm that dumped half an inch in an hour and that gave us 
problems," Brennan said. "Today's storm brought a half an inch of rain over a 
five-hour period so we were able to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 For canyon residents, the fear of flooding remains real. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Burge's canyon neighbors, Pete Ott, has placed 6,000 sandbags around 
his home, which was one of the last left standing that far in the canyon after 
the fire. If the flood or mudslides hit, his home will bear the brunt of the 
rushing waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a constant tense situation," Ott said. "We monitor the weather like we 
never have before."

FIRMS WILL FIGHT ANAHEIM PLAN TO REMOVE BUS BENCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bus bench owners tonight are expected to battle a city proposal to remove all 
benches from the city and replace them with graffiti- and advertising-free 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, city officials say, is that while the city has issued permits to 
three companies for a total of 535 benches, some 2,000 have sprung up on the 
city's sidewalks, many broken and covered with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance being considered tonight by the City Council would require bus 
bench companies to remove their property from the city beginning April 1. The 
benches would be replaced by 400 graffiti-resistant backless benches donated to 
the city by Gannett Transit, which also has an exclusive contract with the city 
to operate 120 bus shelters. Gannett is currently negotiating with the city to 
add an unspecified number of bus shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 But bus bench owners say that arrangement will drive them, Gannett's 
competitors, out of the city. They are particularly upset that the city did not 
notify them of the proposed ordinance and that they are not being allowed to 
bid for the new bus shelter contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure (city officials) already have this deal put together and they don't 
want the council to hear the opposing point of view," said Arlan Renfro, 
president of Coast United Advertising, which has 450 to 500 licensed benches in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they are trying to do is exclude (Gannett's) competition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Ripp, a Gannett vice president, said the city contacted his company 
and asked it to provide the benches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were contacted by the city about its concern over the proliferation of 
unlicensed bus benches," Ripp said. He said that Gannett doesn't care whether 
the benches are eliminated but that "if the city has that concern, we would 
like to help it solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 While the benches and shelters provide seating and cover for those awaiting 
buses, they are really a medium for selling advertising. Depending on the 
location, a bench costs an advertiser $360 to $600 per year, while Gannett's 
shelters cost an advertiser $2,400 to $7,200 per year, according to Gannett and 
the bench companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the difference, benches attract small local advertisers, while 
shelter ads are usually taken out by large national firms, and the bench and 
shelter owners rarely compete for the same accounts. Where they do compete, 
both sides admit, is for the attention of passing drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the benches are eliminated, Gannett's advertisers won't have to compete 
for attention with our advertisers," Renfro said. "Gannett will be able to 
charge more." 
</P>
<P>
 Ripp said that is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
 John Lower, Anaheim's traffic and transportation manager, said the city wants 
to replace the existing benches because many of them "are unlicensed and in a 
state of disrepair." 
</P>
<P>
 The bench owners pay the city a minimum of $6 annually per bench, while 
Gannett pays a minimum of $768 annually per shelter. The city receives about 
$92,000 annually from Gannett and about $4,500 a year from the bench firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But William Sell, the city's treasury manager, said that Coast United has not 
paid the city its $3,000-per-year licensing fee in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of our biggest problems -- getting these people to pay their 
fees," Sell said. "We would just go and confiscate their benches, but it would 
cost us more than what we are owed." 
</P>
<P>
 Renfro said the city has not sent him a bill since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the responsibility for that is on us -- we should have caught that," 
Renfro said. "But we would have paid the bills if we had received them." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that if there are 1,500 unlicensed benches in Anaheim, as officials 
report, "then obviously (the city) has not done a good job of policing its own 
house."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COUNTYWIDE: PHEASANT HUNTING BY PRADO DAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun was still low as Paul Sebourn and three companions, including his 
12-year-old grandson, Brandon, fanned out into the field. 
</P>
<P>
 As three white and gold Brittany spaniels ran yelping in several directions, 
the hunters sauntered cautiously through the brush with shotguns slung over 
their shoulders. Suddenly one of the dogs stopped short, pointing like a frozen 
statue at a bush. A few seconds passed as the hunters cautiously brought their 
guns to the ready. Then, a big brown bird rose slowly up from the ground with 
its wings flapping frantically. 
</P>
<P>
 POP! POP! POP!  
</P>
<P>
 Without further comment, the animal plummeted like a stone, leaving a raft of 
colored feathers fluttering from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't do this just to shoot," said Sebourn, a 73-year-old retired phone 
company employee from the Escondido area. "I do it to watch my dogs work and 
because I like to eat the birds. My wife has four different recipes; I must 
have 20 pheasants at home in the freezer right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene did not take place in rural South Dakota where most of the country's 
wild pheasants are hunted. Instead, Sebourn and other hunters from across 
Southern California have found an unlikely oasis in the fields behind the Prado 
Dam, within shouting distance of the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The land is owned by the Orange County Water District, and for six days a 
week, the shooting here rarely stops. 
</P>
<P>
 'It's relaxation," said Mike Raahauge, who leases the land from the water 
district for the Mike Raahauge's Shooting Enterprise. "Nobody bothers you and 
the phone isn't ringing. It's a simple, nice outing and it's close." 
</P>
<P>
 Raahauge's father founded the business in 1957 just south of Sacramento. In 
1971, the company moved to its present location on 1,000 acres behind Prado 
Dam, which supplies water for most of Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 Raahauge offers a variety of services including target practice, duck hunting 
and the training of hunting dogs. By far the most popular, he says, is pheasant 
hunting, which draws up to 100 hunters a day from October to March. "They shoot 
about 30,000 birds here each year," says Raahauge, 55. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds -- Chinese ring neck pheasants -- are raised on the premises for 
that purpose. Purchased as day-old chicks from a dealer in Fresno, the birds 
are kept in large pens for about four months. Then, on the morning of a hunt, 
they are placed in small cages, loaded on the back of a truck and released into 
the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 For an annual fee of $1,200, members of Raahauge's pheasant-hunting club -- 
who number about 100 -- are entitled to go out as often as they like. Those who 
want a one-time experience may shoot up to three pheasants for $40 on a weekday 
or $45 on a weekend day. 
</P>
<P>
 Raahauge said that about 80% of the birds are killed by the hunters within a 
few hours of their release. The rest, he said, are eventually eaten by 
predators such as hawks or coyotes, with a small percentage surviving long 
enough to reproduce in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Some animal rights activists have criticized commercial pheasant hunting as 
inhumane and cruel. Advocates of the sport say that it maintains ecological 
balance by not affecting natural stock and helps preserve wilderness habitat by 
putting it to profitable use. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just the killing," said Jim Young, one of Sebourn's companions. 
"It's the total experience: the camaraderie and being outdoors." DAVID HALDANE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY PLANS 
TO HACK BUDGET BY $3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having cut $8.1 million from its budget two years ago and another $6 million 
last year, Newport Beach officials have begun looking for $3 million more to 
trim from the 1994-95 fiscal budget.  
</P>
<P>
 Directors of the 11 municipal departments -- such as the police, general 
services and city attorney's office -- have been asked to draw up a projected 
budget that proposes cuts of 4.5% to 7.5%, City Manager Kevin J. Murphy said. 
Those reductions will probably include cuts in city staff and reductions in 
some municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have tried to find cuts in the $56-million budget that residents 
will not notice. But most of those veiled expenses -- such as delaying road 
improvements or replacing city-owned vehicles -- have already been cut close to 
the bone, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We can no longer afford the luxury of continuing to do business as usual," 
Mayor Clarence J. Turner said in his State of the City address Friday night at 
the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Tennis Club. "It is my contention that 
fewer personnel will be asked to maintain a level of service that the citizens 
of our city have come to rely on." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's budget has been a focus of attention in recent years because of the 
statewide recession and steady decrease in sales tax and other revenue upon 
which cities traditionally rely. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, while the city raised taxes on business licenses, hotel beds and 
use of emergency paramedics, it also eliminated 47 full-time jobs from its 
payroll by way of retirements, attrition and six layoffs. For the remaining 700 
employees, officials granted a 3% pay raise that went into effect the first of 
this year and a second increase of 5% at the top of the salary scale to begin 
in April. These raises, which the city manager and city attorney declined, are 
the first salary increases in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises account for the bulk of the city's projected $3-million shortfall 
for 1994-95 fiscal year. City Finance Director Dennis Danner said that 
officials will probably design an early-retirement package in hope of 
attracting enough takers to keep this year's layoffs to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 But staff reductions alone probably cannot meet the projected budget deficit, 
and for that reason city officials have begun looking at scaling back service 
at many levels of the city government, Danner said. For example, he said it may 
take longer to get building inspectors to a site, and street sweeping may not 
be as frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's public safety departments -- police, fire and marine safety -- will 
be able to avoid the deepest cuts because of last November's voter approval of 
Proposition 172 to continue a statewide sales tax to pay for public safety. 
Danner said that Newport Beach is anticipating receiving $452,000 from the 
state to cushion the blow of municipal cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials caution that budget projections at this point are simply estimates 
that cannot be assured until the governor signs a state budget. City staff 
expects to review and fine-tune the budget with employee associations 
throughout March and will submit the budget document to the city council in 
May.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: NEWPORT BEACH; BALBOA 
WATER SERVICE WILL BE INTERRUPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning late Wednesday night and lasting until dawn Thursday, water will cut 
off to a portion of Balboa Peninsula while city workers reline a water main. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Antista, Newport Beach utilities superintendent, said that residents who 
live between 8th Street and Island Avenue should plan to be without water from 
11 p.m. Wednesday to 5 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Antista said some residents also will notice flakes of rust in their tap water 
while the project is underway. He said that people can safely drink that 
odd-colored water but should not use it to do laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers, with the help of a hired contractor, will be relining a 16-inch 
water pipe that was installed in 1926 to serve the peninsula. Before the work 
begins, workers will go door-to-door to tell residents of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents can expect a series of water interruptions in coming weeks but 
Antista is not sure when they will occur and for how long.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COUNTYWIDE: RESERVE COMMAND AIDS QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Staff Sgt. Manuel Martinez of the 63rd U.S. Army Reserve Command based in Los 
Alamitos helped some of the Northridge earthquake victims fill out forms for 
government assistance Monday at Sylmar High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was one of 30 linguists from the command who were stationed at five 
FEMA centers in Los Angeles, Sylmar and Van Nuys for two weeks. They translated 
for people who spoke only Spanish, Korean, Russian, Vietnamese or Chinese and 
could not fill out the government assistance applications in English. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time the translators had been assigned to help earthquake 
victims cope with the stress and difficulties of dealing with their losses, 
Army officials said. Monday was their last day on duty there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty slow today," said Martinez, who helped dozens of Spanish-speaking 
victims. "Most people who are coming in now are in need of minor help." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, there were long lines of people waiting to ask for everything 
from money to food, clothing and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty depressing," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled being saddened when an elderly, partially blind woman told him she 
lost everything she owned when the temblor destroyed her home, which happened 
to be part of a laundry room in an apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "She needed help and we referred her to the Red Cross for food and clothes and 
HUD (Housing and Urban Development) to help pay the rent in a real apartment," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 30 linguists, 15 mental health experts from the command 
helped victims of the Jan. 17 quake. Today is their last day on duty helping 
out victims. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the experts, Army specialist Ana Estevez, said the number of families 
still in need of counseling services is dwindling. She said she has been 
helping social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists quell people's fears of 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are just plain afraid of the earthquakes and we're explaining 
to them that an earthquake is a natural thing," she said from the Hollywood 
High School gym, where about 170 earthquake victims are staying. 
</P>
<P>
 She said many children are too scared to leave their parents' side. One child 
told her, "I want to stay with my mommy because I want to die with my mommy," 
Estevez said. "I talked to him and kind of lightened his fear but it's been 
traumatic, especially for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 About their assignment, Martinez said: "People were coming in looking for help 
and they were grateful to get it. It made us feel good."MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: COSTA MESA; PATRONS PLAN 
DANCE TO PAY DEBT TO CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse Patrons Assn., which owes the city more than 
$2,000, has scheduled a fund-raising dance on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Association Vice President Hugo Hunziker said he wants to finish paying the 
debt, which ran up to $3,183 when the association rented a room at the Civic 
Center in 1991 to hold bingo games.Attendance at the games dwindled after the 
city passed a no-smoking ordinance, and the bingo games were finally canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council in December accepted a $1,000 check from Hunziker, and he 
paid another $100 in January. Hunziker told the council he would make monthly 
payments, and recently added that he would like to pay it all off at once.  
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Director of Finance Marcus D. Davis said the association owes

said about $600 has been raised, leaving roughly $1,400 as the goal for the 
fund-raiser.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: IRVINE; FORUM TO BE HELD 
ON MARINE BASE REUSE 
</P>

<P>
 The public will have an opportunity to comment on conversion plans for the El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station during a community forum Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is sponsored by the city and the Chamber of Commerce, which has 
assembled a panel of experts to discuss the closure and reuse process. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the goal is to provide residents with accurate information 
about El Toro's future and solicit ideas from the public on what to do with the 
base once the Marines leave later this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 One often-discussed idea is to convert El Toro into a commercial airport. But 
many Irvine residents oppose the idea because of fears that it will create 
traffic, noise and pollution. Other suggestions include using parts of the base 
to build a commercial business district or an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists include Paul O. Brady Jr., Irvine's city manager; Peter Ciesla, 
assistant transition coordinator for the Pentagon's Base Realignment and 
Closure Office; and Ernie Schneider, the county's administrative officer. The 
moderator will be Steve Churm, publisher of Orange County Metropolitan. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum will be from 7 to 9 p.m. at the council chambers. It will also be 
broadcast on cable television. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: BREA; DEVELOPERS TO START ON SHOPPING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction of a 50-acre commercial and residential project in the downtown 
redevelopment area will begin within 45 days, project officials announced last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The first part will be the 18-acre Gateway Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members voted 3 to 1 last week to allow developers out of a 
3-year-old agreement that required them to build on the 5,000-square-foot 
corner of Brea Boulevard and Birch Street that was supposed to be part of the 
Gateway Center. Instead, that land now will be part of a business and 
entertainment center, which is part of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action dropped the price of the shopping center by $455,000. 
Developers now will buy Gateway's land from the city for $4.5 million, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project involves construction of: 
</P>
<P>
 * The shopping center, which will include a Ralphs supermarket and Payless 
drug store on the north side of Imperial Highway west of Brea Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * The business and entertainment center on Birch Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 100 townhouses north of Birch Street and west of Walnut Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the business and entertainment center, which will include an 
Edwards Cinema, is expected to begin in 1995 while the housing construction 
will begin this summer, said Susan M. Georgino, director of Redevelopment 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the project will eliminate the "blighting conditions in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Project construction was delayed for about three years by legal action from 
business and property owners unhappy with being forced from the area to make 
way for the redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the legal wrangling was settled out of court when the city created a 
relocation plan for displaced businesses. A few property owners, however, still 
are contesting the purchase price of their properties, which the Brea 
Redevelopment Agency acquired by eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Kathyrn E. Wiser, who cast the vote against allowing developers 
to change their agreement, said she did so because of those property owners.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: BUENA PARK; DISTRICT TO DEDICATE CENTRALIA 
SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Centralia School District's newest school, and the first with a year-round 
schedule, will be dedicated Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 The 10 a.m. ceremony will be held in the multipurpose room at Centralia 
School, 195 N. Western Ave., at the corner of Western and Lincoln avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours of the school, which opened in August, will be available while classes 
are in session before the dedication ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 students in kindergarten through sixth grade attend the school, the 
site of the old Centralia School built in 1936. That school closed in 1981 
because of the district's declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 The district then decided to rebuild to relieve overcrowding in three schools: 
Walter Knott, G.H. Dysinger and Danbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Centralia School has teachers at the same grade level working in teams, an 
effective approach used in the district's summer academy program, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has a media center, computer lab and art and science room. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the dedication ceremony, call (714) 228-3100.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: DANA POINT; TALL SHIP REPLICA 
TO SAIL INTO HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 205 years after its namesake became the first American Colonial vessel 
to reach land on the West Coast, the Lady Washington will sail into the Dana 
Point Harbor today.  
</P>
<P>
 Off the coast of Orange County, the 112-foot, full-size tall ship replica will 
exchange cannon salutes with another schooner, the Californian, before mooring 
in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lady Washington will be open to the public the next two weekends from 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. It will be moored at the Orange County Marine Institute, 24200 
Dana Point Harbor Drive at the north end of the marina. 
</P>
<P>
 The current incarnation of the Lady Washington is owned by the Grays Harbor 
Historical Seaport in Washington state. The ship has been visiting ports along 
the West Coast since September. 
</P>
<P>
 Named after America's original first lady, Martha Washington, the Lady 
Washington set out from Boston Harbor in 1787, bound for the West Coast via the 
long Cape Horn route. 
</P>
<P>
 One year later, the Lady Washington and a larger companion vessel explored the 
coastline from Washington to California before setting sail for Hawaii and 
Japan. Maritime historians say the ship was instrumental in establishing 
trading routes between the nascent American colonies and the Orient, as well as 
the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the voyage was ill-fated. Upon leaving Japan, the ship and all its 
crew were lost in the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lady Washington, the Californian and the Orange County Marine Institute's 
Pilgrim are all involved in maritime education. Large groups of schoolchildren 
visit the frigates in their home ports. All have living history programs in 
which local sailing buffs dressed in historical nautical costumes demonstrate 
19th-Century sailing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the Lady Washington's visit, call the Marine Institute 
at (714) 496-2274. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: LAGUNA HILLS; POLICE SEEK 
GUNMAN IN BAKERY ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies are looking for a robber who pistol-whipped an employee of 
a Laguna Hills Mall bakery early Monday morning and escaped with $2,700. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sheriff's Department spokesman said the gunman, wearing a ski mask, entered 
through the employee entrance of T.J. Cinnamons shortly after 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The man held a gun on the lone employee working at the bakery and demanded 
money, which the worker handed over in a bag. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the gunman demanded more. When shown an empty cash register he struck 
the baker on the head with his gun, then fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee complained of a lump on his head, but declined medical treatment 
and remained on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said the gunman is wanted on charges of armed robbery and assault. He 
was wearing dark pants, a gray sweater or sweat shirt and ski gloves.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: FULLERTON; RECALL ELECTION TO BE HELD; CITY'S 
FIRST EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will hold its first-ever recall election now that detractors of the 
City Council have succeeded in collecting enough signatures to demand a vote, 
City Clerk Anne M. York said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County registrar of voters finished verifying thousands of 
signatures late Friday for the recall of council members Don Bankhead and Molly 
McClanahan, York said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and York also are recall targets. The registrar's 
office estimates that it will finish verifying the signatures on those 
petitions within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort has been going on since July, when the City Council voted 3 
to 2 in favor of an unpopular 2% tax on water, telephone, electricity, natural 
gas and cable television bills, despite objections from hundreds of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Bankhead, McClanahan and Catlin voted in favor of the tax, 
while council members Julie Sa and Chris Norby voted against it.  
</P>
<P>
 A group of opponents had urged the council to trim the city's budget instead 
of increasing taxes and asked that the issue be put before voters in a special 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 But the suggestions "fell on deaf ears," said Thomas Babcock, chairman of the 
Fullerton Recalls Committee. His group decided to recall the council members to 
"send a message that their actions should have consequences," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that my efforts proved to be fruitful, but I wish like hell that 
we didn't have to do it," Babcock said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 The recall will probably be placed on the June 7 primary ballot, and is 
estimated to cost $90,000, York said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council members are recalled, another election will be held to replace 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither McClanahan nor Bankhead could be reached for comment Monday, but city 
spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer Mudrick said McClanahan has indicated she intends to 
fight the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Babcock said York is a target for recall because she rejected recall petitions 
against the council members, saying they exceeded the legal word limit, and 
because she mixed up some of the documents, a mistake that could have 
potentially invalidated the recall process. 
</P>
<P>
 York, who has been city clerk since 1976, says there is no reason for the 
recall effort against her. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: SEAL BEACH; OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS WETLANDS 
PROJECT

<P>
 City officials will present their critique of the Koll Co.'s Bolsa Chica 
development plan at a meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has long expressed concerns about the 4,286-home development near 
Huntington Beach, fearing it will increase traffic and noise in nearby Seal 
Beach neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's environmental quality control board will discuss the project's 
recently released environmental impact report and focus on what the development 
would mean to traffic along Pacific Coast Highway, Seal Beach Boulevard and 
other major roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting also will give the public an opportunity to comment on the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to send a detailed letter to the Koll Co. and county planners 
outlining the Seal Beach's concerns about the impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, written by Seal Beach's planning staff, questions the report's 
assertion that traffic congestion will be eased by the widening of Pacific 
Coast Highway from four to six lanes through Sunset Beach and Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said it is possible the road will never be widened and that 
planners should take that into account when calculating how the Bolsa Chica 
development will affect traffic patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the (widening) is not going to occur, we don't think it should be 
considered," Planning Director Lee Whittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Co. seeks to build the homes on 400 acres of unincorporated land near 
Warner Avenue and Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in Huntington Beach are divided over the project. More than 500 
people attended a public meeting on the issue last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seal Beach hearing begins at 6:30 p.m. at the Council Chambers. SHELBY

WOMAN'S EX-BOYFRIEND HELD IN MAN'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fontana man who had been separated from the mother of his five children for 
the last year has been arrested in the shooting death of the woman's new 
boyfriend, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ysrael Cordova, 35, was arrested Sunday on suspicion of murder in the death of 
Paul Rivas, 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Cruz, who lived with Cordova for 13 years and bore him four daughters 
and a son, said she watched helplessly as Cordova shot Rivas twice at 
point-blank range when the two men confronted each other in her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, she said that Cordova also threatened to kill her, but that 
she managed to escape to her mother's nearby home after she and Cordova 
scuffled for the handgun. In the past, she said, Cordova had made similar 
threats against other members of her family, whom he blamed for the breakup of 
their common-law marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Cruz's mother, Mona Cruz, said that in the hours between the 4:30 a.m. 
Sunday shooting and Cordova's arrest that night, she received more than 20 
threatening phone calls from him, which she said she taped.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I'll kill you next,' " she recounted. "The reason . . . is because 
you're the mother of (Rebecca), and I want to see you cry like your daughter 
cried." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Cruz, 30, said she pleaded tearfully for her life after she witnessed 
the slaying of Rivas. She said that Cordova broke into her apartment on East 
Park Lane and that Rivas confronted him with a baseball bat before he was shot, 
first in the temple and then execution-style in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Cordova's arrest, Rebecca Cruz went into hiding Monday, fearing for 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz said her 13-year relationship with Cordova was marked by fights and 
abuse. In their breakup last year, she said Cordova got custody of the two 
oldest daughters, age 9 and 12, and she was awarded the three youngest, whose 
ages range from 2 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz said she and Rivas, who has two school-age children of his own, had been 
dating for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Police Sgt. Steve Rodig said officers had gone to the residence 
several times in the past on "domestic violence" calls involving Cordova. He 
did not elaborate, citing the pending investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has beaten me up; he has threatened my family," Rebecca Cruz said. "I have 
told the police; I have asked for their help. They said they could do nothing. 
And now he has killed Paul." 
</P>
<P>
 About three months ago, Mona Cruz said, Cordova rammed his car into her car in 
anger. Around the same time, Cordova also dumped a mixture of cement and paint 
on Rivas' car, the Cruz women said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Cordova started a fire in Rebecca Cruz's apartment in Fullerton. No 
one was hurt, and shortly afterward Rebecca Cruz sought a temporary restraining 
order to keep Cordova at a distance from her and her family, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mona Cruz, 53, said she also complained to police about Cordova last year 
after he assaulted her. She also told police she had taped Cordova's 
threatening telephone calls, but was told the conversations were hearsay and 
therefore could not be used. Anaheim Police declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother said Cordova blamed the family for his estrangement from her 
daughter. "He thinks that we came between him and my daughter. We helped my 
daughter. I got her this apartment (in Anaheim) because I didn't want her to 
depend on him. So he hates me and all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mona and Rebecca Cruz and other members of their family said they would fear 
for their lives if Cordova were free. 
</P>
<P>
 He was jailed after his arrest, and his bail was set at $250,000. Rodig said 
police will try to keep him in custody and would oppose any move to reduce his 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled to be arraigned today in Municipal Court in Fullerton.

ANAHEIM JOINS CITIES GROUP LOBBYING ON EL TORO; LAND USE: THE ALLIANCE OF NORTH 
COUNTY GOVERNMENTS FAVORS CONVERTING THE MARINE BASE INTO A COMMERICAL AIRPORT 
AFTER IT IS CLOSED DOWN. 
</P>

<P>
 After months of posturing, the city of Anaheim will officially join an 
alliance of North County cities trying to influence future development plans 
for the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, city officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, known as the Orange County Regional Airport Authority, supports 
building a commercial airport at the base after it closes, which is scheduled 
to occur by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is closely monitoring the actions of the county's newly formed El 
Toro Reuse Planning Authority, which is taking the lead in determining the base 
reuse issue. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of North County cities, including Anaheim, are concerned that the 
county's executive panel will not seriously consider an airport option for the 
base. Furthermore, they contend that the county panel is weighted in favor of 
cities that do not favor an airport proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of South County cities oppose putting an airport at the 4,700-acre 
base because they contend it will create too much noise, snarl traffic and 
affect their quality of life. They would like to see some other development at 
the base, such as residential or commercial projects.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Anaheim officials have participated in OCRAA meetings, the council is 
expected to make the city an official member of the group with a vote at 
tonight's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure we have a say in what's going to become of the base," 
said Councilman Irv Pickler. "We have to look out for our city's interests." 
</P>
<P>
 OCRAA was formed by the cities of Garden Grove, Stanton and Los Alamitos last 
summer. Anaheim had not joined the group because it was waiting to see who 
would be included in the county's reuse committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Bruner, aide to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley who is the designated chairman 
of the county's El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, said Anaheim's decision 
should not be considered a disruptive influence on the base conversion process. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials have also indicated they would join the executive council of 
the county's planning group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Folks in every city in this county ought to take care of their interests in 
the best way they know how," Bruner said. "We can't tell people living in 
Anaheim, Orange or San Clemente what they ought to be doing. I would hope 
(Anaheim's) participation in OCRAA would not be to the exclusion of any 
involvement (on the county authority)." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since El Toro was slated for closure, the future development of the base 
has been a hotly debated issue among Orange County cities, which are divided on 
whether to build an airport on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan B. Hughes, executive director of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, said 
he supports the city joining OCRAA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it is now, the non-airport people have a veto" in the county plan, he 
said. "We think that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said a commercial or cargo airport at the base would greatly enhance 
the county's tourism industry as well as its businesses.

CITRON TO FACE 1ST CHALLENGER IN 23 YEARS; POLITICS: COSTA MESA ACCOUNTANT 
CALLS THE INCUMBENT COUNTY TREASURER-TAX COLLECTOR A BUREAUCRACY 'LIFER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time since he was elected more than two decades ago, County 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron will face a challenger in the June 7 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 John M.W. Moorlach, a Costa Mesa accountant who is active in local Republican 
politics, announced his candidacy Monday for the post Citron has held since 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach, 38, called Citron, 68, a government bureaucracy "lifer" and pointed 
out that Citron's 23 years in office is longer than much of the electorate has 
been registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to have some new blood in there. I just want to provide some 
professional skepticism, do some digging," said Moorlach, who grew up in Buena 
Park and has lived in Santa Ana and Costa Mesa since 1978. "I want to be a 
taxpayer advocate, represent the citizens. I want to provide a fresh face and 
give the voters a real chance at term limits." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron said it is his long tenure and success in the post that qualify him to 
keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 A registered Democrat in a heavily Republican county, Citron has run unopposed 
since his first election and enjoys wide respect among local officials and 
colleagues across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 He was originally elected just tax collector, but in 1973 the County Board of 
Supervisors decided to merge the treasurer's and tax collector's jobs into one. 
</P>
<P>
 As treasurer, Citron manages a massive investment portfolio that includes 
county funds from 187 local government agencies. His investment accounts total 
$7.5 billion and have long offered municipalities higher interest rates than 
the state or other county treasurers' offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an office that takes a great deal of experience," Citron said Monday. 
"The kind of success I've had on behalf of my constituency has been such that 
it gives me a great thrill to be able to assist and help these many districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have somebody running against you, you take it seriously," 
Citron said. "But I believe with my years and my excellent reputation of what 
I've done in my office, we'll be reelected." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach, who was elected assistant treasurer of Orange County's Republican 
Party in 1992, has spent the last 17 years as an accountant and is a partner in 
the firm of Balser, Horowitz, Frank and Wakeling. He writes a local newspaper 
column and hosts a cable television program, "The Costa Mesa Conservative 
Report." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he had considered a bid for the Assembly seat being vacated by Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), Moorlach said he chose to run for the county post 
instead, so he could stay close to his wife and three children. 
</P>
<P>
 In his announcement, he focused on Citron's long tenure and said he would push 
for prompt reassessments and lower property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the background. I'm someone from the private sector that can step in 
and give it a fresh look rather than someone from inside," he said. "I think 
the citizens should have someone that represents them as opposed to the county 
bureaucracy."

 CU Bancorp, the Encino-based parent of California United Bank, said its 
chairman, Jon P. Goodman, resigned as expected after helping to engineer the 
bank's turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul W. Glass, 47, a CU Bancorp director, was named the bank holding company's 
new chairman.A certified public accountant, Glass is a principal in the Encino 
accounting firm of Glass & Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman, a business professor at USC, also resigned as a director of both CU 
Bancorp and California United. Her replacement on those boards will be 
announced later, a CU Bancorp spokesman said. In a statement, Goodman said she 
would return to USC, where she directs the business school's entrepreneurial 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 CU Bancorp named Goodman chairman 13 months ago in a management shake-up 
related to the bank's mounting real estate losses. The company has since 
refocused its attention on mid-sized business clients while reducing its 
non-performing real estate loans, and recently reported its fourth straight 
quarterly profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen G. Carpenter, CU Bancorp's president and chief executive officer, will 
also take on Goodman's duties as chairman of California United. David I. 
Rainer, California United's chief operating officer, will also become president 
of California United, succeeding Carpenter.

GREED BEHIND PROBLEMS AT OXNARD DUNES, JURY IS TOLD; TRIAL: DURING CLOSING 
ARGUMENTS IN LONG-RUNNING LAWSUIT, ATTORNEY FOR HOME BUYERS SAYS THE CITY AND 
DEVELOPER KNEW AN OIL WASTE DUMP LURKED UNDER THE SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A housing developer and the city of Oxnard knew that an abandoned oil waste 
dump lurked underneath the Oxnard Dunes development, but they neglected to warn 
home buyers because of greed, an attorney for three families said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Lawrence M. Schulner's remarks came during closing arguments in the 
complex four-month trial over the families' lawsuit, which was filed after the 
discovery of a toxic dump under the 100-home development nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The three families are seeking unspecified damages from the developer, the 
city of Oxnard, a former landowner and numerous other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, 175 residents joined in the lawsuit in Ventura County Superior 
Court. All but the three remaining families agreed to an undisclosed 
out-of-court settlement last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The subdivision -- off Harbor Boulevard about 1 1/2 miles north of Channel 
Islands Harbor -- was used as a dump for oil field waste during the 1950s. The 
developer started selling lots there in 1964, and most of the homes were built 
in the late 1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the remnants of the dump were discovered, state health officials 
conducted tests over five years and concluded in 1990 that the site posed no 
health hazard to residents. Tests found no dangerous levels of contaminants in 
the soil, water or air. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulner, however, told the jury that the land is contaminated with the toxin 
barium, which he described as poisonous but not cancer-causing. He accused the 
state of "burying its head in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue of barium looms larger and larger for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulner's arguments are scheduled to continue today. An attorney for the 
developer, Oxnard Shores Co., is expected to present the defense argument 
Wednesday. In past statements, the company has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulner is trying to persuade the jury in Judge Melinda A. Johnson's 
courtroom that Fred Marlow, an agent for the developer, intentionally concealed 
the history of the land from the people who bought lots and eventually built 
homes there. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulner said Marlow, who bought the property for Oxnard Shores in 1959, 
covered up the waste on the property by pouring sand over it. That ploy, he 
argued, kept residents from discovering the dump for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Oxnard also was aware of the problem with the Dunes before lots 
were sold, Schulner told the jury. The city chose not to intervene because it 
stood to collect significant tax revenues from the development, Schulner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard city officials on Monday declined to respond to Schulner's charges. 
City Atty. Gary Gillig said that as part of the settlement agreement with the 
other families in the lawsuit, the city agreed to a gag order until the case is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlow, now in his 90s, could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulner pointed to more than 500 documents that he said help prove that 
private and public officials were aware of the problems at the Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 He started with a transcript of a deposition by Marlow, who testified that he 
bought and sold the Dunes property sight unseen 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that is unlikely, Schulner said. He portrayed Marlow, a graduate of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as a sophisticated real estate developer 
who would have known better than to buy property without taking a firsthand 
look. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a man who understood every nuance of real estate, every nuance of 
subdividing," Schulner said. "He has a background that just won't quit. . . . 
He left (the waste) there because it was cheaper to do it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the plaintiffs in the case, Steven Blanchard and Linda Paxton, sat at 
the table with Schulner as he presented his arguments. Those plaintiffs, along 
with Mary and Paul Null, have lost all the value of their property since the 
history of Oxnard Dunes was disclosed, Schulner said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the Paxtons and Blanchards moved out of their homes three years ago 
and quit paying their mortgages, their banks have not foreclosed on them, 
Schulner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is contaminated just enough that the lenders and the public don't want any 
part of it," the attorney said.

OFFICES OPEN FOR EMERGENCY FOOD STAMPS; SERVICES: SUSPECTED FRAUD IN LOS 
ANGELES COUNTY DELAYED TIMELY AID TO LOCAL EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS, BUT APPLICATIONS 
ARE NOW BEING TAKEN. SCREENING IS TIGHT, HOWEVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a lengthy delay prompted by fraud problems in Los Angeles County, 
Ventura County welfare workers began accepting applications Monday from local 
earthquake victims for emergency food stamp vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income county residents who suffered losses during the Jan. 17 quake may 
apply for 10 days at newly opened offices in Simi Valley and Fillmore and one 
to open soon in Piru, said Helen Reburn, deputy director of the county's 
Department of Public Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Screening for the emergency food program is tight in response to suspected 
widespread fraud in Los Angeles County, Reburn said. Early reports of fraud, in 
fact, delayed federal approval of this county's Jan. 25 application for 
emergency food stamps, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That slowed down the procedures and resulted in several conference calls with 
state and federal officials to work out all the problems," Reburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 As implemented Monday, Ventura County's program requires a 72-hour waiting 
period before stamps are distributed, a mandate now re-established in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The program here also adds requirements unique to this county. It specifies 
that only residents of the hard-hit Fillmore, Simi Valley and Piru areas may 
apply. And it requires thorough checks of the applicants' identities, places of 
residence and income eligibility -- and uses computer hookups with a variety of 
agencies to verify information, Reburn said. Concerned that Los Angeles County 
residents might apply here, officials will cross-check with that county's 
welfare agency to see if applicants have also applied there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to ensure that Ventura County residents who suffered damage or 
loss receive the food assistance for which they are entitled, but that nobody 
else does," Reburn said.  
</P>
<P>
 Amid sporadic but heavy rains, about 80 applicants had filtered through the 
Simi Valley and Fillmore application centers by late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first day, and the torrential downpour has something to do with 
it," Reburn said of the small turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She said crowds are expected today at application centers at the First 
Assembly of God Church at 703 Central Ave. in Fillmore and the East Valley 
Courthouse at 3855-F Alamo St. in Simi Valley. The centers are open from 9 a.m. 
to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen applicants showed up in Fillmore, where 11 welfare workers 
staffed a makeshift office. Two welfare fraud investigators were present to 
question those suspected of not living in the area or whose damage claims 
seemed far-fetched, Reburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants who turned out Monday welcomed the aid and said their need is real. 
</P>
<P>
 "A friend told me about this. She knew we were really hurting," said Lisa 
Sparks, 27, who lives with husband Joe and two children in nearby Rancho 
Camulos. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's food supply spoiled in the days after the earthquake, when their 
power went out and damage kept them from entering their house to salvage 
perishables. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to charge our food at the market (in Piru), but now they're going to 
tear it down," said Joe Sparks, 34. "We just need a little something to get us 
by for now." 
</P>
<P>
 At the newly opened Simi Valley center, Holly, a mother of four, said the 
assistance would replace food lost during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had friends and relatives bringing us care packages, living off 
Cheerios, hot dogs, soup and sandwiches," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly was gratified to get a call early Monday from Supervisor Vicky Howard's 
office informing her of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The resident, who lives in a 60-year-old un-reinforced brick home with her 
husband and children, said the family has not slept in the structure since the 
earthquake opened large cracks in the walls and caused the chimney to lean 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, they've been sleeping in a trailer parked outside the house and 
waiting for an engineer's estimate of what it will take to shore up the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she called Howard's office last week to ask about food stamp 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really glad and surprised when the woman called me back this morning, 
because no one's ever called me back," Holly said. "We're those people who keep 
falling through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Distribution of the emergency stamps was formally approved by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture on Friday. Welfare officials immediately spread the 
word to local, state and federal relief agencies about the Monday openings, 
said Kathi Strahl, manager of the Simi Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
 Information was also broadcast on a local cable television channel in Fillmore 
and Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The county-administered program requires applicants to meet low-income 
standards and file a declaration of earthquake-related loss of income or food. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a quake victim could qualify by losing a job because of quake 
damage or because his or her food spoiled during a power outage caused by the 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits are issued one time only and cover the equivalent of one month's food 
stamps -- $112 for a single person and up to $676 for a family of eight. The 
maximum net income for a qualifying family of four is $1,534 a month after 
earthquake losses are figured in, Reburn said.

SEARCHING FOR SECURITY; AFTER SLAYING, SIMI SCHOOLS WANT 2 SAFETY COMMITTEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bombarded with calls from concerned parents, Simi Valley school officials have 
decided to form two safety committees instead of one following the slaying of a 
14-year-old junior high school student last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will form one task force to address security concerns at Valley 
View Junior High, where Chad Hubbard was stabbed to death, and another panel to 
consider districtwide safety issues ranging from emergency plans for future 
earthquakes to precautions against student violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, school officials had announced plans to form only one safety 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just became clear to us from the number of responses we were getting that 
there were lots of people interested and one districtwide task force would not 
be adequate," said Leslie Crunelle, director of secondary education, who will 
help lead the Valley View safety committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Simi Valley police said Monday an officer had, by 
coincidence, searched the suspect in the stabbing, 13-year-old Phillip 
Hernandez, in a graffiti investigation prior to the Feb. 1 killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers failed to find spray paint or other graffiti utensils on Hernandez. 
Nor did they find the three-inch folding knife that the boy is suspected of 
using that afternoon on Hubbard.  
</P>
<P>
 Police say they believe the boy may have given the knife to someone else prior 
to the search. 
</P>
<P>
 As police continue their investigation into the killing, school officials are 
scrambling to cope with community concerns about the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they received about 30 calls by midmorning Monday from people 
wanting to serve on a safety committee. The number of applicants is expected to 
increase to 50 by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District will pick 20 to 30 parents, school 
staff, community residents and students, and at least one police officer to 
serve on the Valley View committee, Crunelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel will consider ways to boost security and discipline at Valley View, 
which may range from increasing parent involvement on campus to enacting a 
stringent dress code, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the districtwide panel, called the Safety Task Force, will have 
35 to 45 members, representing many sectors of the community, said Director of 
Elementary Education Ann Eklund, who will head the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides parents, students and school staff, the larger task force will include 
police, fire officials and representatives from agencies that serve children, 
such as the local park district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to look at safety in a much larger concept than just violence in the 
schools," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley school officials had been planning since last spring to form a 
safety task force, Eklund said, but the killing at Valley View in addition to 
the recent earthquake speeded the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley schools suffered more damage from the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake than any others in Ventura County. Three weeks after the quake, Simi 
Valley High remains closed for repairs, with its students attending Royal High 
in the afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 School officials want to review emergency plans for how they would deal with a 
quake that occurred during school hours, Eklund said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people want to make sure their schools are safe," she said. "You 
always, after any kind of disaster, you want to go back and debrief." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force will probably be limited to about 45 people, but the district 
will also appoint separate subcommittees to look into specific issues such as 
earthquake preparedness, traffic safety at schools, discipline and dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The districtwide safety task force will hold its first meeting on Feb. 16 from 
5 p.m. to 7 p.m., probably at the district offices, Eklund said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley View committee will convene some time within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the police investigation, Valley View students have told police they saw 
Hernandez carrying a knife in his shoe prior to last week's stabbing, Simi 
Valley Police Detective Sgt. Andy McCluskey said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But some people interviewed have also indicated that the boy did not have the 
knife earlier in the day when he reported to the school office, where he was 
searched by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like he did not, that he had passed it off to someone," McCluskey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Mike King said Hernandez was one of about seven students at 
various schools whom officers searched last Tuesday after receiving reports 
that the youths had been involved in tagging. In such searches, officers check 
lockers and ask students to empty pockets and backpacks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews with students, investigators believe Hernandez had carried 
knives to school in the past, McCluskey said. They have uncovered no evidence 
that he was planning to stab the victim when he allegedly brought the knife 
last week.

 Two Westlake High School students arrested last week on charges of assault and 
attempted murder after a brawl that left three classmates with gunshot wounds 
may be prosecuted as adults, a deputy district attorney said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John Cardoza said he is considering a charge of attempted 
murder against one of the youths, a 17-year-old Thousand Oaks resident who is 
accused of shooting into a crowd of classmates and wounding three boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza said he also plans to file a charge of assault with a deadly weapon 
against the other boy, a 16-year-old from Thousand Oaks who was to have engaged 
in a fistfight last Thursday with a classmate in front of a crowd of fellow 
Westlake High students. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the younger boy attacked another youth with a baseball bat or 
piece of wood after piling out of a car with a group of teen-agers who 
announced, "We're the Asian Mafia!" and attacked the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Two boys suffered minor gunshot wounds, but a third, David Behling, a junior 
year football player, was hit by a bullet in the neck that fractured his skull. 
Behling remained hospitalized at Westlake Medical Center on Monday evening, 
where he is listed in satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The two suspects in the attack -- both Asian Americans -- are scheduled to be 
arraigned Wednesday morning in Ventura County Juvenile Court, and could be 
charged as adults, Cardoza said. "That is being contemplated at this point, but 
nothing's definite," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sheriff's detectives are looking for two other youths, one from 
Thousand Oaks and one from the Los Angeles area, who may have been involved in 
the attack, said Sgt. David Paige. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since Friday night, things really haven't changed," Paige said. "There's 
two people we really want to talk to. . . . We don't know if they're suspects 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paige said detectives have confirmed that the Asian Mafia is the name of a Los 
Angeles gang. But they have no proof whether the attackers actually were gang 
members or merely claimed to be, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County detectives are working with detectives from the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department to get more information on the incident in Los 
Angeles County, including the unincorporated communities around Torrance, Paige 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake High School has been closed since Friday because of a semester break 
and Staff Development Day, but students will return to the campus this morning 
for the first time since the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the violence that marked the end of the first semester Thursday, the 
school will not post additional security guards on campus today. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Richard W. Simpson said the school needs no additional 
security because "the situation that took place last Thursday did not take 
place on campus. It was after school, away from school." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, students will be greeted early in the day by a message from Westlake 
Principal Curt Luft, broadcast throughout the school, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The message will emphasize that students should report planned fights or 
confrontations to school officials, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Westlake High students knew about the fight between junior Curtis Simmons 
and a sophomore student planned for after school at North Ranch Park, Simpson 
said. Luft will stress to students that they do their classmates a favor when 
they report planned fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an awful lot of students who knew that the incident was going to take 
place and didn't let adults know that," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake High officials have already suspended three students involved in 
Thursday's melee, including the two arrested Friday, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, Simpson will appear before the Thousand Oaks City Council to explain 
the district's plans for combatting school violence, which range from expelling 
students who carry weapons to restricting the number of high school students 
who leave campus during lunch.

CITY TO WEIGH MEANS TO FINANCE ARTS PLAZA; THOUSAND OAKS: LEADERS GRAPPLE WITH 
$13-MILLION SHORTFALL IN CONSTRUCTION BUDGET. STRATEGIES MIGHT INCLUDE TAKING 
OUT LOANS, ISSUING BONDS AND SHUFFLING FUNDS AMONG MUNICIPAL ACCOUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scrambling to cover a more than $13-million shortfall in the Civic Arts Plaza 
construction budget, Thousand Oaks leaders tonight will consider taking out 
loans, issuing bonds and shuffling money among various city accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Director Robert Biery has recommended a number of actions to generate 
enough cash to finish paying construction bills on the long-awaited performing 
arts center and government headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider, for instance, shifting $1.1 million from the 
affordable-housing fund to the construction budget. That money would pay for 
office space for the two staff members who work on housing issues, Biery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two staffers draw their salaries from the Redevelopment Agency, 
which supports the affordable-housing fund, Thousand Oaks has never before 
dipped into that account to subsidize city office space. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah said she disapproved of paying for employees' cubicles with 
money earmarked for developing low-cost housing and assisting first-time home 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think that's appropriate," Zeanah said. "That's affordable-housing 
money and it should not be used for construction of a new city hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Assistant Counsel Daniel Murphy, who has been working with the 
Thousand Oaks Redevelopment Agency, said he "would be interested in looking to 
see if they're really using their (affordable-housing) set-aside 
appropriately." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have complained in the past that the Redevelopment Agency, 
which is required by law to set aside 20% of its funds for affordable housing, 
spends too much of its money making cosmetic changes rather than fulfilling its 
stated goal of eradicating blight. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Manager Grant Brimhall defended the recommendation to withdraw money 
from the affordable-housing account for office space, arguing that "everything 
ought to pay its own way." The decision not to charge the affordable-housing 
fund for employee cubicles in Thousand Oaks' past and present city halls "was 
an oversight," Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The allocation from the affordable-housing fund, however controversial, is 
designed to fill just a small chunk of the gaping hole in the Civic Arts Plaza 
financing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the largest shortfall came about because the original budget counted on 
at least $11 million from the sale of the former city hall at 401 Hillcrest 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 That property remains unsold, and the council has decided to hold on to it for 
a few years until the sagging real estate market picks up. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members express confidence that they will eventually find a buyer for 
the 30-acre, oak-studded hilltop parcel. But in the interim, they said they 
need the $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To fill that immediate need, Biery has recommended shuffling millions of 
dollars between various city accounts and taking out loans or issuing 
certificates of participation, which are similar to city bonds. Either course 
of action would add to Thousand Oaks' substantial debt -- a prospect that 
alarms Zeanah and her political ally, Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, nearly 10% of the city's General Fund goes to repay, with interest, 
the certificates of participation issued to fund construction of the senior and 
teen-ager centers, the Newbury Park Branch Library, the park behind the main 
library and the East Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, neighboring Simi Valley boasts a debt-free General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ventura this year allocated about 7.5% of its General Fund to pay 
off debts, mainly certificates of participation issued to renovate a golf 
course, refurbish a fire station and build new storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks' expenditures on debt service are higher than some 
other Ventura County cities, Biery said devoting 10% of the General Fund to 
debt service is "reasonable" and "not exorbitant." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will retire a substantial chunk of its debt in 2001, when payments on 
the East Valley Sheriff's Station are scheduled to end, Biery said. Any debt 
incurred to fund the Civic Arts Plaza would also be short-lived, paid off as 
soon as the Hillcrest Drive property is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is still in a good, sound financial position," Councilwoman Judy 
Lazar agreed. "I'm sure we would have no problem issuing bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 Biery promised to try to structure the bond issue so debt payments would not 
siphon money from city services. Still, some members of the council remained 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing out that Thousand Oaks allocates just 13.5% of its General Fund 
budget for public safety and nearly 10% for debt service, Zukowski said: "The 
priorities are skewed. We've lost our perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 And Zeanah, long a critic of the Civic Arts Plaza's financing plan, added: "I 
am concerned that we have moved away from being a pay-as-you-go city and are 
going further and further and further into debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of seeking loans or issuing bonds, Zeanah would prefer to pay the 
final eight months of Civic Arts Plaza construction bills by borrowing from 
various city accounts. Unable to identify which funds would be the best to tap, 
Zeanah said she would ask for a report from the finance director. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said Biery's preliminary report, contained in a three-page memo to the 
council, did not satisfy her because it does not include specifics on paying 
the full construction tab without borrowing more money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Biery recommended that the council shift millions of dollars from 
nine city accounts to cover part of the construction costs, in addition to 
securing $11 million through bonds or loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial funding plan, for instance, counted on $2 million from the Conejo 
Recreation and Park District, in exchange for offices in the complex as the 
district's new administrative headquarters. But parks officials last year 
decided against the costly move -- leaving the city with 10,000 square feet of 
unleased office space and a substantial shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up that gap, Biery is recommending that the city transfer more than $2 
million from its insurance fund, which covers small claims for liability and 
workers' compensation cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Characterizing the transfer as a loan, Biery said he considers the shuffle a 
sound investment. The insurance fund will be paid back -- with interest -- when 
the city finally finds a tenant for that space, Biery said.  
</P>
<P>
 In purchasing the space originally designated for the park district, the city 
will charge itself $200 per square foot. In contrast, Biery is recommending 
that the Redevelopment Agency's affordable-housing account pay more than 10 
times that amount -- about $2,200 per square foot -- for office space. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing fund's two full-time workers will each occupy a standard office, 
which covers roughly 100 square feet, project manager Ed Johnduff said. Even 
accounting for part-time personnel, total space requirements would be just 500 
square feet. For that, the city is prepared to pay $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's in there, gold paneling?" Assistant County Counsel Murphy asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Biery explained the difference between the rates by noting that the 
affordable-housing staff will be renting finished office space, with access to 
City Hall bathrooms, parking, common space and other amenities. The park 
district space is unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo, calling the housing expenditure reasonable, said, 
"You can't compare these kind of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah and Zukowski, however, said the discrepancy illuminates what they see 
as a desperate scramble to plug funding holes. "The figures speak for 
themselves," Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this emphasizes that this very broad-stroke financial plan needs 
in-depth evaluation and independent assessment," Zukowski said. "This sketchy 
transfer of funds and allocation from new sources is not appropriate when it 
comes to public funds."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: JOB PROGRAM WILL AID QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County residents who lost their jobs because of the Jan. 17 earthquake 
will be eligible to work on repairing public facilities in a special federal 
job program, the Jobs Training Policy Council announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Labor has released an initial $3.1-million grant for 
Southern California workers who lost their livelihoods because their workplaces 
were destroyed or businesses harmed, said Aram Saroyan, a jobs council 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that amount, Ventura County will receive slightly less than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A subsequent request for $28 million will be submitted by state employment 
officials within weeks, with $1.3 million targeted for Ventura County, Saroyan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, which is independent of other disaster aid being considered at the 
federal level, will provide employment to as many as 150 people in a variety of 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Saroyan said each job created under the program should help more than a single 
employee, as recovering businesses recall their work force. "Many businesses 
will be back on their feet, reopen and the people who were forced out of work 
will return," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs will range from those in the maintenance and clerical fields to building 
trades and technical support. 
</P>
<P>
 Employment officials say that more than 1,000 of the estimated 10,000 jobs 
lost directly and indirectly because of the January's earthquake were in 
Ventura County. Three times the usual number of claims were filed at the state 
unemployment office in Simi Valley during the two weeks following the quake, 
said office manager Larry Kennedy.  
</P>
<P>
 Workers seeking jobs under the program can apply at state unemployment offices 
in Simi Valley, Oxnard or Ventura. PATRICK McCARTNEY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BOARD OF EDUCATION MAY MEET MORE OFTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Education on Wednesday will consider whether to 
routinely schedule two meetings a month instead of one. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Wendy Larner has asked the five-member board to plan to meet twice 
monthly for at least the next year, a change that she said is necessary for the 
board to complete all of its work. 
</P>
<P>
 The county board oversees 18 schools for troubled youths and special-education 
students and also helps disseminate information from the state Department of 
Education to local school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The five trustees have a regularly scheduled meeting at 3 p.m. on the last 
Monday of every month at the county superintendent of schools office.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the past year, board members have become so bogged down with an 
internal review of their policies that they often have to meet a second time 
later in the month to catch up on routine business, Larner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the second meetings have been held at different days and times, making it 
difficult for trustees to set their schedules in advance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets very difficult to plan one's personal schedule," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If board members double the number of regularly scheduled meetings for the 
next year, Larner said, they may be able to catch up enough on their work to 
return to meeting only once a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members each receive a stipend of $50 per meeting, with a limit of $200 
per trustee per month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board meeting Wednesday will be held at 5 p.m. at the James F. Cowan 
Conference Center, 550 Airport Way, Camarillo Airport. MAIA DAVIS

<P>
 Ronald Stark and J. Paul Fredericks, both members of the Oak Park Municipal 
Advisory Council, said Monday they are bowing out of the race for the Ventura 
County supervisorial seat being vacated by Maria VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to try it," said Stark, who along with Fredericks had taken out 
nomination papers to run."But I just don't think it's realistic. . . . I would 
feel bad to have people contribute to a campaign that I know had no chance of 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Stark said he will support Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo in the June 
7 election. Fredericks said he will probably do the same. Both said they plan 
to consult with Schillo about his candidacy later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Schillo, three candidates remain in the race for the 
supervisorial seat representing the Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. They are 
former Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, taxpayer advocate H. Jere 
Robings and corrections officer David Goodman. CARLOS V. LOZANO

CAMARILLO LEADERS WILL RECONSIDER THEATER COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council on Wednesday night will reconsider a controversial 
proposal to build an 11-screen United Artists theater complex near Camino Ruiz 
and Verdugo Way. 
</P>
<P>
 During its Jan. 12 meeting, the council tentatively approved the 2,629-seat 
complex but asked the city's Planning Commission to review city-imposed 
stipulations about parking at the site.The stipulations are among 135 
conditions for city approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Pardee Construction Co., the proposal's developer, object to the 
parking requirement. They say it would unfairly allow the city to regulate the 
theater's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning staff said they will offer members of the council a compromise 
that would allow the city to monitor parking conditions at the theater and 
refer problems to the Planning Commission for review. However, the commission 
would not be allowed to reduce the number of screens or seats at the complex to 
solve a parking problem. Instead, it would have to refer problems to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 During the January meeting, the council heard several hours of testimony from 
residents living nearby who argued that the proposal would generate too much 
light and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners, residents of the Fairfield II housing tract, have retained an 
attorney to represent them at Wednesday's meeting and have threatened to sue 
the city should the council approve the theater project. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting starts at 5 p.m. at City Hall, 601 Carmen Dr. J.E. MITCHELL

 Four men were stabbed on Cooper Road at McKinley Avenue in the east Oxnard 
neighborhood of La Colonia Monday evening in what police said was an apparent 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 The four Spanish-speaking victims appeared to be laborers and not associated 
with any gang, said Oxnard Police Sgt. Tim Combs. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the stabbing victims were hospitalized, and two were reported in 
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the victims were rushed to Ventura County Medical Center, where a 
nursing supervisor said one was in guarded condition and the other in serious 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 A 23-year-old man taken to Pleasant Valley Hospital was reported in stable 
condition with three stab wounds but no major loss of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth victim was transported to St. John's Regional Medical Center and 
underwent surgery for abdominal wounds. A nursing supervisor said his condition 
was serious. 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbings were reported to police around 7:30 p.m., but no suspects were 
immediately identified. An investigation is continuing, Combs said. PATRICK

 Pushing forward with plans to get disaster aid for earthquake-damaged 
buildings, the Simi Valley City Council on Monday agreed to pick up a small 
local share of a federal program to remount hundreds of toppled mobile homes 
back onto their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 In another effort to get on with rebuilding the city, the council approved a 
list of damaged public properties and decided to forward the list to state and 
federal agencies as part of the city's application for disaster-relief funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The city included the civic center complex, police station, buckled streets, 
broken sewer lines and idled components of the city's water system in the 
22-item list to be sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the 
state Office of Emergency Services for disaster relief funds. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members told the council they have not determined the total cost of 
the damage, but estimated that repairs to City Hall would cost $45,000 and the 
police station as much as $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to private property in the city is estimated at $60.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also waived a $21 city fee usually required for repairing damaged 
buildings. It was another way, council members said, to help residents and 
businesses get on with rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 To help the city's mobile home parks, the council agreed to participate in a 
program that promises to pay at least $1,500 per coach to repair damaged 
foundations and hoist fallen trailers back onto their platforms. City officials 
said coach repairs are estimated to range between $800 and $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA will pay 90% of the cost, the state Office of Emergency Services will 
pick up 7.5% and the city will fund the remaining 2.5% with Community 
Development Block Grants, Deputy City Manager Laura Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the state office of Housing and Community Development agreed to 
administer the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton praised the plan. "This is a great solution," Stratton 
said. "It's time to get these people back into their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 quake devastated Simi Valley's six mobile home parks, knocking 
nearly two thirds of the city's 791 mobile homes off their foundations. SARA

<P>
 Mark Boos Benhard, who plans to announce his candidacy for the congressional 
seat representing Thousand Oaks next week, will hold a voter open-house meeting 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are invited to attend the 8 p.m. meeting at the home of Dr. Paul and 
Teri Reisser at 1885 Montgomery Road.Those interested should call (805) 
379-4520 or (818) 707-0264. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard, 29, of Agoura, is one of three Republicans expected to battle for the 
nomination to oppose Democratic Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, whose 24th District 
includes Malibu and part of the San Fernando Valley. Benhard, who has already 
opened a campaign office in Woodland Hills, said he plans to formally announce 
his candidacy within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hammer, a Newbury Park banking consultant, is the only officially 
declared Republican candidate in the congressional race. Richard Sybert, a 
former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, is also expected to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no Democratic candidates have stepped forward to challenge Beilenson, 
who is seeking his 10th term in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard said he plans to hold a series of open house meetings over the next 
several months to discuss his campaign to fight crime and reduce taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already set up 50 house meetings," he said. "We hope to hold 100. It's 
a way of taking our message directly to the public." CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; ADVENTISTS' PLANS FOR MALL TO BE 
STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council will hold a study session March 8 on a 
Seventh-day Adventist Church development proposal, giving residents a sneak 
peak at plans for a commercial center on one of the city's largest undeveloped 
parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 The church has already filed papers requesting a zoning change for part of its 
vast land holding in the hills of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Stifled by the current zoning -- which would allow only institutional 
buildings such as a church or school on the site -- the project managers are 
seeking permission to build a sprawling shopping mall on part of the 458-acre 
parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the retail center would cover 85 acres -- making it nearly as big 
as The Oaks mall -- and would include a Target store and other department 
stores. A movie theater and food court also might be built on the property, 
which abuts Rancho Conejo Industrial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall would replace an equestrian center, senior citizen housing and a 
private school located on a portion of the church property. Those facilities 
would be relocated to a now-undeveloped slice of church property. 
</P>
<P>
 Public hearings on the project will begin in late spring or early summer, 
planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski voted against holding the 
study session in March. Instead, they suggested that an informal informational 
meeting would work best in April, when reports on the project's economic and 
environmental impacts would be ready for public analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 But a majority voted to hold the study session March 8 so that residents can 
"see information about the project sooner rather than later," Councilwoman Judy 
Lazar said. STEPHANIE SIMON

MISGUIDED TO FIRMER GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the article in Valley Business on Feb. 1 that "Some buyers from the 
San Fernando Valley seek firmer ground in Antelope Valley." . . . The article 
seems to say the people wanting to move there think that Palmdale is 
seismically safer than the San Fernando Valley.This seems ignorant because most 
of the new houses in Palmdale are within a mile or two of the San Andreas 
Fault. Even though the houses there may be built better, people are going to be 
shaken a lot more when that fault moves. I think it's because of what we have 
built over and around us that may fall on, or explode next to us, that makes 
many people fearful of earthquakes (myself included) and want to move away from 
them. But I would not move next to the largest fault in California.

TOPANGA PLAZA IS OPEN, THANK YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading the article "Promenade Mall Beats Its Rival to the Punch" on 
Jan. 25, I wonder if you really understand what quake recovery in the Valley is 
all about. Is it really about one business getting a jump-start on its 
competitor? I don't think so. Rather, I believe it's about all businesses and 
residents working together to restore this community and help it regain the 
vitality and synergy that gives all of us the opportunity to prosper. It's also 
about businesses proceeding cautiously and responsibly to ascertain that their 
structures are safe for customers and employees before they reopen their doors. 
</P>
<P>
 You erroneously reported that the Promenade came out of the earthquake in much 
better shape than Topanga Plaza, and that Topanga Plaza was likely to remain 
closed for several weeks. The facts are that Topanga Plaza, which is now open, 
suffered only superficial damage to the main mall area and, thanks to seismic 
upgrading work that was done during our renovation in 1992, our skylights came 
through the quake without so much as a crack. 
</P>
<P>
 As Topanga Plaza is more than twice the size of the Promenade, it is logical 
to expect cleanup and reopening preparations to take longer. We at Topanga 
Plaza are pleased that the Promenade was able to reopen their center relatively 
quickly after the quake. For us it is a sign that our community is emerging 
from the devastation. We expect that for the same reason, our friends at the 
Promenade will be equally pleased to see our center reopen. For the past 21 
years there has been room in the Warner Center community for two shopping 
centers and this community will most likely continue to support both Topanga 
Plaza and the Promenade.

3 INCHES OF RAIN DUE IN STRONGEST STORM OF WINTER; WEATHER: STEADY DOWNPOUR HAS 
CAUSED NO SERIOUS HILLSIDE EROSION. BUT OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SLIDES IN 
FIRE-SCORCHED AREAS IF SHOWERS INTENSIFY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The most potent storm of the season was expected to drop up to three inches of 
rain in some areas of the county and blanket mountainous areas above 4,000 feet 
with up to two feet of snow before skies clear later today. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rain, which fell steadily through Sunday night and Monday at a pace of 
less than a quarter-inch per hour, sank into the ground and did not cause major 
hillside erosion, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the rain continues at the same pace, then subsides for at least three days 
as expected, county Public Works officials do not anticipate problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the rainfall intensifies, officials and residents are concerned about 
potential mud and debris slides in areas where the October fires scorched 
hillsides above residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Boone, whose Deer Valley Avenue house sits at the foot of a still 
charred and barren hill in Newbury Park, said she had a foot of mud in her home 
after rains in December. Now, she said, the back of her house is protected with 
sandbags as she watches the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had the slightest bit of a problem so far, but I was up every hour 
looking at the window," she said. "We're still very nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 John Philpott, who lives on Erinlea Avenue in Newbury Park, said he was 
grateful that the rain has been gentle. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, we've been real lucky with the rain being light," he said. "It's been 
quite a year. We've gone through the fire, the earthquake and now, here come 
the rains." 
</P>
<P>
 Locally heavy showers and hail were expected in some areas Monday night, with 
possible thunderstorms in the mountains. But today, scattered showers in the 
morning were forecast to give way to clearing skies in the afternoon, said 
National Weather Service meteorologist Debra Rominger. 
</P>
<P>
 Gusty winds up to 30 m.p.h. were expected through the week, but no rain is 
forecast before Friday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheri Klittich, soil conservationist for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service 
office in Somis, said the agency has been applying a mixture of mulch, seed and 
a glue-like substance to the burned hillsides in an attempt to create a ground 
cover of vegetation to prevent mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But up until now, she said, there has not been enough rain for the seeds to 
take root, and the cover has not returned. But she said the mulch will help 
slow any runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The areas without vegetation or mulch could be vulnerable to a slide once the 
ground is saturated. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the burn, you get a multiplier effect," she said. "A storm that might 
happen only every 10 years would act like a 100-year event and the impacts 
could increase dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the October fires, including the Green Meadow fire in Thousand Oaks and 
the Steckle fire above Santa Paula, the Department of Public Works has begun 
construction on three catch basins -- graded areas with earth dams designed to 
trap silt and debris and minimize mudslide problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the basins built in canyons above Santa Paula are incomplete but are 
nevertheless expected to operate well enough to contain any mud flow, said 
Dolores Taylor, division engineer for Ventura County Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 But the third basin being built in Newbury Park got a later start and would 
probably offer little protection, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the burn area is underlined by bedrock, so there is just the surface 
soil that can come off there," Taylor said. She said other areas of concern are 
places where the mountains have been graded, and that "compacted soil can get 
saturated and start moving." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Thousand Oaks has built up banks of gravel in the canyons above 
the Deer Ridge area that burned during the fire. The banks are designed to 
allow the water to go through, while cutting down the flow of silt and mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had any problems yet," said Gil Pableo, city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, rain may have settled into some of the cracks in the earth 
created by the Jan. 17 earthquake, said Michael Kuhn, senior planner for the 
city. That could cause additional settling of the ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is some concern that the earthquake may have left some canyon areas 
unstable, but those areas are not populated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi's planned Whiteface development, which would include 1,600 homes between 
Tapo and Sand canyons, could be an area of concern, so the developer has been 
instructed to have a geologist investigate the stability of the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, rain delayed demolition of the Fillmore Hotel and the city's 
Mason's Building, but demolition was expected to resume as soon as the rain let 
up. Crews used sandbags to shore up a domed tent that was erected to house 
displaced merchants after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works crews were out Monday patrolling streets and drainage ditches to 
make sure that county roads were kept free of rocks and flooding. Road 
maintenance engineer Loren Blair said the roads were clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're keeping an eye on the Yerba Buena area because there is not a lot of 
vegetation left up there to stop runoff." But crews were not expected to be 
needed through the night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain forced crews cleaning up an oil spill in the Santa Clara River east 
of Piru to postpone much of their work. Only a few hand crews and three vacuum 
trucks were at work on Monday cleaning up oil that spilled from a ruptured 
pipeline during the earthquake. More than 400 people were working on the 
cleanup last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Schlichting, a spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Game, 
now estimates the spill at 193,494 gallons, and said it is about 25% cleaned 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain could spread the remaining oil downstream if river runoff breaches 
the berms built up to contain the spill, Schlichting said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if we got a really heavy rain, it could actually help wash it down the 
river and out to sea," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, crews finished the cleanup at McGrath Lake, where another ruptured 
pipeline that was discovered on Christmas Day spilled 84,000 gallons into the 
lake, the surrounding wetlands and creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Togstad, who supervised the cleanup for Fish and Game's Office of Oil 
Spill Prevention and Response, said the official declaration will come after 
state parks officials sign off on the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Test results showed that even less oil than expected remained at the lake 
bottom, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like we got the vast majority of that oil," Togstad said. "But we 
dug up a lot of earth and we removed a lot of soil."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY PUSHES FOR KEYS DREDGING SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura city officials are scheduled to hold a town hall meeting tonight in an 
effort to persuade Ventura Keys homeowners to settle lawsuits against the city 
over dredging bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is set for 7:30 p.m. at the Poinsettia Pavilion in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Keys residents have fought the city for years over who should pay for 
removing the silt and debris that builds up in their back-yard canals connected 
to the Ventura Harbor. A group of Keys property owners lost a lawsuit last year 
that challenged the city's authority to assess homeowners extra taxes to pay 
for dredging their canals. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a settlement proposal, city officials want Keys homeowners to drop other 
pending lawsuits that contend the city and county governments and the Ventura 
Port District are responsible for polluting the Keys and should pay the cleanup 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the city, along with county and Port District officials, 
circulated a settlement proposal negotiated between city leaders and two 
representatives of Keys residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But a majority of the Keys homeowners failed to meet the deadline to reject or 
approve the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson and Keys negotiators have since reworked the 
settlement proposal and sent out a revised document Saturday. The new 
settlement proposal, which must be ratified by March 5, clarifies some points, 
but is not significantly different from the original document. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would reduce dredging fees assessed per household from $1,733 a 
year to $685. After that, the city could increase the annual tax by $64 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some residents applaud the reduced fees, others balk at the condition 
not to sue over future pollution of their back-yard canals. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said that this may be the last settlement offer. "This is pretty much 
it," Carson said. "This is yes or no, or do you want to go to court?" PEGGY Y.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; TOWER OPPONENTS TO URGE COUNCIL TO JOIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council tonight will be asked to join Ventura County supervisors 
and state representatives in opposing a radar weather tower atop Sulphur 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution urges the federal government to conduct further environmental 
studies before turning on the weather-tracking station that emits low levels of 
radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Ojai is going to support the opposition to the radar tower," 
Councilwoman Nina V. Shelley said. "My major objection is that the federal 
government did not follow the same procedures that we're all required to 
follow." 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Coalition of Ojai recently sued the federal government for 
what the group said was inadequate notice given to residents on constructing 
the tower and a failure to properly study the impact of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the group has succeeded in garnering support from the Ventura County 
Board of Supervisors, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-Calif.) and others in its fight against the microwave radar 
station. But the coalition suffered a major setback Friday, when a federal 
judge refused to grant a preliminary injunction preventing the National Weather 
Service from switching the tower on later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the coalition and two residents who brought the suit said Friday 
they expect to file an appeal with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But actor Larry Hagman, one of two residents named as plaintiffs in the 
federal court case, said Monday he was not certain the appeal would go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is scheduled to begin testing the radar tower before the end of 
the week, according to Jerry McDuffie, who runs the Oxnard office of the 
National Weather Service. JEFF McDONALD

 A fire caused by an electric blanket nearly destroyed a Ventura house Monday 
afternoon, but none of the six people at home were injured, said a spokesman 
for the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, located at 5382 Norway Drive, was engulfed in flames within seconds 
after a short circuit occurred in one of the bedroom's electrical blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which was put out within 25 minutes, caused more than $35,000 in 
damage and left the house uninhabitable, officials said. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; OWNER OF RV PARK FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The corporation that owns the Ventura Beach RV Resort has filed for protection 
from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U. S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Hubbard, who manages the corporation, said Hubbard Family Corp. filed 
for bankruptcy protection Jan. 6.She declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Filing Chapter 11 gives a company a chance to reorganize its finances with the 
goal of emerging from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members said the RV park will continue to operate as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-acre park, which sits at the mouth of the Ventura River, was flooded by 
storms two years ago. Dozens of recreational vehicles were damaged or destroyed 
because park visitors were not evacuated in time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the storms, Hubbard paid the county Flood Control District 
$5,000 for installing a rain and stream gauge along the river, and $1,800 for 
new topographic maps of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But five months after the agreement was signed, county officials terminated 
the pact, citing liability concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard is negotiating with city officials to share weather information from a 
private contractor. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; HEAD OF RIGHTS GROUP ALLEGES HATE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armando Garcia, the chairman of an immigrant advocacy group called the 
Coalition for Immigrant Rights, reported that he was beaten and choked at his 
Oxnard office on Saturday after asking a man to pay for an employment form. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday his organization issued a press release calling Garcia's beating a 
hate crime, but Oxnard Police Department officials disagreed Monday, saying 
there is no evidence that the attack was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to the officers, read the report, and I can't see anything that 
would indicate that this is a hate crime," Assistant Police Chief Jim Latimer 
said. "It's all a mystery to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Coalition for Immigrant Rights said Garcia, who has 
recently given a series of talks supporting more liberal immigration laws, has 
received increasingly threatening phone calls and letters.  
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Garcia said he received a call from a man who needed a form to 
hire foreign nationals to work at his company. When the man arrived, he asked 
specifically for Garcia.  
</P>
<P>
 Garcia told police that, after some confusion about what he wanted, the man 
was asked to pay for the form. He immediately yelled abuse at Garcia, 
denigrating his Mexican heritage, according to a police report. When Garcia 
asked the man to leave, he was attacked, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived, they said, there was no mention that any racial comments 
were made during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply cursing and using a racial epithet does not make it a hate crime," 
Latimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Latimer also said Garcia explicitly told officers he did not want to file 
charges against his assailant, telling police he was instead considering a 
lawsuit against the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, however, Garcia's group issued a press release saying the attack 
was racially motivated and that Oxnard police were not taking the case 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Armando has been outspoken for some time," said Fred Pierce, spokesman for 
Garcia. "It's seems unlikely that Armando just ran into this white guy who was 
having a bad day. I don't think it was a coincidence, and the police could at 
least conduct an investigation." SCOTT HADLY

REGIONAL EARNINGS: AMGEN'S PROFIT FALLS 32% IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amgen Inc. said its fourth-quarter profit fell 32% to $91.1 million from the 
$133.8 million the Thousand Oaks biotechnology concern earned a year earlier, 
when it received a large legal award.  
</P>
<P>
 Revenue in the three months ended Dec. 31 climbed 19% to $365.6 million from 
$308.2 million, spurred by sales of Amgen's two main products, Epogen and 
Neupogen.The results, slightly less than some Wall Street estimates, sent 
Amgen's stock tumbling $1.75 a share to $47 when the news hit the market last 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen has only two drugs on the market: Sales of Epogen, which stimulates the 
production of red blood cells in kidney-dialysis patients, climbed 18% in the 
quarter to $160.4 million, and sales of Neupogen, used to produce 
infection-fighting white blood cells in cancer patients, rose 16% in the latest 
three months over the same period last year to $186.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year, Amgen posted a record profit of $383.3 million, up 7% from 
$357.6 million in 1992, ahead of some analysts' estimates. For 1993, revenue 
rose 26% to $1.4 billion from $1.1 billion a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 results included a $50.9-million gain from a legal award.  
</P>
<P>
 Epogen sales for all of 1993 rose 16% to $586.9 million, while Neupogen's 
sales increased 32% to $719.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen also announced a marketing push into the People's Republic of China, 
including recently opened offices in Beijing and Guangzhou. A third office will 
open in Shanghai by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Epogen was approved for sale in China in 1992, when Amgen also established 
Amgen Greater China Limited, based in Hong Kong. Neupogen was approved for sale 
in China last summer.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HARMAN'S 2ND-QUARTER PROFIT MORE THAN DOUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harman International Industries, a Northridge-based maker of audio speaker 
systems, said its fiscal second-quarter profit more than doubled from a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company posted a profit of $6.8 million, up 
from $3.3 million in the same quarter a year earlier.Sales in the latest 
quarter surged 26% to $222.7 million from $177.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months ended Dec. 31, Harman posted a profit of $7.86 million, up 
300% from earnings of $1.97 million in the same period a year earlier. 
Six-month sales climbed 20% to $386.4 million from $322.1 million. The company 
said the increase reflects its recent acquisition of AKG as well as strong 
performances in its automotive, consumer and professional group sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman also said the company's manufacturing plant in Northridge, despite 
being near the Jan. 17 earthquake's epicenter, did not sustain significant 
damage and was in full operation.

OFFICE VACANCY RATE EXPECTED TO FALL BY HALF; LEASING: AS EARTHQUAKE-DISPLACED 
COMPANIES SCRAMBLE FOR NEW SPACE, AGENTS EXPECT THE VALLEY'S OFFICE RATE TO 
PLUNGE TO 7% BY SUMMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leasing agents expect the San Fernando Valley's office vacancy rate, 
alreadythe lowest in Los Angeles County, to fall by half to as low as 7% before 
summer as firms scramble to find temporary quarters to replace offices damaged 
or destroyed in last month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's office vacancy rate was 14.5% in the fourth quarter and 15.7% in 
the fourth quarter of 1992, according to Grubb & Ellis Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although there is a tremendous short-term need for office space in the 
Valley, we haven't seen a rise in the cost of rent. But as the dust settles and 
the vacancy rate goes down in a few months, the cost of the remaining space 
will start to creep up," said Seth Dudley, a leasing agent with Julien J. 
Studley Inc. in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Zugsmith, president of Zugsmith-Thind in Burbank, said there is a rush of 
"tenants looking for temporary office space for periods of as short as one 
month and as long as two years." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the early winners in the search for new office space is the Conejo 
Valley, which includes Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks. More than 500,000 square 
feet of previously vacant office space were rented in the area in the two weeks 
following the Jan. 17 quake, according to the Conejo Valley Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Zugsmith said the demand for temporary office space caused by the quake will 
have a short-term impact on the office leasing market in the San Fernando 
Valley by cutting the vacancy rate by as much as half. He expects the office 
vacancy rate to hit single digits in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "But long-term, my sense is that the quake will have little impact overall. 
Many of these temporary leases will wash out in the next month to two years, 
when tenants displaced by the earthquake begin moving back to their repaired or 
rebuilt buildings," Zugsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, landlords have up to 120 days after the earthquake to locate and 
identify damage suffered by their office buildings. After that, they have up to 
two years to repair or reconstruct a building. In many cases, tenants are bound 
by lease agreements to reoccupy a building after it is repaired or rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Stevens, partner in the leasing firm Beitler Commercial Realty, sees a 
bitter irony in the position that his company finds itself now as a result of 
the quake. Normally, Beitler would be busy negotiating office leases for 
prospective tenants, instead of finding one for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens' company was one of dozens of businesses displaced by the quake. 
Beitler grossed about $5 million in 1993, and it occupied 10,000 square feet of 
office space, including the penthouse suite, at the Trust Co. of the West (TCW) 
office building on Ventura Boulevard. The building and 100,000 square feet of 
office space, however, were destroyed in the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Beitler's 47 employees work out of 3,300 square feet of space at the 
Atrium Building in Encino, and Stevens said he feels fortunate to have found 
about one-third the space his business formerly occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business has been seriously impaired. About 90% of our files, not to 
mention our furniture and office equipment, are still in the TCW building," 
Stevens said. "Every other major brokerage firm in the Valley is (operating 
again) except for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Beitler is still calculating the losses the company incurred in the quake. 
Stevens, who has been with the company for nine years, said about 95% of all 
tenants who lease office space do not have earthquake insurance. Beitler is no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have insurance to cover everything else, but not for business interruption 
caused by an earthquake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivitar Corp. and Packard Bell are two San Fernando Valley companies that 
moved to the Conejo Valley when their buildings were destroyed in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell had been headquartered in Chatsworth, but when that site was 
damaged, the company leased 160,000 square feet in Westlake Village for its 
headquarters and it also leased 176,000 square feet in Camarillo as a 
distribution center for personal computers. The company, which has about 1,200 
employees, said it expected to post $1.2 billion in sales in 1993 and is the 
fourth-largest maker of IBM-compatible personal computers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley called Packard Bell's move to Westlake Village the "most noteworthy" of 
the temporary lease transactions resulting from the quake. Before the quake, 
the company had already announced plans to move its production facilities and 
administrative office to a new site. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the sites then under consideration by Packard Bell officials were 
Palmdale, Newbury Park, Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake County, Utah. Since the 
earthquake, however, the company said its plans to relocate to a permanent site 
were put on hold for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the 100,000 square feet leased by Vivitar in Newbury Park is for 
office space, said spokesman Ron Leach, who works for a public relations firm 
that represents Vivitar. The company's offices, including its headquarters in 
Chatsworth, were destroyed in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivitar, owned by Gestetner Holdings of London, has 120 employees and markets 
photographic equipment worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 For Vivitar, the quake occurred at both the best and worst possible times. It 
struck when sales of photographic equipment are traditionally slow, but also 
when the industry was preparing for its annual trade show on Feb. 17 in 
Atlanta, where manufacturers preview their latest models. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of sales, it couldn't have come at a better time for us. But we 
understand that there is no good time for a quake of this magnitude," said 
Leach. "However, the two or three weeks before the annual trade show are 
traditionally slow, because retailers are waiting to see the new product lines 
(at the trade show) before restocking their shelves." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Vivitar executives spend the month before the trade show preparing 
for the event. But because of the timing of the quake, company officials have 
spent most of their time salvaging files and office equipment and looking for a 
new facility to lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, Vivitar employees were still moving into the new facility in 
Newbury Park. "It's still very chaotic. People are trying to figure out where 
they're going to sit and where to plug in their phones," Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 While leasing agents hurry to find office space for businesses displaced by 
the quake, they are also keeping a nervous eye on Woodland Hills-based 20th 
Century Industries, which is looking for up to 700,000 square feet of new 
office space for its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance firm announced last month that it would not go through with 
plans to move to a planned Warner Ridge office site in Woodland Hills next to 
Pierce College. 20th Century could turn the office market on its head if it 
decides to move from the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the earthquake, Neil Ashley, 20th Century's chief executive, 
said the company would stay in California and relocate to a site convenient for 
its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley said he had appointed a committee to find a new site. He added that 
20th Century is no longer interested in having an office built from scratch and 
was probably going to move into an existing facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Some leasing agents said 20th Century is interested in moving into the 
Calabasas Park Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the business is waiting to see what 20th Century is going to do. 
No matter what they do, they're going to have a big impact on the Valley when 
they do it," Zugsmith said.

ANIMATION COMPANY NO LONGER IN 'TOONS; TELEVISION: DESPITE SOME SUCCESSFUL 
SHOWS, ZODIAC ENTERTAINMENT FINDS IT IS TOO SMALL TO COMPETE IN THE CARTOON 
PRODUCTION BUSINESS. IT WILL CONTINUE AS A DISTRIBUTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW HELLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Its British parent company pumped $35 million into the business over four 
years, and three of its cartoon shows made it ont U.S. television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Widget," its cartoon about an environmentally conscious alien, was 
recommended for viewing by the National Education Assn. and was sold to 100 
countries. But that was not enough to keep Zodiac Entertainment in the cartoon 
production business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Studio City-based company announced late in December that its effort to 
find a niche as an independent producer in the fiercely competitive animation 
world was over. From now on, Zodiac will only be a distributor -- of its 
existing cartoon programs, and whatever distribution rights it picks up from 
other animation firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Zodiac's once enthusiastic co-founders, Peter Keefe and Brian 
Lacey, have left the company to start a new animation venture. 
</P>
<P>
 For children, the demise of Zodiac means no more new episodes of "Widget," 
"Mr. Bogus" and "Twinkle the Dream Being." For Zodiac, it is a stark 
illustration of the perils of battling the big animation studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business is nowadays very competitive . . . and it's not a business 
Zodiac can play in," said Kevin Morrison, Zodiac's president, who remains with 
the company. "It's simply not a big enough player." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in its heyday, Zodiac was a small operation; in 1992 its revenue was only 
about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Zodiac withdrew from production only a month after its parent firm -- 
Britain's Central Independent Television -- agreed to merge with Carlton 
Communications, another U. K. entertainment concern. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morrison denied that had anything to do with Zodiac's change of course. 
"This was a business decision," he said. "It's been building over a number of 
years." According to Morrison, the business looked quite different when Zodiac 
was founded in 1989 by Central along with Keefe and Lacey, both animation 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-'80s independent American TV stations had created great demand for 
syndicated programming. With such big producers as Walt Disney Co. and Warner 
Bros. still preoccupied with network TV, there seemed to be a niche for 
"boutiques" like Zodiac that could make cartoons for syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble was that the majors soon recognized the same opportunity. Once 
they had organized themselves to exploit it, they shoved aside the small 
producers in the quest for syndication dollars. "Disney merely had to announce 
they were going into that business and stations signed up," Morrison recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whereas Zodiac, which is a new and struggling company, said, 'We're going to 
do "Widget," ' and people said, 'Who are you?' " Morrison said Zodiac succeeded 
in overcoming this credibility problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Widget" is about a purple alien who goes around transforming himself into 
various characters helping to solve environmental problems. In 1990, Morrison 
noted, "Widget" played on 80% of independent U. S. stations and, the following 
year, it went to five shows a week. And he said during the May "sweeps" week of 
1992, "Mr. Bogus," a cat-and-mouse type cartoon, was the highest-rated weekly 
syndicated children's show. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zodiac was having trouble getting what Keefe calls "on-Broadway" time 
slots -- between 7 and 8 in the morning, and between 3:30 and 5:30 in the 
afternoon. "The reality is you have to have 'on-Broadway' time periods," said 
Keefe, who was Zodiac's director of production and strategic planning. "The 
number of children watching in those periods is quadruple that in other 
periods." 
</P>
<P>
 One problem for Zodiac was its lack of advertising clout, Morrison said. For 
those prime slots, he explained, stations favor cartoon shows whose characters 
are also popular toys, or which are produced by big studios. It's a lucrative 
payoff for the TV stations, because often the toy company guarantees to buy 
large blocks of their advertising time. 
</P>
<P>
 In true Hollywood tradition, it is often the deal that counts in animation, 
not the show. Zodiac's shows "were perceived by broadcasters as nines or 10s as 
programs, but as business deals, they were fours," Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other industry players said Zodiac could have found a way around such 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Segal, president of MCA's Universal Cartoon Studios, suggested that the 
company could have worked like a subcontractor. If a studio wished to make a 
cartoon based on a toy or a comic strip, they could turn to Zodiac rather than 
going in-house. "If the fifth network goes ahead, and assuming CBS and Fox and 
the others stay in the animation business, there's always going to be room for 
small boutiques that take in a project they may not have originated," Segal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Spears, vice president of Ruby-Spears Productions, another animation 
independent, pointed to the example of Film Roman. The North Hollywood studio 
helped get the idea to take the popular comic strip "Garfield" and turn the 
mischievous feline into a hit TV cartoon, with toy company advertising galore. 
</P>

 "They got hold of a popular character," Spears said. "They've been very 
successful and been able to continue based on a not very large volume of work." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Morrison, adopting such strategies would mean betraying Zodiac's 
philosophy of putting programming first. Going "cap in hand" to the big toy 
companies, he said, "we regarded that as a prostitution of program-making." He 
added: "Temperamentally, as a broadcaster, (Central) wants to make programming 
for programming's sake rather than because of the advertising tie-ins. They 
simply decided it wasn't the sort of game they wanted to be in and they would 
retire." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that retirement, Zodiac intends to remain an active player by 
distributing its existing cartoons and shows it will acquire from others. 
Morrison said Central's merger with Carlton -- whose Hollywood interests also 
include Technicolor Inc., a film processing company, and Complete Post, a large 
post-production facility in Los Angeles -- will help Zodiac expand its 
distribution business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Widget," he predicted, will be around for many years as the purple alien 
character appeals to new generations of children. "The proof of all of this 
will really be how many of the shows that are in syndication this week will 
also be in syndication in 10 years' time. I bet you 'Widget' is." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Keefe and Lacey, they may end up proving the current conventional 
wisdom on how small boutiques can prosper in the current animation market. The 
partners have an idea for a new series called "Power Animals" that is based on 
the 12 characters of the Chinese zodiac. 
</P>
<P>
 And they hope to market it to stations in conjunction with a toy company.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MEDGROUP REPORTS LOSS IN 3RD QUARTER OF $474,890 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MedGroup Inc., an Encino supplier of medical products, posted a $474,890 net 
loss for its fiscal third quarter, contrasted with a profit of $24,048 a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue dipped 2% in the quarter that ended Dec. 31 to $969,749 from $991,323 
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Medgroup blamed its net loss largely on the cost of launching several new 
products. The company expects two of those products, a car seat for the 
disabled and a system for shipping temperature-sensitive medical supplies, to 
begin producing revenue later this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 During the third quarter, Med group also said it absorbed a one-time loss of 
$381,000 from the 1992 sale of its physical therapy clinics because the buyer 
defaulted on its note. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months, Medgroup's net loss nearly doubled to $422,470 from 
$224,933 for the same period last year. Revenue fell 31% to $2.74 million from 
$3.98 million a year earlier.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SIX AREA CENTERS OPEN FOR SMALL BUSINESS LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Valley Economic Development Center, together with Valley area chambers of 
commerce, has opened six centers to help business owners seeking earthquake 
relief get loans from the federal Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the SBA has received more than 42,000 requests for disaster-loan 
applications, according to John J. Rooney, VEDC president. 
</P>
<P>
 The "mini-business disaster registration centers" are in addition to existing 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sites, where business owners can 
also apply for SBA disaster loans in person or by calling FEMA at (800) 
525-0321. 
</P>
<P>
 Once business owners have registered at one of the VEDC centers, they can 
enroll in a series of workshops being conducted by the VEDC and its North Los 
Angeles Small Business Development Center. The workshops offer loan applicants 
one-on-one assistance with filling out forms. 
</P>
<P>
 The VEDC and the United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley are 
operating the disaster centers out of chamber offices at 14540 Victory Blvd., 
Suite 100, Van Nuys; 5019 Lankershim Blvd., Universal City/North Hollywood; 
21600 Oxnard St., Woodland Hills; 21943 Plummer St., Chatsworth; 11243 Glenoaks 
Blvd., Suite 6, Pacoima, and 5191 S. Brand Blvd., San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners should call the chambers for appointments.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: MARTIN LAWRENCE EXPECTS SALES DROP DUE TO QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc., a Van Nuys-based art publisher and 
seller, said its first-quarter sales will probably be "significantly" lower 
than the company had expected because of the recent Northridge earthquake and 
severe cold in the Midwest and the East. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarter ended March 31 last year, Martin Lawrence posted a net loss of 
$1.7 million on $4.7 million of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence said it was forced to close two of its galleries in local 
shopping malls because the malls were damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Martin Lawrence Gallery in Sherman Oaks' Fashion Square mall will be 
closed from two to six months, said company president Barry R. Levine. The 
company's Northridge Fashion Center gallery won't reopen until the summer at 
the earliest, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence said the quake also forced the company to effectively shut its 
corporate headquarters for two weeks. However, the company was fully 
operational by the beginning of last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence said it expects to recover a significant portion of the damage 
from its insurer.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: CAMARILLO COMPUTER FIRMS TO LAY OFF 115 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A total of 115 employees are being laid off by two Camarillo concerns involved 
in the computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the larger layoff, 95 jobs are being eliminated due to the closure of 
Unisys Corp.'s commercial software unit in Camarillo.The unit is being combined 
with a similar operation in San Jose. In addition to those laid off, 15 workers 
are being transferred from Camarillo to San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Unisys' defense-related computer division remains in Camarillo with 240 
employees, reports company spokesman Joe Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in technology are blamed for the layoff of 20 employees at 
Camarillo-based McLean Engineering, which produces cooling devices and other 
parts for large computer installations. 
</P>
<P>
 The laid-off workers were employed by McLean's Contempo Engineering unit, 
which made room air-conditioners for mainframes and other computer systems. The 
systems are now produced with internal cooling devices, eliminating the need 
for placing them in a cool environment, said Wilford D. Godbold, president and 
chief executive of Zero Corp., McLean's Los Angeles-based parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still very much involved in computer cooling through the production of 
internal units," Godbold said. "We hope to rehire some of those who were laid 
off, either at McLean or at other Zero divisions."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: TRAVEL'S STRONG COMEBACK MAY BE QUAKE-PROOF

 The earthquake doesn't appear to have affected a strong comeback already being 
enjoyed by the travel industry, reports Tony Whittle, vice president of 
marketing at Pleasant Travel Service, the Westlake Village firm that operates 
Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Bookings sold since Jan. 1 are up 30% over the same period last year, Whittle 
said."The improvement has been pretty even in our markets nationwide, and 
includes our Hawaiian and Mexican packages," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the company's largest market, no deviation one way or 
another has been seen in bookings from the San Fernando Valley or other areas 
hit by the earthquake, Whittle said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the improved economy appeared to be the main reason for the travel 
industry's comeback. Also, passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
has been credited with helping Pleasant Travel's Mexican tours. 
</P>
<P>
 The travel industry was mostly stagnant during the recession.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: NMB'S QUAKE TROUBLES AIDS TANDON CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NMB Technologies Inc., a Chatsworth firm that was hit hard by the temblor, 
benefited from the misfortunes of TSL Holdings Inc., the troubled Moorpark 
computer maker that was formerly called Tandon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the quake, with NMB's main plant reduced to shambles, an NMB 
executive recalled that Tandon had filed for bankruptcy protection and that its 
large, modern plant was vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a bid to lease the property within hours, and it's a good thing we 
moved fast," reports Steven Katz, senior marketing administrator for NMB, a 
supplier of computer components. Several other quake-damaged companies got the 
same idea, but the NMB bid was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few days, 150 employees of NMB and two sister companies made the move 
from a complex on Independence Avenue in Chatsworth to the 100,000-square-foot 
former Tandon plant near the interchange of the Moorpark and Simi Valley 
freeways. Two of the three buildings in Chatsworth are still occupied by 350 
employees of NMB's parent, Tokyo-based Minebea Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-mile move went so smoothly that NMB didn't miss a single shipment to 
its customers, Katz said. "The Chatsworth building was very badly damaged, but 
we've already started the cleanup work. We're definitely going to rebuild and 
move back." 
</P>
<P>
 TSL Holdings doesn't own its former headquarters building, but the company 
will still benefit from NMB's move. "They left a lot of furniture in the 
offices when they moved out," Katz said. "We're renting it from them."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: COMMERCIAL VACANCY LEVELS MAY DROP IN WAKE OF QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visions of an earthquake-related boom in commercial real estate haven't 
materialized, but Ventura County brokers expect vacancy levels to decrease 
somewhat in the wake of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the panic that immediately followed the earthquake, lots of business 
people rushed out here from the Valley," said Jerry R. Pelton, senior vice 
president in charge of the CB Commercial office in Ventura."But within a few 
days, many of them found that their plants weren't damaged as badly as they'd 
feared -- and they canceled their moving plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Small and medium-sized firms have been especially cautious about pulling up 
stakes because of the steep costs involved, Pelton said. The few larger 
companies that have moved to the county since the quake had incurred severe 
damage and also had deep pockets, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Principe, chairman of Westcord/Westlake Commercial Group in Westlake 
Village, said his brokerage has several leasing proposals pending for 
medium-sized office and industrial properties. The deals, mainly in the Conejo 
Valley, are about evenly divided between companies that were or were not 
affected by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Principe expects already low commercial vacancy rates to continue declining 
between Camarillo and the Los Angeles County line. Within 90 days, he believes 
vacancies will fall to the 8% to 10% range for both office and industrial 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 If the trend continues, speculative commercial development should return to 
Ventura County for the first time in years, Principe predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 One type of commercial property, retail space, probably won't benefit much 
from the earthquake, Principe believes. "You can move an office or a factory 
miles away and keep on doing business, but when you move a store, you've left 
your customers behind."

 School quake information -- Sunday's editions inaccurately reported the Los 
Angeles Unified School District's telephone number that was overwhelmed by 
calls for earthquake information. The correct number is (213) 625-4000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same story, a paragraph that clarified the quake response of KLCS, the 
district's TV station, was deleted. Beginning two days after the quake, the 
station interrupted regular programming to air press conferences and Board of 
Education meetings and to carry the Federal Emergency Management Agency's 
recovery channel.
