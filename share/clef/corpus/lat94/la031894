 Harrumphs from Hollywood! It seems odd that a motion picture awards show would 
be unable to obtain financial support from the Industry. But that's the case 
with the 14-year-old Golden Raspberry Foundation, possibly because it 
"dishonors the worst achievements in film." 
</P>
<P>
 So strapped is Razzies founder John Wilson that he had to persuade friends and 
associates to help pay for this year's extravaganza, which will be held Sunday 
at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. The first insult is scheduled for 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Wilson's biggest disappointments was his failure to hook up with a 
fertilizer company. "The corporate person I talked to just didn't get it," 
Wilson said. "He kept asking, 'But what does it have to do with gardening?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson doesn't expect worst-actress nominee Madonna ("Body of Evidence") or 
any of the other candidates to attend Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least actor Tom Selleck was good-natured enough to accept a 1993 Razzie 
on the Chevy Chase show for his role as Ferdinand, that hunk of a king of 
Spain, in the film, "1492."  
</P>
<P>
 "He (Chase) brought it up in the middle of a conversation about artificially 
inseminating a bull on Selleck's ranch," Wilson noted proudly. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Egg roles: The casting of Selleck in "1492" was a memorable mismatch, even if 
he did forgo using his trademark Detroit baseball cap as a crown. It's too bad 
the Razzies weren't around years ago, when they could have honored these other 
bizarre combinations: 
</P>
<P>
 * John Wayne as Genghis Khan, "The Conqueror," 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 * Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa, "Villa Rides," 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zsa Zsa Gabor in title role, "Queen of Outer Space," 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Dreyfuss as Baby-Face Nelson, "Dillinger," 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frank Sinatra in title role, "The Kissing Bandit," 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rod Steiger as W.C. Fields, "W.C. Fields & Me," 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 * And, of course, Tony Curtis as a Cossack warrior with a Brooklyn accent, 
"Taras Bulba," 1962 ("Yonda lies da castle of my faddah, the Khan.") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And a Razzie in the making: Shooting will start soon on "Jefferson in Paris," 
a film about Thomas Jefferson, who will be portrayed by Nick Nolte. 
</P>
<P>
 What? Stallone wasn't available?

 Those things happen when you only have 35 years to build a freeway: Jane 
Gifford observed that when you drive eastbound on the Century Freeway from LAX, 
you first see a sign that says Vermont is three miles ahead. "Then," she added, 
"after another mile or so, the next sign lists Vermont Avenue as 3 3/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, it seems the closer one gets to Vermont, the farther away it 
is!"

 And after what he did to Abel: The School of Theology at Claremont has 
installed a "Cain Professor of Theology and Ecclesiology." miscelLAny:

president of the school, not for the Biblical bad brother.

A DECISION THAT DENIES REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Germany's highest appeals court has ruled that the leader of a far-right party 
did not violate the law against inciting racial hatred when he endorsed another 
person's claim that Jews were not exterminated in Nazi death camps. Given 
German law, this was an irresponsible decision, condemned by both liberal and 
conservative voices in Germany. And it comes at a time when neo-fascism is 
becoming increasingly prominent across much of Europe. Intended or not, its 
implicit and disturbing message is of increased legal tolerance for the 
advocates of intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 German law, interpreted and upheld by many court decisions in the postwar 
years, outlaws the publication of Nazi propaganda, the display of the swastika 
and statements that seek to deny or call into doubt the massively documented 
record of Nazi war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 At a rally in the town of Weinheim in 1991 an American neo-Nazi named Fred 
Leuchter made a speech claiming that mass murder could not have occurred at the 
Auschwitz death camp. Gunter Deckert, chairman of the National Democratic 
Party, translated and circulated the speech, leading to his conviction for 
inciting hatred. But the appeals court has now found that repeating Leuchter's 
assertions didn't make Deckert guilty of incitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Claims that Nazi war crimes -- specifically the Holocaust -- never occurred 
are the basis of a growing international industry, a good part of which, 
actually, has its home in the United States. The irrationalism underlying these 
claims is beyond the reach of normal argument. It is also an assault on 
civilized values. In "Denying the Holocaust" Deborah Lipstadt perceptively 
notes that "just as the Holocaust was not a tragedy of the Jews but a tragedy 
of civilization in which the victims were Jews, so too denial of the Holocaust 
is not a threat just to Jewish history but a threat to all who believe in the 
ultimate power of reason." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court has ordered Deckert to be retried, and asked that particular 
attention be given -- as if there could be any question about it -- to whether 
he acted out of a belief in Nazi principles. The common-sense answer to that 
question is of course plain, if not to the appeals court then certainly to 
nearly everyone else in Germany.

AND DON'T LEAVE THE DRIVING TO US; LEADERSHIP IS NEEDED TO BOOST CAR-POOL-LANE 
IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never has there been so much big talk about reinventing Los Angeles as has 
been heard in the wake of successive natural and man-made catastrophes. But in 
this land of dreams and dreamers, talk of change flows faster than storm runoff 
down the Los Angeles River. Cyber schools? Sure. The virtual workplace? Why 
not. Smart freeways? Of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Really? 
</P>
<P>
 What about taking a first step toward a better future by making permanent the 
temporary car-pool lane along stretches of the Santa Monica Freeway? Alas, this 
small but critical step apparently calls for political courage. Anybody up to 
it? 
</P>
<P>
 Days after the Northridge earthquake, Caltrans, the state transportation 
agency, constructed a series of commuter detours around broken parts of the 
Santa Monica Freeway. Caltrans crews worked with speed and imagination in 
getting this freeway, the nation's busiest, back into operation. Key to this 
jury-rigged system of alternative routes are two lanes that reward car-poolers 
with a quicker and much more direct detour around the freeway breaks. The 
eastbound and westbound lanes approaching the breaks near La Cienega Boulevard 
and Fairfax Avenue allow car-poolers to stay on the freeway one exit farther 
than those driving alone and reroute them back one entrance sooner.  
</P>
<P>
 In a region where transportation planners and commuters are still haunted by 
the Ghost of Diamond Lanes Past, one would have predicted a huge outcry against 
such bold "social engineering" by state bureaucrats. Instead, the I-10 car-pool 
lanes appear to be a success. An estimated 1,300 cars use the lanes hourly 
during peak periods. Given that those cars must carry at least two people, the 
lanes are now moving more people each hour than did unrestricted lanes on the 
same freeway before the quake. Some car-poolers report that their commute is 
faster now than it was before the Jan. 17 temblor. And the lanes have done more 
to entice Angelenos out of their solo driving habits than all the previous 
campaigns of exhortation by transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan and U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena have 
expressed interest in extending these lanes and making them permanent features 
of the reconstructed I-10. But as repairs move forward, ahead of schedule, far 
too little has been done to begin that process. In fact, when this freeway 
returns to normal -- this is expected by May -- the car-pool lane could 
disappear. If that happens because state transportation leaders, City Council 
members or the mayor lacked the resolve to formally endorse this notion, it 
will be a sorry measure of the commitment to a brighter future in this 
now-beleaguered region of big dreams. Drive we must, but let's car-pool, and be 
rewarded for it, as much as we can.

HEALTH WATCH; FAT CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lifestyle pages have been full of stories about boomers who are sick and 
tired of being healthy. They're falling off their exercise bikes and onto the 
couch, and there are even some who are picking up the old coffin nails 
again.("Just one cigarette after dinner," one of these lapsed nonsmokers was 
heard to say. Yeah, right. As soon as we finish eating this one potato chip.) 
Could it be that in this age of enlightened self-denial a lot of people are 
discovering that clean living, though it might make one feel healthier and 
virtuous, really is kind of a grind? 
</P>
<P>
 The falling-off-the-wagon trend flies in the face of science, which keeps 
proving that thinner is healthier and linking dietary fat to diseases from head 
to toe, or at least from heart to colon. But human nature doesn't always 
operate by logic, something the marketers of fast food are grateful for. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years ago a burger chain pushed the nutrition envelope with its triple 
cheeseburger, carrying a whopping 69 grams of fat, more than anyone should eat 
in a whole day. That was nothing: Now, according to the Nutrition Action Health 
Letter, consumers can fall off the low-fat wagon by scarfing down half-pound 
burgers that have three ounces of cheese and eight strips of bacon and add up 
to a whopping 75 grams of fat. In their dainty, diet-y way, the newsletter 
folks have nicknamed such delicacies Suicide Burgers. They say the fat content 
equals three-quarters of a stick of butter. Probably true -- but for plenty of 
consumers taste is a terrible thing to waste. Burp.

QUAKE BONDS ON JUNE BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times' proposal for financing the state's share of earthquake recovery 
costs (editorial, March 9) fails to provide a workable alternative to Gov. Pete 
Wilson's proposal. First in its problems is the suggestion that the state 
somehow tap into the Pooled Money Investment Account to allocate a line of 
credit for earthquake repair work. Loans from this account cannot be made 
unless there is an existing bond authorization, and no bond authorization has 
been approved for such purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the criticism that "bureaucrats" are the reason that previously 
authorized earthquake bond monies have not been spent, many of those 
"bureaucrats" are in fact seismic engineers. The 1990 earthquake bond measure 
required each and every state and local government building throughout 
California to be examined for seismic safety, a process that understandably 
took several years to complete. Those buildings have been prioritized based on 
their need of repair, and the priority lists are or will shortly be submitted 
to the Legislature.  
</P>
<P>
 The Times also takes issue with the Administration's proposal to finance $65 
million in hazard mitigation costs through a new bond authorization. The reason 
for this approach is simple: Tapping into the 1990 bond funds will only serve 
to put off and push back needed seismic retrofit work on a number of buildings 
around the state.  
</P>
<P>
 The Times suggests that the state take several actions the same way it did 
after the Loma Prieta earthquake, some using new sales tax money. But 
California's economy today is worlds apart from what it was in late 1989. On 
the issue of bonds, there's a difference today that's compelling: The weighted 
average interest on GO bonds in late 1989 was 6.84%. Today, it's 5.23% -- it is 
more economical for the state to go the bond route.

 In a March 12 editorial, you argue that Californians should not pay for 
post-Northridge-quake reconstruction by means of bond issues because "in the 
long run they cost more than equivalent taxes." Right. But you support a 
"temporary sales tax increase" or a "modest gasoline tax hike" instead. Wrong. 
It is a symptom of the degeneration of political discourse in California (and 
across the United States generally) that you neglected to mention the fairest 
and most equitable solution: a temporary hike in the state income tax.  
</P>
<P>
 Elementary facts of political economy show that the burden of a sales tax 
falls disproportionately on the poor and that a hike in the gasoline tax is 
unfair to truck drivers and long-distance commuters. What makes these taxes 
attractive to politicians is that their effects are virtually invisible to the 
majority of voters. But invisible injustice is still injustice, and its very 
invisibility makes it all the more important for decent citizens to oppose it. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The editorial supporting a new tax to pay for rebuilding earthquake-damaged 
public structures characterizes the sales tax imposed after the Loma Prieta 
earthquake as a "modest and temporary" tax increase. If the tax increase was 
temporary, why are we still paying it? Remember the rationale to support making 
the tax permanent in November? "It's not a new tax." 
</P>
<P>
 If a new tax is imposed now, we can be certain that two or three years from 
now the tax will be made permanent. There is no such thing as a temporary tax.

'3 STRIKES' PASSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Why 'Three Strikes' May Take California for a Ride," editorial, March 
13: 
</P>
<P>
 It never ceases to amaze me how the left just can't get the message of the 
"three strikes and you're out" bill. The overwhelming majority of the 
population doesn't care if it fails to deter crime. They don't care that 
"50-cent felons" are going to jail for life. And they don't care about the 
so-called Law of Unintended Consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 What the public does care about is keeping dangerous felons off the streets 
for good. Is the new law perfect? No. But is it better than endless negotiation 
and discussion in the state Legislature by a group of politicians who seem to 
be more concerned about criminals' rights than the rights of the criminals' 
victims and families? Yes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The sick irony of your editorial is that it's The Times that's been taking 
its readers for a ride for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Your half-truth that one of the first felons to be charged under the law 
allegedly wrested 50 cents from a homeless man irresponsibly omitted the fact 
that the criminal had a rap sheet 52 pages long. How much have those 
apprehensions and legal costs amounted to already, to say nothing of the tragic 
cost to victims? 
</P>
<P>
 As for your fears that life imprisonment for first-time rapists and child 
molesters would be unjust, inappropriate and too costly, where have you been? 
Did you miss all the studies that invariably show these creeps never stop at 
one incident? If your misplaced pity still lies with the perpetrators, do you 
think the police work and interminable trials incurred by these heinous acts 
are free? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * There are a couple of things having to do with the "three strikes" law that 
I just don't seem to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of lawyers advising their clients to go to trial rather than plea 
bargain, because a plea bargain will count as a conviction, and therefore be a 
"strike" against them, why don't they advise them to take the plea bargain and 
then not commit any more felonies? 
</P>
<P>
 The other source of mystery is why some people seem to think that the law 
should only apply to violent felons. Persons who view others in society as 
potential victims of their violence or as suckers to be fleeced are both 
contemptible. Both ways of thinking can and do cause enormous harm.

case of "foul balls."

 * Concerning Sherry Jeffe's "three strikes" article (Opinion, March 13): What 
is so wrong with California's legislators being responsive to the desires of 
their constituency? It is a sad indictment of our legislative process that the 
people have to scream so loudly to effect any real change.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, three strikes will be expensive. And yes, state representatives will have 
to make some very difficult decisions on how to finance this new legislation, 
but the task of providing safe city streets for law-abiding citizens of our 
state is perhaps the most fundamental duty of our public sector.

 The Watts Towers Art Center may be Los Angeles' most off-the-beaten-track 
gallery, but happily the gallery is equally as far off the beaten political and 
ideological track. For his inaugural exhibition, director Mark S. Greenfield 
chose not February, Black History Month, but March, Women's History Month. The 
show, running through April 2, is entitled "As We See It," and the women in the 
show -- black, white and Latino -- see nearly everything with a measure of wry 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider "Game Tables," a set of several collages-under-glass by Kathi Martin. 
Each joins an assembly of old game boards and playing cards -- old enough to 
make an adult viewer think of childhood as well as of hazard -- to a story from 
the "Daily Mirror, the paper that dares to add realistic dimensions to TV's 
pounding perfection." The Mirror story built into one collage deals with 
"Flat-Faced Companion," a service offering "fantasy meetings" via television:  
</P>
<P>
 "The ache of loneliness can now be curbed by use of your television! 
Subscriptions to a new service, 'Flat-Faced Companion,' offer a wide array of 
programs for your fantasy entertainment. First, the viewer chooses a friend, a 
favorite actor, musician or Tarot card reader that they are particularly fond 
of. Then for a nominal fee, the viewer can purchase a 'party kit.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The kit consists of a script and video tape of their idols. They have a long, 
breezy, intense conversation, and the dinner that matches that of the screen 
actor! The lonely person actually has a meal with their favorite actor, 
conversation and all. Add the Sideways Dimension Video Kit, and their 
experience is spliced together so that they may keep forever a tape of the two 
humans together. Yes, it's the visual karaoke of the New Age. For a small fee, 
a director will come to your home to set up your living room for the taping." 
</P>
<P>
 The media, ah, the media! We are all victims of the media, imprisoned for our 
seven daily hours with the "flat-faced companion." Or are we? Martin, several 
of whose companions in this show politely but firmly decline the victim's role, 
seems to have no trouble laughing old Flat-Face back to where he belongs. We 
take her not just as an enjoyable artist but also as a slyly reassuring clue.

Nixon reappears on the world stage. President Boris Yeltsin publicly snubbed 
Nixon for "protocol indiscretions" for meeting with opposition political 
leaders before meeting with him.Yeltsin was livid in his refusal to meet with 
Nixon. He abruptly canceled Nixon's briefings with lower government officials 
and removed the complimentary bodyguard and limousine service.  
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's public reaction puzzled me, knowing the tremendous financial help 
needed from America, until I read an article in The Times, March 10. The last 
paragraph illuminates why I believe Yeltsin spoke of Nixon's misstep so 
angrily. It states, "On a visit to Russia in April, 1991, Nixon met Yeltsin 
against Gorbachev's wishes; Nixon later urged Washington to forge better ties 
with Gorbachev's rivals." Does Nixon's arrival and talks with opposition 
leaders now look like deja vu to Yeltsin? 
</P>
<P>
 Who is Nixon working for now that he's retired from "public" life? He says he 
traveled to Russia as a private citizen doing some fact-finding, not official 
business. Nixon said he talked to President Clinton before traveling to Russia. 
Is Nixon the "kingmaker" or just a messenger for those with "real" power in the 
world? 
</P>
<P>
 As I see things, Nixon isn't helping the situation and may jeopardize future 
relations between Russia and the United States. I don't believe Nixon is a 
"fact-finding" asset America needs at this time. It's time to say good night, 
Dick.

OSCAR IS ONE AWARD THE GIPPER EARNED BUT HASN'T WON -- YET; HOLLYWOOD: THE 
PRESIDENT WHO WAS PROUD TO BE AN ACTOR DESERVES THE ACADEMY'S NOTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY LORD, Jeffrey Lord, a White House aide from 1985-88, is a writer in 
Washington. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here we go again. Oscar time approaches and there is no hint of recognition 
for a man regarded by some in the film community as simply a B-movie star from 
the 1940s and '50s. Not only did he never win an Oscar for his acting, but he 
actually played straight man to a monkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, of course, there is his politics. In an industry decimated by AIDS and 
dominated by influential men and women who were intensely liberal on the Soviet 
Union, the air-traffic-controller's strike, the U.S. defense buildup, 
economics, abortion and Central America, the mere mention of his name causes 
seething tempers. 
</P>
<P>
 The very idea of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarding an 
honorary Oscar to Ronald Reagan does not appear to have the slightest support 
from the Academy's members.  
</P>
<P>
 That's a shame.  
</P>
<P>
 With the ascendancy of the Clintons to the White House, liberals in Hollywood 
looked forward to the opportunity for more involvement in Washington politics. 
"We're in!" exclaimed a jubilant Barbra Streisand at the inaugural gala. Surely 
it was disconcerting for the Hollywood activists to find themselves under 
attack a few months later -- not from conservatives but from liberal 
journalists and politicians. The reason was blunt and had to hurt: Streisand 
and company were only actors. They might have fame and cash -- always helpful 
in a campaign -- but the election was over, policy was being discussed and 
actors have no business in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of having been an actor," Reagan told his biographer, Lou Cannon. 
Ironically, the former President has so thoroughly dominated the political and 
policy landscape of America for so long that his involvement with the 
motion-picture business is now generally relegated to footnote status. Long 
since forgotten is this gem from Democratic Gov. Pat Brown in a 1966 campaign 
TV commercial titled "Man vs. Actor:" "I'm running against an actor, and you 
know who shot Lincoln, don't you?" That was only one line of a chorus that, as 
Streisand and her liberal colleagues have now rediscovered, is used repeatedly 
by professional politicians and policymakers to insinuate that successful work 
in Hollywood somehow disenfranchises an otherwise qualified citizen from 
participating as fully in the national debates as, say, a computer salesman 
from Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole tiresome line is meant to imply that actors are dumb, spoiled and 
useful only as cash cows for infinitely more knowledgeable and serious people. 
Reagan never hesitated to stand up against this notion, going out of his way as 
President to bring both actors and movies to the White House. Reagan happily 
hosted non-supporter and Oscar-winning director Warren Beatty for a White House 
screening of his epic film "Reds." 
</P>
<P>
 In Reagan's 40-year movie career, he made 53 motion pictures, including 
"King's Row," his favorite, and "Knute Rockne, All American," in which he won 
the nickname "Gipper" for his portrayal of dying Notre Dame football star 
George Gipp. He was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild seven times. 
Reagan served as a co-host of the Oscar ceremony (with Bob Hope) in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy's treatment of the only actor President is particularly puzzling 
when looked at through a Washington lens. Like Hollywood, Washington reveres 
its stars, understanding that the best of them make the system work by 
forthrightly holding to their honorably held views. Reagan is permanently fixed 
in Washington's 200-year-old "star system" alongside names like Webster, 
Calhoun and Clay, Lincoln and Douglas, Wilson, Roosevelt, Eisenhower and 
Kennedy.  
</P>
<P>
 All of these people spoke out fearlessly for what they believed was best for 
the country in their time. Sometimes it was at the price of their lives, a 
price Reagan himself almost paid at the hands of a deranged movie fan. "When 
the battle is over and the ground is cooled, well, it's then that you see the 
opposing general's valor," Reagan said of John F. Kennedy at a fund-raiser for 
the Kennedy Library at Ted Kennedy's home in the mid-1980s. "Many men are 
great, but few capture the imagination and the spirit of the times. The ones 
who do are unforgettable." 
</P>
<P>
 It could perhaps be said that Reagan, who also captured the imagination and 
spirit of his times, has received so many honors that recognition by the 
academy would be superfluous. Still, it is too bad that, at 83, this former SAG 
president, governor of California and President of the United States won't 
receive an award that may seem superfluous to many, although probably not to 
him.

PERSPECTIVE ON TOURISM; SELL L.A. IN ALL ITS TASTES AND COLORS; PUT OUR ETHNIC 
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE PICTURE, LITERALLY AND ECONOMICALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MADELINE JANIS-APARICI; GILDA HAAS, ; ROBIN CANNON, Madeline Janis-Aparicio 
is executive director of the Tourism Industry Development Council. Gilda Haas 
is vice-chair of the council and lectures in economic development at UCLA, 
where she runs the Community Scholars Program. Robin Cannon is a council board 
member and president of Concerned Citizens of South-Central.

<P>
 Shortly after the 1992 civil unrest, a group of Community Scholars at UCLA 
released a wide-ranging analysis of Los Angeles' vital tourism industry. The 
report, titled "Accidental Tourism," concluded: "As with the devastated 
neighborhoods of the city, tourism must not be simply restored, but must be 
built in a new way." 
</P>
<P>
 Has this happened? Unfortunately, no. When it comes to tourism, Los Angeles is 
still held hostage to a vision that is economically dangerous and racist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greater Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, a private, nonprofit 
agency funded by $6 million in city hotel tax revenues, promotes Los Angeles to 
the outside world with a map that would leave most residents wondering where 
they live. "Like a colorful mosaic," the bureau's publication, "Destination Los 
Angeles," states, "the city's landscape is an intricately designed panorama 
comprising five regions or neighborhoods, each with its own character: Downtown 
-- a sophisticated urban center; Hollywood -- the world's entertainment 
capital; Westside -- neighborhoods of the rich and famous; Coastal -- beachside 
pleasures and spectacular views; The Valleys -- myriad suburban recreational 
pursuits." 
</P>
<P>
 South and South-Central Los Angeles, East Los Angeles, Pico-Union, Koreatown 
and virtually all working-class and/or ethnic neighborhoods -- the 
neighborhoods in which so many of the area's tourism workers actually live -- 
are banished from the official tourism promotion of our city.  
</P>
<P>
 Where on this map are the powerful murals of East Los Angeles? The hip cafes 
and shops of Leimert Park? The "recreational pursuits" (and incomparable views) 
from the top of Baldwin Hills, or the festive Sundays in Lincoln Park? The 
opportunity to visit a bit of Korea just a few blocks off the Santa Monica 
Freeway? The wonderful Mexican, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Salvadoran and other 
restaurants that are the favorites of Angelenos from all backgrounds? Like so 
much else, they neither register on nor benefit from a tourism policy that 
shunts visitors and their wallets to some communities while deepening the 
economic dependency and stoking the flames of discontent in others. 
</P>
<P>
 With millions of public dollars invested in a tourism policy based on this 
elitist vision of Los Angeles, it is no surprise that the official tourism 
promoters lapse into defensiveness and near-hysteria when contrary images 
surface. Recall the panic over the Police Protective League's bargaining-tactic 
threat to distribute a video that sounded like "Falling Down" and "Blade 
Runner" rolled into one. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there an alternative for promoting the real Los Angeles? Of course. 
Building on other cities' experience, Los Angeles can create a new model of 
tourism as a vehicle for real economic development. Here are the necessary 
ingredients: 
</P>
<P>
 * A community-based approach. Incorporate into the $8-billion tourism economy 
the businesses and residents of communities historically excluded. It can be 
done. New York, for example, channels its hotel tax dollars to community 
organizations in all five boroughs of the city. Philadelphia has a very 
effective and well-funded program to promote its African American history and 
neighborhoods. New Orleans' Black Tourism Network, a highly successful program, 
is funded by the city's hotel tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * A sea-change in the attitude of major employers in tourism toward the 
unionization of their service workers. San Francisco and Hawaii, vacation and 
convention destinations of consistent strength, have a much higher degree of 
unionization in their tourism-oriented hotels than Los Angeles. The result: a 
work force bolstered by medical insurance and other benefits, taking home, on 
average, wages 50% higher than ours. This means more earned dollars circulating 
in poor communities, nurturing small business. 
</P>
<P>
 * A comprehensive policy that links these elements with the tourism and 
convention infrastructure. The Tourism Industry Development Council, a 
nonprofit entity, was formed just for this purpose. By joining community, labor 
and business resources, we can make tourism an engine of economic development 
for the whole city. 
</P>
<P>
 A tourism policy that showcases rather than denies the complex vitality of our 
city must be the basis on which this critical sector of our economy is built. 
When business flourishes, when all of our communities share in the benefits of 
tourism, and when the interests of workers throughout the industry are 
represented by unions, no video, no matter what it may show, will stand a 
chance against reality.

STOP THE BOMB 'OR ELSE'? WHAT'S THE ELSE ?; NORTH KOREA: GIVEN LIMITS OF 
COERCION, U.S. HAS MADE THE MOST OF A REALISTIC STRATEGY TO HALT A 
NUCLEAR-WEAPONS PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE PERKOVICH, George Perkovich directs the Secure World Program of the 
W. Alton Jones Foundation in Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dealing with North Korea has always been morally dissatisfying. It has now 
gotten worse. We learned this week that the long-awaited international 
inspection of acknowledged nuclear facilities has been obstructed by North 
Korean officials. This was supposed to be only the easiest step of a process to 
ensure that North Korea does not possess nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before this latest setback, pundits and some members of Congress had 
chastised the "softness" of the Clinton Administration's diplomatic strategy. 
Critics want immediate satisfaction by North Korea, "or else." Unfortunately, 
they cannot say what the "or else" is. In reality, the Clinton team's 
diplomatic strategy is the only viable option. Military attack and 
comprehensive economic sanctions are untenable. Yet it will take uncommon 
realism for the American public and a politically skittish White House to 
resist the righteous temptation to decisively "punish" North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the Administration's diplomacy exclaim that North Korea has been 
cajoled and potentially rewarded for doing what it was obligated to do under 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The North, in effect, has been shaking 
down the United States. This is true, but beside the point. The real point is 
that North Korea, legally or not, has acquired the means to continue a 
nuclear-weapons program. The issue now is how to stop and reverse this program. 
 
</P>
<P>
 There are several underappreciated reasons why the Administration is compelled 
to continue negotiating -- despite the announcement in Washington on Thursday 
of the cancellation of high-level U.S.-North Korean talks that were to begin 
Monday, together with the word that joint military exercises with South Korea 
were being reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, neither the United States nor South Korea can "afford" a war 
on the Korean peninsula. An attack on the North could provoke a counterattack 
on South Korea, threatening massive casualties and destruction in Seoul. And 
even if we were willing to go to war, we may not be able to achieve our 
objectives through force. Military planners do not know the whereabouts of the 
plutonium or other weapons-related assets presumably hidden in North Korea. 
Attacking known nuclear facilities poses serious risks of radioactive 
contamination. The American public would not support putting American lives on 
the line in Korea any more than in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 As in President Clinton's early tough stance on Bosnia, the invocation of 
potential military force against North Korea will generate pressure to back up 
words with deeds. Columnists and members of Congress will start demanding that 
the President exercise the military option -- "You can only shake a stick so 
long before you have to use it. What are your waiting for, Mr. President?" At 
the point the ugly reality will emerge as it has in Bosnia: There is no 
military option, either because the military says it's too uncertain or the 
President isn't willing to take the political risks. If force is out, the 
United States and its allies should not undermine their credibility by 
pretending otherwise.  
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate leverage the world has on North Korea is the baleful North Korean 
economy. North Korean leaders know that without trade, technical assistance and 
international engagement, the communist system will collapse. Sanctions and 
further economic isolation for the rest of the world could hasten this 
collapse. Hence the North's need of international cooperation appears to have 
motivated concessions on the nuclear question. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the very threat of collapse also constrains the Clinton Administration. 
Neither South Korea, Japan nor the United States can afford to inherit the 
downtrodden society of North Korea that the communists have created. Communism 
has turned into a deterrent: You can't attack or squeeze a communist state 
because you might win and inherit all their problems. The South Koreans have 
seen Germany struggle with unification and would rather wait. While respecting 
this concern, the Clinton Administration must persuade South Korea and Japan 
that if push comes to shove, a North Korea collapsing under sanctions is 
preferable to a nuclear-armed North Korea. This is a hard sell, and it points 
to the need now to build international consensus on sanctions against future 
proliferators so that diplomats in the next crisis have hardier sticks to 
wield. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the options, the United States has been making the most of a realistic 
diplomatic strategy of stopping, and eventually reversing, the North Korean 
bomb program. The resolution of this crisis must be either full North Korean 
compliance with the treaty or expulsion from it, with pariah status and 
sanctions.  
</P>
<P>
 The treaty has worked thus far by smoking out North Korea's bomb program and 
providing procedures for redemption or isolation and punishment. Holding a 
hollow stick, the Clinton Administration has been right to keep the North 
Koreans interested in the wages of redemption.

THE STYLE FILES / SPECIAL FASHION ISSUE; THE PLEASURES; LITTLE NOTHINGS; 
THERE'S A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNDERWEAR AND LINGERIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE DRAKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the world is divided into women who wear underwear and women who wear 
lingerie, the latter -- without a doubt -- have more fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some women have an incredible fetish for lingerie," says Joan Wills, owner of 
Merletto on Rodeo Drive. Her supply of La Perla lingerie can't keep up with 
demand. When shipments come in from Bologna, Italy, every few weeks, Wills 
calls 50 of her best customers, who snap up the sophisticated lace-trimmed 
bras, panties and camisoles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where these women put all this lingerie, says Wills, "because 
they can't possibly wear it all." She suspects that they match their lingerie 
to their outfits, which, of course, are different every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the recession cannot touch this particular obsession. "In this economy, 
people may not be buying many designer clothes, but they're still treating 
themselves to lingerie, where you can buy something new for $300 to $400 rather 
than spending thousands on a new Armani." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who must have La Perla is "basically, someone with a great body," 
admits Wheel. "The cup sizes are traditional but they offer an amazing fit." 
Though she does make one concession: "It is hard for us to fit an extremely 
large-busted woman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While La Perla is all sugar and spice, that's not at all what you get at 
Trashy Lingerie on La Cienega Boulevard. You could guess as much from the black 
leather-trussed mannequins in the window. A sentry at the door collects a $2 
annual fee, part of the "club" atmosphere that allows the store to forbid entry 
to undesirables (male voyeurs). 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, it's one big happy family, complete with a comfy couch and a bathtub 
on the selling floor overflowing with G-strings. This is where Princess Diana 
found the white satin-and-lace garter belt for her royal wedding (OK, she 
bought it at Harrods, but Trashy Lingerie made it). And where Stephanie 
Seymour, Linda Evangelista, Niki Taylor, Dolly Parton and Dana Delany shop. 
</P>
<P>
 According to owners Tracy and Mitchell Shrier, theirs is the only store in the 
United States that will custom-sew a merry widow (a corset with stays and an 
attached underwire bra) to your dimensions. Prices start at $125. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a merry widow really fits, it's comfortable beyond belief. You can wear 
it for 10 years," says Tracy. "Ours have the best boning, are lined in cotton, 
and use hook-and-eye closure. We can do a lace-up front but it won't give you 
as much cleavage." 
</P>
<P>
 A custom-made bra costs from $25 to $60. (That's if you can't find a 
ready-made version from the thousands in stock.) All told, the Shriers have 
more than 100,000 items to choose from -- bras, panties, camisoles, teddies, 
garter belts, corsets, suits, and dresses. Alterations are free and done on the 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 For whom? Everyone. Trashy Lingerie is one of those rare spots where 
socialites and schoolteachers, strippers and dancers all meet on common ground 
-- and not so common. "What's weird," Mitchell says, "is when the mistress is 
in here and the husband comes in with his wife. On occasion, we've had to help 
the mistress scoot out the back door." 
</P>
<P>
 A few infidelities aside, the current rage for monogamy has been a boon to the 
lingerie business, says Tracy: "People want to make a monogamous marriage work 
without endangering either partner, and the way to do that is to become a 
different person. One day you might want to wear leather, the next you might 
want to be Little Bo Peep or the upstairs maid, and lingerie lets you do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The store fulfills fantasies, no matter how bizarre. "A woman wanted us to 
make the strapless dress that Jessica Rabbit wore in the film 'Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit,' " says Mitchell.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the search for a lacy Size 34-D bra that first brought actress Sandra 
Korn into the store. "The beautiful bras in department stores all seemed to 
stop at C," she says. "All I could find were Old Mother Hubbard-type bras." 
</P>
<P>
 Korn has an entire dresser full of lingerie. And that's about all she wears in 
the upcoming film "Exit to Eden." "The entire wardrobe was from Trashy! I said, 
'That's perfect -- I can go to work in my stuff!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Korn is one of those women who actually prefers garter belts to pantyhose. 
"Even if I have to wear a suit, underneath I still wear my garter belt, because 
it just makes me feel pretty. . . . Unless you have a protruding tummy or 
something, I don't know why you'd wear pantyhose." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A mile away from Trashy Lingerie but poles apart is the vintage lingerie from 
the 1920s, '30s and '40s at The Collection on Robertson Boulevard, where Karen 
Allyn's Timeless Attire shares space with Lily Vintage Clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 "Vintage lingerie is sexy without being seductive," says Allyn. "It speaks to 
the female in all of us -- the soft part. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be very productive in your business life and still not lose that 
female quality," she says. "And I really think that's the tack that feminism is 
taking now." 
</P>
<P>
 Allyn's silk and satin slips, floor-length nightgowns, and bed jackets are 
alluring because of the fabric and the bias cut, "not because they plunge down 
to the table," she says. Some have never been worn and all have lace on the 
bodice or a hem embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
 "These gowns are so extraordinary they can be worn as dresses," she says. 
About 40% of her customers do just that. Some women lace up Allyn's antique 
corsets on the outside of soft chiffon dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of her customers come in again and again. "Once they buy vintage 
lingerie, they're hooked because it's pretty much one of a kind. They 
appreciate the fabric -- real silk feels sensual on the body, unlike synthetic 
fabric, which has a cold feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers covet the luxurious details, such as hand embroidery and silk -- 
rather than rayon -- velvet nightgown trims. "I have customers who come in just 
to get high," says Allyn. "Those who can't buy all the time, just try something 
on and get transported." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think that Lisa Norman, who's been selling high-end lingerie in her 
eponymous stores for 16 years, would be addicted to the stuff, but she's not. 
Or so she claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a lingerie freak. I just like quality, a good fit, and nice fabric 
that feels good. And so do my customers -- they wouldn't think of buying any 
old bra," she says. "It has to fit properly, be pretty and be right for the 
clothing, since a lot of foundations don't work under certain clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 People who dress well also like to be well-dressed underneath, she explains. 
To her customers, every season means placing an order for new lingerie and 
sleepwear. Her stores, in Santa Monica on Montana Avenue and in West Hollywood 
in Sunset Plaza, are the sorts of places mothers bring their daughters for 
their first bras. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you're a certain size doesn't mean that size will fit," says 
Norman. "Each manufacturer uses its own set of measurements." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman won't drop the names of celebrity clients, although she points to a 
$558 green silk-and-velvet dressing gown and says, "That's already in a few 
good homes." She also sells to Hollywood wardrobe stylists, who pick up 
bathrobes for their female stars to wear on location. (Can't grant an interview 
in your trailer looking like a frump.) 
</P>
<P>
 To watch Lisa Norman point out the difference between a $154 La Perla bra and 
a $14 bra (which she also carries) is to witness a seduction of sorts: "La 
Perla uses European polyester, which is wonderful. It's spun like silk. And 
their laces are superior. Isn't this beautiful lace on the cup? And they make 
these beautiful lace straps. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can always tell the quality in how well the color is matched throughout 
the bra -- the elastic, the lace, the thread. And see how silky this feels -- 
this is what's next to your body all day long. It's one of life's luxuries, 
like sleeping on expensive sheets."  
</P>
<P>
 Ah, what the heck. We're worth it.

THE STYLE FILES / SPECIAL FASHION ISSUE; THE PLEASURES; DAY TRIPPING; AN 
ABBREVIATED SPA EXPERIENCE TAKES LESS TIME AND MONEY

<P>
 After days of pounding my bones and muscles on the snow-dusted slopes of Vail, 
my body and mind were ready for serious pampering. So I decided to trade in 
moguls for mud masks and other hedonistic pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Day spas feature an abbreviated spa experience. The best of the lot offer the 
same services as resort-caliber spas. And because time commitment is shorter, 
cash layout is a lot less. 
</P>
<P>
 At five spas from Encino to Laguna Niguel, four- to five-hour packages 
(including lunch) range from $185 to $491. But an investment of one hour and 
$85 affords a mini spa experience that is both soothing and energizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair warning, though: Being pampered can be habit-forming. Start saving now. 
AMADEUS SPA SALON 
</P>
<P>
 First stop is the Amadeus Spa Salon, adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton Huntington 
Hotel in Pasadena. On arrival, I'm given a cappuccino, thongs and the requisite 
white terry-cloth robe. My afternoon begins with the Spa Facial. Esthetician 
Sally Pierson begins the treatment by ushering my hands, one at a time, into a 
vat of warm, melted wax. Although the idea is unnerving at first, it feels 
nice. My coated hands are then topped with plastic and slipped into heated 
mitts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierson leads me into a private room dimly lit with a scented aromatherapy 
candle. She cleanses my face twice, steams it with a stationary wand-type 
instrument and then inspects it under the overhead light. Pierson applies 
several preparations from the Dermalogica line, some designed to exfoliate, 
others designed to calm.  
</P>
<P>
 Then come the extractions -- the most unpleasant part of the treatment -- 
squeezing clogged pores until they come clean. I endure it. Soon it's over, and 
the soothing facial massage begins. A masque follows. My skin feels soft. 
</P>
<P>
 I move to a tiled wet room where esthetician Ingrid Marone Thompson gives me a 
modesty towel -- a sort of expanded fig leaf -- and I lie face down on the 
table. She gives my body the once-over with a dry brush. This is supposed to 
stimulate the lymphatic system, which will be cleansed during the upcoming 
hydrotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 A scrub with loofah mitts feels surprisingly nice. But what follows is the 
nicest of all: Thompson centers a large overhead pipe fitted with five shower 
heads -- called a Vichy shower -- over my head and turns it on. 
</P>
<P>
 Massage therapist Ron Smith then leads me into a room filled with candlelight 
and the music of Enya. This massage proves to be the most relaxing of the half 
a dozen I eventually sample. As he firmly presses with his palms against my 
flesh, my tight muscles vibrate with such an intensity I wonder if he uses a 
machine (he doesn't) and if his talent attracts groupies (it does). After 90 
blissful minutes, I shuffle off to the hydrotherapy tub. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrotherapy, I am told, increases blood circulation, reduces fluid retention 
and eliminates toxins. Sixty water and air jets target areas such as lumbar and 
spinal column, waist, hips, arms and legs. Essential oils, French seawater and 
seaweed compounds are mixed with good old H2O. After climbing in, I relax and 
sip water while Smith massages my neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith then takes a water wand and runs it over the lymph node areas of the 
body to purify the body of toxins. Afterward, I relax alone for a few minutes 
and am again rinsed off with the shower system. 
</P>
<P>
 For the finale, Smith rubs eucalyptus oil into my body, invigorating me for 
the drive home. 
</P>
<P>
 Total cost of treatment: $285 
</P>
<P>
 Ambience: Good 
</P>
<P>
 Service: Excellent BELLEZZA SALON / DAY SPA 
</P>
<P>
 Bellezza Salon / Day Spa in Laguna Niguel, publishes a 30-page brochure 
(including ads) that is tempting on several counts. I decide to try the Seaweed 
Body Treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's changing room -- outfitted with wet and dry sauna and 
Swiss-style shower -- I slip into a terry wrap, matching robe and plastic 
thongs. I relax in the steam room for as long as I can stand it. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Stout leads me to a chair near the water treatment room. While she's 
busy with last-minute preparations, I peek into the other treatment rooms. In 
one is a hydrotherapy tub. The massage rooms contain illuminated plants and 
aromatic candles. The wet room -- where I'm headed -- is lined from ceiling to 
floor with spotless tiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes later, Stout ushers me into the wet room, now dimly lit by three 
candles. I lie down on a table outfitted with a heating element and lined with 
a special type of Mylar. First, Stout applies toning and mineral ointments. 
Then she slathers me with a seaweed mixture that has been warmed to just above 
body temperature. It is soothing and fresh-smelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I'm coated, she wraps the Mylar around me, followed by a body-sized 
heating pad. Yet another cover tops the many layers. I'm brought a glass of 
juice with a straw -- a final beverage for a woman about to be mummified. In 
case of fire, will Stout save me? She nods and laughs, leaving me to cook under 
the pads. I feel a bit like a pig-in-a-blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I'm nice and toasty, it's time to rinse off in the shower. I slip on my 
robe and head for the dry sauna while Stout prepares for the second half of the 
wrap. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes later, I return, lie on a plastic sheet, and the entire wrap and 
shower process is repeated on clean skin. I'm given a quick application of 
hydrating cream infused with mint oil, which, Stout says, closes pores and 
retards perspiration. Since many of Bellezza's packages include makeup and hair 
services, it's possible to leave looking better than when you arrived. But I'm 
too mellow for primping. 
</P>
<P>
 Total cost of treatment: $85 
</P>
<P>
 Ambience: Good 
</P>
<P>
 Service: Good BURKE WILLIAMS 
</P>
<P>
 With great anticipation I head to Burke Williams in Santa Monica, probably 
L.A.'s best-known (or best-marketed?) day spa. The beautifully lit marble entry 
and fresh flowers disguise the fact that the place is completely underground. 
</P>
<P>
 I proceed down a narrow hallway to a quiet room, where phone booth-like 
seating houses clients who want to eat a quick bite and don't mind compact 
quarters. It's also possible to nap, since it's quite dark, but individual 
lamps make reading an option. I'm given a locker key, a cranberry-colored 
terry-cloth robe and thongs. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's dressing area is the largest I've ever seen. It houses a whirlpool 
bath, steam room, dry sauna, changing area and a very large, elaborate vanity 
stocked with lotions, mousse, hair spray, deodorant and blow dryers. A pack of 
primping teen-agers could have a field day here. 
</P>
<P>
 Communal whirlpool bathing is the order of the day in the dressing area, but 
"private baths" are available for an extra $25. (These tubs are enclosed in 
clear glass and within plain view of the whirlpool users, making the bathwater 
private -- but not the business of bathing.) 
</P>
<P>
 I decide to think about getting clean later since I'm about to be covered with 
mud. This will cleanse my pores and soften my skin, I'm told. 
</P>
<P>
 In a very small room bathed in reddish light, I lie face down on a table. 
Esthetician Margaret Domasehewich applies Israeli mud to my skin. The smell is 
awful -- not anything like the aroma of Fango mud from the Borghese line that I 
own and love. An infusion of essential oil could easily cure the problem. But 
since the treatment is so popular, perhaps this is merely my personal aversion. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A trio of red heat lamps bakes the mud for 10 minutes. Smelling the stinky mud 
as it dries, I long for some New Age-style music to help me relax. Instead, I 
get the incessant tick-tocking of a wall clock. Not exactly in keeping with the 
escapism I associate with a spa. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 minutes, Domasehewich tells me to flip over so she can coat the rest 
of me. More baking. Soon I am en croute from the neck down. I anticipate the 
mud's removal with great eagerness. Perhaps I'll be cleansed with some 
divine-smelling scrub and lavished with lotion for the grand finale. Most day 
spas place a great emphasis on "finishing off" their treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I'm unceremoniously rinsed with a hose. No soap is involved. 
Domasehewich suggests a dip in the whirlpool. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the dressing area, I take a real shower with soap, kicking about bits 
of residue on the shower floor. The mud's smell, however, lingers. In the 
vanity area, I apply gratis body lotion -- this seems like such an effort after 
having been spoiled elsewhere -- but I could still smell the mud. (Only after 
another bath at home did the odor finally fade.) 
</P>
<P>
 On the way out, I peek into a massage room. The subdued lighting and New Age 
music seem to beckon entry. I wished I had sampled a service with better value 
for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Total cost of treatment: $89 
</P>
<P>
 Ambience: Fair 
</P>
<P>
 Service: Good, if perfunctory SKIN SPA 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the upper level of the Courtyard Shops in Encino, Skin Spa is 
dedicated to French-style face and body treatments. The entire space -- from 
the peach walls to the sisal floor coverings -- smells heavenly and is utterly 
immaculate. It offers the most private experience of any I visited. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arrival, I am given a locker key and a bag containing a Japanese-style 
cotton robe and a pair of spa slippers with those massaging little teeth on the 
soles. The changing room is outfitted with neatly arranged hair brushes, 
curling irons, blow dryers and sterilized combs. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for my treatments (I've signed up for the Spa de Provence I 
package), I sit in the dry sauna, adjacent to the changing room, for about 10 
minutes. Then esthetician Maria Edding leads me to the treatment suite, three 
connected rooms that alleviate the need to parade around the facility to 
receive services. 
</P>
<P>
 My first service is the Salt Glo. Edding applies a peach-colored salt compound 
to dry skin. The abrasion is delicate and relaxing. My skin is rinsed with a 
hose, then cleansed with a highly aromatic mango cleanser. 
</P>
<P>
 The next stop is the hydrotherapy tub for more lymph-gland cleansing. This is 
accompanied by a serious underwater massage with a hand-guided jet. 
</P>
<P>
 The tub has fewer jets than the one at the Amadeus Spa, but is wider, longer 
and more comfortable. It's in a peaceful, candlelit room and a Moor Mud 
compound for sensitive skin is added to the water. Much to my relief, the mud 
is enhanced with fragrant oils. I am massaged on both sides of my body with the 
jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Two glasses of water and half a cookie later, I move into the Niagara room. 
This water-treatment process features alternating hot and cold water Swiss 
Needle streams spraying from shower heads lining the ceiling and walls. The 
streams of water are needling, indeed. I dash in and out. There is also a 
single tunnel of water that springs forth from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The pounding is tough to endure yet invigorating. The experience ends with a 
light application of a hydrating gel.  
</P>
<P>
 This spa is one of the best for hanging out a bit. The intimate outdoor spa 
deck has tiny private cabanas and is surrounded by privacy walls. There is a 
unisex whirlpool (bathing suits required) and honor bar with complimentary 
coffee and water. Lunch can be ordered from the neighboring Tribeca and eaten 
on the deck table. 
</P>
<P>
 Spa patrons can lounge on the chaises, use the dry sauna, Niagara and Swiss 
Needle Shower for as long as they like. I recline on the chaise and flip 
through a few magazines before driving home. 
</P>
<P>
 Total cost of treatment: $100 
</P>
<P>
 Ambience: Excellent 
</P>
<P>
 Service: Excellent VERA'S RETREAT IN THE GLEN 
</P>
<P>
 The final stop on the day spa tour is Vera's Retreat in the Glen, nestled in 
Beverly Glen near Mulholland Boulevard. Though it doesn't call itself a day spa 
-- there are no hydrotherapy baths, saunas or whirlpool facilities -- Vera's 
Retreat offers the most popular body, face, hand and foot treatments offered 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is clean and quite luxe, with etched glass panels accented with 
peach and mauve tones. I change into a cotton gown and am covered from the 
shoulders down with a sheet and a blanket on a narrow bed-style table. Soothing 
background music relaxes me. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Fisher begins the Deluxe European Facial by cleansing my face, analyzing 
it and cleansing it again. She then applies a light peel made from papaya 
extracts. 
</P>
<P>
 She steams my face, performs the necessary extractions (ouch) and then turns 
on a high-frequency wand to tone and exfoliate. She mixes two masks together 
and applies them. Then she cleanses the face to prepare for the delightful 
facial massage. 
</P>
<P>
 To my surprise, Larissa Pasternak tiptoes in like Tinkerbelle and massages my 
feet. Fisher's strokes are firm and assured, while Pasternak's are light and 
soothing. I feel I am getting incredible mileage for my spa dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 One hour later, my face feels smooth and velvety, if not a bit red from the 
extractions (typical for sensitive skin and fortunately not permanent) and my 
feet are invigorated, too. I leave this retreat having been delightfully 
pampered from head to toe, exactly as things should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Total cost of treatment: $50

THE STYLE FILES / SPECIAL FASHION ISSUE; THE PLEASURES; THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE 
BEAUTIFUL; WHY WE LOVE FASHION SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I love fashion shows. There is no better way to spend an hour. Which is one of 
their charms -- they don't last very long. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all shows are created equal. There are big-ticket spectaculars, local 
charity affairs, dog parades (not to be confused with dog shows) and nightclub 
shows. The best -- those staged by high-rolling designers -- are sumptuous and 
free. The worst are midnight horror fests at local nightclubs. Most fashion 
shows fall in between. 
</P>
<P>
 What they all have in common, though, is the minimal effort required on the 
part of the audience. Watching a fashion show is the sport of slugs. In fact, 
it helps to be mildly comatose (which is probably why the nightclub shows still 
exist). All you have to do is dress appropriately and clap politely.  
</P>
<P>
 The lights go down. The music comes up. And volleys of the world's most 
beautiful people come striding down the ramp. They want you to look at them, 
blatantly scrutinize everything they have on, the way they wear their hair and 
the color of their lipstick. It's like being in the high school cafeteria and 
checking everybody out, except you don't have be surreptitious about it.  
</P>
<P>
 Deciding who looks the best or has the most fabulous hair is encouraged. And 
unlike the Miss America pageant, the models are not expected to twirl a baton 
or answer questions about world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of the clothes has little to do with whether the show is good. 
I've seen exquisite gowns through half-closed eyes and pieces of dreck that 
looked stunning. The models make the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a reason Naomi, Cindy, Linda and Christy are called super models. 
It's not just because they have mile-and-half-long legs or charming beauty 
marks. They are super models because they can make a canvas pup tent look like 
the perfect answer to your wardrobe needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Schiffer can't even walk, for heaven's sake. She has the gait of a 
hobbled horse and yet she looks wonderful and the clothes she wears look 
wonderful and you actually believe that you, too, would look wonderful if only 
you had that marabou-trimmed burlap bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are times when designers make clothes that are so beautiful, so 
clever or so innovative that you don't notice the models and just marvel at the 
garments. Fashion editors have been known to cry, so moved were they by a 
fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I have never been reduced to tears, but I have been inspired, awed 
and uplifted -- and there wasn't a collection plate in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of sitting in the audience, I've picked up a few fashion show 
pointers: 
</P>
<P>
 * On arrival, check out the chair before you sit down. You don't want to 
squash a perfectly good goody bag. The appropriately named bags are usually 
given at designer or a department store shows and contents can vary from a 
couple of ounces of the headliner's fragrance to Major Accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Fendi, the Italian leather and fur company, was famous for giving great 
goodies. Then, in the late '80s, Fendi did some belt-tightening and decided not 
to give handbags at its seasonal show. Fendi guests, editors and store buyers 
disguised their horror at seeing the empty chairs. But when no one was looking, 
they stuck their heads between their knees and pulled up the skirts of the 
folding chairs, hunting for the elusive graft. A few anxious souls, hoping to 
find the gift horse's larynx, even tore the slipcovers off the chairs, sure 
that the Fendi's were playing hide 'n' seek with the treats. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch the crowd. The politics of seating at a fashion show can be quite 
Machiavellian. Usually the press gets the best seats, unless it's a charity 
affair and then the chairmen get front row center. At store shows, the 
preferred seats go to the big spenders. 
</P>
<P>
 At the designer shows in New York, Paris and Milan, the magazine editors get 
the front row -- though they're hardly the best seats for viewing the clothes. 
Between the editor and the end of the catwalk are about 200 photographers who 
are inclined to stand the entire time, toss empty film boxes over their 
shoulders and dump camera bags on the feet of the holiest of scribes. But the 
bob-locked elite would never retreat to safety of Row B. At fashion shows you 
are either front row or forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny dramas play out in the few seconds before a show begins. Best moment in 
recent history: the first public meeting between Grace Mirabella (former editor 
of Vogue and now Mirabella magazine) and Anna Wintour (her successor at Vogue). 
The 15-second encounter was dissected for days. Mirabella always came out the 
winner. She made the overtures, she carried the brief chat period and she 
exited at the perfect moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the time some lesser being sat in the seat of CNN's fashion 
caster, Elsa Klensch. Madam had a very vocal hissy fit, but it was impossible 
to identify the culprit without asking everyone to stand. The show did not go 
on until Elsa was given a special chair in the middle of an aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fashion shows always start late. Perhaps models aren't ready or one of the 
front-row seats hasn't been claimed. The garment business is full of people so 
full of themselves they must make an entrance. Their antics hold up the show as 
they cat-and-mouse each other to see who will be the last to enter.

CALIFORNIA DATELINE / PATT MORRISON: SNAPSHOTS OF LIFE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. ; 
TOO-TALL CAMBRIA HOUSE TO COME DOWN A FOOT OR TWO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After much public anger over an architect's flubbed math, the owners of a 
Cambria coastal house under construction have decided to sink it rather than 
swim against the local tide. 
</P>
<P>
 A measurement error and a plus that should have been a minus left Bill and 
Jean Thompson's house 18 inches taller than San Luis Obispo County's coastal 
plans allow. Rather than squeezing the second floor, supervising planner Mike 
Druze said, the owner has opted to have the house lifted, then drop the 
foundation the necessary inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cambria is a small community and people tend to get irritated at people who 
break the rules and get away with it," Druze said. The owner felt "he'd have to 
live with this hanging over his head, having gotten away with something other 
people didn't get away with. They want to live in this house." 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have to give him credit: He wasn't so upset about the money--it was 
more a problem of, 'Gee, everybody's gonna hate me, I'm not really that kind of 
person.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Is this Cambria, or Bedford Falls? 
</P>
<P>
 * Avocado Season 
</P>
<P>
 Our state is the heart of avocado country, producing 95% of the nation's crop. 
During the 1993 crop year (from November, 1992, to October, 1993), Americans 
consumed an estimated 300 million California avocados. Here are our top four 
avocado-producing cities for that year.

 Bigger bighorn: For the chance to clamber over rock and through scrub to bag 
one of California's 3,900 desert bighorn sheep, some unidentified Southern 
California Nimrod-businessman bid a record $110,000 at a fund-raising auction 
of state big-game hunting tags. The Nelson bighorn, a protected game mammal, 
capers about in 40 California mountain ranges, and the record price paid to 
bring one down goes to reintroduce his horned brethren and related threatened 
species into areas whence they have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for that money, you could get seven sheepskins from UCLA. 
</P>

 Sic transit Gloria's husband: A recent New York Times Sunday magazine story 
misspelled the name of not-too-long-gone California Gov. George Deukmejian.

 The scarlet number: Felons would have to face up to their offenses, and so 
would everyone else, if an initiative measure gets to the November ballot, and 
beyond. First-time violent or armed parolees would have to wear 
doctor-implanted numbers, half an inch high and red, under the right eye. 
Second offenders would add another set of numbers to the left cheek, and 
three-strike parolees would wear yet more digits on their foreheads. It will 
take 384,974 signatures to get "Release From Custody. Facial Implant" on the 
ballot.

 Nine lives or term limits? Kiefer Tennenbaum will not be permitted to run for 
mayor of Berkeley. The objection: no signature, notarization or proof of voter 
registration on his application. No one minded that Kiefer is a cat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham, Martin and the Beaver: During a discussion about the merits of 
letting convicted felon Michael Milken teach at UCLA, University of California 
Regent Roy T. Brophy told about the time 30 years ago when, as president of a 
suburban Sacramento school district, he objected to allowing high school 
students out of class for a speech by that 1960s radical, "Martin Cleaver." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody said anything, but when Brophy mentioned again "the kind of opposition 
that I got to my position with Martin Cleaver," another regent couldn't bear 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Eldridge," he said. (It's the latest indignity for Cleaver, the former 
Black Panther, who recently suffered a head injury in an assault .) 
</P>
<P>
 Brophy later said his error was certainly not, as some thought, a case of 
mistaken identity with Martin Luther King Jr., whom Brophy called "a saint." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the hell I was thinking about." 
</P>

 Star '90--and '94: Who's that man in the Kathleen Brown-for-governor 
commercial? Why, it's Darryl Young, legislative consultant to state Sen. Tom 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica). But wait: Isn't Hayden running for governor, too? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. But Young (whose family is "very confused. They said, 'We thought you 
worked for Hayden' ") is actually in reruns. Four years ago, on his lunch break

campaign. The revival doesn't bother him. And his environmentally minded boss 
shouldn't object either: It is recycling. EXIT LINE

 "I'm not a libertarian, I'm not a Republican or a shrill, weird person. I'm

 --San Jose State environmental studies professor Frank Schiavo, who recycles 
so assiduously that he hasn't put out the trash for 15 years. In a local 
variant of the federal practice of paying farmers not to grow crops, San Jose 
insists that Schiavo pay them the standard $13.95 a month even though he sets 
out no trash. (The man is clearly a threat to public order; what would happen 
if no one had any garbage?)

HUGH YORK; HAIRSTYLIST AND MAKEUP ARTIST OF CELEBRITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hugh York, a Coty Award-winning Hollywood hairstylist and makeup designer for 
such celebrities as Candice Bergen, Cher and Farrah Fawcett, has died. He was 
53. 
</P>
<P>
 York died of cancer March 10 in his Los Angeles home, friends said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Ashland, Ore., and raised there and in Scottsdale, Ariz., York gained 
experience at Lily Dashe and Saks Fifth Avenue in New York before moving to 
Saks Beverly Hills in the mid-1960s. There, Bergen selected him as her 
hairstylist for a film, and he quickly won a following among Hollywood 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Cher devoted a chapter in her recent book to the makeup styles York developed 
for her, and Fawcett credited him in her autobiography for creating the look 
she made famous on the "Charlie's Angels" television series and in commercials 
for Wella Balsam hair care products. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a layer or shag, but a special kind of graduation all around," York 
said in 1977 of Fawcett's hairstyle. "It takes hot curlers, rollers, lots of 
pampering and care." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1970s, York was host of a nationally syndicated television program 
called "Total Image," offering advice on hairstyling, makeup and fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beauty is not from the neck up," he frequently said. "It is the total woman." 
</P>
<P>
 At his own salon, Hugh York & Associates, York served such clients as Dame 
Judith Anderson, Diahann Carroll, Edie Adams, Diana Ross, Sophia Loren, 
Princess Grace, Margaux Hemingway, Cheryl Tiegs and Cybill Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 He created looks for men as well, and his clients included Robert Stack and 
Neil Diamond as well as many politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades ago, York commanded fees of $1,500 plus expenses for consultations 
with local and national politicians in New York, Washington or California. The 
service involved styling hair and makeup and selecting fashionable eyeglasses 
and a wardrobe that could cost thousands of dollars but would look as though a 
voter could buy it off the rack. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to gauge the look both to raise money by and to sell to the American 
public," he once said. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates ended up, he said, "wearing their own identity. That's why I have 
been called an image-maker." 
</P>
<P>
 York is survived by his mother and stepfather, Alice and Raymond Bacus, and a 
sister, Betty Lou Sweeten.

 MAGNET APPEAL: It's time for Valley schools to apply to become magnet schools, 
and you can bet they'll be standing in line. Why not? Principals say they get 
lower absenteeism and higher staff morale.(A1) . . . It can also be a great 
recruiting tool for coaches. Cleveland High and North Hollywood High became 
hoop powerhouses after going magnet.

 RESPECT: CalArts might be going through some tough times these days, holding 
classes off campus while recovering from quake damage. But that doesn't stop 
the Valencia school from getting some pretty good national ink. The latest 
issue of Rolling Stone spotlights CalArts as one of the nation's top art 
schools. "We were delighted to be included," said a school spokeswoman, adding 
classes should resume on campus in August. 
</P>
<P>
 FRIZ IS FIRST: OK, maybe this isn't Oscar night, but it's still pretty 
impressive. Isadore (Friz) Freleng, the animator (above) who gave us Bugs 
Bunny, Daffy Duck, Sylvester and the Pink Panther, will receive the lifetime 
achievement award Saturday at the first Santa Clarita Valley International Film 
Festival. . . . The festival runs today through Thursday. See Valley Life! Page 
3. 
</P>
<P>
 BOOKS R US: Looking for that obscure novel you can't wait to consume, or that 
rare collector's item the major book chains don't carry? Well, look no further. 
The Valley can probably help you. . . . From Glendale to the West Valley, 
there's a surprising range of used-book stores offering everything from L. 
Frank Baum to back issues of Collier's magazine. See Valley Life! Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 SAFE SCHOOLS: L.A. schools aren't the only ones with a security problem. In 
the Antelope Valley, 116 high school students have been recommended for 
expulsion this school year. . . . Some administrators suggest surveillance 
cameras, telephones in every classroom, and a 10-foot high wrought-iron fence.

 BIG EASY SOUND: New Orleans and San Juan Capistrano aren't sister cities, but 
they do have at least one thing in common: St. Joseph's Day -- this Saturday -- 
when the swallows annually return to Mission San Juan Capistrano from their 
winter migration. St. Joseph's Day is also a day of festivities in New Orleans. 
. . . It was in honor of the legend of the swallows that New Orleans musician 
Leon Rene in 1940 composed "When the Swallows Come Back To Capistrano." It was 
a huge hit for both Glenn Miller and the Ink Spots.

 LATE ARRIVAL: Most teams at this weekend's state high school basketball finals 
will be in Oakland a day or two before their games, but not the Brea Olinda 
girls. They'll fly up Saturday morning, play at 2:30 p.m. and then spend the 
night after the game in a hotel. . . . "The one year we flew up the night 
before, we lost," Brea Coach John Hattrup explains. "It's not because of 
anything we do, it's because everyone around you on the (hotel) floor is 
keeping you up."

 HERE SHE COMES? Anaheim Arena folks were hoping for Barbra Streisand to sing 
at last summer's grand opening, but she wasn't doing concert work at the time. 
Since then, though, she's wowed them on stage in Las Vegas. So she's set for an 
upcoming cross-country tour and negotiating with the Anaheim Arena to include 
multiple shows there. The tour starts April 20 and Streisand's Anaheim dates -- 
if agreement is reached -- would likely be in late May.

 FUNNY BONES: Brooklyn-born Yaakov Kirschen, who appears here today, started 
his career as a children's book illustrator and gag cartoonist, often for 
Playboy. But in 1971 Kirschen moved to Israel, and is now its most famous 
cartoonist with his "Dry Bones" strip. His fame reached a new level this year, 
with his highly acclaimed "Trees, the Green Testament," a cartoon history of 
the Jews in Israel. . . . He signs copies at the Golden Dreidle gift shop in 
Costa Mesa, starting at 11 a.m., and speaks at the University Synagogue in 
Irvine at 7:30 p.m.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; INVISIBLE BUT ALWAYS THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were few in number, only a dozen or so, and hidden from view most of the 
time, the way America prefers its homeless. But this week the state Department 
of Transportation evicted the squatters from their longtime encampment near the 
San Diego Freeway at Beach Boulevard after complaints from nearby businesses 
that some of the homeless were shoplifting and breaking into cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Those evicted were not just told to hit the road. In a good move, 
representatives of the nonprofit Mental Health Assn. of Orange County gave the 
homeless information about assistance, including shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the association's program coordinator, Paul Wager, underscored the depth 
of the homeless problem in Orange County when he noted that there is not even 
one bed available for every 10 people homeless in the county. Wager correctly 
pointed out that not enough resources are being allocated to help the homeless. 
With understatement, he called it a "tough situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans also followed its sensible policy of warning the homeless of 
impending evictions, notifying them several days in advance of what was coming. 
But it is difficult to see why the agency could not have waited several 
additional days, since some of the homeless said they had been there for three 
or even five years. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also hard to see why the Huntington Beach police could not have tried to 
determine just who among the homeless were the alleged criminals, and arrested 
them, rather than sweeping out all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who were forced to move said the crime was the fault of a few bad apples 
passing through, not the long-term residents, a view supported by advocates for 
the homeless who were aware of the encampment, in oleander and acacia bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Homeless Issues Task Force recently estimated the number of homeless in 
the county at 12,000, 30% to 50% of them children. Ground was broken two months 
ago for the county's first shelter for the mentally ill homeless, but much more 
needs to be done to help people who may disappear from view but who will not 
just go away.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: GAINING POLITICAL CLOUT IN NUMBERS; WITH THE STATE 
RAIDING LOCAL COFFERS, NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR GARDEN GROVE TO LEAVE LEAGUE OF 
CALIFORNIA CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RHONDA J. McCUNE, Rhonda J. McCune is president of the Orange County 
division of the League of California Cities and a member of the Buena Park City 
Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Garden Grove's decision recently to withdraw from the League of 
California Cities would be perplexing at any time, but is especially so now. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities across California lost more than $700 million over the past three years 
as local revenue was redirected by the Legislature to schools to relieve state 
government's deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss to Orange County cities topped $89 million. Garden Grove's loss 
totaled $4.35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction of local finances led to layoffs, cutbacks in services provided 
by cities and painful efforts to modestly raise revenue locally in some cities 
to protect high-profile community programs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the state deficit climbing into the billions, Sacramento's revenue grab 
could have been much bigger. The key to protecting local revenue is that cities 
across the state work together to develop ways in which to offer municipal 
services more cost-effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The League of California Cities is a statewide association of municipal 
governments that represents city interests before the state Legislature and the 
governor. The organization is like a chamber of commerce or professional 
association that works to promote the interests of its members and the 
efficiency of its profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every city in California -- 469 of them -- belongs to the league. The 
association offers the only formal opportunity for cities across the state to 
work together to promote efficient municipal government, consensus on the range 
of issues that impact local government, and representation before the state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Those activities have resulted in funds for more police on the streets and 
dollars to fix the local roads themselves. The league has also been 
instrumental in achieving reforms on redevelopment, worker's compensation and 
open meeting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 On the local level here in Orange County, we carry on the strong work done by 
the statewide league. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County division of the league complements the statewide 
organization by creating a forum where area cities can debate regional issues, 
build a consensus, and make their concerns and recommendations known to a 
variety of regional agencies and the County of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 We come together monthly to discuss issues of mutual concern suggested by our 
member cities, hear speakers on topics of interest or who challenge our cities 
to look at local government in new ways, and vote on public policy issues and 
positions taken by our organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The division also toils to implement the league's statewide strategy on the 
state budget deliberations in an effort to deliver local government's message 
directly to our legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in 1993 we organized and carried out face-to-face meetings 
between our mayors and their state senators and assembly members. The point was 
to underscore the dramatic fiscal impact state diversion of local revenue was 
having on our cities and their ability to provide services to their residents. 
</P>
<P>
 We also used these meetings to highlight innovative approaches taken by our 
cities individually to provide services and manage with less revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 These ideas, exchanged and developed individually by cities across the state, 
resonate with elected officials in a hundred different California communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The League of California Cities provides a great opportunity to share ideas 
and approaches that can become the catalyst for more innovative programs and 
encourages their implementation statewide.  
</P>
<P>
 This kind of innovation exchange strengthens and streamlines local government 
in California. Our ability to be effective with less is enhanced when we share 
our ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 These are just some of the reasons the League of California Cities is an 
important part of the local government landscape. Membership in the 
organization is absolutely critical to sustain the strongest and clearest voice 
possible for cities and to provide the framework and opportunity for cities to 
continue to innovate and improve local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities face exceedingly uncertain times in California as we grapple with 
declining fiscal resources and ongoing threats to divert local revenue to state 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the time to be drilling holes in the bottom of our own lifeboat.

SCREEN STYLE / OSCAR PREVIEW: VERDICT FOR 'INNOCENCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suffering from a serious case of Oscar fever, all we can think about these 
days are hoops, corsets, bustles, bonnets and hacking jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 (Allow us to also inject a note of disappointment about a nominee list that 
left off Ruth Carter for "What's Love Got to Do With It.") 
</P>
<P>
 Who will capture the prize for best costume design Monday night? Here's a 
recap of the potential winners and our assessment of their chances. 'The 
Remains of the Day' 
</P>
<P>
 Credits: Jenny Beavan and John Bright (who together designed "Maurice," "The 
Bostonians," "Howards End" and shared an Academy Award for "A Room With a 
View"). 
</P>
<P>
 Challenge: Dressing a butler and a housekeeper in 1930s England, plus a 
houseful of servants whose wardrobe is quite dull. 
</P>
<P>
 Solution: Consulting Queen Elizabeth II's former butler to get the details 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumph: Not prettying things up. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom Line: Although they're pets of the Academy, Beavan and Bright would 
probably require a few more yards of brocade to take home another prize. 'The 
Piano' 
</P>
<P>
 Credits: Janet Patterson ("The Last Days of Chez Nous"). 
</P>
<P>
 Challenge: Establishing a look for unlikely lovers in priggish times and a 
rough locale -- the 19th-Century New Zealand bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Solution: Severe hair, hats and hooped skirts for a woman who wants to break 
out of social confines, and do-your-own-thing whaler garb and native facial 
tattoos for the earthy man. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumph: Dark and indelible fashion images, especially the black bonnets. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom Line: Possibly too low-key, sullen and weird. 'Orlando' 
</P>
<P>
 Credits: Sandy Powell ("The Crying Game"). 
</P>
<P>
 Challenge: Leaping through four centuries of costume history. 
</P>
<P>
 Solution: Go for the gold -- extravagant, theatrical costumes that look as if 
they stepped out of royal portraits. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumph: Glitzy 17th-Century babe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom Line: Too esoteric -- not enough voters saw the movie. 'Schindler's 
List' 
</P>
<P>
 Credits: Anna Biedrzycka-Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenge: Dressing as many as 20,000 extras in a Nazi forced-labor camp plus 
one sharply turned-out Nazi party member. 
</P>
<P>
 Solution: Defining the elegance of men's fashion against the haunting imagery 
of incarcerated Jews in threadbare prison uniforms and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumph: Photo-realism in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom Line: As impressive as the costumes are, this category could prevent a 
"Schindler" sweep. 'The Age of Innocence' 
</P>
<P>
 Credits: Gabriella Pescucci ("Indochine," "The Adventures of Baron 
Munchausen," "The Name of the Rose," "City of Women"). 
</P>
<P>
 Challenge: Swathing upper-crust New Yorkers with predilection for operas and 
balls, circa 1870. 
</P>
<P>
 Solution: Clothes with a lush yet prim quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumph: A feast of details -- gloves, furs, embroidery, feathers, jewels. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom Line: The bigness and sheer beauty of the movie, plus the Martin 
Scorcese imprimatur, make it the likely snob-appeal favorite for Academy 
voters. BETTY GOODWIN

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: A PEEK INTO STARS' PRIVATE LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who cares about the romantic and financial triumphs and travails of 
celebrities? We'd rather peek in their closets. Which brings us to a magazine 
called In Style. 
</P>
<P>
 Brought to you by the people who make People, In Style presents home decor, 
fashion, beauty and fitness as practiced by the most-probably rich and the 
most-certainly famous. Time Inc. executives announced Wednesday that after 
several well-received test issues, In Style would go monthly this June. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did the publishers come up with yet another way of pandering to our 
collective appetite for celebrity fawning? Partially, they said, from the 
popularity of such People special issues as "Best and Worst Dressed People." 
</P>
<P>
 We can't wait for a tour of "Hollywood's Worst Decorated Houses." 
</P>
<P>
 Mommy Dearest: Keeping track of Heather Locklear's possible TV moms has been, 
well, trickier than following a tacky nighttime soap opera. Veteran model 
Lauren Hutton was initially dubbed most likely to succeed as Amanda's mother on 
Fox's "Melrose Place." Perfect, we thought, since the character is supposed to 
run a modeling agency (the setting for a summer spin-off called "Models Inc."). 
 
</P>
<P>
 But Hutton -- who's hot, hot, hot -- had other plans. Then Raquel Welch was 
said to be in negotiations for the role. Talk about dueling divas. Now we learn 
that former "Dallas" star Linda Gray will play the modeling agency doyenne 
starting April 27. Just keep her away from those handsome young hunks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Body Buddies: Oscar nominee Angela ("What's Love Got to Do With It") Bassett's 
penchant for Escada was born on the gym floor. It seems the actress was working 
out next to Denzel Washington's wife, Pauletta Pearson Washington, and the 
subject turned to award-winning garb. Washington talked up Escada -- whose 
standout black-and-white striped gown, you'll recall, she wore to last year's 
Oscars. Bassett followed suit, dressing for the recent People's Choice awards 
in a gold lame Escada jacket, brocade vest and chocolate-colored tuxedo 
trousers. She's selected Escada for the Oscars, too. But the details are under 
wrap till Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing Their Hearts on Their Sleeves: Speaking of Oscar wear, some men are 
opting for tuxedo shirts that subtly broadcast their social awareness. Elton 
John, Leonardo DiCaprio and Steve Tisch are among those expected to be clad in 
Eton of Sweden's $225 "Stop AIDS" shirt. That message is woven into the white 
tone-on-tone fabric. The shirt's buttons are tiny clocks signifying that time 
is running out for those living with AIDS. Proceeds from the sale of the shirts 
(available at Sami Dinar in Beverly Hills, Ron Ross in the Valley and Steigler 
in Century City) go to national and local AIDS charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sneak Attack: Oregon-based Adidas inaugurated its hip new 
entertainment/promotional offices in West L.A. last Friday night with a party 
for film and television costumers, buyers, store owners and a flock of kids 
dressed in what only can be described as hip-hop, phase two. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogging the spotlight, though, was the next generation of sneakers. Good 
thing, since even Wall Street is sounding the death knell of all brands of the 
once-coveted, overpriced high-tops. The Adidas Adventurer looks more like a 
Birken-sneaker -- a sandal with a rubber toe -- while the Intruder is clearly a 
deconstructionist's dream: The insides are on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 A Beautiful Friendship: It's well-known that QVC mogul Barry Diller was 
introduced to the world of home shopping by longtime friend and glamour girl 
par excellence Diane von Furstenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Diller has returned the favor, naming Von Furstenberg creative planning 
director of Q2, the new high-end QVC Inc. subsidiary. Von Furstenberg will 
concentrate on special projects with high-profile designers. 
</P>
<P>
 Up and Out: A 70-year-old British underwear manufacturer has taken the push-up 
bra a step further. The Gossard Super-Uplift bra -- billed as the "ultimate 
cleavage creator" -- will be introduced today in the United States at Saks 
Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills. (Just in time for the Academy Awards!) The bra 
($40) arrives with some amazing statistics: 46 separate components, 28 sewing 
stages, 18 months of research and development, an assortment of removable pads 
for extra lift and volume.  
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't implants be simpler? 
</P>
<P>
 The Host With the Most: In Hollywood, the power players like to hide their 
idiosyncrasies behind the somber mantle of an Armani suit. Eccentric dressing 
is a reckless gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never wear that," agents and producers tell Allan Ludwig, longtime 
maitre d' at the Grill, when they peruse his whimsical combination of a deeply 
colored, patterned tie, one of his collection of 200 lapel pins and an 
oversized '40s-style pin-striped suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes you can," he tells them. "It just takes courage." 
</P>
<P>
 Before his stint at the Grill, Ludwig was a haberdasher, and old habits, he 
says, die hard. "I buy for myself as I bought for my store. I'd rather buy one 
good item than several ordinary ones. If someone gave me a Nicole Miller tie 
right now, I'd give it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, regulars have contributed to Ludwig's extensive tie 
collection. From Warner Bros. exec Terry Semel and his wife, Jane, came the 
earliest version of Looney Toons ties. A never-produced prototype for a 
Spider-man tie was a gift from New World Television's Barbara Corday. Sharon 
Gless and husband Barney Rosenzweig gave him the Tabasco-bottle-covered tie he 
wore to work Wednesday on the background of a dark teal blue shirt. "They know 
my taste," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy Talk: Speaking of fashionable dining, isn't it a happy coincidence that 
the Elite modeling agency and Maple Drive restaurant share the same office 
complex? That way, those studly married actors can ogle young, new-in-town 
models and wolf down their power lunches at the very same time. One such guy 
(an Oscar nominee) felt it necessary to circle one such gal twice for a 
close-up gander. Or maybe he wanted to make sure she wasn't "In the Line of 
Fire."

YOUR WHEELS / RALPH VARTABEDIAN: NEED A GREASE JOB? KNOW YOUR CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The job of greasing the suspension system on your car had all but disappeared 
in recent years. Now, greasing is making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, many auto makers eliminated greasing points because they 
believed that the quality of grease had so improved it would last the life of 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
 But motorists knew better. What "lifetime lubrication" often meant was the 
grease would last 60,000 miles, then the part would wear out and a $300 repair 
was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors was one of the few that continued equipping its cars with 
grease fittings. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical GM car today has grease fittings on the lower ball joint, the two 
pivot points on the lower control arm and on both tie-rod ends. So, for 10 
cents worth of grease, you should be able to get substantially more life out of 
the front suspension system. 
</P>
<P>
 Most foreign manufacturers long ago stopped manufacturing systems with grease 
points. Ford and Chrysler also abandoned grease points in the 1980s, although 
they equipped the suspension parts with plugs that could be removed for the 
installation of grease fittings. Now, they too are equipping many of their new 
cars with fittings. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason auto makers abandoned grease fittings was highlighted in a letter 
from a Lakewood reader, who asked why the lithium grease he bought was being 
phased out of auto parts stores. Lithium grease was introduced in the 1960s as 
a major improvement over conventional petroleum greases. But lithium grease was 
still subject to breakdown from water and had a limited life. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1980s, the petroleum industry came up with greases that were water 
resistant and stood up to very high temperatures without melting, leading car 
makers to believe that they could permanently seal suspension parts and 
constant velocity joints. 
</P>
<P>
 Car makers continue to seal constant velocity joints but are reverting to 
grease fittings on suspension parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for car owners is that many service stations don't have a clue 
about which cars have grease points and which don't. 
</P>
<P>
 You should check your owner's manual to see whether it recommends periodic 
greasing of the suspension and specifically tell your mechanic what your car 
needs during an oil change. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: I have a 1988 Buick LeSabre. The fuel pump on this car fails about every 
7,000 miles. The car has been towed into the dealer six times. What do you 
suggest? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Buick says it does not have a history of failures on the LeSabre fuel pump, 
although you are not the first LeSabre owner to write me about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 You must have a separate problem that is causing the fuel pumps to fail, 
because it is improbable that you received six defective pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 First, make sure the electrical circuit to the pump is not open and the pump 
is properly grounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Also make sure the fuel lines are not restricted in any way that would 
overburden the pump.

INTO THE NIGHT / BILL HIGGINS: THE GRONKSTER FINALLY GETS INSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Wednesday's opening reception for "Gronk! A Living Survey 
1973-1993" at the L.A. County Museum of Art. The artist, born Glugio Gronk 
Nicandro, is the first living Chicano artist to have a solo show at LACMA. 
"What this is about," said one guest, "is it's about time." 
</P>
<P>
 Prehistory: In 1972, Gronk and two other artists tagged a LACMA wall with 
graffiti after a curator made a comment to the effect that all Mexican art is 
folk art. "I think this is the same as '72," Gronk said about his opening, "but 
I'm on the inside defacing now." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Marie Acosta-Colon, the director of San Francisco's Mexican 
Museum, described the crowd as "anyone who's anyone in the Chicano/Latino 
visual arts community." Among the guests were Gronk, John Valadez, Patssi 
Valdez, Solomon Huerta, Al Nodal, Armando Duran, Daniel J. Martinez, Mario 
Tamayo, Dan Saxon, Fred Weisman, Ed Leffingwell, Stanley Grinstein and Mike 
Woo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buzz: Love the show, joyous over the locale. When was the last time they 
had to flash the lights and have security guards sweep the courtyard to get 
guests to leave a LACMA party? "This is a big night because it's been waiting 
in the hearts of many people," said artist Yolanda Gonzalez. "It's a chance for 
us to show our true colors at the museum. This is just the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: A buffet of Mexican food from Somerset. "They asked me if I wanted 
ethnic food," Gronk said. "I thought matzo balls with guacamole would have been 
a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Gronk said he didn't go into art "to be in museums and galleries. It's 
always been about making something. The attention and all the other things I 
never expected. When I come back to the studio I feel normal -- whatever that 
means. To me it's being a lounge potato with a cup of coffee and a piece of 
pie." 
</P>
<P>
 Noted: Among the written comments in the guest book: "How fitting, Gronk and 
Picasso"; "Gronk is an angel amidst vultures," and "Andale! Gronkster!"

BOOK REVIEW / EDUCATION; EDUCATION SEPARATES GIRLS FROM THE BOYS; FAILING AT 
FAIRNESS: HOW AMERICA'S SCHOOLS CHEAT GIRLS BY MYRA AND DAVID SADKER ; 
SCRIBNER'S, $22, 352 PAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coeducation is not equal education, as the authors definitively demonstrate in 
their systematic examination of America's public schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Myra and David Sadker spent 20 years collecting evidence to support their 
disturbing thesis, sending trained observers into classrooms, videotaping 
teachers and students in action, and interviewing boys and girls about their 
attitudes toward school and each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their results are profoundly unsettling, the Sadkers present the 
facts succinctly, briskly and with occasional forays into wry humor. The 
children help. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to imagine what life as a girl might be like, a middle school boy 
offers: "I'd have to . . . shave my legs and wear heels. I'd buy a Thighmaster, 
but every day I would grow more cellulite." A girl in the same group responds 
eagerly: "I'd order Playboy. Buy beer. Talk dirty. I wouldn't have to deal with 
date rape. I wouldn't mind it for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, not much fun in the facts the Sadkers' research uncovered. 
Although girls surpass boys academically in the early grades, outdistancing 
them in all the elementary subjects, by middle school the boys have not only 
caught up but have begun to sprint ahead, not only in math and science, but in 
the subjects where girls had the most conspicuous lead: spelling, reading, 
history and geography. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys are louder, faster, more obstreperous, demanding and receiving a 
disproportionate amount of the teacher's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Shown videotapes of their classrooms, teachers who pride themselves on their 
fairness are stunned to see how much more often they call on boys, how 
patiently they listen to them, how generous they are with their praise. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls get compliments on their new sweaters and pats on the head for the 
neatness of their workbooks, but the boys receive explanations, corrections, 
and the leading questions that encourage them to keep thinking and talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignored, their contributions acknowledged by a hurried "OK" or "Uh-huh," the 
girls become increasingly tentative and hesitant. By junior high, they're 
prefacing every classroom comment with a disclaimer -- "I'm not sure if this is 
what you mean," "I'm probably wrong" -- answering with a question when they 
answer at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend accelerates in high school when the gender gap becomes a chasm. 
Desperately concerned with what others think, terrified of being branded with 
the expletives reserved for the brainy girls, they conceal their intelligence 
and downplay their achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Their grades may remain high, but as the Sadkers demonstrate, good grades are 
too often given for behavior rather than for ideas. When these A students are 
confronted with the Scholastic Aptitude Test (now somewhat revised as the 
Scholastic Assessment Test), their ladylike habits of difference and deference 
are a distinct handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys, who have fewer inhibitions about speaking up and being wrong, will guess 
if they don't know; girls will often leave blank a multiple-choice box unless 
they're sure of an answer. A guess had a 25% chance of being right; a blank has 
none. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors remind us that the SAT is the outgrowth of a test designed during 
World War II to sort out Army recruits, and despite extensive revisions, it 
remains "male friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 In its original incarnation as the Army Mental Test, it didn't do a 
particularly efficient job of matching soldiers to appropriate jobs, and half a 
century later, it still rewards speed and penalizes thoughtfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 The appalling statistics are emphasized and enlivened by anecdotal material. 
Reluctant as we may be to admit so counterrevolutionary a notion, it seems that 
boys and girls arrive at intellectual conclusions by different routes. The male 
route may be more direct, the female more circuitous. Although both sexes will 
eventually offer an equal number of correct answers, standard tests are 
weighted in favor of speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more counterrevolutionary is the finding that when girls are no longer 
competing with boys for the teacher's attention and with each other for the 
boys' approval; when they're not overly concerned with their appearance or 
whether a right answer will devalue them as prom dates, they speak up loudly, 
clearly and correctly in class. 
</P>
<P>
 This reversal happens when girls attend single-sex schools. Although the 
authors stop short of recommending a wholesale return to sexually segregated 
classrooms, they demonstrate that in certain cases -- for boys as well as girls 
-- separate education produces amazing results.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a number of 19th-Century educators stumbled on to that, but for 
many of the wrong reasons. Now that we have a fresh set of motives, the idea 
might be worth re-examining.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'THE PAPER': IT'S ALL IN THE DELIVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Who remembers the great writers of the city room?" a disgruntled reporter was 
once moved to complain. "In a single generation they are one with Nineveh and 
Tyre." A sad fate, and one newspapers themselves, dismissed by heartless 
futurists as road kill on the information superhighway, may someday be forced 
to share. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if everyone else gives up on newspapers, Hollywood never will. Not 
for nothing has Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's "The Front Page" been made 
and remade three times. At least once a decade the movies fall in love with the 
romance of print journalism, and the studios' latest crush, "The Paper," 
directed by Ron Howard, shows the reasons why. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of a single day in the life of a great, albeit fictional tabloid, 
the New York Sun (motto: "It Shines on All"), and Henry Hackett (Michael 
Keaton), its God-I-love-this-business metro editor, "The Paper" is rife with 
the motion and commotion that characterize all newspaper films. With their 
insistence on what's timely and their fear of time running out, deadline-crazed 
daily papers have a built-in thrill-of-the-chase quality that the movie 
business understandably finds irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of manic "get-that-story" energy is especially suited to knockabout 
comedy and, when "The Paper" relaxes and concentrates on jolt-a-minute madness, 
it's as crowd-pleasing as "Parenthood," Howard's most-successful ensemble 
venture to date. 
</P>
<P>
 But Howard and screenwriting brothers David Koepp & Stephen Koepp (one a 
"Jurassic Park" writer, the other a Time magazine senior editor) are not 
content to make us laugh. They are determined to thrust as many serious moments 
into this picture as it can take, and it can't take very many at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Paper's" breathless doings begin with a brief prologue showing a pair of 
black teen-agers in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn discovering a car 
containing two slain white businessmen and, via a bit of bad luck, becoming 
prime suspects for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Hackett is also introduced not at his best, waking up fully clothed 
(don't worry, he's been chasing stories, not women) next to his extremely 
pregnant wife, Martha (Marisa Tomei). She's a former Sun reporter who has quit 
the paper for motherhood and days full of worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha is especially concerned about an interview Henry has with the tweedy 
New York Sentinel, an upscale place that runs headlines like "Nepalese Premier 
Won't Resign" while the Sun concentrates on murder and mayhem. Martha wants him 
to forsake his tabloid roots for security, but Henry, not surprisingly, is not 
so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he gets to his office (whose tip of Manhattan location is patterned on 
the New York Post as surely as the Sentinel is on the New York Times), it's 
obvious why Henry hates the thought of leaving. For the Sun is staffed entirely 
by lovable comic eccentrics, zany types like a gun-toting columnist named 
McDougal (Randy Quaid) and a reporter who cares more about his orthopedic chair 
than any story he's ever worked on. 
</P>
<P>
 Since this makes staff meetings as hectic as a Marx Brothers movie, it's the 
newspaper situations that are the most consistently entertaining parts of "The 
Paper," never lacking for laughs even when Henry leaves the building and goes 
for that interview with a stuffy Sentinel editor (deliciously played by 
Spalding Gray). 
</P>
<P>
 Policing the zoo at the Sun are a particularly odd couple. Editor in chief 
Bernie White (Robert Duvall, engaging even when he's coasting) is Henry's 
mentor, a crusty troglodyte who barks more than he bites. Glamorous managing 
editor Alicia Clark (Glenn Close) is Henry's bete noir, a bottom line-oriented 
ice queen whose motto is "if everybody loves you, you're doing something 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of the day for this group is deciding whether that unlucky pair's 
arrest for the Williamsburg murder can command the front page. Henry, who's 
heard rumors that even the cops disown the bust, doesn't want to ruin the boys' 
lives if the story is wrong. So Bernie gives him five hours to prove what the 
audience already knows, that the kids didn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 While this would be enough for most movies, it's not for Howard and the 
Koepps, who toss prominent subplots to everyone within reach. Bernie is given a 
malignant prostate "the size of a bagel" and an estranged daughter, Alicia has 
worries about her career and her looks, McDougal has a vengeful city parking 
commissioner on his trail, and, of course, Henry has a career crisis as well as 
a wife who fears, like the first Mrs. Charles Foster Kane, that she may have to 
name the paper as a co-respondent. 
</P>
<P>
 That welter of incident, helped by lively acting, especially from Keaton, who 
despite the ensemble nature of things really carries this picture, means that 
at minimum "The Paper" never stops for breath long enough to be dull. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this tumult also leads to a feeling of shellshock, of having every 
contrivance not nailed down thrown at the audience. Part of the problem is that 
many of these subplots, like Henry's marital difficulties, are no more than 
Hollywood serious, dealing with adult situations in a bogus way that would be 
better avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 Not helping is Howard's insistence on underlining everything. Though he likes 
the idea of mixing serious moments with his comedy, the director doesn't trust 
that his audience will catch the change of pace. So manipulative situations end 
up being milked with overly insistent music and a too-careful tone. Like a 
novice reporter trying to cram too much into a lead, Howard overreaches and 
leaves a taste of frustration along with the pleasant laughter.

engagement at Orange County's Anaheim Arena in late May as part of a tour that 
begins April 20 in London, sources said Thursday. Streisand's return to live 
concerts Dec. 31 in Las Vegas after a 22-year break set a pop box-office record 
of $7 million. She is expected to play between five and eight U.S. and Canadian

the festival's goals, which is to recognize filmmakers whose work expresses 
"hope and respect for the positive values of life." "Schindler's List" was 
cited in the Top 10 by 81% of the 117 critics responding. Runner-up was "The

 Post-Olympic Deals: Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding has signed a contract 
with producer Zev Braun for a movie on her life story, Braun said Thursday. The 
deal was completed Wednesday, hours before Harding pleaded guilty in a 
Portland, Ore., courtroom to charges of "hindering prosecution" into the 
investigation of the attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan. There was no word on how 
much money Harding got for the deal, but Wednesday's court action makes 
Harding's tale "even more interesting," Braun said. He was unsure if the 
project will land on television or be released theatrically. . . . Meanwhile, 
gold-medal speedskater Dan Jansen has signed a deal with Warner Bros. 
Television that will pay him $750,000 if the company succeeds in producing a TV 
movie about his life. No network has been lined up yet.

from Wednesday's actual court proceedings will be edited onto the staged 
proceeding, which features flamboyant attorney Domenic Barbara, whose clients 
have included Joey Buttafuoco and Jessica Hahn, defending the skater. MUSIC

poor country like the Philippines. On Thursday, Pavarotti said he has strived

tenor will also donate an undisclosed portion of his fee to a charity for

MOVIE REVIEW; THE GAGS THAT HIT MARK ARE REASON ENOUGH TO GET 'NAKED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Reviewing "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult" is a bit like reviewing a joke 
book -- you don't want to give away the jokes. Some of the gags are 
side-splitters, some just sit on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But the film would have to be a great deal worse to prevent "Naked Gun" 
die-hards from lining up. It is, after all, the movie that finally confirms 
what we suspected all along -- Leslie Nielsen's Lt. Frank Drebin looks exactly 
like Phil Donahue from the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Drebin is retired in this third series installment but a mysterious bomb plot 
brings him back into action. He's also having marital problems with his wife, 
Jane (Priscilla Presley) -- and no movie hero was ever less suggestive to 
marriage counseling than the blank-faced Drebin. 
</P>
<P>
 He's in his deadpan element going undercover to root out terrorists. Stops 
along the way include a maximum-security prison, a sperm bank -- he becomes a 
heavy donor -- and finally the Academy Awards show. The Oscars have never been 
trashed in quite this way in a movie before, though the Oscar show itself has 
often come close. The shenanigans go on for too long, but, then again, so does 
the telecast. It's hard-edged realism, "Naked Gun"-style. 
</P>
<P>
 The usual faces turn up again, including George Kennedy and O.J. Simpson, and 
a few new ones too, like Fred Ward as a square-jawed baddie; Guess? jeans model 
Anna Nicole Smith, whose pneumatic enticements threaten to smother Drebin; and 
Ellen Greene, in a way-too-small cameo. (Greene is a great comic actress in a 
cast of Great Pretenders.) The regulars all have the good humor of performers 
who know they're playing out an annuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Peter Segal is new to the series -- he's new to feature-film 
directing -- and he doesn't vary much from the formula. He keeps the gags 
popping, and there are always funny little doodles taking place in the corner 
of the frame (like the convict who pole vaults to safety during a prison yard 
scene). There are also a couple of misfires. We don't really need a joke 
involving a black prisoner in a riot imploring us with the words, "Can't we all 
get along?" That's the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naked Gun 33 1/3," of course, functions best in the fake one. One hopes this 
"Insult" won't be final.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'DANGEROUS GAME' A RAW, COMPELLING MORALITY PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Dangerous Game" is a perfect title for an Abel Ferrara picture, for he has 
always taken risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, with "Body Snatchers," he pulled off a distinctive remake of a 
classic that had already been effectively remade once. Though he started his 
career with exploitation material, he has always managed to find meaning in the 
most extreme violence, and in such corrosive films as "The King of New York" 
and "Bad Lieutenant," he has created heroes seeking spiritual redemption in a 
world of escalating brutality. Typically for Ferrara, it's a film of 
no-holds-barred language, passion and rage, but it's a move away from genre, 
more a chamber drama than action movie in which violence is more psychic than 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
 With the compelling and explosive "Dangerous Game," Ferrara moves out of the 
streets of Manhattan and onto a no-less-volatile Hollywood movie set, where the 
New York-based Eddie (Harvey Keitel) is directing Madonna's Sarah and James 
Russo's Frank in an intimate, emotion-charged drama of marital crisis. The 
husband has lost a $200,000-a-year job just as his wife has had a "revelation," 
a religious experience that causes her understandably, to say the least, to 
question their sex-and-drug orgy lifestyle. He's too threatened by this 
profound change in his wife to consider even remotely that there is any 
validity to her new feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 When we meet the director and his actors, they come across as witty, low-keyed 
professionals, but the intensity of the material they're working with begins to 
exact its toll. Sarah, whom Eddie describes as "very L.A.," proves to be an 
actress of great concentration and resource, whereas Frank finds he actually 
must drink and party hard in order to play the husband. For Eddie, making the 
film becomes a ruthless quest for truth, but the more he demands of his actors, 
the more he unwittingly brings about a confrontation with himself, which is the 
heart of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing new, especially in the movie-within-a-movie context, in 
exploring the ways in which life imitates art and how the line blurs between 
fantasy and reality. But rarely have the movie within the movie and its making 
seemed so authentic; dogged honesty saves Ferrara and his inspired writer, 
Nicholas St. John, from the pretentiousness that can afflict such pictures.  
</P>
<P>
 While "Dangerous Game" inevitably causes us to speculate as to how 
autobiographical it is, there is no question as to how very personal it 
becomes. To what extent Eddie is an alter ego for Ferrara is not, however, as 
important as the simple fact of Eddie's presence, of a director, the key 
creative force, being onscreen: It adds another layer of meaning to the film, 
involving him in what becomes for him his own morality play. In any case, 
Ferrara makes it clear that those on both sides of the camera must tap deeply 
into themselves if their work is to have any truth to it. Beyond this, Ferrara 
considers the paradox, as in "Bad Lieutenant," that the act of self-redemption 
may inevitably be also an act of self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Now at the height of his powers, Keitel is the ideal Ferrara star, his 
control, volcanic emotions and endless capacity for expressiveness and 
revelation matching up with those very qualities in Ferrara himself. For 
Madonna this may be the long-awaited breakthrough film, for as never before she 
reveals the vulnerability as well as the strength of both the actress and the 
character she is playing. She also surely represents for Eddie the perilous 
lure and irresistible temptation of Hollywood itself.  
</P>
<P>
 Doubtlessly, there will be those who find the highly verbal "Dangerous Game" 
too bombastic in its anger and profane language, too risky a business, but it's 
arguably Abel Ferrara's most mature work to date.

 While it's true that great children's films work equally well for adults, what 
about middling kid flix? If you're over the age of 10, "Monkey Trouble" isn't 
the kind of film you would want to spend much time with. It's indifferently 
made -- to put it mildly. The microphone actually drops into frame in a couple 
of scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has something going for it that kids will probably eat up. It's about a 
9-year-old girl, Eva Gregory (Thora Birch), who longs for a pet against the 
wishes of her parents (Mimi Rogers and Christopher McDonald) and ends up with 
more than she bargained for -- a capuchin monkey. 
</P>
<P>
 The monkey, whom she nicknames Dodger, literally falls into her path one day 
while she's strolling through the park. On the run from the Gypsy (Harvey 
Keitel) who trained him to pick pockets and loot homes, Dodger becomes Eva's 
secret playmate. She keeps her formerly messy room so spic-and-span that her 
parents never suspect a thing (though her stepfather, allergic to pet fur, 
can't explain his sudden sneezing). 
</P>
<P>
 Director Franco Amurri and his co-screenwriter Stu Krieger work in a lot of 
standard storybook elements: Eva has a baby brother she wishes would go away 
and a stepfather she can't warm up to. Keitel's Gypsy is a gold-toothed 
scalawag who prances after her like he was a reject from a touring company of 
"Peter Pan." (Keitel is once again indulging his appetite for grunge, but in 
kiddie-sized bites.) If the filmmakers had worked some storybook magic into the 
filmmaking, "Monkey Trouble" might have been a joy. 
</P>
<P>
 But they do all right by the monkey, whose real name is Finster and who was 
trained for the film by Mark Harden. He's a wizardly little performer, and he's 
in practically every scene. And the bond that develops between Eva and Dodger 
feels just right. It's a convincing evocation that every kid feels about his 
first pet.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CARTER'S WORDS GET LOST IN AURAL BARRAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's nobody named Carter in the duo known as Carter the Unstoppable Sex 
Machine, which played the Roxy on Wednesday. The two south London 
singer-guitarists are known as Fruitbat and Jim Bob, and today's rock world 
provides no context for their punk-pop broadsides. 
</P>
<P>
 So they roam like mad prophets without portfolio, proclaiming not so much from 
passion and purpose, it appears, as from helpless compulsion -- Jim Bob, the 
tall one with the foot-long top-knot, kept telling the Roxy audience how old 
and tired he feels. Then he'd launch one more deafening, hyperactive tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter USM is a last stronghold of punk-forged social-political comment. They 
name the names of the pop stars and politicians they attack in their cascading, 
wryly witty lyrics, but you couldn't hear many of the words on Wednesday. 
Behind their wall of guitar noise, a drummer provided propulsive beats, and 
they crammed in swelling, swirling recorded keyboard sounds that made it sound 
a bit like a punk-rock Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
 They also neutralized their sentiments with their self-mocking manner, coming 
off as a sort of Monty-Python-meets-the-Clash. Loony tunes can be a valuable 
antidote to rock's self-important tendencies, but Carter USM's impact had worn 
thin by the end of its set.RICHARD CROMELIN

 ** 1/2 Billy Taylor, "It's A Matter of Pride," GRP. Taylor's 50th anniversary 
in jazz is celebrated with infectious enthusiasm on this new release.Typically, 
it is Taylor's compositions, rich with chromatic changes and rhythmic shifts of 
mood, which stand out above his sometimes choppy piano work. Other high points 
include Grady Tate's warmly sincere vocals on two Taylor originals dedicated to 
Martin Luther King, and Stanley Turrentine's demonstration of his 
still-impressive skills as a mainstream improviser.

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good, recommended), four stars (excellent). DON HECKMAN

NEW RELEASES / JAZZ; A NEWCOMER SIZZLES, A VET PHILOSOPHIZES

 Careers in jazz are often easier to start than they are to maintain. This 
week's group of new album releases is headed up by the debut of a promising 
pianist, and the latest CD from a veteran saxophonist whose career is 
undergoing a resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 *** CYRUS CHESTNUT, "Revelation" Atlantic  
</P>
<P>
 The pianist, in his early 20s and probably best known for his work with singer 
Betty Carter, makes an auspicious debut, leading a trio with bassist 
Christopher Thomas and drummer Clarence Penn. Chestnut has a ton going for him: 
an authoritative, resonant touch, a supple sense of swing, a bluesy swagger, 
compelling lyricism and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Chestnut wrote 10 of the album's 11 pieces, and they range from torrid 
("Dilemmas") to tender ("Sweet Hour of Prayer"). The pieces occasionally sound 
derivative; "Macdaddy," for example, has an Oscar Peterson-ish tone -- but 
listen to how softly Chestnut plays his instrument. The title track, performed 
unaccompanied and with a stylistic nod to Bud Powell, is nonetheless a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Chestnut adopts Ahmad Jamal's mannered delicacy and Gene Harris' 
blues grit, but he's young, and with considered effort this artist will 
undoubtedly blossom into a distinctive voice that will add vigor to the world 
of piano trio. New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars 
(fair), three stars (good, recommended), four stars (excellent). ZAN STEWART

 *** 1/2 CHARLES LLOYD "The Call" ECM  
</P>
<P>
 This album, much like Lloyd's previous releases for ECM, is replete with 
contemplative airs, pensive confessions and sweeping vistas that reflect the 
saxophonist's own philosophical journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd's tenor is at once curiously imaginative and assertive, and played in 
tones that carry an ember's glow.The space he leaves between phrases becomes as 
important as the phrases themselves when Lloyd, playing with a thoughtful 
deliberateness, allows each note time to settle into view. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Bobo Stenson complements this approach with lyricism and spacious 
harmonics. His unaccompanied introduction to "Song" tacks breezily here and 
there until he sails ahead on bassist Anders Jormin's puffy walk. In Billy 
Hart, who shades and colors each tune with responsive snare and cymbal accents, 
Lloyd seems to have found the perfect drummer for his dreamy episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything here is sedate. "Imke" finds Lloyd ready to rant, powered by 
Hart's swelling tom-tom exchanges. And Lloyd's tenor flurries on "Brother on 
the Rooftop" show that he can pack even the most tribal, free-form rhythms with 
meaning and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good, recommended), four stars (excellent). BILL KOHLHAASE

 *** 1/2 Kitty Margolis, "Evolution," Mad-Kat. From the label that gave us 
Madeline Eastman comes another underrated singer.She cooks in bop 
("Anthropology"), is lyrical on ballads ("Where Do You Start?"), superbly gutty 
on blues (a quasi-hysterical "Please Send Me Someone to Love"). Joe Henderson 
guests on several tunes, among them Wayne Shorter's "Footprints" and Cedar 
Walton's "Firm Roots," for both of which Margolis supplied sensitive lyrics. As 
Jon Hendricks' liner notes point out, Margolis possesses impeccable taste and 
selectivity. (Available from Mad-Kat Records, P.O. Box 420253, San Francisco, 
94142).

 *** 1/2 Don Braden, "Wish List," Criss Cross. The tenor saxophonist, who has 
played with Wynton Marsalis and Tony Williams, is one fine composer and 
arranger.Even if he hadn't hired some of the cream of today's jazz crop -- Tom 
Harrell (trumpet), Benny Green (piano), Steve Turre (trombone) and Christian 
McBride (bass) -- this album of originals and just-so arranged standards and 
jazz classics would still sound superb. A bubbling hold-back rhythm keeps 
"Father Time" popping along, and "Just the Facts" is a firebrand blues. The 
leader's tone -- bright and beaming -- is the first thing you notice about his 
playing, but soon his surging lines demand attention. Harrell's squiggly yet 
driving ideas are always riveting, and Green really opens up here and stretches 
out. New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), 
three stars (good, recommended), four stars (excellent). ZAN STEWARD

JAZZ NOTES: ETTA JAMES TONES IT DOWN FOR A SALUTE TO LADY DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Etta James, a 1993 inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, has built her 
four-decade-plus career on such blues and R&B hits as "Tell Mama," "At Last" 
and "I'd Rather Go Blind." 
</P>
<P>
 But James, 57, has long had an affinity for songs recorded by Billie Holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Billie was cool," James says. "My mother used to play nothing but Billie 
Holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 To document her admiration for Holiday, James has released "Mystery Lady," a 
collection of 11 torch songs associated with Lady Day. In a plain-spoken, 
unembellished manner that is a far cry from her typically impassioned blues 
renditions, James delivers such standards as "The Man I Love," "You've 
Changed," "Body and Soul" and "Lover Man" with remarkable authenticity and 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances on "Mystery Lady" are bolstered by the presence of pianist 
Cedar Walton -- his characteristically natty arrangements set James up ideally. 
Also on hand is creamy-toned tenorman Red Holloway, who adds several alluring 
solos. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her years in the blues and R&B trade, James says the album isn't 
really a stretch. " 'Mystery Lady' really is Etta James. I love these songs. 
I've been singing them all my life," she says. "And early on, I sang jazz with 
a group called the Peaches. We sounded like the Hi-Los. We liked Gerry Mulligan 
and Chet Baker." 
</P>
<P>
 James performs with her own band tonight at the Strand in Redondo Beach, and 
Saturday at the Ventura Theatre in Ventura. She says that although she admired 
vocalists like Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington, she never wanted to 
become a jazz singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz took too much discipline," she says. "You have to come in at the right 
place, which is different than me singing the blues, where I can sing, 'Oh, 
baby,' if there's a pause in the melody. With jazz, you better leave that space 
open, or put in something real cool. I learned that again at this session." 
</P>
<P>
 The singer met Holiday just once, when they were both performing in New York 
on an NBC radio show called "Jazz Plus Blues Equals Soul." James saw Holiday, 
who was late for the broadcast, being helped through a door by two men. 
Holiday's hands were incredibly swollen, James says, and when the singing great 
noticed her staring, she leaned over and said conspiratorially, "Just don't 
ever let this happen to you." 
</P>
<P>
 "The funny thing was, it did happen," James says, referring to her earlier 
problems with drugs. "Maybe she saw that wildness in my eyes and sensed that I 
might be that type. Later, when I was on drugs, I often thought about that." 
</P>
<P>
 * Etta James plays tonight at 8:30 at the Strand, 1700 S. Pacific Coast 
Highway, Redondo Beach. Tickets, $25. (310) 316-1700.  
</P>
<P>
 * New Gig for Taylor: Pianist Billy Taylor has been named artistic director 
and host of a new series of broadcasts to be co-produced by National Public 
Radio and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcasts, which will be taped in Washington and begin airing on NPR in 
fall, 1995, are dubbed "Billy Taylor's Jazz at the Kennedy Center." The series 
is "designed to acquaint listeners with the rich history and diversity of 
American jazz" and will feature Taylor's trio in performance with guest stars. 
It will also include conversation and commentary. Frank Wess, Jon Hendricks, 
Arturo Sandoval, Kenny Burrell and Clark Terry are among the scheduled guest 
artists.

JAZZ REVIEW; REDMAN SHOWS THE FATHER CAN PLAY AS WELL AS THE SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dewey Redman, the tenor saxophonist who opened Tuesday at Catalina Bar & 
Grill, exemplifies a phenomenon very rare in jazz: a first-generation musician 
who finds renewed prominence on the strength of his son's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is most unlikely that the senior Redman would have been booked for 
this engagement had his 24-year-old son Joshua not scored a surprise hit in the 
same venue a few months ago, Dewey Redman has a splendid track record of his 
own.It includes seven years with Ornette Coleman and stints with Charlie Haden 
as well as with his own group Old and New Dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Redman's power lies in his versatility. During a set composed of ultra-long 
excursions, he moved from an early be-bop tune, "Half Nelson," to a pop 
standard, "Everything Happens to Me," followed by a ferocious examination of 
what sounded like the avant-garde scene circa 1960. It was typical of Redman's 
unpredictability that he shifted gears from this experimental foray into "Take 
the A-Train." 
</P>
<P>
 Redman's ability to idiom-hop might be characterized as a two-edged sword, 
since the fits and starts of his Ornettish interludes seem somewhat out of 
kilter with his warmer moments, in which his sound evokes memories of such 
pioneers as Don Byas. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it is an ironic truth that Joshua Redman, at this early stage of his 
career, displays more consistent maturity than his father. Of course, 
consistency is not what Dewey Redman has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The accompanying group meets the challenge of his daring moods, with Kenny 
Kirkland outstanding on piano, Cameron Brown a fiery bass virtuoso, and the 
ubiquitous Ralph Penland on drums. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dewey Redman Quartet at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., 
Hollywood. (213) 466-2210. 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. through Sunday. $12 door charge 
($15 Saturday), plus two drink minimum.

THEATER REVIEW; CHAOTIC COMEDIAN ENLIVENS KANTER'S 'LAUGHING MATTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say the title, "Laughing Matters." You can change the meaning by emphasizing 
either the first word or the second. In Hal Kanter's show at the Westwood 
Playhouse, the emphasis is on the laughing.  
</P>
<P>
 This is primarily laughter for laughter's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanter has assembled four comics and thrown himself into the mix as the emcee. 
Unfortunately, he also tossed in an awkward first scene in which three of the 
comics play themselves, schmoozing "backstage" before performing at a fictional 
Los Angeles benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides cracking jokes, the three comics -- Marty Brill, Hank Garrett and 
Jackie Kahane -- discuss the tardiness and other legendary habits of a 
fictional colleague, one Freddie Sherman. This waiting-for-Freddie gag is 
supposed to provide an ongoing theme -- an embryonic narrative, even -- but it 
goes nowhere. The first scene establishes only that these men are not actors. 
They need the microphone, and they need to address the audience, not one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 But hang in there until the show itself begins, and you're likely to find the 
laugh meter moving up. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanter opens with remarks from behind a lectern at the side of the stage. He 
looks urbane, but he doesn't let this stand in the way of indulging in lowbrow 
material, and the contrast between his distinguished looks and the sillier 
jokes provides some of the comedy. Kanter doesn't try to hide the fact that 
he's reading from his notes. He makes his comedy writing so apparent that it's 
as if we're getting a close-up glimpse of the Hollywood gag machine at full 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Frizzy-haired Kahane is up next, and behind the mike he suddenly seems 20 
years younger than he did in the opening sketch. Not that his material is so 
fresh; most of it is vintage Borscht Belt, and some of it specifically 
addresses the travails of being in his mid-60s. But the last part of his act, 
when he yanks the mike off the stand and prowls the front of the stage talking 
about bits of common but crazy behavior, is more contemporary in delivery as 
well as in theme. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, the burly Garrett comes out. Introduced as a master of 
dialects, he verifies that description with his act. But his material is musty, 
and his habit of grinning and giggling at his own jokes -- endearing at first 
-- soon becomes something to be endured. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of Frankie Pace, supposedly as the replacement for the unseen 
Freddie Sherman, enlivens the proceedings considerably. Pace is a wizard of 
uncanny sound effects and goofy sight gags involving simple props drawn 
primarily from the suitcase he carries. He flings jokes at the audience at such 
a quick, yes, pace that the laughs blend into each other and approach comic 
chaos. He leaves us wanting more, perhaps because he realizes how hard it would 
be to sustain that kind of momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Brill concludes the evening, acknowledging how tough an act he has to 
follow, and he's right. His jokes are more topical than those of his 
predecessors, but they're not cutting-edge. In an age when Jay Leno and other 
late-night hosts crack a steady diet of political jokes, acts like Brill's 
don't add much. His reliance on ethnic jokes and gags about such comic 
has-beens as Jimmy Carter and Dan Quayle seems especially old-hat. 
</P>

HOME TECH / VIDEOS: VCRS GOOD ENOUGH TO CATCH 'RABBIT'; DON'T WANT TO SPRING 
FOR A LASER DISC? DON'T DESPAIR -- VIDEOTAPES OF THE DISNEY FEATURE ALSO HAVE 
THE NOTORIOUS SCENES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to know how weird this whole "Roger Rabbit" business has become? 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need a laser-disc copy of Disney's "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" to 
check out those notorious scenes. The videotape has the same sequences. 
</P>
<P>
 To see them, though, what's needed is a VCR with four heads -- fairly standard 
with stereo VCRs. The extra two heads provide the same high-quality 
freeze-frame and slow-motion capabilities you get with a laser machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the tape in the office, using freeze-frame and slow-motion, only one 
of the scenes seemed fairly lewd. The cartoon character of Baby Herman fondles 
a woman as he passes under her dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything else, though, is tame. On a graffiti-covered wall near a phone you 
can see very clearly, "For a good time call Allyson Wonderland." When Jessica 
Rabbit is thrown from a car after an accident, you can see for a split second 
that she's not wearing underwear. But it's not a close-up and you don't see 
defined sexual parts.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the news came out Monday about these previously undetected frames, 
emphasizing that they could only be seen on a laser-disc machine, every laser 
copy of "Roger Rabbit" in town seems to have been sold. At a Videotheque store 
on Sunset Strip this week, a man was walking up to customers in the laser 
section, saying he'd pay $200 for a laser copy that retails for $40. A woman at 
Lazer Blazer in West Los Angeles was offering $250. 
</P>
<P>
 For another $50 or so, she could get a four-headed VCR. Candy Movies 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers are reporting a huge run on John Candy movies since his recent 
death. All indications are that it will be a long run. Some retailers say many 
interested customers only know about a few of his films and are looking for 
guidance on what to rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a rough guide: His two best movies as a comic actor were "Splash," 
playing second banana to Tom Hanks, and "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," 
tormenting a fellow traveler portrayed by Steve Martin. Though he's fairly good 
in the slapstick "Uncle Buck," the movie is thin. Two of his funniest efforts 
were smaller parts in "Home Alone" and "Stripes." He stretched a bit -- rather 
successfully -- in 1991's "Only the Lonely," a sentimental tale of a mama's boy 
who falls in love. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy movies to avoid: "Brewster's Millions," "Summer Rental," "Volunteers," 
"The Great Outdoors" and "Who's Harry Crumb?" Marketing Classics 
</P>
<P>
 Always looking for ways to market its vast library of classics, MGM/UA is 
including a free documentary about some of its old movies when you buy certain 
films. Called "The Lion's Roar Magazine," it features behind-the-scenes clips 
from classics such as "Ben-Hur" and "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is to increase the customer base for classics, to inspire people to 
buy old movies," said George Feltenstein, the company's senior vice president 
and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 100,000 copies of the magazine just went on the market, attached to titles 
such as "Rain Man," "Casablanca," "Moonstruck" and "Thelma & Louise," which 
sell for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawback to this marketing scheme is its expense, which Feltenstein 
described as "considerable." The profit margin on old movies is already very 
small and gets even smaller with this costly documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the price of the movies raised to help pay for the documentary? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," Feltenstein insisted. If the documentary generates fan interest, 
he said they may come up with a new one every quarter. What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Gettysburg" (Turner). The stirring battle scenes make this four-hour Civil 
War drama worth seeing, despite the miscasting of Martin Sheen as Gen. Robert 
Lee and overacting by an impressive cast that includes Tom Berenger and Jeff 
Daniels.  
</P>
<P>
 "So I Married an Axe Murderer" (Columbia TriStar). In this wacky comedy, a 
husband (Mike Myers) is convinced that his wife (Nancy Travis) is a killer and 
that he's the next victim. Nonstop, low-brow silliness has its moments if 
you're in the right mood.  
</P>
<P>
 "Wilder Napalm" (Columbia TriStar). Weird comedy about two brothers (Dennis 
Quaid and Arliss Howard) who can start fires by telekinesis. They're at odds, 
partly over a woman (Debra Winger). Directed by Glenn Caron Gordon, who created 
TV's "Moonlighting." Strains to be offbeat and is occasionally charming but 
most often unsatisfying. Upcoming

 Just announced: Best picture Oscar nominee "The Piano," starring Holly Hunter, 
a best actress nominee, is due on May 25 from LIVE. Paramount's "Wayne's World

RESTAURANT REVIEW; BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG MENU AT COU COU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I took my accountant to lunch at the Cou Cou Grill. He had once lived in La 
Canada and not only remembered that the Cou Cou Grill used to be Reflections, 
but that it used to be the Chef's Inn, all dark wood and low ceilings, a 
serious place to drink. "I drank so much here one night," he said, "I forgot I 
was with my wife, went home and went to bed without her." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflections, a spin-off of Pasadena's Parkway Grill, brightened up the 
ambience. The Cou Cou, on the other hand, is more than a bit silly in terms of 
decor. The circular beamed ceiling is now exposed, painted white and lit with 
skylights. Throughout the dining room and bar, the wallpaper is busy, busy, 
busy, the color scheme hot pink and indigo. There are big stuffed dolls set 
here and there, and decorative wheeled toys, and a stuffed gorilla stuck up 
there in the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 With early bird specials, and theme nights such as Mariachi Night and Lobster 
Bakes, the Cou Cou also reminds me of country clubs I have known. At any rate, 
one can't imagine losing track of a spouse here: It's far too well-lit. 
</P>
<P>
 Local families with their well-dressed, well-behaved children can be seen at 
the Cou Cou, along with dates and older couples and business folk. La Canada 
Flintridge, one of L.A.'s more soignee suburbs, is also the home of Kevin 
Costner and countless Trojan engineers. Bruins, who may have slipped in for 
dinner after a game at the nearby Rose Bowl, should be easy to spot: They'd be 
the ones giving the natives nervous sidelong glances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cou Cou's food is not only better than most country club fare, it's pretty 
good in general -- if you don't order the shrimp. Even the salad bar has its 
virtues: The lettuce could be a bit fresher, but after you've piled a chilled 
plate with various beans, peppers, sprouts, bacon bits and cheeses, a 
good-natured man tosses it for you. This is a nice touch; somehow, a tossed 
multiple-ingredient salad is instantly more appealing and integrated than the 
standard mixed-food group heap. There's the usual selection of dressings -- the 
Italian has capers, an interesting twist -- and you can choose rice vinegar or 
balsamic vinegar. With some playing around, you could conceivably make yourself 
a pretty good salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Another house specialty is guacamole made at the table. A good ripe avocado is 
chopped and mashed in a molcajete ; salt, lime juice, cilantro, onions, 
tomatoes, and jalapenos are added upon request. Our guacamole chef was a bit 
heavy-handed with the salt -- he literally threw in a hefty spoonful -- but 
otherwise turned out a fresh, juicy and delicious mash, jalapenos on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Crab cakes are unusually good: crisp, with plump hunks of sweet claw meat 
embedded among the standard shred. The dip served with them, a chile-heated 
mayonnaise, is so good, we used it to enliven five tasteless boiled shrimp 
served in the cocktail. Shrimp were also tasteless in a scampi sauce with 
remarkably bland polenta. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrees are divided between a standard, permanent menu of old favorites, and a 
monthly menu of Abraham Figueroa's "chef's special creations." Monthly menus 
can have a theme -- there was a German month, recently -- and popular items, 
like a salmon en croute and so-called "honey-stung" baby-back ribs can evolve 
into permanent offerings.  
</P>
<P>
 Items from both the monthly and permanent menus are sound in design and 
execution. A simple grilled slab of halibut is juicy, satisfying. The waiter 
talked a friend of mine into trying the salmon en croute rather than the plain 
salmon steak. I was dubious, but the waiter was right: The fish, wrapped in 
puff pastry, was moist and not, as I feared, overcooked. 
</P>
<P>
 I ordered a mixed-game plate with one rather tough, though tasty, and 
disconcertingly pink wild boar chop and one tender, succulent, appropriately 
rare venison chop. My favorite item on the plate, however, was the vegetable: 
mashed "potato 'n' turnip." 
</P>
<P>
 Rotisserie chicken, perhaps because it was ordered late in the evening, was so 
dry, it was like eating string. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of dinner here is disappointing: Creme brulee with tasteless 
blueberries has a peculiarly weak custard, as if it had been made with skimmed 
milk. A mango sorbet is syrupy and freezer-burned. Decaf coffee is as weak as 
tea. 
</P>
<P>

HOME TECH / LASER BIN: JUDY GARLAND, BEFORE SHE MET THE WIZARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few releases in MGM/UA's growing catalogue of double bills are more 
ingratiating than the new "Judy Garland Double Feature" ($60), offering the 
delightful pre-"Oz" Judy. 
</P>
<P>
 1937's "Thoroughbreds Don't Cry" marks her first, but definitely not last, 
pairing with the exuberant young Mickey Rooney, and "Listen, Darling," a 1938 
romp with Freddie Bartholomew, Mary Astor and Walter Pidgeon, showcases an 
emerging, energetic talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-disc set offers a real bonus: a previously unreleased Garland 
rendition of a sparkling Arthur Freed-Nacio Herb Brown ("Singin' in the Rain") 
ditty called "Sun Showers." 
</P>
<P>
 Producers George Feltenstein, Allan Fisch and John Fricke's detailed 
production notes report that the song was originally to have been a showcase 
for Igor Gorin in "Broadway Melody." But, alas, it's taken this long to get an 
airing. It's a Garland number that should have been heard long before this, 
sounding something like "Over the Rainbow" crossed with "Singin' in the Rain." 
On this disc, it's played under a number of rarely seen beautiful publicity 
stills taken from 1936-38 that reveal a complex talented young girl growing 
into womanhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Also offered are previously unreleased audio takes of "Zing! Went the Strings 
of My Heart," which Garland first sang in "Listen, Darling." In 1934, the young 
Garland auditioned for MGM with "Zing!" and, listening to the unused versions, 
it's easy to see why studio executives searched long and hard to find the right 
vehicle for her. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Garland's takes of the song are presented here, mixed for stereo from 
multichannel recordings made in 1938. They're spotlighted on chapter stops, 
making them easy to find. The zippiest is a swing version, but that "was cut to 
a gentle chorus and a half for the final print." 
</P>
<P>
 Also included are four Garland takes of the unjustly neglected but catchy "On 
the Bumpy Road to Love," also featured in "Listen, Darling." A snappy song 
called "Got a Pair of New Shoes," a Garland number deleted from "Thoroughbreds" 
but presented for the first time on this disc, was also snipped when planned 
for Eleanor Powell in "Broadway Melody of 1938." The producers report that 
"bits of the song can still be heard in 'Broadway's' finale." 
</P>
<P>
 The films themselves are the harbingers of the kinds of films now churned out 
by the Disney factory or TV sitcoms centered on young teens, obviously geared 
to the talents of their young stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thoroughbreds Don't Cry," which introduced the Australian Ronald Sinclair as 
the next Freddie Bartholomew, gives a glimpse of '30s track life, with exciting 
races that put "International Velvet" to shame. A brash, no-nonsense Sophie 
Tucker also adds zip to the film. The film's trailer shows the no-longer-a-kid 
Bartholomew introducing young Sinclair as his replacement in the MGM stable of 
kid stars. You can actually hear his changing voice break during the 
introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, Darling" might be seen as an early-day "Sleepless in Seattle" -- kids 
try to find a suitable mate for a widowed mom (this time, she's poor, and would 
wed someone she doesn't love to make a suitable home for her brood). The 
ravishing Astor and the handsome Pidgeon are as charming as Garland and 
Bartholomew, whose acting ability apparently wasn't hampered by his growing up. 
In this film, he shows he would have made an appealing young adult actor. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 While "The Fugitive" videotape was blazing its way into stores, the 
letterboxed Warner Home Video disc of the Oscar-nominated film has quietly made 
its appearance on shelves at $40. As with other big-screen action-packed 
pictures, this handsome digital transfer with Dolby surround stereo sound turns 
your living room inside out. The thrilling Andrew Davis-directed set-pieces -- 
the train wreck, chases through sewers, streets and cityscapes -- dominate the 
room as the sound comes at you from every direction. It's also a more intimate 
experience on the small screen. The banding preserves the aspect ratio well, 
yet offers a good-sized picture on any 32-inch set. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Soderbergh's far more quiet 1993 "King of the Hill," by contrast, comes 
with relatively wide banding in the MCA Universal laser ($35), odd for such a 
contemporary film. Nonetheless, the muted, dark tones of the Depression-era 
story based on A.E. Hotchner's memoir are captured effectively, giving 
poignancy to the personal story of a 12-year-old's (Jesse Bradford) struggle. 
The affecting, if unjustly neglected, film featuring Jeroen Krabbe, Lisa 
Eichhorn, Spalding Gray, Karen Allen and Elizabeth McGovern cannot help but 
resonate to a 1990s audience watching joblessness, homelessness and 
hopelessness grow all around it. Laserbits 
</P>
<P>
 New Movies Just Out: "Judgment Night" (MCA/Universal, $35); "Wilder Naplam" 
(Columbia TriStar, $35); "Son of the Pink Panther" (MGM/UA, letterboxed, $35); 
"Gypsy" (Cabin Fever, $50).

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: RECAPTURING TIM HARDIN'S 'DREAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can argue about a lot of things when it comes to Tim Hardin -- starting 
with whether he was chiefly a jazz artist, as he maintained, or a folk artist, 
which is how the pop world generally viewed him. 
</P>
<P>
 But few people who have heard the poignant, often lonely, tone of the late 
performer's body of work would dispute the suggestion that he was one of the 
most affecting singer-songwriters of the modern pop era. 
</P>
<P>
 In his best moments, Hardin combined the confessional anguish of Hank Williams 
and the artful intimacy of Leonard Cohen -- and most of those moments are found 
in Polydor Records' new two-disc retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Hang On to a Dream: The Verve Recordings," the package contains all 47 
of the Hardin recordings released on Verve Records in the mid-'60s, including 
"If I Were a Carpenter" and "Reason to Believe." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the CD set offers 17 previously unreleased tracks, both Hardin 
originals and versions of such blues tunes as Jimmie Cox's "Nobody Knows You 
(When You're Down and Out)." 
</P>
<P>
 The latter is an especially moving number because the rise and fall outlined 
in the lyrics serves as an eerie reflection of Hardin's own troubled story, 
which ended in 1980 when he died at age 39 of a drug overdose in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If Tim Hardin's life had one recurrent theme, it was excess," Colin Escott 
writes in the album liner notes, chronicling the elements that caused the 
Oregon native to waste most of his talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took everything to the limits -- then stretched them. He ate in binges, 
drank to excess, smoked constantly, doped himself up excessively, loved 
suffocatingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Hardin's Verve recordings never sold enough to make the pop charts, 
it's reasonable to call the music in "Hang On to a Dream" a lost American 
treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for someone familiar with the songs through hit versions by artists 
ranging from the Four Tops to Rod Stewart, Hardin brings such a personalized 
longing to the lyrics that he makes you feel you are truly hearing them for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappointment is that the set doesn't include Hardin's post-Verve work on 
Columbia Records, where, in 1969, he had his only American chart hit with 
"Simple Song of Freedom." Ironically, the song was written by Bobby Darin, who 
had scored a Top 10 hit three years earlier with Hardin's "If I Were a 
Carpenter."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CROWDED HOUSE PLEASES FANS AT WILTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a band fails to play its best-known, best-loved songs in a concert, it's 
usually a sign of a major shift in direction -- and a major letdown for its 
fans. In Crowded House's concert at the Wiltern Theatre on Wednesday, the first 
of two nights there, it proved to be neither. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the absence of several sure-fire crowd-pleasers -- including "Don't 
Dream It's Over," the band's first and biggest hit -- the fans clearly enjoyed 
the abundant pleasures that have kept the band at the top of the power-pop pack 
since it formed from the ashes of New Zealand's Split Enz in 1986.  
</P>
<P>
 Primary singer-songwriter Neil Finn's bittersweet hooks are easy to get swept 
up in, just as the characters in his songs are swept up in the twisting eddies 
of romantic and spiritual fate. 
</P>
<P>
 And the mix of in-song melancholy and the between-song mirth of Finn and 
quick-witted mates Paul Hester and Nick Seymour remains a highly entertaining 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 The impression left Wednesday was that the old songs were discarded simply 
because the band tired of them, not because it's outgrown them. Besides beefing 
up its sound with the addition of guitarist-keyboardist Mark Hart, Crowded 
House has changed little over the years. In the arts, there's a very fine line 
between being consistent and being static, and Crowded House seems to be 
straddling it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crowded House plays tonight at the Arlington Theatre, 1317 State St., Santa 
Barbara, (805) 963-4408. Tickets are $22 and $19. 8 p.m. STEVE HOCHMAN

THEATER BEAT: 'DAUGHTERS' BOWS AT THE HUDSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is one hypnotic performance in "Daughters." Unfortunately for everyone 
else involved with the Los Angeles premiere of John Morgan Evans' excessively 
loquacious soap opera at the Hudson Theatre, this star never utters a 
comprehensible word and is only seen briefly during Act I. Confused, 
self-absorbed, utterly peripheral to the plot, Connie Sawyer's Old World 
grandmother mirrors our confusion.We can identify with her bafflement while her 
squabbling Italian American descendants stereotypically trespass on John 
Patrick Shanley's turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Mark W. Travis strains to make convincing the family's schizophrenic 
behavior, but the sentimentality only increases our envy of the lucky 
grandmother who dies between acts.

Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends April 17. $18. (213)

THEATER / JAN HERMAN; WAY OFF BROADWAY'S 'RED SCARE' IS WAY OFFBEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Commie menace marches on -- if not in reality, at least in "Red Scare on 
Sunset." Kitschmeister Charles Busch spares no effort to parody Hollywood 
cliches in his 1991 spoof of movieland pinkos during the early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Now on view at the Way Off Broadway Playhouse in Santa Ana, "Red Scare" takes 
us back before the Reagan revolution to the McCarthy period and shows the Evil 
Empire spreading its poison propaganda through dread Stanislavski method actors 
and other nefarious agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Central casting never had it so good. Over-the-top stereotypes abound. 
</P>
<P>
 There's pert blond starlet Mary Dale (Karen Kawolics), a right-wing die-hard 
who gives dainty tea parties. She is making a bio-pic of Lady Godiva. ("Can I 
help it if I'm pretty and have a flair for fashion?")  
</P>
<P>
 There's her adulterous husband, the alcoholic matinee idol Frank Taggart 
(David Walloch). He signs up for method-acting lessons but doesn't read the 
fine print on his contract. It turns out he has joined The Party. 
</P>
<P>
 There's his Slavic paramour Marta Towers (Annette Bravo), a Kremlin spy who 
peppers her sultry conversation with Yiddish phrases. She takes charge of 
Taggart's acting lessons. ("You were supposed to start scene study class and 
kill your wife.") 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the chief characters are right-wing radio celebrity Pat Pilford 
(Lisa Antablian) and her former boyfriend Mitchell Drake (David Rousseve, 
another Kremlin spy.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pilford is a born show-biz performer ("When I open the refrigerator and the 
light goes on, I do 20 minutes"). But her enthusiastic bedroom performances for 
Drake have left her vulnerable to Commie blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few years, Way Off Broadway has become a regular outlet for 
Busch's campy, off-the-wall comedies. This revival, a Southern California 
premiere, is the third since 1990 under the direction of WOB executive producer 
Tony Reverditto. (The other two were "Psycho Beach Party," a 
beach-blanket-movie parody, and "Times Square Angel," a Yuletide sendup.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some respects, this shoestring production is the most accomplished of the 
three. The set design, for example, shows exemplary attention to detail: a 
leopard-skin chaise lounge, period appointments, flag-painted flooring and the 
suggestion of a patio, which is framed like a miniature diorama in a 
living-room window. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the performers seem committed to their roles. One of them -- Ramsey 
Warfield, who plays several small parts -- actually shows real talent for 
characterization and dialect. (It's too bad he doesn't have more stage time.) 
And Antablian does Pilford with brassy theatrical style. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night this reviewer attended, however, the lighting cues were 
invariably out of sync. The effect was disconcerting, not just for the audience 
but for the performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reverditto went to the unusual length of calling the next morning to apologize 
for the foul-up. He explained that the lighting technicians were high-school 
volunteers whose attention had flagged. And he offered assurances that future 
performances would be more carefully cued. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is life in the amateur trenches. In fact, finesse has never been one of 
this basement theater's virtues. Way Off Broadway's attraction is quite the 
opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater is adjacent to a railroad track, for example, and one of the 
endearing features of its playbills is a note to patrons: "Attention: 'A train 
may occasionally pass by the theater. Do not be alarmed, it's not the big one!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The rumble of a locomotive bearing down on you can't help catch your 
attention, of course, giving Way Off Broadway productions a unique sensation 
regardless of their content. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there are compensations: the sound of be-bop jazz piped over the 
theater's speakers before and between acts or the Bohemian atmosphere of its 
underground warren of brick-lined rooms with their used-but-homey furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Way Off Broadway seems an extension of Greenwich Village more than 
anything else-for which, bravo.

THEATER BEAT: 'GIRL BAR': CALL IT A LITTLE-SEEN CLASSIC

 It's always happy hour in "Girl Bar" for Celebration Theatre patrons, even if 
it's never "Cheers." Nor is it a sedate "Last Summer on Bluefish Cove."Except 
for one straight girl who's cruising the wild side of feminism, Phyllis Nagy's 
women are so far out of the closet they're beyond lesbian chic. This nightclub 
may seem like a gay subculture, but "Girl Bar" is open to everyone, thanks to 
poetic dialogue, charismatic performances and Valerie Landsburg's user-friendly 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 But voyeurs beware: These women are not sedate wallflowers. Lipstick-lesbian 
Charlotte (a dazzling Michelle Agnew) offers warnings while two women dance 
slow and close. Jean (a heartbreaking Iona Morris) confesses: "I have a problem 
and it isn't very pretty. I'm a black dyke. Bad enough to be dyke in this city, 
worse to be a black woman. . . . Home is where the girls are." 
</P>
<P>
 Drew (a dynamic Sharon Murray) calls herself a "throwback." Claire (a poignant 
Jennifer Edwards) is the pitiful Ivy League scholar phoning Jane Austin and 
Virginia Woolf. Katherine (an intriguing Ellie Gerstein) is the mother "who 
left my son in a previous life." 
</P>
<P>
 All of them know what they want: Mollie, the straight girl. Does Mollie (a 
sizzling Lisa Robin Kelly) know what she wants? There are plenty of volunteers 
willing to guide this waif toward self-realization. The eternal dance of 
seduction becomes the evening's motif, the nature of desire its fascinating 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Can this be a 5-year-old play that's only been produced in Tampa? In its West 
Coast premiere, "Girl Bar" seems like a modern classic of eroticism. r.

THEATER BEAT: 'CUT FLOWERS' WILTS AT VICTORY THEATRE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before being gathered, Sage Allen's "Cut Flowers" received too much sunlight 
or not enough water. In either case, it's a wilting bouquet of weeds and 
mismatched colors.Whatever message the florist hoped to deliver got lost on the 
way to the Victory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, "Cut Flowers" seems to be a light comedy about old friends (a 
baffled Joanna Miles and Salome Jens) reuniting for dinner after a troubled 
period. Then it shifts radically into menacing drama as drug-addicted children 
(a riveting Zilah and Chris Jordan) invade the suburban kitchen. So we accept 
the play as a women's "Desperate Hours," only to suddenly be transported into 
Eugene O'Neill-styled soul-searching confessions. The final, shocking impact is 
due more to chaotic dramaturgy than to Jules Aaron's erratic direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps "Cut Flowers" should be returned to the garden and replanted.

THEATER BEAT: EARLY MILLER FROM A NOISE WITHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1947, a novice playwright named Arthur Miller was struggling to learn his 
craft. Those struggles mercifully succeeded with his first hit play, "All My 
Sons," an earnest tragedy about a corrupt factory owner.It's a labored and 
dated tome, primarily of interest to academics. But if any theater can inject 
vitality into Miller's old-fashioned morality tale, it would be Glendale's 
gifted repertory company A Noise Within. 
</P>
<P>
 But even this company can't overcome the play's clunking construction. They 
only triumph during the climactic moments when Miller stops playing chess with 
his characters. Then, actors Steve Weingartner as the enlightened son and Dierk 
Torsek as the doomed father briefly but brilliantly demonstrate catharsis, 
while Deborah Strang's mother observes with compelling despair. 
</P>
<P>
 So expect the expected and this "All My Sons" won't disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
 * "All My Sons," A Noise Within, 234 S. Brand Blvd., Glendale. In repertory 
with two other productions. Call for dates/times. Ends May 1. $13-$15. (818)

THEATER BEAT: 'HOMAGE' A TRIBUTE TO MEDOFF'S TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Medoff's drama "The Homage That Follows" may be burdened with an opaque 
title, but tribute must be paid to his most illuminating work since 1980's 
"Children of a Lesser God." At its rigorously staged West Coast premiere at 
Theatre 40, "The Homage That Follows" resembles an invaluable seminar on the 
media and violence. Never pompous or didactic, it eloquently dramatizes 
questions of responsibility, guilt and pathology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homage" is no whodunit. Medoff doesn't waste stage time setting up 
melodramatic mystery. The gathered ensemble quickly reveal the facts of the 
case. But the complex moral issues are translated into challenging story 
theater, like a cubist portrait of grief. Incidents from the past are offered 
by characters seemingly trapped in Purgatory. Director Flora Plumb gracefully 
negotiates the complex text, employing spare choreography to piece together the 
numerous fragments. Her work is complemented by a superbly disciplined company 
of actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Archie (Michael Gough), a physicist tormented by incipient psychosis, is in 
jail for murdering a New Mexico ranch-owner's daughter who is also a sitcom 
star. He did it, admits public defender Joseph Smith (William Frankfather), but 
who's really to blame? "We have needs," he mutters, "to which we can't give 
names." 
</P>
<P>
 But then Lucy (Anita Barone) should have known you can't go home again -- even 
during her show's hiatus. Yet Lucy is an adult only in the tabloids. 
Chronically depressed, desperate to withdraw from alcohol and fame, Lucy jokes 
that she's "auditioning for the role of the estranged daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucy's mother (Elizabeth Meads) is also in crisis. Katherine has lost 
faith in teaching, and retreated to a solitary existence on her ranch. She has 
no answers, only questions, and angrily resents her daughter's attempts at 
reconciliation.  
</P>
<P>
 Her ranch-hand Archie is yet another fugitive from city life. But as Medoff's 
characters reluctantly discover, there's no escape from self . . . or the 
pervasive media influence. Archie can't resist writing an original sci-fi 
screenplay for Lucy, any more than Katherine can avoid falling for his sinister 
charms. When Lucy tries to avoid responsibility for the impact of her image, 
even the local sheriff (Richard Miro) loses perspective. All become 
collaborators in celebrity murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Victimizer becomes victim. And so another mourning parent stands alone under a 
galaxy of stars and pleads -- not for justice -- but for ethics. Blame it on 
particle physics? Accidental equations? Chance collisions? Where's meaning in 
the universe if we don't impose it? 
</P>
<P>
 Homage must be paid, this grieving mother cries to the stars, and Medoff 
answers her prayers. And ours. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Homage That Follows," Theatre 40, 241 Moreno Drive, Beverly Hills. 
Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends April 24. $14-$17. (213)

ART REVIEW; THESE WORKS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two current exhibitions at the Barnsdall Art Park find numerous local artists 
wrestling big questions. They ask if an old reality that was tangible, robust 
and subtly textured has disappeared forever. They wonder if everything from a 
disembodied information society to the coercive constraints of political 
correctness have conspired to curdle life into a juiceless abstraction.  
</P>
<P>
 None traffics directly in the kind of dreary agit-prop conceptualism we've all 
seen too much of, but they poke at the edges of the issues. Quite a few pipe 
wistful tunes of Edens lost to all but memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Current Abstractions" at the Municipal Art Gallery was organized by the 
Muni's curator and program director Noel Korten. His introduction in the show's 
brochure is helpful, as is an essay by Michael Darling. In substance, the 
presentation includes several works each by some 25 artists who paint, sculpt 
or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Once abstract art was seen as a way of releasing subconscious contents. Then 
it was reduced to an exercise in pure form. Artists here reintroduce the idea 
of "Funk" from the '60s, its fascination with layered multiple meanings 
conditioned by the present gloomy Zeitgeist . 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition frontispiece, for example, is a circle covered with aluminum 
foil. Made by Tim Hawkinson, it's titled "Volume Control" and brings to mind 
Robert Irwin's landmark disappearing discs, but it looks more primitive. It may 
have something to say about retribalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Friedman's tangle of liquid-filled plastic tubing is titled "Co-mingling 
(sic) Without Ever Exchanging." Seems to be thinking about AIDS and isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Elesby's sweet "Surface Decoration" series makes wall reliefs of 
delicate wire encrusted with notions-counter gewgaws. Could this be a 
subversive message about a kind of femininity feminists abhor? 
</P>
<P>
 There's quite a bit of that sort of oblique questioning. Then there is the 
inevitable segment of the show that fails for sheer timidity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most encouraging is that contingent of artists pushing the envelope using 
art's own non-programmatic grammar. Marcus Lutyens brings the natural and the 
artificial together in "Tuch and Go," where sections of logs are joined by 
tense cling-wrap with condensed moisture inside. Social commentary can be 
inferred from the thing but its success lies in its sensuous reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The icy edge of minimalism melts in George Ketterl's compositions of ovoid 
forms. They undermine symmetry to become both dynamic and menacing. George 
Bruland's small paintings use little but the seduction of color and exquisitely 
massaged surfaces to create a sense of personal and historical romanticism that 
make titles like "Byron's Rock" perfectly apt. Something similar happens in 
wistful little paintings by Mario Cutajar. They rhyme perfectly with handles 
like "Watteau's Melancholy." 
</P>
<P>
 Among others equally worth a second look are Susan Elias, Linda Stark, David 
Grant and Andrew Watanabe. 
</P>
<P>
 If this visual essay is about opening the philosophical implications of 
abstraction to include the real, then "Illusions of Reality" is the opposite. 
It extends reality to include the philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed across the way in the Junior Art Center gallery is a smaller 
eight-artist exercise organized by curator Scott Canty. 
</P>
<P>
 It tends toward fool-the-eye technique orchestrated to remind us that illusion 
is delightful but only poetically real. So what is reality composed of these 
days? 
</P>
<P>
 Carlo Marcucci plunges into the question of physical reality vs. information 
reality by painting apples or bananas against images of printed documents. 
James Griffith imitates printing plates to demonstrate how pictorial illusion 
is built up with abstract means. Steven Robison pushes the edge, making pure 
abstraction appear to be made of delicate fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Some join those in the abstraction show playing theme and variation on 
Proust's conviction that reality exists only in reverie. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Campbell copies discarded mattresses down to the last nocturnal stain. 
When we stop being fooled, we see the works are embodied autobiography. 
Haunting photographs of attic treasures by Anthony Nelson evoke old prints that 
similarly sound chords of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Keith puns on reality depicting rational and artificial things like 
rulers and wedding cake grooms. Laura Whipple has a delightful time playing 
with the size of memory. In "Night Sweat" she sees it as a toy ocean liner 
going through a funnel only to emerge even smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly the most engaging piece here could be in either exhibition. 
Robert Wedemeyer's "Music Box" looks like a big minimalist wooden wall-relief 
sculpture in the form of a cantilevered circle segment. The trick is that it 
contains about 30 little music boxes that the viewer is invited to wind up 
according to serendipity. The resulting melding of tinkling tunes makes an 
eerie original composition that is at once avant-garde and plaintive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Barnsdall Art Park, 4800 Hollywood Blvd.; both shows continue through April 
17, closed Mondays, (213) 485-4581.

MUSIC REVIEW; PIANIST MURRAY PERAHIA RETURNS TO WESTWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The art of Murray Perahia, the much-admired American pianist who has been 
visiting Southern California for more than two decades, continues to evolve and 
to widen its horizons. It is an art based on versatility, a deep command of 
styles, musical conscientiousness and impassioned rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to Westwood on Wednesday night, the 46-year-old native New Yorker 
displayed several facets of his celebrated pianistic and musical resources. 
Before intermission, he brought reliability and stolidity to Beethoven's first 
Piano Sonata (Opus 2, No. 1) and to four Brahms works. In the second half, he 
produced exquisite, thoughtful and heroic Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
 Wadsworth Theater may be an excellent venue for a piano recital -- it has 
certainly proved so in seasons past -- but on this occasion the place, or 
perhaps just the instrument occupying the stage, seemed less than optimally 
expressive in its welcome, more mechanical and clunky than fluent and 
malleable. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Perahia managed to make some beautiful music in this room and on 
this piano, especially in the Chopin half, when he offered two Ballades, two 
Etudes, three Mazurkas and the Berceuse. 
</P>
<P>
 He chose to underline the violent, rather than the tender, side of the 
sometimes bucolic F-major Ballade; later, he unraveled at controlled high 
speeds the dramatic content in the complex F-minor Ballade. Even so, most 
cherishable were his Mazurkas (in D, A minor and F minor), which became 
polished gems of keyboard poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, however, Beethoven's first F-minor Sonata, emerged dutiful in 
articulation and woody in sound. And Brahms' B-minor Rhapsody and B-minor 
Capriccio, E-flat-minor Intermezzo and E-flat Rhapsody, needed many more colors 
and moods to fill out their familiar emotional contours. While the lack of hues 
may have been the Steinway's fault, the missing wit and humors had to be the 
province of the pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 A large and approving audience demanded encores; its first reward was the 
E-flat Waltz (No. 5) of Chopin.

PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW; BRILLIANT 'FORT HEAD' FULL OF TWISTS, TURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Known locally as a dancer in Bella Lewitzky's company (1973-76) and a teacher 
of dance at UCLA (1978-81), Chris Burnside returned to the Southland on 
Wednesday as an autobiographical performance artist. However, throughout 105 
minutes of personal testimony about what he called "one gay man's journey 
through the Vietnam-era military," Burnside relied extensively on movement 
design as an extra layer of commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented at Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, his "Fort Head" used 
expressive gesture, sculptural poses, physical mimicry and occasional passages 
of intense and, at the end, liberating dance to artfully underscore and 
punctuate his spoken narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafted in 1969, Burnside immediately found Army life to be disastrously 
incompatible with both his calling as an artist and his identity as a confused, 
repressed homosexual. It was a different era in gay consciousness, he tells us, 
but, clearly, the military mentality hasn't grown at the same rate: The 
processes of collective brutalization that he describes still endure. 
</P>
<P>
 Most often, the clash of sensibilities that Burnside experienced yields 
memorably rueful or off-the-wall comedy -- as in his accounts of the bizarre 
excesses in what he wryly terms "manly-men training." But, with a pause, a 
shift of vocal tone or a turn of the head, his piece suddenly grows darker and 
more piercing as it details his suicide attempts and other crises of 
self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled after the nickname of a Texas military base notorious for abundant 
illegal drugs, "Fort Head" is the classic tale of an innocent who tries to beat 
the system and develops a keen sense of irony in the process. Burnside's secret 
ballet lessons off the base add an extra layer of comic subterfuge to this 
story, and his unrequited love for another soldier a dimension of heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnside is currently the chair of the dance department at Virginia 
Commonwealth University, but he relives the rigors of 1969 basic training with 
such vulnerability to each memory that the years melt away and you sit at 
Highways worrying about his chances of survival. A vivid, involving performance 
memoir full of devastating surprises.

ART REVIEWS; RUMMAGING IN THE GETTY'S STOREROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Connections 2" marks the second in a series sponsored by the Getty Center for 
the History of Art and Humanities in which artists are invited to produce their 
own installations using the center's collection of historical books, prints, 
letters, photographs and other documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition of having artists and other so-called "non-professionals" ferret 
around the museum's storerooms is new. It responds to the wave of 1980s art 
devoted to institutional critique; in this, it should be seen as a defensive 
gesture, designed to foster the illusion of the museum's accessibility while 
protecting its hegemonic role. 
</P>
<P>
 Such controlled tampering has, in any case, yielded fascinating results, as 
when Barbara Kruger tackled the Museum of Modern Art's archives to examine 
photos of "great" artists; and Joseph Kosuth plundered the holdings at the 
Brooklyn Museum to cogitate upon Ludwig Wittgenstein's own cogitations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Getty Center, the results are less fortuitous. Part of this is due to 
the fact that the seventh-floor gallery is really a glorified hallway and thus, 
the space allotted to each of the four artists involved is sharply 
circumscribed. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that all the artists are 
committed to explicitly extra-aesthetic agendas; and sociopolitical change 
doesn't fit comfortably into the department-store-style display cases that -- 
perhaps by necessity -- dominate here. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Gamboa Jr.'s work suffers from an overload of visual and textual 
material. Letters by muralists David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jose Clemente Orozco, 
and Gamboa's own photos and musings, work in dialogue to explore Chicano 
identity. But these are poorly integrated with a slew of archival postcards of 
Los Angeles. The latter, juxtaposed with references to the recent riots and 
earthquake, are framed as metaphors for the region's besmirched innocence. As 
such, they are regrettably stale. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Rosenthal is interested in monotheistic culture's demonization of 
animals, nature and "the animal in us." To that end, she displays illustrations 
of animal-human hybrids culledfrom texts as various as a Napoleonic account of 
Egypt; an early 20th-Century book of Russian fables; and Max Ernst's " Une 
semaine de bonte. " She does perhaps the best job of showing off the center's 
holdings, though as an artwork, her installation is overly didactic, plagued by 
hyperbolic, eco-feminist rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Noah Purifoy creates a five-foot high shadowbox, filled with Fluxus objects, 
leather-bound manuscripts and collaged, Christian imagery. As a statement about 
the institutional power of both art and religion, the mock-reliquary might have 
been interesting. But accompanied by life-sized mannequins of a nude priest and 
boy, the installation becomes at once tasteless and moralistic, and worse yet, 
artistically void. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Nobuho Nagasawa manages to skirt the limitations of this format to offer 
something truly provocative. Her installation features four globes swathed in 
computer-generated images derived from rare maps of the Roman Empire, the 
Christian era, the Third Reich and architect Richard Meier's drawing of the new 
Getty Center, now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Getty globe is a Plexiglas box filled with memorabilia belonging to 
J. Paul Getty, and across the way, a telling photograph of Getty, taken by 
Yousuf Karsh. In one economical blow, Nagasawa evokes the relationships between 
conquest and desire, art and empire, and does so without whitewashing her own 
desires, her own complicity in the living and the telling of the tale. 
</P>

<P>
 Gender Talk: If the feminist reading of the "male gaze" -- voracious, 
predatory and relentless -- has become a critical commonplace, Judith Simonian 
makes the commonplace uncanny. In her new work at Ovsey Gallery, gendered 
positions are turned inside out and then deftly reversed so that we are back 
where we started, but also somewhere else.

 The haunting paintings of Balthus, which record the artist's defiantly 
perverse fascination with young girls, provide the pretext for Simonian's work. 
She repaints several of the most lubricious on the flip sides of white panels 
that hang from the ceiling, several inches in front of the wall. When the 
viewer looks through the holes Simonian cuts in the paintings, precisely where 
the heads of the young girls should be, he or she sees his or her own face 
reflected in the wall-mounted mirrors opposite -- the viewer as the viewed 
object, framed within an image, trapped inside the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not simply Jacques Lacan meets Barnum and Bailey, though there is 
certainly a playful, even carnivalesque aspect to Simonian's aesthetic 
trickery. Instead, this is a sophisticated intervention into the politics of 
looking -- at bodies, at art, at any or all combinations thereof. For when the 
viewer looks through the designated hole, what he or she sees is not so much 
Simonian's lascivious "re-painting," but a picture of him or herself as voyeur, 
a picture of his or her own desire to see. 
</P>
<P>
 As voyeurs, we are invariably frustrated, for the moment we turn to look, we 
lose sight of ourselves completely. Simonian suggests that the image -- like 
the self -- is always incomplete; and that the gaze is merely an instrument by 
which we seek to stave off this knowledge.

 Messenger: It is difficult to write about Hannelore Baron's work without 
resorting to superlatives, despite the fact that her small, spotted and frayed 
collages evince a marked distaste for excess of any kind. The German-born Baron 
embraced an ideal of humility, a vision of the art object as message -- or 
rather, intimation -- offered without expectation of anything in return. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty of Baron's collages and constructions, produced from 1975 to 1987, the 
year she died, are now on view at Manny Silverman, and it is a rare pleasure to 
see them. Carefully, indeed reverently assembled from bits of old fabric and 
hand-colored scraps of paper, sometimes covered with illegible scrawls or 
rudimentary figures, these objects seem like memory fragments. They want to 
speak, but they know too much has already been lost. They are, thus, fragile, 
sometimes stitched together -- literally -- by nothing stronger than worn 
pieces of thread. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron was an untrained artist, though she certainly learned something along 
the way from Paul Klee, Kurt Schwitters and Joseph Cornell. Despite these 
influences, her work is neither whimsical, cerebral nor surreal. It is 
powerfully self-effacing, a contradiction anywhere but here. 
</P>

TV REVIEW; 'DVORAK IN PRAGUE' STICKS TO THE MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say this for "Dvorak in Prague": It's a concert rather than the usual talky, 
self-congratulatory promo. Not a word is spoken. Nor is any on-screen clue 
offered as to what was being celebrated (and when) in this "Celebration," the 
program's strikingly original subtitle. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoop, a press release informs, is that conductor Seiji Ozawa, his Boston 
Symphony and a quartet of glamorous soloists were in Prague last December in 
conjunction with the centennial of the premiere of Dvorak's "New World" 
Symphony (a premiere that, by the way, took place in New York). 
</P>
<P>
 The program shows inconsistent faith in its audience's ability to absorb the 
music of this most accessible composer without the help of arrangements to, for 
instance, enable violinist Itzhak Perlman and cellist Yo-Yo Ma to do the duet 
bit on the "Humoresque," originally for piano solo. And do we really need the 
Largo from the "New World" Symphony twice, first over some evocative shots of 
Prague's monuments, then at the concert proper, which took place in the Smetana 
Hall before an audience including Czech President Vaclav Havel? 
</P>
<P>
 Several short pieces are, however, presented as written and in their entirety, 
including the Romance in F, poignantly delivered by Perlman; Ma playing "Silent 
Woods" with a stunning, seamless legato, a vibrato measurable on the Richter 
Scale and his patented agonized facial choreography; and Dvorak's majestic 
setting of Psalm 149 with the lusty Prague Philharmonic Chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 Mezzo Frederica von Stade nearly steals the show with her radiant delivery of 
Rusalka's "Song to the Moon," in which Ozawa and the BSO prove the most 
sensitive of accompanists, and a couple of Dvorak's Gypsy Songs, with 
octogenarian, Czech-born Rudolf Firkusny a dignified partner at the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos, too, to audio producer Thomas Frost and his engineers for creating an 
exceptionally handsome- sounding classical music video. HERBERT GLASS

TV REVIEW; A & E'S 'VIOLENCE' PROBES WITH DEPTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Prime Time Violence," the latest editiE's "Investigative Reports," 
definitively proves that television can't help report on television violence 
without showing the thing that it's reporting about -- and in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, an unintended irony of a report on the effect of TV violence on children 
has generous, blood-splattered clips from HBO's "Tales of the Crypt" (which 
airs after most kids have gone to bed) beamed into households when kids can see 
it. Surely the good Rev. Billy A. Melvin, Christian organizer of TV boycotting 
campaigns, never imagined that his concerns about graphic TV violence would be 
coupled with one of the "Crypt" characters losing major body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this Bill Kurtis-hosted program succumbing to a major case of 
cognitive dissonance, "Prime Time Violence" really does explore the burning 
issue in some depth. Why it's hot now, why it's triggered legislative threats 
of monitoring from Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno's stern 
Big Brother-like warnings of government censorship, raises its own questions. 
(CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer says TV controls are politically 
easier than gun control: "Beat up on the NRA and the money goes away.") 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the concerns of critics like Simon and Melvin, particularly those 
addressing the glamorization of violence, are never going to be answered with 
"Law & Order" creator Dick Wolf's familiar and phony remark that Greek tragedy 
and Shakespeare are more violent than prime time. Even though the TV industry 
succumbed in February to congressional pressure and agreed to such 
self-monitoring measures as a ratings system, an annual "violence report card" 
and development of the so-called "V chip" for parents to electronically delete 
violent programs from the screen, the war of words is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate here conclusively demonstrates this, ranging from Simon's good cop 
style of government watchman to actor Michael Moriarty's scorching attacks on 
Reno ("It's the KGB") to film critic Gene Siskel's sensible joint concerns 
about government control and parents' needs to monitor their kids' viewing 
habits.  
</P>
<P>
 Because, reminds Peggy Charren of Action for Children's Television, it really 
comes down to kids and their impressionable minds. If parents don't do the job, 
Big Brother may do it for them. ROBERT KOEHLER

ENERGY DEPT. MISSING MILLIONS IN EQUIPMENT, AUDITORS REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Energy Department contractors cannot account for tens of millions of dollars' 
worth of equipment, much of it either stolen or disposed of as trash, 
government auditors reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In one incident, furniture and other equipment was stored with radioactive 
material at the Fernald weapons facility in Ohio and, as a result, had to be 
buried at the Nevada nuclear test site, Energy Department Inspector General 
John Layton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators for the General Accounting Office and the inspector general said 
at a Senate hearing that contractors running federal nuclear weapons plants 
have shown widespread disregard for excess equipment, leading to millions of 
dollars in government losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department has lost or could not account for . . . computers, forklifts, 
furniture, welders, X-ray machines and even a semi-trailer," complained Sen. 
John Glenn (D-Ohio), who is chairman of the Government Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Department officials acknowledged that contractors at Energy Department 
facilities in Colorado, New Mexico, Ohio and elsewhere have had shoddy property 
inventory programs, despite clear federal requirements and procedures for 
disposing of usable property. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Energy Secretary Bill White said the department has begun detailed 
inventories to establish a "base line" of equipment held by contractors and to 
curtail future losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department owns more than $13 billion in personal property, from 
furniture to sophisticated testing and research equipment, with about 90% of it 
in the hands of private contractors at laboratories and weapons plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings of audits over the last three years: 
</P>
<P>
 * In a 1993 audit at the Rocky Flats weapons plant in Colorado, $29.8-million 
worth of equipment was reported missing or unaccounted for, including a 
semi-trailer, forklifts, cameras, desks, typewriters and computers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico, auditors said, may not be able to 
account for $100-million worth of equipment, including computers, X-ray 
machines and other sophisticated equipment.

SON OF HIP-HOP; FASHION: THE IN-YOUR-FACE STYLE ISN'T DEAD; IT'S JUST EVOLVING 
INTO SOMETHING GENERIC AND KINDA DRAB. BAGGY STYLES AND LOUD COLORS ARE OUT. 
WORK CLOTHES AND GRAY, BROWN AND BLACK ARE IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We have it on good authority that hip-hop is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 A funeral notice appeared in the October '93 issue of GQ magazine (prompted by 
the appearance of hip-hop fashion in Sears). What's more, Cross Colours, the 
Commerce-based clothing line that went from $15 million in sales in 1990 to $89 
million in 1992 with colorful denim clothes inscribed with anti-gang messages, 
has faltered. And Merry-Go-Round stores, a shopping haven for young men looking 
for cutting-edge clothing, has filed for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But hip-hop -- both the fashion and the music -- has evolved into another, 
equally powerful social statement. We'll call it PH -- post-hip hop. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the music is now gangsta rap, a hybrid that makes headlines for its 
often brutal lyrics and headliners, namely Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur, 
known as much for their arrest records as for their musical recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 The original hip-hop fashions -- bright, graphic, exaggerated jeans and 
T-shirts -- have faded. The preferred dress of post-hip-hoppers is generic and 
drab. Rarely do you see labels, logos or graphics to denote the manufacturer. 
The colors of the street -- concrete gray, asphalt black and sandlot brown -- 
prevail.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet this notice-me-not-my-clothes style is being reinterpreted by the world's 
most scrutinized designers. The kids from Los Angeles are influencing Karl 
Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein and Christian Lacroix. 
</P>
<P>
 Streetwear has often been a catalyst for high fashion, particularly in the 
last several years. We've seen neon-bright surfwear and bicycle gear rip 
through the fashion Zeitgeist. Now, a subtle urban warrior style is doing the 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Low PH (low-priced post hip-hop) men's clothes are the stuff of blue-collar 
catalogues and civil-servant issue -- firefighters coats, camouflage-print 
pants, washed-out plaid shirts, big ol' black jeans, heavy storm-trooper boots 
and the requisite knitted skullcap, called a skully. All of it is tinged with a 
thrift-shop pallor. 
</P>
<P>
 When Los Angeles stylist Lynn Bugaii dresses rap groups, she goes shopping in 
the Compton flea markets. "You don't want it to look like you got it at the 
Beverly Center, even though now you probably could get it at the Beverly 
Center," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people want is hard-core industrial clothes," says Los Angeles clothing 
designer Ron Wash, who produces custom-made tour jackets. Wash's firefighters 
jacket (modeled on the real thing) has been outselling the traditional bomber 
styles. It has been bought by the casts of TV's "Living Single" and "Martin," 
and by such Motown Musical groups as El Dogg, Tha Mexakinz and Trends of 
Culture.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not since Cross Colours' rapid ascendancy two years ago has there been a label 
that young men and women have worn head to toe. Urban teens want their 
attitude, not their clothes, to do the talking. Which is its own special kind 
of fashion statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not looking trendy is the trend," says Craig Bohman, president of Jay Jacob 
stores, a national chain, with 22 stores in Southern California. "There isn't a 
(popular) label that people are after." 
</P>
<P>
 Glitter rap star Hammer has adopted the style, trashing the harem pants, bare 
pecs and sundial-size medallions. The new, PH Hammer wears a skully, boots, 
black denim pants, tank top and a take-me-seriously expression, although it's 
hard to see with the blinding glare from his downsized-but-still-enormous gold 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Cole, a costumer for "South Central," a new television show from Fox 
scheduled to air in April, has been researching the post-hip-hop look among 
teens at Dorsey High School. She found the "baggy, baggy look is over and guys 
are wearing much slimmer pants -- not as skinny as Levi's but not hanging off 
their hips. They wear a lot of work clothes."  
</P>
<P>
 The low-PH look for women is equally anti-label. It might include, starting 
from the top: a skully or braided extensions, small cropped top (the bra-top 
replacement), short skirt wrapped with a flannel shirt or denim jacket, black 
tights or leggings and heavy black boots or Pumas. Cole says many of the 
teen-age girls she's seen are wearing baby doll dresses, bobby socks and short 
shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Large manufacturers that are trying to reach a fashion customer have made note 
of the patina that accompanies a lot of the post-hip-hop styles. Diesel, one of 
the most forward denim companies, shows its jeans and jackets in an aged state 
-- as if they've been worn hard and laundered only occasionally -- in ads for 
such trendy publications as Vibe. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickies also roughs up clothes before they go in front of the camera, and it 
mixes Dickies bib overalls, striped coveralls, denim jackets and jeans with 
other labels. "It's the way people dress," says Dickies' representative Dee 
Shoup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 High PH is very much alive. It was enthusiastically embraced last season by 
the world-class designers and has not been abandoned. Less than two weeks ago 
in Paris, Lagerfeld sent a little blue bra topped with a cropped fuchsia 
sweater down the Chanel runway. The sweater was cut high and the waistband on 
the matching miniskirt was cut low so that the ubiquitous Chanel belt (this 
time a thin strand of gold chain) could thread through the model's navel ring.  
</P>
<P>
 He also envisioned the lunching ladies who buy from his Chanel collection in 
knit shorts rolled up the thigh, newsboy caps and brightly colored fake fur. 
And he showed most of these get-ups with black tights and black boots. 
</P>
<P>
 It may seem laughable, but the demand three years ago for $1,000 Chanel biker 
boots created a waiting list at the Beverly Hills boutique. The Chanel flock 
will pay thousands for the privilege of wearing a look that began across town 
for less than $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Lacroix's version of downtown for fall was a black satin evening 
jacket with lame short shorts, a black lace top and lace hosiery. This is not a 
look born in the ateliers of Europe. This is street dressing translated into 
the big bucks that perpetuate cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if hip-hop is dead, it's having a very healthy afterlife.

BEHIND THE WHEEL / PAUL DEAN: A FORD WITH A CORD; READY TO UNPLUG FROM THE GAS 
PUMP AND PLUG IN TO THE FUTURE? THE ELECTRIC ECOSTAR WON'T SHOCK YOU WITH 
SPECTACULAR PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co., working with hastened technology and a hesitant commitment, is 
introducing new world electric motoring to the real world -- worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 Ford Ecostars from an eventual test fleet of 100 -- the infant 
electric vehicle industry's largest assembly of rolling laboratories -- have 
already been delivered from Canada to Spain, from UPS in Sacramento to 
Commonwealth Edison in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 By July, most of these electric buzzers -- based on two-seat, British-built 
mini-panel trucks -- will be reassigned by utilities leasing them to delivery 
services and a few suburban families. Ford suggests, even insists, that test 
drivers use the vehicles as they would a gasoline-powered car. With only a 
1-800 hot line as a safety net should a driver's eyebrows start arcing during a 
rainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "That won't happen," says Ford spokesman John Clinard as he delivers a blue 
Ecostar, a 30-minute briefing, one field service electrician, several operating 
manuals and an additional piece of damp-driving advice: "Feel free to take 
Ecostar through a car wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vehicle also has a range of 100 miles, will run at freeway speeds up to 
70 miles per hour, and you certainly will not have to stop at any service 
stations." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout seven days with Sparky, we stopped for nothing except daily 
destinations. The little van not only ran at freeway speeds, but actually 
passed many among the snorting, polluting, environmentally incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 It accelerated almost as well as the breeziest subcompacts and regularly 
chirped its tires -- experimental rubber inflated to 50 psi for reduced rolling 
resistance -- on ribald starts. And it held that crisp performance whether the 
battery was 100% charged or dribbling flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparky survived night trips, with headlights burning and the radio explaining 
why we were locked in the four-lane metal ingot that is the San Diego Freeway 
these days. The 1-800 hot line was not called; gasoline-powered vehicles parked 
in reserve at both ends of the day's business were not needed; fuses remained 
unblown and circuits unbroken in the vehicle and at home. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of 600 miles -- and recalling EVs driven since ecologists, 
futurists and governments began sentencing modern motoring to the electric 
chair -- one conclusion is clear: Although short on performance extremes and 
expensive to purchase, Ford's Ecostar fits the crowded, sluggish mainstream of 
everyday commuting as well as any gasoline-powered counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 Will it impress Porsche purists and souls that surge to engine noise, hot 
energy and the challenge of fast, precise passage? 
</P>
<P>
 Nah . 
</P>
<P>
 Can Ford bring it to market by the end of the century for under $50,000? 
</P>
<P>
 Unlikely . 
</P>
<P>
 But could Ecostar succeed as a local runabout where short-haul delivery 
capability, not spiritual self-indulgence, is the issue? 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely.  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout our no-quarter wring-out, each turn of Ecostar's wheels and every 
spin of its 300-volt motor were recorded by on-board black boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is with the international test fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the 30-month evaluation, the 100 cars will be collected, data 
collated and Ford will be that much wiser in meeting The Mandate -- a 1990 
order by the California Air Resources Board dictating that 2% of all new 
vehicles sold in the state in 1998 will be emission-free, i.e. electric 
vehicles. Or manufacturers will lose their certification to sell in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's Big Three -- pleading high costs, low performance, weak public 
interest in electric vehicles and retarded battery technology -- want the 
deadline rolled back. The ruling will be reviewed in May; so far, the 
California board hasn't budged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a mandate to sell electric vehicles," says Pam Kueber, an 
environmental communications manager for Ford. "Unfortunately, there is no 
mandate to buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, domestic car builders have maintained reluctant electrical progress 
-- Chrysler with some experimental vans; GM with its Impact, a two-place 
commuter car that will be shipped out for public testing later this year, and 
the Ecostar. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's brighter idea cost $100 million. That makes each test vehicle worth $1 
million, a smug satisfaction when pulling alongside a Rolls-Royce on the Santa 
Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 About $5 million was spent custom-developing a unique sodium-sulfur battery, 
hermetically sealed in a stainless steel thermos. It produces five times the 
driving range of a more conventional lead-acid battery weighing the same 770 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Full resuscitation takes seven hours when plugged into a 220-volt system via a 
charging station no bigger than a one-suiter on wheels. Or 27 hours if hooked 
to a 110-volt household outlet. Partial recharging takes less time. 
</P>
<P>
 There's 12 feet of on-board charging cord that reels through a small trap door 
in the grille and into a housing beneath the hood where the engine used to be. 
The engine bay is now filled by the electronics center -- battery charging 
systems, inverters and a converter to charge a 12-volt battery for auxiliary 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuel costs, according to Ford's calculations, with all variables considered, 
should be about 2 cents a mile. That compares favorably to 6 cents a mile for 
an average gasoline-powered vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford claims that the battery cannot leak, is virtually indestructible and no 
more volatile than 1.5 gallons of unleaded. The impact to release that energy, 
of course, would make guacamole out of car and all who rode in it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Temperament and cost are downsides. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve maximum life and efficiency, the battery -- flat and invisible 
beneath the rear floor of the van -- maintains an optimum operating temperature 
of about 600 degrees Fahrenheit by eating its own power. Parked unplugged for 
12 hours, the battery chills below critical levels and might not respond to 
recharge. 
</P>
<P>
 And a replacement battery, even with the car in production, could cost about 
$15,000. Under normal circumstances, says program manager Robert Kiessel, the 
life of an Ecostar battery would be "guessing . . . at three to five years. It 
is almost entirely recyclable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done a terrific job of moving EV technology forward, yet we are 
criticized for a lack of commitment. We're not opposing the mandate because of 
knee-jerk negativism. We are concerned that rushing this technology into the 
marketplace is not going to produce happy Ford customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ecostar is front-driven by a three-phase, 75-horsepower, AC electric motor 
coupled to a single-speed transaxle. It's likely the only vehicle where freeway 
stops actually become something of a blessing -- because braking converts the 
motor into a generator. Regenerative braking restores as much as 15% of the 
battery power. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite broad use of magnesium, aluminum and composite materials for wheels, 
transaxle casing, rear springs, load floor and bulkheads, the Ecostar weighs in 
at 3,100 pounds -- heavier than a Saturn and about equal to a Ford Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying capacity is less than a half-ton, which is pretty good for an EV but 
rather sparse for other forms of wheeled delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Piloting an Ecostar requires few changes from internal-combustion techniques. 
It's odd to key-start an engine that bursts into life in total silence. There 
is air conditioning aboard, but only a diesel heater. Do not expect the options 
list to include power steering, power brakes, power windows or other 
high-energy accessories that could drain travels to around seven blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 And no fuel gauges. Just one dial reporting miles remaining to full discharge 
and another telling the percentage of power left in the battery. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecostar runs hills as effortlessly and speedily as it travels freeway flats. 
We used a 110-volt charge at home and a 220-volt jolt at the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet daily commuting from Woodland Hills to Downtown -- with side trips for 
pastrami at Canter's and to visit a sick buddy at Cedars-Sinai -- never saw 
available energy fall below 50% at day's end. The real surprise is realizing 
how few days one actually travels more than 100 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecostar blends perfectly with traffic and draws no curious stares because it 
doesn't have the golf cart look and doesn't limp along like a transportation 
experiment. One motorist, in fact, presumed Sparky's door decals to be a 
promotion and the car a gasoline-powered wolf in EV clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, Ecostar failed its ultimate test. 
</P>
<P>
 We teased and taunted and stretched Sparky's mettle on several freeways 
beneath the Ray-Bans of motoring's ultimate arbitrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody seemed hungry for a place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the 
first police officer to give a speeding ticket to an electric vehicle.

UNDER CONTROL; PANTYHOSE THAT PROMISE TO FLATTEN -- AND FLATTER -- YOU ARE 
IMPROVING. WE TESTED SIX VERSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Control-top pantyhose can squeeze the life out of you.Yet working women endure 
them, often 10 hours a day or more, because they want the payoff: a 
flatter-looking tummy, butt and thighs. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, figure-altering pantyhose have gotten better over the years. New, 
forgiving Lycra has improved the support mechanism. And pinching waistbands and 
sagging crotches, to name two of the problems associated with control-tops, 
seem to be waning with "memory" yarns that hold their shape and improve ours. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are my impressions of a sampling of control-top pantyhose I recently 
tested for fit, longevity and "suck-in" ability. 
</P>
<P>
 I faithfully followed the accompanying height and weight charts, a must for 
proper fit, and wore each pair for a minimum of seven hours. Round the Clock 
Extra Firm/Extra Control Top, $7 in department stores 
</P>
<P>
 The hose went on snugly but felt fine after five minutes of give. Because 
they're not sheer to waist, wearing a micro mini, if I owned one, was out of 
the question. After seven hours, I found no horizontal stretch marks in the 
fabric or runs of any kind. And for $7, this brand costs considerably less than 
others with comparable girdle capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanes Smooth Illusions Body Contouring Pantyhose (medium-control), $8.95. 
</P>
<P>
 I signed up for industrial-strength tummy control when I climbed into these 
babies. My stomach was impressively flatter, my less-than-rock-hard thighs 
looked as if they had done Thighmaster workouts. The fit was good -- no bagging 
anywhere. And nary a hole or a run at day's end, even after a cat-claw 
puncture. Anne Klein Collections Signature Sheer Contour Control Top Pantyhose 
(silky sheer leg with Lycra, sandalfoot), $9 in department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I'm sure I pulled them on straight, the hose initially felt twisted, 
then relaxed after about 15 minutes. Moderate control, with no bagging at the 
knees or pinching at the waistband. As I prepared to take them off, I noticed 
little marks in the fabric where the hose met up with my shoes. Donna Karan New 
York Sheer Satin Hosiery (control top), $11.50 in department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many endorsements from friends as well as professional wardrobe 
stylists, I was eager to give this brand a go. Although I noticed two 
pinhead-size holes when I pulled on the DKNYs, neither got bigger nor triggered 
a run. The sheer look was pleasing, the control factor only moderate. Givenchy 
Body Smoothers Support Pantyhose (with longer, firmer control top), $9.50 in 
department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 This pair felt as stiff as wax paper out of the package but did a remarkable 
job of "toning" abdomen and thighs. Fans of ultra minis need not buy them, 
though, as the panty part extends from waist to three inches above the knee. 
Surprisingly, comfort and sheerness were not sacrificed for control. Even at 
$9.50 a pair, I'm tempted to load up, or at least watch for sales. Hanes Silk 
Reflections Silky Sheer (control-top sandalfoot pantyhose), $5.50 in department 
and drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
 The luxurious, literally silky "hand," or feel, of the fabric was as 
attractive as the price tag. Moderate tummy control, superior comfort. After 
seven hours, I noticed a dozen or so of those annoying horizontal stretch marks 
in the fabric, but this pair otherwise performed well.

SENSIBLE SHOES, NOT HIGH HEELS, ARE THE CHOICE FOR WORKING WOMEN...; IN TRANSIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN SAJBEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a working woman who started commuting via public transportation 
after the Northridge quake, you've probably realized that your footwear must 
change. To negotiate trains, keep your balance on a lurching bus, or even make 
the walk from your stop to the office without bottoming out, you need durable 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 When choosing a suitable commuter style, take a hint from longtime riders of 
the Blue Line, Metrolink, Amtrak or a bus: A quick survey of arrivals one 
weekday morning found a marked preference for Reeboks, followed by other brands 
of athletic shoes, then beat-up, comfortable flats. The sneaker-wearing women, 
who often put on crew socks over their hose, seemed to have an edge over their 
teetering counterparts in heels. They walked with a confident gait, ready to 
sprint to the Dash -- or away from an urban predator. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Weiner commutes from Encino to a Downtown bank in the beloved floral Keds 
she's had since high school. She tucks her Kenneth Cole business shoes in a 
tote. Carol Torres arrives Downtown in construction boots worthy of Li'l Abner, 
carrying her presentable high heels in a sack. 
</P>
<P>
 Others like to travel light and leave their work shoes under their desks. 
Social worker June Cowherd keeps a pair of all-purpose black pumps at the 
office, and executive secretary Gloria King keeps four pairs -- red, black, 
beige and brown -- to ensure color coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who demand comfort but can't quite get into the suit-and-sneaker 
combination tend to wear boots or loafers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't wear tennis shoes," fashionable legal assistant and Blue Line 
commuter Monica Singh says firmly. Her black Etienne Aigner flats make the 
transition from sidewalks to corridors. "Since I've been taking the train, I've 
been buying more flats. If it rains, I wear my Doc Martens," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemakers have been considering the commuter for years, and some, including 
Joan Helpern of Joan & David, like to say they design for "women running 
through airports." She believes in beautiful shoes that do not maim the feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to think of anyone commuting while feeling miserable because 
one part of the body is in distress," Helpern says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sneakers are wonderful and comfortable," she concedes, "but for most of us, 
sneakers are not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 A better solution, she suggests, is a shoe that's "grounded in reality without 
being dull." A number of styles in her current collection fit that description, 
including suede slippers with flexible soles. They're available at the Joan & 
David company store in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 New York shoe meister Kenneth Cole, who has an eponymous store on Sunset 
Boulevard in West Hollywood, agrees that one style can travel well from the 
streets to the workplace, particularly if it has rubber soles to absorb shock. 
"How appropriate for Los Angeles," he says wryly of his linen boots.  
</P>
<P>
 Cole adds that although Los Angeles commuters tend to put their least 
fashionable footwear forward, many New York women take the reverse approach. 
"They're a little more concerned that someone will see them coming and going," 
he says. Indeed, why risk making a bad impression on a cute co-commuter? 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists don't exactly have a cushy commute either. With some daily treks 
that have become numbingly long because of quake-related closures and detours, 
they want to baby their feet. Some people don slippers or driving shoes. 
Moccasins with pedal-gripping rubber cleats come in a range of prices: J.P. 
Tod's for $170 at Neiman Marcus, Cole-Haan's "Explorer" for $128 in the 
company's Beverly Hills store or the Broadway, and Minnetonka's for $59.95 by 
special order from Beverly Hills Motoring Accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Other drivers simply take off their shoes. And despite rumors to the contrary, 
going barefoot is perfectly legal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember someone saying there was a law against driving barefoot, but that 
was back in the '70s, when I was in high school," recalls Officer Christine 
Rogers of the California Highway Patrol in Sacramento. "The consensus in my 
office is that it's a folk tale. There isn't anything on the books that 
prohibits it."

NUGGETS WON'T LET CLIPPERS GET CLOSER; PRO BASKETBALL: FOUR-GAME WINNING STREAK 
ENDS AGAINST THE TEAM L.A. SOMEHOW HOPES TO TO CATCH.

<P>
 The Clippers, who maintain that they have an outside shot to overtake the 
Denver Nuggets for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff berth, had 
better wait before they begin printing playoff tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets ended the Clippers' season-high four-game winning streak Thursday, 
handing them an 102-99 loss before 9,661 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an ugly night for us," said guard Ron Harper, who scored 27 points and 
ended his month-long silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, however, maintains that the Clippers, who have two more games left 
against Denver, still have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look good, but I think we have been playing hard as a team and we 
have improved as a team," Harper said. "As long as we improved, that's a very, 
very good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers (23-39) are eight games behind the Nuggets (31-31). Each team has 
20 games left, but the Nuggets may have an edge because they have 11 games left 
in Denver, where they are 22-8. The Clippers, who open a six-game Eastern trip 
next week, have eight home games and 12 road games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But until All-Star forward Dominique Wilkins arrived last month, the Clippers 
seemed destined for the NBA draft lottery. They are 5-5 since trading Danny 
Manning for Wilkins on Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who had averaged 29.9 points in his first nine games as a Clipper, 
scored 35 points, including 12 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilkins, who made 10 of 22 shots from the field and 15 of 19 free throws 
had a chance to tie the score, 100-100, with 13.8 seconds left when he was 
fouled by Laphonso Ellis, but he missed the first of two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't believe I missed that many free throws down the stretch," 
Wilkins said. "This was definitely a game we had. We just missed so many free 
throws, and that's what lost the game for us." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no heroics by seven-foot rookie center Bob Martin, who had a 
season-high 10 points and 11 rebounds as the Clippers overcame a 20-point lead 
to defeat the Utah Jazz, 108-105, on Tuesday. Martin had three points and five 
rebounds before fouling out while trying to guard Dikembe Mutombo, who had 21 
points and 13 rebounds. Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf also had 21 points as the Nuggets 
ended a five-game road losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 91-84, after Rodney Rogers made a three-pointer, the Clippers 
outscored the Nuggets, 7-3, to cut it to 94-91 on a layup by Wilkins with 2:14 
remaining. After former Clipper Reggie Williams sank a jumper, Wilkins made a 
follow shot and a free throw with 1:21 remaining for 96-94. 
</P>
<P>
 After Abdul-Rauf missed a jumper, Harper made a three-pointer in front of 
Denver Coach Dan Issel for 97-96, but Abdul-Rauf answered with a jumper for 
98-97. Charles Outlaw tied it when he made the first of two free throws with 30 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bryant Stith, who had 17 points, made two free throws after he was fouled 
by Harper to break the tie with 30.6 seconds remaining. The Clippers used a 
timeout to set up a play, but reserve guard Randy Woods and Harper missed 
back-to-back three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wilkins' free throw made it 100-99, the Clippers wasted nine seconds 
before Wilkins fouled Stith, who sank two free throws for 102-99 with 4.8 
seconds left. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kauffman, who represents Dominique Wilkins, has been here since Tuesday, 
but Kauffman said his primary purpose wasn't to negotiate a new contract for 
Wilkins, who could become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. 
He also denied a report that Wilkins' has set a Sunday deadline for the 
Clippers to sign him. Columnist Peter Vecsey of the New York Post reported that 
Wilkins, 34, has asked for a $21-million, three-year contract and there are 
also reports that he's asking for $18 million over three years. Clipper 
spokesman Joe Safety declined comment.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; WAVES COME OH SO CLOSE; MIDWEST 
REGIONAL: UPSTART PEPPERDINE TAKES THE GAME TO OVERTIME BEFORE FALLING TO 
MICHIGAN, 78-74. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If the Pepperdine basketball team was searching for respect, it found it here. 
</P>
<P>
 This was supposed to be a relatively pain-free victory for Michigan on the 
road to another shot at the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 But somebody forgot to tell the Waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine matched the third-seeded Wolverines stride for stride before 
finally losing, 78-74, in overtime in the first round of the NCAA Midwest 
Regional at the Kansas Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14th-seeded Waves (19-11) even won over the crowd of 10,036 with a 
spirited comeback in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan led, 39-32, at the half and the Wolverines appeared on the verge of 
taking control several times in the second half. But Pepperdine wouldn't let 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines opened a 61-51 lead on a three-point basket by guard Jalen Rose 
with 7:22 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when things started to get interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd started to move behind the Waves after 6-foot-9 center Juwan Howard 
of Michigan was called for his fourth foul with 6:24 remaining and engaged in a 
stare-down with Pepperdine guard Damin Lopez, who is a foot shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't say anything to each other," Lopez said. "Actually, I just stared 
at him and he stared back and the crowd got behind us because it was like David 
and Goliath." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd also sided with the Waves less than a minute later when Lopez dived 
for a loose ball and Michigan reserve Makhtar Ndiaye, sitting on the bench, 
caught him in the shoulder with his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too close to me because I didn't see Makhtar push him," Michigan Coach 
Steve Fisher said. "I just hope you wouldn't plant a scenario that we're the 
bad guys. Makhtar is just a freshman, and he's only been here two months." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but both incidents only served to ignite the crowd and give a boost 
to Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves went on a 9-0 run, closing to within one point on an off-balance 
three-point basket by Lopez with 3:41 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 They completed their comeback when forward Clark James hit a three-pointer for 
a 66-64 lead with 1:38 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine went ahead for the last time, 68-66, on a layup by center Derek 
Noether with 43 seconds remaining. After Michigan's Howard tied it up on a 
layup with 17 seconds left, Pepperdine had one last chance to win in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lopez had to hurry a jumper as time expired and it was blocked by two 
Wolverine defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan then scored the first six points in overtime and made four 
consecutive free throws in the final minute to hold on for the win. 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably the best Pepperdine has played in a season filled with highs 
and lows. Coach Tom Asbury did not want to call it a moral victory, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is because we didn't win," he said. "We didn't come here to 
play hand grenades where close wins. I'm pleased with our effort, but the 
bottom line is we're going home tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan was simply happy to survive to play again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first round of the tournament is always the toughest" Howard said. "When 
you play a team like that and they're an underdog and they get the crowd behind 
them, you have to play with poise, and that's what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard led the Wolverines with 28 points and nine rebounds. But he scored most 
of his points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine forward Dana Jones also helped the Waves stay in the game by 
holding Rose, Michigan's leading scorer this season, to 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves were led by Lopez with 21 points, all of which came on 
three-pointers. He was seven of 17 in three-point attempts. Jones had 15 
points, moving into second place on Pepperdine's all-time scoring list, and 
nine rebounds.

MIKE DOWNEY: COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; TULSA'S BIG NAME 
SOUNDS FAMILIAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tulsa takes on UCLA today, led by senior co-captain -- OK, get ready -- Lou 
Alcindor Dawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "My uncle actually named me," said Dawkins, a 6-foot-5 guard who averages 12.5 
points a game. "I was born in 1971 and I guess Lew Alcindor was the man in 
college basketball then. I guess he won, like, a bunch of championships in a 
row." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't sure how many. Uncertainty surrounds Dawkins, whose birth date is 
listed in Tulsa's preseason media guide as Oct. 4, 1968, but in the postseason 
guide as March 3, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins, 23 going on 25, is from Saginaw, Mich., where his Uncle Willie had 
once been a big high school basketball star. Willie Dawkins was also an admirer 
of Lew Alcindor, back when he was winning a bunch of championships for John 
Wooden and before he became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Upon learning that Haley and 
Marie Dawkins intended to name their new son Lou, Uncle Willie said, "Have I 
got a middle name for you." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, with this NCAA tournament pairing, people must be saying. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "No, you're the first one who's brought it up," Lou Alcindor Dawkins said 
after practice here Thursday, 24 hours from Tulsa-UCLA. "Nobody else has gotten 
on me about it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. Maybe nobody in Tulsa remembers who Lew Alcindor was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmmm. Very possibly," Dawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprising, sometimes, what some folks do know and what some folks don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, the recent admission by UCLA forward Ed O'Bannon that he, a 
college junior, had no idea that Tulsa was in Oklahoma. Nor, apparently, did a 
couple of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like the movie "Sleepless in Seattle," in which Tom Hanks points to a 
map of the United States and asks his son, "Do you know where Oklahoma is?" 
</P>
<P>
 And his son says, "In the middle?" 
</P>
<P>
 All the UCLA Bruins knew was that they were opening the NCAA tournament with 
somebody from the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Oooh, people said, Tulsa is going to be insulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, some busybody stepped right up to Gary Collier, Tulsa's senior 
forward from Ft. Worth, and said, "Gary, Ed O'Bannon said that until this week, 
he wasn't even aware of where Tulsa was. How do you feel about that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The insulted Tulsan's reply? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, before I signed there, I didn't know where Tulsa was, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Laughing, Collier said he understood where UCLA was coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Alcindor Dawkins knows where Tulsa is -- now. It took him five years to 
adjust to leaving Saginaw. Michigan seems like a dream to him now. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins said, "Tulsa was real strange. It was slow. I wasn't used to it, 
especially the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, I came from a 100%, all-black school to a place where, like, there's 50 
out of 5,000 who are black. Man, that really shocked me." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins now ranks among Tulsa's all-time leaders in games played. He was the 
Missouri Valley Conference's defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 How to defend against UCLA is his immediate problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa intends to run with the Bruins, which could be a mistake unless UCLA 
playmaker Tyus Edney can't make his backache go away. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins said, "They can only go three-deep, but we can play the whole bench. 
If we can get them to play our game, we should come out on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Tubby Smith, the Tulsa coach, said of today's opponents, "They haven't been 
playing well of late, but we are. We won 15 of our last 18 games. We are trying 
to get Tulsa to the point where UCLA is at. We want to be expected to be in the 
postseason, just like they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Careful what you ask for, Tub. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurking around the corner at UCLA are two big things -- expectations and Bill 
Walton. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to recent commentary by Walton about the ol' alma mater, Coach Jim 
Harrick jabbed back, "What I've found out about Bill is he's anti. He's always 
been anti. He's been that way since college. I've even heard him rip Coach 
Wooden. That's enough said. Consider the source." 
</P>
<P>
 This apparently means the coach will not name any future children Bill Walton 
Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes no promises about winning the tournament, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick said, "Let me educate everybody with one word. It's not hard to win 
the tournament. It's real hard. It's harder to win it than it is to get a 
ticket to it."

A SUPER-GIANT WAY TO BOW OUT; SKIING: OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST DIANN 
ROFFE-STEINROTTER WINS HER FIRST WORLD CUP SUPER-G IN HER FINAL INTERNATIONAL 
RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a ski racing farewell comparable to Ted Williams' final at-bat, the 
retiring Diann Roffe-Steinrotter went deep Thursday, winning her first World 
Cup super-giant slalom in her last international race. 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter's upset at the World Cup finals was nearly as improbable and 
emotional as her recent Olympic gold-medal victory in super-G had been. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years had passed since her only World Cup victory -- in a 1985 giant 
slalom at Lake Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is everything I've dreamed about for nine years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because ski racing is not baseball, and final ski runs don't rank in lore with 
final home runs, the shelf life of Roffe-Steinrotter's feat outside the ski 
industry figures to be short. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Roffe-Steinrotter's hands trembled in victory. When the 22nd and 
last racer crossed the finish, eliminating the chance of an upset of her upset, 
Roffe-Steinrotter extended her arms skyward and burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old from Potsdam, N.Y., had not, as she had feared, bowed out of 
her 11-year career with a middle-of-the-pack showing, leaving the naysayers to 
doubt the significance of a career punctuated with periodic bursts of 
brilliance, yet lacking in World Cup consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Roffe-Steinrotter seized the day with her winning run of 1 minute 
24.93 seconds from the fourth starting position. Unlike in the Olympics, where 
she got a break when Germany's Katja Seizinger, the world's top super-G racer, 
crashed, Roffe-Steinrotter defeated Seizinger straight up on the Vail course. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizinger, skiing ninth, crossed 0.14 seconds slower. Admittedly, the German 
had more to lose, and skied tentatively to assure a finish and clinch the World 
Cup super-G title. 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, Austria's Anita Wachter, who had shared with Roffe-Steinrotter 
the silver in giant slalom at the 1992 Albertville Olympics, finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter had announced her retirement at the Olympics, and that 
apparently helped soften Thursday's emotional blow for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," she said. "I don't want to stop, but I have to stop, because I 
said I was going to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Would she reconsider? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. "It's 100%. That's why I was crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Her victory was similar to her gold-medal run at Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 There, she started first and sweated out the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, she started fourth and did the same, first surviving Seizinger, then two 
Italians, Isolde Kostner, the Olympic super-G bronze medalist, and Bibiana 
Perez, ranked second in super-G. 
</P>
<P>
 Both crashed. Then came Wachter, skiing 17th, who made a mad dash to beat 
Roffe-Steinrotter's time, only to fall .16 short. 
</P>
<P>
 Only then did the American nervously start accepting congratulations, not yet 
comprehending what she had done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unbelievable," her husband, Willi, said in the finish corral. 
</P>
<P>
 Who was going to argue? 
</P>
<P>
 "At Lillehammer, it was just hard work paying off, sort of like back at you, 
guys," Diann said. "This was just an emotional release. I said to myself, 'It's 
over. It's going to end now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwegians dominated the men's afternoon super-G, with Jan Einar Thorsen 
defeating teammate Lasse Kjus by .44. Hans Knaus of Austria finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 American Tommy Moe, a pre-race favorite, skied sloppily but still finished a 
strong sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I could win if I skied flawless," Moe said. "But Thorsen won by almost 
a half second. I skied good. It was just a tough course. But I had a great 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, Thorsen leap-frogged over Moe, Austria's Guenther Mader and 
Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli to claim the men's super-G title. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli blew a 69-point lead over Thorsen when he finished 10th. Thorsen, 
awarded 100 points for his victory, defeated Girardelli by five. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a bad run on the lower part," said Girardelli, who had won the World 
Cup downhill title Wednesday. "I'll have to try next year again." World Cup 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 With his fourth-place finish in super-G, Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt clinched 
the overall men's title with two races remaining. It was the first overall 
title for the 22-year-old Aamodt, who finished second last year to five-time 
champion Marc Girardelli. "It's the greatest title you can win in skiing, in my 
eyes," Aamodt said. Aamodt, who has supplanted Girardelli as "the world's 
greatest skier," already has won five Olympic medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, injured in Wednesday's downhill, did not race 
Thursday, which virtually assures Switzerland's Vreni Schneider of the overall 
women's title.. . . Although Diann Roffe-Steinrotter's World Cup career ended 
Thursday, she plans to race in next week's U.S. Nationals at Winter Park, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland's William Besse, the winner of Wednesday's downhill, tore a 
ligament in his left knee during a nasty fall during the super-G. . . . After a 
day off today, the World Cup finals resume Saturday with the giant slalom, 
followed by Sunday's slalom.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; WHICH WAY WILL UCLA PLAY TODAY?; 
MIDWEST REGIONAL: AFTER A POOR FINISH IN THE PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE, THE BRUINS 
HOPE TO BE REVITALIZED AGAINST TULSA IN THE FIRST ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA plunges headfirst into the unknown, right here in Central Oklahoma, where 
the Bruins finally will learn what kind of team they really are. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long journey to the NCAA tournament's Midwest Regional and a 
first-round match-up against Tulsa today at noon PST in something that amounts 
to part game, part identity crisis for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Which UCLA team is going to show? The one that was 14-0 and ranked No. 1, or 
the one that finished the regular season 7-6 and dropped to No. 17? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good question and one to which there are about as many answers as hairs 
on Ed O'Bannon's shaved head. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harrick did not sound too worried about the state of his 21-6 and 
fifth-seeded Bruins and putting them up against the 12th-seeded Golden 
Hurricanes, who are 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind our draw, I kind of mind where we are located," said Harrick, 
who pointed out that neither Tulsa nor Oklahoma State, UCLA's potential 
second-round opponent, needed to leave the state to play in the regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not disappointed in the way our team has played," he said. "It's no 
disgrace to lose six games, five on the road. I just want us to be mentally 
ready and emotionally ready. If you can't get excited about playing in this 
thing, pal, you need to be somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 For UCLA to survive the first round, the Bruins also need to be physically 
ready. Tyus Edney missed practice Monday and Tuesday because of a sore back, 
the aftereffects of muscle spasms last Friday, the day before the Oregon game. 
Edney's presence is critical to the Bruins, who need his output on the fast 
break, not to mention his outside shooting and his ability to break down a 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to have him healthy," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando (Tubby) Smith's Tulsa team uses a pressure defense, sometimes in the 
form of a half-court or full-court press, and at the other end, excels at 
stretching an opponent's defense by filling the air with three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricanes tried 551 three-point shots and made 223, a school record. 
Shooting from long distance isn't a big part of the Bruin offense. In 27 games, 
UCLA shot 298 three-pointers and made 103. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith noted that the Bruins are vulnerable in a half-court game, but he said 
he isn't likely to change the Hurricanes' style of play just because Tulsa has 
drawn UCLA in its first NCAA tournament appearance in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's way too late for that," he said. "What you do is to prepare the same way 
we did for every game this season. You try to be as consistent as possible. As 
for UCLA, we know they have great athletes, they're tough in transition and 
they like to run. We might not have the same athleticism as they do, but we 
play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa's chief weapon is 6-foot-4 forward Gary Collier, the Missouri Valley 
Conference's player of the year. On his way to a 22-point average, Collier made 
80 three-pointers, shooting 46.8% from long range. Harrick said Collier will be 
Shon Tarver's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of UCLA's plan to combat Tulsa's three-point shooting is to switch 
all screens on the perimeter and to establish rebounding superiority against a 
smaller team. Tulsa starts one player taller than 6-5 whereas UCLA has 7-0 
George Zidek, 6-8 Ed O'Bannon and 6-6 Charles O'Bannon across the front line. 
</P>
<P>
 When UCLA has the ball, the Bruins have to make sure they hang on to it so 
they don't repeat the 20-turnover debacle at Oregon. Harrick said there is a 
common theory on how to defend UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think you have to play us physical," he said. "Forearm shivers. You're 
not going to get away with that in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Another theory on playing the Bruins is to force them into playing a 
half-court offense. UCLA has had problems working against zone defenses and can 
expect to see Tulsa throw one at them intermittently. Ed O'Bannon is almost 
always double-teamed when he gets the ball now, so he must recognize the 
defense, find an open player and pass the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa's running style should help lift UCLA from any lingering depression 
caused by Saturday's one-point loss to Oregon in the last game of Pacific 10 
Conference race. If it's an open-court game, the Bruins should be more 
comfortable and then play better. That's the plan, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 And if it makes Bruin fans feel any better, Harrick said UCLA is a better team 
now than when it was 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go back and look at us then, we were doing the same things we are 
doing now and we were getting by with them," he said. "When the games got 
tougher, we didn't get by with them any more." 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage of the season, UCLA won't be able to get by with very much and 
still win. There is little margin for error and what a team did in the regular 
season does not count.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's just the way it is," Harrick said. "What if Arkansas gets beat? What 
if North Carolina gets beat? What if Arizona gets beat? It's sad, the season is 
just window dressing all the way to the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 And what if UCLA gets beat? That's one season out the window. Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tyus Edney completed a full practice Thursday for the first time since 
suffering from muscle spasms in his back six days ago. Edney, who couldn't 
practice Monday or Tuesday, lasted about half of UCLA's practice Wednesday, but 
said he felt good after working out at the Myriad, site of today's games. "I'm 
certain we'll play him," Coach Jim Harrick said. "I'm just not certain how well 
he'll play." Harrick, who played an ineffective Edney for 33 minutes against 
Oregon the day after the point guard was injured, called that decision "a real 
stupid move by that coach." UCLA got a scare during practice when Charles 
O'Bannon was accidentally poked in the right eye. O'Bannon sat in a chair on 
the sideline and held an ice pack over his eye. His injury is not believed to 
be serious. . . . In case you were wondering: Tulsa Coach Orlando (Tubby) 
Smith, one of 17 children, said this is how he got his nickname: "I was a 
little chubby and I had a fondness for the bathtub."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PARK IS SOUND, TEAM DOCTOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the Dodgers signed Chan Ho Park, they sent team orthopedist Frank Jobe 
to Korea to examine him. Jobe reported that Park was a very sound prospect, but 
said there was a slight overgrowth of bone in his pitching elbow, a sign of 
overuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Overgrowth is a common condition that does not interfere with pitching, but 
usually doesn't occur until later in a pitcher's career. What it told the 
Dodgers was that Park, 20, probably had been throwing hard for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean that something is wrong, but we need to have him under a good 
pitching program that doesn't allow him to hurt his elbow," Jobe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park is such a top prospect that the Dodgers are watching him carefully. He 
has been given a turn in the rotation and will continue to start regularly in 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, in the Dodgers' 4-3 victory over the New York Mets at Vero Beach, 
Fla., he started his third game and pitched well, giving up a run, three hits 
and striking out three in three innings. He mixed up his pitches, kept his 
composure after the umpires had called his second balk of the day, and got his 
first major league hit, waving to the crowd as he stood on first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got to first base, (first baseman) Glenn Davis said hello to me in 
Korean, and that made me feel good, too." Park said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had wavered on whether to pitch Park because his arm was slightly 
sore after his four-inning stint on Sunday, a normal condition in spring 
training. But Park said he felt fine, so he pitched a predetermined three 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Park continued to mix up his delivery, and hesitated during several windups. 
On one pitch to Jeromy Burnitz, he paused so long that Met players yelled at 
Burnitz to step out. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Met Manager) Dallas Greene told me after the game that he will not allow 
Park to use that delivery during the season," said umpire Bruce Froemming, who 
worked first base. "He will have his batters call time out. There is no 
interpretation of the rule, and if this is still happening when the season 
starts, there will be a serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
 It will only be a problem if Park makes the team, and to do that, he will have 
to beat out a starter, or replace an injured or traded starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching coach Ron Perranoski said Park is progressing faster than he 
expected. But he needs some seasoning, and the club is not likely to put him in 
the bullpen. They would prefer to see him starting at triple-A Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers reportedly have been shopping Roger McDowell to clubs all spring, 
including the Angels, but Executive Vice President Fred Claire said McDowell 
has a place on the team. "We are not seeking to move Roger McDowell," Claire 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry was already on the field when he got word that his wife, 
Charisse, had given birth to a boy, Jordan Shay. "I named him after Michael 
Jordan," Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good friend and I'm a big fan of his and that's why I picked it." 
Strawberry said. He will fly to Los Angeles today to be with his wife and plans 
to return in time for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Offerman has made no errors in 11 games this spring. He is batting .314.

HUNTER LEFT BEHIND A LEGACY OF GOOD WILL; BASEBALL: SPRING TRAINING IS NOT THE 
SAME WITHOUT THE DEAN OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BASEBALL WRITERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual rite known as spring training is in full swing, but for many in 
Southern California, baseball training camps will never be the same again. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in more than half a century, Bob Hunter, dean of Los 
Angeles baseball writers, is not there. Hunter died last fall, the day after 
probably the wildest game in World Series history, Toronto's 15-14 marathon 
victory over Philadelphia. His death ended a writing career that began in the 
'30s, when the only major sports in Los Angeles were college football, horse 
racing and boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 He is missed by writers, players, broadcasters, executives and fans. There was 
hardly a writer who came along in those more than 50 years who didn't get a 
helping hand from Hunter, among them this one. Hunter made sure this country 
boy from Missouri had a chance to get to know all the important sports people. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he was the one who cut up the pot for the high-low poker games at 
Dodger camp for more than 30 years, Hunter was given the nickname of "Chopper." 
He could just as well have been called "Scoop." Besides being an outstanding 
baseball writer and columnist, Hunter was among the best sports reporters in 
the newspaper business. He almost always had the story first. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the Dodgers brought major league baseball to the area, spring 
training was a major event in Southern California. As many as half a dozen 
major league teams trained in the area, along with the Pacific Coast League 
teams. Hunter covered the PCL for the old Los Angeles Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1946, a dozen years before the Dodgers came west, Hunter left this note: 
"Check out the Pirates-White Sox game tomorrow at San Bernardino. The Pirates 
have a young slugger named Kiner. He's something special." 
</P>
<P>
 Turned out that Ralph Kiner was, indeed, something special. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter and Examiner columnist Vincent X. Flaherty were at the forefront of the 
group responsible for bringing the Dodgers to the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is probably best remembered for lending a hand to young writers. Gordon 
Verrell of the Long Beach Press-Telegram, now the dean of Dodger writers, 
recalls his first meeting with Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was halfway through the 1969 season," Verrell said. "I was replacing Fred 
Claire, who was joining the Dodger organization. I had been covering the 
Angels, but I didn't know anybody on the Dodgers or in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second half started in Chicago. When I boarded the team bus for Wrigley 
Field, Hunter came up, introduced himself and sat down by me. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we reached the park he took me over to the Cubs' clubhouse. We had to 
cross the field because the clubhouse was out in left field. It took longer 
than a normal walk because players and coaches stopped to greet Hunter. I was 
startled to see just how well everyone seemed to know him. He introduced me to 
all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and Leo Durocher, then manager of the Cubs, greeted each other like old 
buddies. Then Hunter introduced me. Although he barely knew me, he told Leo, 
'This is one of the good guys, Leo.' It was that way with Hunter the rest of 
the year. He made sure I knew everyone. It made it much easier for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Times Sports Editor Bill Dwyre also remembers an occasion when Hunter was 
extremely helpful to a newcomer. At the time, Hunter was working for the rival 
Herald Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had met Hunter a couple of times, but this was my first day at Vero Beach 
for The Times," Dwyre said. "The story had broken that day about baseball 
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth fining some Pittsburgh players for a drug problem. 
My computer broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunter saw my plight. He didn't just give me his machine to use, he stayed 
around for two hours to make sure I didn't have any problems with the machine. 
He was somebody exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Times columnist John Hall might not have been in the newspaper business 
if it had not been for a boost from Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just been graduated from Stanford in 1950," Hall recalled. "I had 
called and written letters to all the sports editors and received no replies. I 
was thinking that maybe I should go to graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunter was my last hope. The father of a classmate of mine, Dean Borba, was a 
baseball writer, covering the San Francisco Seals and Dean had suggested I see 
Hunter. I called Hunter and he was at Wrigley Field covering a game. He invited 
me to come to a game and sit with him in the press box and discuss my plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "He introduced me to everyone, put in his newsy column, 'Bobbin' Around,' that 
a classmate of basketball star George Yardley and sports editor of the Daily 
Stanford was looking for a writing job. He also called some people that 
eventually led to a job. He was always something special to me." 
</P>
<P>
 One of my fondest memories of Hunter goes back to that fateful day, Jan. 7, 
1962, when Los Angeles went from four newspapers to two when the Mirror folded 
and the Examiner was merged with the Herald. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter immediately called Curley Grieve, sports editor of the San Francisco 
Examiner, telling him that the best baseball writer in the West (this writer) 
was available. Grieve offered me a job. Although I eventually joined The Times, 
it was a welcome gesture at a time of uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get the idea that Hunter was a saint. He wasn't. When he started in the 
newspaper business in the '30s, it was a tough, low-paying profession and many 
of its practitioners were transients and hard drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 In his early days as a sportswriter, Hunter covered the San Diego Padres in 
the PCL for the Examiner. He wrote something about them that displeased the 
owner, who banned Hunter from Lane Field, home of the Padres. So, for a week, 
until the dispute was resolved, Hunter climbed a telephone pole outside the 
park and never missed a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Hunter was part-owner of a bar called the Sports Club at Fifth and Hill 
in downtown Los Angeles. His friendship with so many baseball managers enabled 
him to throw a post-World Series party each fall during the '50s that was 
almost always attended by the managers of the World Series opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other celebrities who usually attended was UCLA football Coach Red 
Sanders. An interesting sight was Sanders, who had played semipro baseball at 
one time, giving former Dodger Manager Charlie Dressen tips on baseball. In 
turn, Dressen, a quarterback for the old Chicago Staleys, forerunner to the 
Chicago Bears, would diagram plays he thought Sanders should use. 
</P>
<P>
 A true friend is gone and spring training just isn't the same.

MORNING BRIEFING: WISCONSIN MEMORIES LINGER ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Wolf, retired Milwaukee sportswriter who lives in San Diego and writes 
occasionally for The Times, remembers the last time Wisconsin was in the NCAA 
tournament, 1947, from the vantage point of a student manager. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why the memory lingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wisconsin's basketball team had to survive a tragic experience en route to 
its last previous NCAA bid 47 years ago," says Wolf. "At halftime of a game 
against Purdue in West Lafayette, Ind., the wooden stands on one side of the 
floor collapsed. Three spectators were killed and hundreds were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game was called at that point, with Purdue leading, 34-33, and was 
completed after the regular season ended at Evanston, Ill., High School, where 
Northwestern played most of its home games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only did the switch cost Purdue its home-court advantage, the crowd in 
Evanston was overwhelmingly pro-Wisconsin. The Badgers won going away, 72-60, 
and clinched the championship of the Big Nine, as the Big Ten was known in 
those days, before Michigan State joined, replacing Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: This Wyoming guard started for the Cowboys' first NCAA tournament 
team, in 1941, and was held scoreless in losses to Arkansas and Creighton. He 
became better known for broadcasting the tournament, as well as baseball, 
football and outdoor shows. Who was he? 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coaches: If Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson needs any help getting 
his point across during a timeout in the Razorbacks' game against North 
Carolina A&T today, he can point to the Powell family, in the stands at 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara and Bernie Powell of Little Rock, their son Jeff of Dallas and Sharron 
Burtcher of Springfield, Ark., wear Razorback hats and red shirts. Barbara's 
says "40" on the front, Bernie's "Minutes," Sharron's "Of" and Jeff's "Hell." 
Together they spell out the scenario often preached by Richardson: "40 minutes 
of hell." 
</P>
<P>
 What have you done lately?The Atlanta Braves have won three consecutive 
National League West titles, but have yet to win a World Series, so Manager 
Bobby Cox is being called baseball's Marv Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at us like we're losers," Cox said. "I told our players in a 
meeting we should act like winners. We won more games than any team in baseball 
the last three years. . . . We're always being compared to the Buffalo Bills. 
I'll tell you this, things have been a lot of fun around here the last three 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Until late October. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael of All Trades: Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe on Michael Jordan's 
baseball venture:  
</P>
<P>
 "We can all be thankful that (Chicago) Bulls-White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf 
doesn't run a hospital. Who knows what Jerry might have allowed if Michael woke 
up one day and said he wanted to perform surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Curt Gowdy.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; YOUNG'S INJURY PUTS TRADE ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels told first baseman J.T. Snow on Thursday that he may be traded to 
the New York Mets, but negotiations stalled when Met pitcher Anthony Young was 
scratched from a start because of a strained groin muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Young completed his warm-up throws in the bullpen at Vero Beach, Fla., where 
he was to have pitched against the Dodgers, then felt a twinge in his groin and 
was scratched. That means the Angels will have to delay their plans for at 
least four days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed, obviously," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said at 
Tempe, Ariz. "We're still very much interested in him, but this is a major 
setback. We want to see him pitch before we do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 If Young had pitched effectively against the Dodgers, Bavasi said the trade 
probably would have been consummated Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he goes out and pitches four to five innings in his next outing, we'll 
probably realize everything is OK. We'll wait, because we're really not that 
close to doing anything with somebody else." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Pete Janicki was optioned to the minor league camp before the Angels' 
10-6 loss to the Chicago Cubs Thursday, but he accomplished in three weeks what 
Manager Buck Rodgers had never envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I'd ever seen him throwing like this," Rodgers said. "I'm 
going to have to take back what I said before, because I really didn't think 
he'd ever pitch in the major leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Janicki returned this spring after suffering a broken right elbow last April 9 
in his first outing. Despite the layoff, Janicki's fastball has been clocked at 
92 m.p.h. He finished his spring with a 0-1 record and a 3.00 ERA.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think I erased all doubts about coming back 100%," Janicki said. "To me, 
it's been very successful." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pitcher John Farrell cleared waivers Thursday and is expected to accept an 
assignment to triple-A Vancouver. . . . Dan O'Brien, former Angel vice 
president, was hired Thursday as director of baseball operations for the 
Arizona Fall League. BOB NIGHTENGALE

RAMS ARE EXPECTED TO TRADE EVERETT SOON; FOOTBALL: DEAL WITH NEW ORLEANS COULD 
BE COMPLETED TODAY, BOTH TEAMS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY and T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams, hoping to make room under the salary cap to stay aggressive in the 
free-agent market, are expected to trade quarterback Jim Everett to the New 
Orleans Saints as soon as today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram officials indicated that if the deal is completed today, the team will 
receive in compensation a low draft pick, believed to be a seventh-rounder. New 
Orleans officials confirmed that the trade could be announced as early as 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett was believed to be on his way to New Orleans on Thursday night, and 
must pass a physical before the trade is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 At a staff meeting Thursday morning, the Rams decided to no longer demand a 
high draft pick in compensation for Everett, and to unload his $2.65-million 
salary for next season. They decided to make contact with New Orleans, the only 
team showing interest in the struggling quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Demoff, Everett's agent, also confirmed Thursday night that the Rams 
and Saints have been discussing a trade for Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams obtained Everett in a trade with Houston in 1986, giving up defensive 
end William Fuller, guard Kent Hill, first-round draft choices in 1987 and '88, 
and a fifth-round choice in 1987. Houston had made Everett the third overall 
selection in the 1986 draft behind running back Bo Jackson (Tampa Bay) and nose 
tackle Tony Casillas (Atlanta). 
</P>
<P>
 But after leading the Rams to three consecutive losing seasons, Everett was 
benched last season in favor of quarterback T.J. Rubley. The Rams considered 
cutting Everett in November to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett has two years left on his contract, and in 1993 was designated as the 
team's transition player for the 1996 season, after his contract expired. By 
trading Everett, the Rams would retain the transition designation to use on 
another player. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have been shopping Everett since the trading period opened Feb. 17.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: SOME TELECASTS FAR FROM MADNESS CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are unemployed, retired, work at night or able to take long lunch 
hours, then the tipoff time for UCLA's not-ready-for-prime-time players today 
might be no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most, weekday basketball that begins around noon, as does the Bruins' 
first-round NCAA tournament game against Tulsa, doesn't cut it. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the game is being televised. California's game Thursday against 
Wisconsin Green Bay wasn't shown in Southern California. Neither will Arizona's 
game today against Loyola of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA selection committee assigned starting times to those games that fall 
out of CBS' time blocks for basketball. Rick Gentile, CBS' senior vice 
president of production, calls it "no man's land." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gentile: "What are you going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Heaven forbid that CBS preempt all its daytime programming for basketball. 
What would all those "Geraldo" fans do? 
</P>
<P>
 But it sure would be nice if CBS farmed out games to ESPN. That's the way it 
used to work, before CBS' current deal with the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS likes the current arrangement because the network has exclusive rights to 
all games. It was willing to pay $1 billion over the seven years for that. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA took the big bucks, and the little guy, such as the Cal or Arizona 
fan who lives in Southern California, ends up paying. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal-Wisconsin Green Bay game was shown by only six CBS stations nationwide 
-- five in Northern California and one in Green Bay. Although Cal fans might 
disagree after watching the 61-57 upset, the game was deserving of more 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcers for today's Bruin game will be Ted Robinson, a Bay Area 
announcer who does the Giants as well as selected Cal and Notre Dame basketball 
telecasts, and Greg Kelser, co-captain with Magic Johnson of the 1979 Michigan 
State national championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelser works Minnesota Timberwolf cable telecasts and does college basketball 
for Raycom and Black Entertainment Television. Kelser also worked the 
tournament for CBS in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS has eight announcing teams working games at the eight sites this weekend. 
That group will be pared down to four teams next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile, who decides who moves on, said he has pretty much made up his mind, 
but could change if there is a team that stands out this weekend, or one that 
falters. The announcers will learn early next week if they made the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing for sure, four broadcast teams aren't going to like me very much," 
Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commentators who impress Gentile sometimes get a cushy studio job, as did 
former Ohio State star Clark Kellogg this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Meyers, working with Tim Ryan on Thursday's Syracuse-Hawaii game, did a 
nice job. 
</P>
<P>
 There it was on national, prime-time television Wednesday night, Bob Knight 
being intimidated, rather than the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Costas' interview with Knight, shown on NBC's new show, "Now," was 
excellent. Costas was fair and evenhanded, yet stood his ground. He didn't back 
down and refused to be bullied. And, in the end, he seemed to earn Knight's 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Costas asked Knight if he had intentionally head-butted freshman guard Sherron 
Wilkerson last week, and if he had intentionally kicked his son Pat earlier in 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight said Wilkerson's head simply got in his way, as had his son's leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Costas gave Knight the benefit of doubt, but questioned why he would leave no 
margin for error, why he would come so close to a player's head with his head 
or why he would kick a chair occupied by his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Costas also said he talked with Wilkerson, and the player told him that he 
believed Knight, that the head butt was accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight's version: "I went down and bent over, and we apparently collided 
heads. I didn't even notice anything about it at the time other than two guys 
in close quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the leg-kicking incident, Pat Knight, interviewed for the feature, 
said, "My leg just happened to be where the chair was. I got grazed, but I mean 
-- as you can tell -- he's going for the chair." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Knight: "Patrick knows that there's nobody else on the face of the earth 
that I love more than him -- and he understands that. I don't even have to 
worry about that. He also understands that he made a really careless bad blind 
pass out on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Costas asked Knight if he understood parents who were hesitant about sending 
their sons to Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," Knight said. "I simply say that I'm going to be the toughest 
coach he can play for. I'm going to be more demanding than any coach he can 
play for. He's going to have to go to class. . . . There will be more demands 
placed on your son at Indiana than anywhere he could go." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Knight: An interview ESPN's Beano Cook did with Knight was shown on 
"SportsCenter" last weekend, and in that one there were no questions about the 
head-butting incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Rome complained on XTRA Monday that Cook "softballed" Knight. Give Rome, 
who is also employed by ESPN, credit for not being afraid to criticize a 
colleague. But apparently Rome didn't know that Cook had taped the interview 
before the head butt. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint should have been that ESPN didn't update the piece before 
showing it.

NBA ROUNDUP; SEATTLE GETS EARLY BERTH IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp had 21 points, 14 rebounds and four steals Thursday night at 
Minneapolis to lead the Seattle SuperSonics in a 107-92 victory over the 
Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics became the first team to clinch a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other players scored in double figures for Seattle, with Kendall Gill and 
Gary Payton each getting 19 as the SuperSonics won for the ninth time in 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle has the NBA's best overall record (46-16) and best road record 
(21-12). The Supersonics, however, have lost guard Ricky Pierce for about four

JOHNSON IS RICHEST IN COURT SKILLS; PREP BASKETBALL: EX-UCLA STAR MARQUES' SON 
OVERCOMES MANY DOUBTS IN LEADING POWERFUL CRENSHAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY BAUM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the new kid, the one with the famous father and the fancy address, 
arrived at Crenshaw High, his basketball teammates welcomed him with what they 
considered a suitable nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came in, they called me 'the Fresh Prince of Bel Air,' " 
Kristaan Johnson said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 That nickname is history, and Johnson can only laugh about his apprehension 
over transferring as a junior from a mostly white private school, Montclair 
Prep in Van Nuys, to the predominantly black public school. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson now is focusing on helping the Cougars win their second consecutive 
State Division I championship, and sixth since 1983, when they play Carmichael 
Jesuit on Saturday at the Oakland Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound forward, had hoped, but never expected, it 
would turn out this way. Last season, his layup at the buzzer beat rival Santa 
Ana Mater Dei in the Southern Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 In the championship rematch last Saturday, the UCLA-bound Johnson, who is 
averaging 23 points and nine rebounds, led Crenshaw to a 71-67 victory with 27 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 But before transferring to Crenshaw, Johnson had serious reservations. 
Although he was dominating Montclair Prep's soft competition, the surroundings 
were comfortable and he didn't have to push himself too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he had this dream of playing at a top level Division I college, as had 
his father, Marques, who starred at UCLA from 1973-77 and went on to an NBA 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched high school championship games on television when I was in ninth 
and 10th grades," Johnson said. "I was like, 'Wow, Mater Dei! Wow, Crenshaw!' I 
thought I'd never be able to play on that level. But in 10th grade, my dad told 
me, 'If you want to play Division I, I think it's best if you go to Crenshaw.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 His father, a former Crenshaw standout, also helped sort out the options. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him he had a few choices," said Marques, 38. " 'You could stay at 
Montclair Prep and be a decent player and, if you did play Division I ball, it 
probably wouldn't be at a big school. Or you could go to a school like Crenshaw 
and have a shot to play at UCLA or another Pac-10 school.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more to Johnson's fear than going to school in the Crenshaw 
district: Could he live up to his father's reputation? 
</P>
<P>
 Willie West, who has coached Crenshaw since 1970, assured Johnson that wasn't 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids tend to feel everybody's going to be comparing them to their father," 
said West, 53. "I told him I'm not looking for him to do what his father did." 
</P>
<P>
 Needing to live in the district in order for Kristaan to play at Crenshaw, the 
Johnson family moved from Bel-Air to a house Marques had previously owned in 
View Park. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another example of Marques boosting his son's budding basketball 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I was young, my dad has always worked with me," Kristaan said. "Every 
day we'd play one on one. He'd be out there timing me when I was running up the 
hill. That really helped our relationship. We got really, really close." 
</P>
<P>
 Years before the training sessions, however, there was a tragedy that already 
had bonded the family. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 16, 1987, Marques' 15-month-old son, Marques Jr., died of cardiac 
arrest less than 24 hours after having fallen into the family swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the house and made the 911 call," said Kristaan, who was 10 at the 
time of the accident. "That was traumatizing for me. It kind of brought our 
family a lot closer together. I think about it to myself a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Marques, who played 10 NBA seasons, including three with the Clippers, played 
one season in Italy after the accident. Then he began to focus on Kristaan's 
game, sometimes with doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In ninth grade he was chunky," Marques said. "He finished last in every drill 
so I was like, 'Hit your books.' But in between his ninth and 10th grade years 
he went all out. He was at the UCLA track every day and lost a lot of weight. 
He came back to Montclair Prep and started finishing first in every drill and 
turned himself around." 
</P>
<P>
 When Kristaan finally decided to go to Crenshaw, he fretted about how he would 
be perceived. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people thought I was stuck up or whatever," he said. "They were 
always saying, 'He thinks he's all that because of his dad.' But I didn't want 
that, to come off like I was some type of arrogant braggadocio person when I'm 
really not. So I kind of kept to myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Said senior forward Tremaine Fowlkes, who had transferred the same year from 
Culver City: "Knowing his father was a former NBA player (we thought) he was 
rich and spoiled. But the attitude toward him changed over a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 As did the attitude of college coaches, who were uncertain about Johnson's 
abilities, even after his solid junior season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people felt, 'Well, he goes to Crenshaw, he's got a lot of players 
around him,' " said UCLA assistant coach Lorenzo Romar. "They said, 'Let's see 
what's going to happen this summer at the ABCD camp.' Well, Kris played among a 
bunch of stars, J.R. Henderson (East Bakersfield and UCLA signee), Jelani 
Gardner (Bellflower St. John Bosco). It was a stacked team, and he was the 
second-leading scorer. He impressed a lot of coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially UCLA's. And the feeling was mutual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in Bel-Air, I used to go down to UCLA every day," said Johnson, whose 
father is the radio analyst for Bruin broadcasts. "I am so familiar with the 
campus it's like, where else would I have gone?" 
</P>
<P>
 He had an early taste of feeling part of the Bruins when John Wooden surprised 
him with a call last Saturday morning, hours before Crenshaw's regional 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the victory over Mater Dei, Johnson and Fowlkes, who has signed 
with California, were at a shopping mall when they got a glimpse of what lies 
in their future. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were like, 'Kris and Tremaine, good game yesterday,' " Johnson said. 
"People I had never seen before. It felt good. It feels good to be recognized."

BOYS' BASKETBALL / STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS; CRENSHAW LOOKS FOR A REPEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carmichael Jesuit High lost to Crenshaw in the State Division I boys' 
basketball final last year at Oakland, then waited patiently to see if it would 
be awarded the championship trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after Crenshaw had defeated Jesuit for its record fifth State title, 
73-66, rumors began flying that the Cougars had violated rules because many of 
their players had questionable transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been hearing things about Crenshaw all year," said Hank Meyer, 
Jesuit's coach. "Things hit a peak during the tournament. We thought maybe 
something would come of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks later, the City Section conducted an investigation into the Crenshaw 
basketball program and found no violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer said many in the community were excited about Jesuit getting the title, 
but he was not counting on anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I really didn't want to win State by forfeiture," he 
said. "I'd rather do it on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Jesuit has the chance to do just that. The Marauders (31-6) take 
on Crenshaw (28-2) for the State championship at 8 p.m. Saturday at the Oakland 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesuit advanced to the title game with a 79-72 victory over Oakland Fremont in 
the Northern Regional final last Saturday, and Crenshaw defeated Santa Ana 
Mater Dei in the Southern Regional, 71-67. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the schools are the same this year, the circumstances are different. 
Jesuit was rated No. 1 in the state by Cal-Hi Sports most of last season, and 
began the final with a 35-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the Marauders struggled early, losing several times in holiday 
tournaments. They dropped two games in the first half of conference play and 
finished in a three-way tie for first with Sacramento Foothill and Roseville 
Oakmont. They were seeded fourth in the Northern Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesuit, however, has won 13 in a row, and Meyer believes his team has finally 
found the right chemistry. His team is well balanced with guards Gio Carmazzi, 
Omarr Collins and Chris Griffin and forward Ben Ammerman scoring in double 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw has been the state's top-rated team all season, despite two losses 
during a holiday tournament in South Carolina. The Cougars had four starters 
from last year, and filled the missing point guard position with Tommie Davis, 
a talented transfer from Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Willie West will be going for his sixth State championship in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been pumped up about this game all season," said Kristaan Johnson, 
Crenshaw's starting forward who is averaging 23 points and nine rebounds. 
"We're at the point where we wanted to be. This season has been awesome."

GIRLS' BASKETBALL / STATE TOURNAMENT; IT'S A TALE OF TWO CHAMPIONS: LYNWOOD 
MEETS SACRED HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A strange situation has arisen in the State Division I girls' basketball 
tournament. When Lynwood plays Atherton Sacred Heart at 6 p.m. in the Oakland 
Coliseum on Saturday, each team will be a defending State champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they won their titles in different divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood won its title in Division I, which consists of the state's largest 
schools and those with the strongest basketball traditions. Sacred Heart won 
its title in Division V, which is the state's lowest level. 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies the strangeness. How does a team jump from the lowest 
division to the highest and still contend for the State championship? 
</P>
<P>
 "Good players," said Sacred Heart Coach Mike Ciardella. 
</P>
<P>
 Two starters from last season's Sacred Heart team currently play for NCAA 
Division I teams, and two senior starters on this year's team will head for 
Division I schools next fall. Not bad for a high school with an enrollment of 
288. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacred Heart was not challenged in Division V last season. The Gators were 
undefeated during the regular season, winning games by an average of 40 points 
and defeating El Cajon Christian in the State final, 59-39. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciardella, who is 101-4 in three years as the Gators' coach, said that girls' 
basketball in the Atherton area is bolstered by the success of the nearby 
Stanford women's team, which won NCAA titles in 1990 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciardella's assistant coach is former Stanford star Molly Goodenbour, most 
valuable player of the 1992 NCAA Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior center Jenny Circle, at 6 feet 3, averages 19.5 points, 13 rebounds and 
leads a balanced attack for Sacred Heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Circle and the rest of the Gators will be busy, however, containing Lynwood's 
Timicha Kirby, a 5-11 senior forward who averages 22 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood is 32-1 this season, its one loss having been inflicted by Brea-Olinda 
in the championship game of the Rancho Cucamonga tournament in December. 
</P>
<P>
 If Sacred Heart (37-0) wins the State title, it will break its own California 
record for victories in a season, set last year. The Gators have won 74 
consecutive games.

MIDWEST REGIONAL / AT WICHITA, KAN.; FRESHMAN CONQUERS ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As freshmen go, there are not many college basketball players with more 
glowing reputations than 6-foot-9 center Joe Smith of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly left an indelible impression on St. Louis Coach Charlie Spoonhour 
in the Terrapins' 74-66 victory in the first round of the NCAA Midwest Regional 
at the Kansas Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith scored 29 points and grabbed 15 rebounds against a team seeded seventh 
in the region and ranked in the top 25 most of the season. He made 10 of 15 
shots and nine of 10 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's quite a player," Spoonhour said. "If there's a better player in this 
tournament, I don't want to see him." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Spoonhour, whose team was making its first appearance in the 
NCAA tournament since 1957, that will not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th-seeded Terrapins (17-11) saw to that, breaking out front early on and 
leading most of the way against St. Louis (23-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts 78, Southwest Texas State 60 -- After a slow start, the 
second-seeded Minutemen had little difficulty in winning their opener. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minutemen (28-6) shot only 34.3% in the first half but still managed to 
open a 39-25 lead by the break. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Texas (25-7), making its first tournament appearance, stayed close 
until Massachusetts guard Mike Williams hit consecutive three-pointers in the 
final minute of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bobcats never got their offense on track, making only 38.9% of their 
shots in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory sets up a rematch between Massachusetts and Maryland. The 
Minutemen won the first meeting in December at Springfield, Mass., 94-80. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 91, Western Kentucky 74 -- The Longhorns advanced past the Hilltoppers 
(20-11) to the second round on the strength of sizzling second-half shooting 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas (26-7) made 65.6% of its shots in the half to overcome a 40-36 halftime 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 19th victory in the last 20 games for the Longhorns, who tied a 
school record for victories in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Longhorns, who will play Michigan in the second round Saturday, were 
sparked by forward Albert Burditt with 26 points. Reserve guard Roderick 
Anderson had 25 points.

NAIA CHAMPIONSHIPS; AZUSA OUSTED BY HAWAII PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Next time, serve decaf, would be Azusa Pacific's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii Pacific woke up in the second half and eliminated the Cougars, 97-78, 
Thursday in the second round of the NAIA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii Pacific (27-7) will play Life College of Georgia today in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little sluggish in the first half and arguing amongst ourselves," 
said Hawaii Pacific's John Strickland, a transfer from Louisville. "We decided 
to win together or lose together. 
</P>
<P>
 "That, and maybe a little bit of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa and Hawaii had the 9 a.m. game, which meant a two-hour time difference 
for Azusa and a five-hour difference for Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific, ending its season at 29-5, led for most of the first half and 
had a halftime lead of 46-41. But Brian Blackwell scored 22 of his game-high 28 
points in the second half as Hawaii Pacific turned the game around and won 
easily.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like everything I called in the first half worked," Azusa Pacific 
Coach Bill Odell said. "But (Blackwell) just went off. If they had gone to him 
in the first half, we probably wouldn't have been in the game then." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly they weren't in it for much of the second half as Hawaii Pacific led 
by 12 points nine minutes into the half and by 22 with 3:48 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting his team's uniforms, Hawaii Coach Tony Sellitto said, "How can you beat 
a team wearing green on St. Patrick's Day?" 
</P>
<P>
 Strickland got Azusa forward Ronnie Winbush and center Paul White into foul 
trouble in the first half. Then, when Azusa Pacific's guards dropped back on 
defense, Blackwell's game opened up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they picked their game up, we didn't react," said Winbush, who finished 
with a team-high 18 points. "We had our shots, but they weren't falling. Today 
we tried to come back with too much one-on-one, and not play as a team."  
</P>
<P>
 Success might have been Azusa Pacific's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're used to being behind -- they didn't lose many this 
year," Blackwell said.

SLOPPY WESTMONT LOSES UGLY, 85-65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westmont Coach John Moore was not sure he wanted to look at the box score. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how badly his team had played in losing, 85-65, to Life College of 
Marietta, Ga., in a second-round game of the NAIA basketball tournament 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 When he did look, it was as bad as he'd feared. 
</P>
<P>
 Westmont (19-13) turned the ball over 16 times in the first half and top 
shooter Zak DeMatteo missed all 13 of his shots. The Santa Barbara school 
trailed early in the game, 11-0, and never got closer than 10 after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were down by 11, I thought, 'If we can get a couple of baskets, we'll 
be back in it," Moore said. "Well, we ran into a buzz saw." 
</P>
<P>
 Life's pressure defense kept Westmont's guards from getting the ball to top 
forward Mike Spears, who ended up with 12 points. Without DeMatteo's outside 
shooting and Spears' usual work inside, Westmont was sunk. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense also led to easy shots, including 26 points on layups. 
</P>
<P>
 Life guard Billy Lewis led all scorers with 28 points.

NCAA TOURNAMENT / DAILY REPORT; EAST REGIONAL; KNIGHT'S BACK HURTS; PLAYERS 
BACK HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indiana Coach Bob Knight says his ailing back will be of little consequence 
when the Hoosiers plays Ohio University tonight in the first round at Landover, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
 "My back doesn't make any difference," he said. "I haven't had anything happen 
to my voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight stood during the final half of his news conference Thursday and never 
raised his voice in perhaps as sedate a session with the press as he has ever 
had. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a truss to ease the pain in his lower back, Knight was almost cordial 
in discussing his team's chances against Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a wild season for Knight, who in separate games appeared to 
head-butt freshman Sherron Wilkerson and appeared to kick his own son, Pat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see what the problem is," said star guard Damon Bailey. "I don't see 
why you guys worry about it when we don't worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sherron is the one who's getting head-butted. Pat's the one who happened to 
get kicked. If we understand what he's doing, if we understand that he's trying 
to make us better. . . . That's just coach's way of doing things. Different 
coaches have different styles." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight, asked if he was concerned he might one day step too far over the line, 
said: "I think we all have areas that we could eventually step over. But are 
any of us ever able to say that it will never happen? We all want things to 
flow as smoothly as possible, but I think we can't in any way guarantee that 
that will always be the case." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Hoosiers' last home game this season, Knight recited a poem to the 
crowd in which he asked to be buried face down so his critics would find it 
easier to kiss his rump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he just found it in a book of great poems somewhere," forward Alan 
Henderson said.

EAST REGIONAL / AT UNIONDALE, N.Y.; UCONN GAGS, BUT DOESN'T CHOKE AGAINST RIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No stranger to NCAA tournaments, but unused to such a lofty seeding, 
Connecticut found its first-round game Thursday fit like a Size-15 collar 
around a Size-19 neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's because Rider was supposed to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncs were anything but in the first half, holding leads as high as six 
points, but then Donyell Marshall took control and Connecticut, second-seeded 
in the East, rolled to a 64-46 victory at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies (28-4) were tied, 29-29, at halftime and then Marshall, who had 
averaged 25.8 points a game but had only six points in the first half, scored 
nine in a 23-6 UConn run to start the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was uptight a little. I think everyone was," said Marshall, who finished 
with 19 points, only the third time all season he has had fewer than 20. "I 
think we were afraid to lose. It's really our first time as big favorites, and 
we were nervous. I hope we got it out of our system." 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut turned the game around with defense in the second half, holding 
Rider (21-9) to eight-for-32 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies, ranked fourth nationally, forced 15th-seeded Rider to miss 13 of 
its first 15 shots in the second half. Connecticut took advantage of the 
drought to turn the halftime tie into a 52-35 lead with 6:34 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 George Washington 51, Alabama Birmingham 46 -- The Colonials, the surprise 
team of last year's tournament when they went to the round of 16, survived a 
20-point second half and will play Connecticut in the second round on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yinka Dare, a 7-foot-1 center, led 10th-seeded George Washington with 16 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a good defensive team and we usually do well against perimeter teams. I 
wish some of our confidence on defense would transfer over to the offense," 
Coach Mike Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
 George Washington (18-11) made only six of 22 shots (27%) in the second half 
and survived a seven-minute scoreless stretch. That was because Alabama 
Birmingham (22-8) wasn't much better, shooting only 29%. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 64, James Madison 62 -- Dan Cross drove through the lane for a running 
one-hander with 7.2 seconds to play to lift the Gators over the upset-minded 
Dukes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve guard Greg Williams, averaging two points in his freshman season, made 
a three-pointer with 48 seconds left, giving Florida a 62-60 lead, but Clayton 
Ritter made two free throws 15 seconds later, tying the score. Ritter scored 20 
of his 27 points in the second half for 14th-seeded James Madison (20-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Cross scored 16 points to lead Florida (26-7), which made James Madison the 
first Lefty Driesell-coached team to lose in the first round in 12 NCAA 
appearances. All of his previous games were with Davidson and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennsylvania 90, Nebraska 80 -- In one way, the Quakers looked like an Ivy 
league team: patient, accurate, intelligent. In another they didn't look like 
one at all: 11th-seeded Penn won. 
</P>
<P>
 The Quakers (25-2) became the first Ivy team to win an NCAA tournament game in 
10 years, with Barry Pierce's 25 points leading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talent-wise, this was not an upset," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradition-wise, it wasn't either. Fifth-seeded Nebraska is 0-5 in NCAA 
tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Allen added 19 points, Eric Moore 15 and Matt Maloney 12 for the 
Quakers, who made 11 three-pointers, milked the clock when they needed to, made 
the extra pass on offense and didn't let sixth-seeded Nebraska (20-9), which 
missed 17 of 20 three-point shots, get high-percentage shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn will play Saturday against Florida in the second round.

GIRLS' STATE DIVISION II FINAL; WOODBRIDGE VS. SACRAMENTO EL CAMINO, 6:15 P.M.

 Where--Oakland Coliseum Arena 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge (32-0)--The Warriors, who were seeded first in the Southern 
California Regional, defeated No. 2-seeded Mission Hills Alemany, 46-41, for 
the regional championship. No matter the outcome, this has been the Warriors' 
best season. Woodbridge won its second Southern Section title, defeating Hemet, 
59-47, in the Division II-AA championship game. The Warriors, who also won the 
II-A championship in 1991, broke the previous school record for victories in a 
season (25), set in 1988 and tied in 1991. Moreover, the Warriors won their 
ninth league championship in the last 11 seasons. Woodbridge is led by senior 
guard Jamie Oenning, who hit a key shot in the fourth quarter against Alemany 
despite playing poorly for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino (35-0)--The Eagles were seeded No. 1 in the Northern California 
Regional. El Camino defeated Pleasanton Amador Valley, 60-26, in the regional 
title game. Senior center Emily Hart had 17 points, 16 rebounds and five 
blocked shots in the victory. El Camino lost in the regional championship game 
in 1991 and 1993. The Eagles, champions of the Metro League, defeated 
Roseville, 58-30, to claim their second Northern Section Division II title. El 
Camino won the section title in 1991, and finished second last season and in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to the game--Each team is making its first appearance in a State 
championship game. El Camino, however, has four seniors in its starting lineup 
compared to one for Woodbridge. Both teams like to apply several forms of 
pressure defense to force steals and spark an up-tempo game. Despite its record 
and relatively easy path to the championship game, El Camino has not been able 
to run the way Coach Bill Baxter thought possible entering the playoffs. "Our 
league is pretty weak, so we could press a lot of teams," Baxter said. "But we 
haven't been able to press as much in the playoffs because the teams are better 
and have kind of dictated that we do other things." Woodbridge should have an 
edge if Oenning and freshman guard Erin Stovall are in sync. Stovall leads the 
team with an average of 4.7 steals and Oenning is second (3.7). The battle 
between Woodbridge junior center Angela Burgess (6 feet 4) and Hart (6-3) is 
also important. Burgess led the Warriors with 12 points and eight rebounds, 
seven on offense, in the regional title victory over Alemany. Warrior Coach 
Eric Bangs said Burgess has made major strides in her overall game during the 
last month. Hart has not played against anyone Burgess' size, Baxter said. 
Another interesting matchup is between Oenning and El Camino guard Kristin 
Niemann, who has an excellent touch from the outside and is cleared to shoot as 
much as she desires. Woodbridge has a deeper bench and more balance on offense. 
Woodbridge should come out on top if Oenning avoids another sub-par game and 
Burgess avoids foul trouble. Starting Lineups

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK; MANSELL STILL THE MAN ON INDY CIRCUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Honda engine, a new Reynard chassis, a recycled Michael Andretti, a 
retiring Mario Andretti and more teams have combined to give the 16-race PPG 
Indy Car World Series a distinctively new look as the season begins Sunday in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Over it all, though, looms the rather large shadow of Nigel Mansell, the 
British driver who forsook his Formula One championship a year ago to drive 
Indy cars and show the Yankees a thing of two about motor racing. Mansell, 
technically a rookie, won five races, the championship and driver-of-the-year 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
 And apparently Mansell expects more of himself and the new-model No. 1 
Lola-Ford Cosworth than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year I will be more in a comfort zone," he said. "Last year everything 
was new -- the car, the tracks, the logistics, the people. This year we will 
know our way around the cities, the hotels and the places to eat. It will be 
much more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be more comfortable on the track too, because the new Lola is a much 
better package than last year's. Lola has done a fantastic job. Really, it's an 
all-new design and the results are remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell has tested at Phoenix and Firebird in Arizona, Laguna Seca and 
Sebring, Fla., and has been the fastest at all four. On the mile oval at 
Phoenix -- where he crashed last year during practice and missed the race -- 
Mansell became the first driver to run a sub-20 second lap. 
</P>
<P>
 He started 1993 at the Surfers Paradise street circuit on Australia's East 
Coast by becoming the first rookie to win the pole and the race in his first 
start. He will be the favorite again when qualifying starts today. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition has also been improving, or at least trying to, and Mansell 
will see a different lineup when the 31 cars start on the 2.795-mile circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Rahal, who did not win a race and failed to qualify for the Indianapolis 
500 after winning the PPG Cup championship a year earlier, has assumed the task 
of developing a Honda engine for his Indy car team. Mike Groff, who will drive 
a second Rahal-Hogan car, spent last season testing the new engine, which was 
built by Honda Performance Division in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynard will become the third British-built chassis -- with Lola and Penske -- 
in the Indy car series. Michael Andretti, the 1991 Indy car champion who is 
returning after a dismal year in Formula One, has tested Chip Ganassi's new 
Ford-powered car for 2,475 miles in preparing for this season. Five others, 
among them Teo Fabi, Jimmy Vasser and Mexican rookie Adrian Fernandez, will 
have Reynard chassis. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez is replacing Al Unser Jr. and Danny Sullivan on Rick Galles' San 
Diego-based team. Unser switched to the potent three-car Roger Penske team with 
Indy 500 winner Emerson Fittipaldi of Brazil and Paul Tracy of Canada, and 
Sullivan was let go in an economy move that left Fernandez as Galles' only 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Michael Andretti is returning, his father Mario, 54, is departing -- 
after a farewell season that is being heralded as " Arrivederci , Mario." The 
racing legend says he expects to have a successful conclusion. His victory last 
year at Phoenix ended a 73-race winless streak that dated to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeup of the drivers of the 31 cars entered in Australia indicates that 
not much will be different from last year, when 14 of the 16 races were won by 
foreign-born drivers -- a number that included Mario, the Italian-born but 
naturalized U.S. citizen. Sixteen of the 31 entries are foreigners, headed by 
Mansell and Tracy, who won five races each last year, and Fittipaldi, who won 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more intriguing newcomers are Jacques Villeneuve of Canada, whose 
father, Gilles, was one of Formula One's finest drivers before he was killed; 
Davy Jones, a former sports car champion who has replaced Robby Gordon as A.J. 
Foyt's driver, and Scott Sharp, a two-time Trans-Am champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Another newcomer will be Andrew Craig, who will replace Bill Stokkan as 
president of CART on March 31. In keeping with the Indy car pattern, Craig is 
an Englishman who most recently has worked in Switzerland.

HORSE RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; LIGHTLY RACED VALIANT NATURE SET FOR 'FELIPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On St. Patrick's Day at Santa Anita's Barn 99, the phone rang early in the 
morning. When Ron McAnally answered, the voice at the other end said, "How come 
you're not drunk yet?" 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally laughed. The intoxicating moments for the 61-year-old trainer this 
week have come when he thinks and talks about Valiant Nature, who will be one 
of the favorites Sunday in the $200,000 San Felipe Stakes, the next-to-last 
important prep race for California's contenders for the Kentucky Derby. All 
that's left after the San Felipe is the Santa Anita Derby on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Valiant Nature has run only three races, McAnally is already dusting 
off a pedestal. The Hall of Fame trainer says Valiant Nature is more versatile 
than his full brother, Tight Spot, and adds that he's as good a Derby prospect 
as Donut King, who would have been the third or fourth betting choice had he 
not been knocked out of the race with an 11th-hour bruised foot at Churchill 
Downs in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are strong comparisons. After all, Valiant Nature hasn't run as a 
3-year-old and was 16-1 in his last race, on Dec. 19, when he beat the apparent 
2-year-old champion, Brocco, in the Hollywood Futurity. Brocco was undefeated 
and had won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, but after his three- quarter-length 
loss to Valiant Nature, the division title went to Dehere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't get over the price they made my horse that day," McAnally said. 
"In the paddock, I looked up and he was 30-1 at one point. But I knew we had 
only one horse (Brocco) to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Hollywood Park race, Valiant Nature had run greenly in his debut, 
shying from dirt being kicked in his face, and finished 10th against maidens at 
Santa Anita on Oct. 10. Five weeks later, he won by 3 1/2 lengths going a mile 
on grass at Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1 1/16-mile San Felipe, both Brocco and Valiant Nature will be making 
their first starts in three months, since McAnally's colt had to run 1 1/16 
miles in 1:40 3/5 -- three-fifths of a second off the track record -- to beat 
the Breeders' Cup champion. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the leading Kentucky Derby contenders in Florida and California 
have been butting heads, Valiant Nature will run just twice before the May 7 
Kentucky Derby -- on Sunday and in the Santa Anita Derby. With just five starts 
overall, he would be one of the most lightly raced horses to run in the 
Kentucky Derby in recent years. The last horse to win the Derby with only two 
starts as a 3-year-old was Sunny's Halo in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 It irks McAnally to hear and read suggestions that Valiant Nature might not 
have been sound since the Hollywood Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brad Free (in the Daily Racing Form) figured out that I've worked this horse 
a total of about 10 miles since the first of the year," McAnally said. "If 
there was something wrong with the horse, I wouldn't have been giving him all 
these works. He's one of the few horses in my barn that doesn't get Bute (a 
legal painkiller). He doesn't get any medication at all. He's in perfect 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Valiant Nature's morning exercises have been on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not as many horses break down on turf as they do on dirt," McAnally said. 
"It's easier to keep a horse sound if you work him on grass." 
</P>
<P>
 Bred and owned by Verne Winchell, Valiant Nature has the same parentage as 
Tight Spot, who was a son of His Majesty and Premium Win, a Lyphard mare. Tight 
Spot, who raced for a Winchell partnership from 1989-92, won 12 of 21 starts, 
earning $1.5 million. Before running ninth in the Breeders' Cup Mile at 
Gulfstream Park in 1992, Tight Spot was undefeated in eight starts on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 To run Valiant Nature early this winter at Santa Anita, McAnally would have 
had to shorten him up on distance after he had already run around two turns at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wouldn't have been my style," McAnally said. "This horse is a very 
willing worker in the mornings, so we've gotten him ready through a lot of 
long, slow works. I've never worked him in company (with another horse), but on 
the days when he gallops, I've put horses in front of him, so he can get used 
to having dirt hit him in the face. He's won both of his races on the front 
end, but if somebody else wants to go Sunday, we'll be content sitting off the 
pace." 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally considered running Valiant Nature in the one-mile San Rafael Stakes 
at Santa Anita two weeks ago. Of consideration was that Fumo Di Londra, an 
Irish-bred colt who had been bought by Sidney and Jenny Craig in Europe as a 
Kentucky Derby prospect, needed some dirt experience and was also nominated for 
the San Rafael. McAnally, who had also been training Fumo Di Londra, didn't 
want to run both horses in the same race, so he and Winchell decided to wait 
until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In his American debut, Fumo Di Londra ran last in the San Rafael, beaten by 31 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "He trained great," McAnally said. "Then he didn't run a step. I've had other 
horses (from Europe) that have done that, too."

<P>
 After nearly falling early in the stretch, favored Dezibelle's Star gathered 
herself and went on to win the $81,200 La Habra Stakes Thursday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to rally between horses under Gary Stevens, the 3-year-old 
Prospective Star filly was shut off when the hole closed.She got going again, 
though, and was able to beat 5-2 second choice Sophisticatedcielo by a length 
in 1:14 for the about 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the third consecutive victory for the even-money favorite, who is 
owned by Gordon Molitor and trained by Jack Van Berg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything quite like that and I've dang sure never been on one 
that did she what she just did," said Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophisticatedcielo finished a length in front of Ballerina Gal, then came 
Airistar, Dancing Ovation and Gambling Mistress. BOB MIESZERSKI

BITTERSWEET SIXTEEN FOR OXNARD'S VARGAS; YOUNGEST AMATEUR FIGHTER LEARNS HE'S A 
LITTLE TOO YOUNG AFTER WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before competing in the U.S. Amateur Boxing Championships in Colorado Springs 
last week, Fernando Vargas didn't think his age was an issue. So what if at 16 
he was the tournament's youngest competitor?  
</P>
<P>
 He felt so ready to box with the big guys, he promised his trainer he would 
bring back the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 And the kid from Oxnard did. Vargas pounded five older, more experienced 
boxers and became the surprise winner of the 132-pound division. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory guarantees Vargas a place in the U.S. Olympic trials preceding the 
1996 Atlanta Olympics. His age, however, will prevent him from competing 
internationally this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under USA Boxing Assn. rules, athletes must be 17 to travel abroad. Vargas' 
birthday is on Dec. 7, so he will miss events in Russia and Thailand. Three of 
the boxers he defeated will go instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible and very disappointing," Vargas said. "I really want this 
birthday badly. Boy I can't wait for it to finally come." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas is the youngest U.S. national amateur champion ever, so inevitably, the 
big talk at the six-day event was his age. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Abayomi Miller had something to say about it, according to Vargas. 
Miller, 19, won the 132-pound title last year and was expected to repeat in 
'94. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miller said, 'How's this guy in Pampers gonna beat me?' " Vargas said. "I 
hate that trash-talking. I never do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, a sophomore at Channel Islands High, beat Miller, 29-23, in a 
semifinal bout and 17-year-old Terrence Cauthen of Philadelphia, 34-14, in the 
final.  
</P>
<P>
 Vargas also defeated 22-year-old Danny Rios, a Golden Glove national champion, 
22-year-old Fred Neil and Hank Manchester, 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a tough road to the national championship," said Melanie Ley, a board 
member with the Southern California Assn. of USA Boxing. "He had one of the 
toughest brackets I've ever seen, especially for a 16-year-old kid in his first 
national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all my years associated with the sport, I've never seen a boxer this young 
do this well." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas wasn't intimidated when he saw his bracket, which is picked randomly 
and without regard to rankings. He earned a berth in the national event by 
defeating an 18-year-old and 25-year-old in the Southern California and Western 
Regionals, so facing -- and beating -- his elders was nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 It also helped that he spent two weeks training at Oscar De La Hoya's camp in 
Big Bear to prepare for altitude competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oscar is very nice," Vargas said. "It was exciting to see him there training. 
He said 'Go get the gold.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest challenge in Colorado, Vargas said, was facing southpaws in his 
last three matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "My right hand was hurting, so I had to wrap it up real good," he said. "But I 
kept thinking, 'I'll break my hand if I have to, but I want to take home that 
plaque and that medal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now all Vargas can do is train while he waits to turn 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas gets up at 5 a.m. every day and runs about 45 minutes. After school he 
trains for three hours at the Oxnard Boys Club with the La Colonia Youth Boxing 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 No parties, late nights or junk food for this teen-ager. His strict diet 
includes a lot of dry tuna, steamed vegetables and broiled chicken.  
</P>
<P>
 Vargas says watching his buddies eat fries, burgers and pizza is often 
torturous. But his mother, Alicia Romo, says no one can make him abandon the 
routine. At times even she doesn't understand his intensity and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what I had to use for punishment if he didn't do something?" Romo 
said. "I'd have to say, 'If you don't pick up your room, you can't go 
training.' And he would do it right away. That's the only way for me to get him 
to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas started boxing when he was 10, after watching youths participate in the 
sport on a local cable channel. He won his first title as a 100-pound 
12-year-old at the Junior Olympics regionals in Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
 At 14 he won a Junior Golden Gloves title in the 125-pound division and in 
1993 he was champion at the Junior Olympics in the same weight class. Also in 
'93, Vargas won the Blue and Gold tournament, a national invitational held 
annually in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 At the '92 Junior Olympics, he was a silver medalist at 112 pounds. He has a 
52-7 record in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fernando adapts very nicely to his opponents," said Manuel Herrera, president 
of La Colonia and a former boxer. "He's not a power puncher, yet he has 
sufficient power. He also has a lot of style. Already they're calling him the 
second coming of Oscar De La Hoya." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas credits trainer Eduardo Garcia, who has worked with him from the 
beginning. Garcia, a strawberry field foreman, boxed in Mexico and volunteers 
at La Colonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's taught me everything I know about boxing, but he's also taught me good 
values and he's given me great advice," Vargas said. "That's why I'm a smart 
fighter. I use my mind a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia says few young boxers are as dedicated as Vargas. "Sometimes I have to 
stop him because he wants to train more than he has to," Garcia said in 
Spanish. "He is an ideal kid and he has what it takes to become a grand 
champion." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas is getting used to the attention. He has done interviews with more than 
10 publications and a handful of television and radio stations since returning 
to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The hype started after his championship match Saturday. A writer for Sports 
Illustrated and a commentator for the cable channel televising the event 
approached him for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so happy," Vargas said. "I felt kind of . . . I don't know . . . 
famous!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was great, he said, even though they wouldn't stop asking about his age.

CHATSWORTH STARTS TO SHOW IT'S NOT JUST A PAPERWEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slowly but surely, the Chatsworth High baseball team is showing signs that it 
is indeed the powerful squad it appeared to be on paper before the season 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest glimmer of hope: the Chancellors' 8-7 victory over Bell on Thursday 
in a semifinal game of the Sylmar tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Chatsworth starters returned from last season's City Section 4-A 
Division runner-up team, and in the preseason, some City coaches were all but 
handing the Chancellors this year's championship trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 But after four games, Chatsworth had lost two and won the other two by one 
run, and Coach Tom Meusborn was not happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Chatsworth (5-2) has won three consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're playing a little better," Meusborn said. "Our pitching and our 
defense will be there eventually, but our hitting was beginning to concern me. 
Now we're hitting the ball a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 Two nice things -- two identical nice things -- were the performances of twins 
Rod and Ray Daryabigi on Thursday. Rod, a second baseman, went three for four 
and scored three runs. Ray, batting leadoff and playing center field, drove in 
three runs and scored once. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray has been swinging a hot bat and Rod has too," Meusborn said. "Rod has 
gotten a lot more aggressive and has been a pleasant surprise offensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth built a 7-3 lead after three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim DeBiase (2-1), who surrendered four extra-base hits in the first two 
innings, left after five innings with an 8-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Greg Wold, a sidearmed junkball pitcher, surrendered a two-run double 
to Jose Lopez in the sixth and a run-scoring single to Gus Valenzuela in the 
seventh, bringing up the potential go-ahead run with two out. But Wold induced 
Claudio Moreno to fly out, ending the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Meusborn talked to his players for 20 minutes after the game, listing the 
positives and negatives. On the plus side, there were the eight runs and the 
victory. The bad news: four errors -- three in the fourth inning -- and the 
fact that Bell (5-1) outhit Chatsworth, 12-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a long way from where we need to be," Meusborn said. "But we're getting 
there."

DOS REMEDIOS NAMED AS COACH OF BURROUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that was not popular with Burroughs High football players and a 
13-member search comitteee, the Burbank Unified School District Board of 
Education named Robert dos Remedios as new head football coach Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, after meeting in closed session, voted 5-0 in favor of a 
recommendation by Burroughs principal Tim Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, Burroughs quarterback Scott Boldvich spoke out in support 
of Burroughs assistant Pat Blackburn, the candidate the search committee voted 
7-6 to support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We listen to this coach at least 25 hours a week," Boldvich said. "We bond 
with him. The bond is basically between the players and Blackburn. The players 
should at least get an equal say at who's the next coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan said he chose Dos Remedios, 27, because he's intelligent, has a lot 
of energy, knows the community and has five years of coaching experience at 
Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee however, supported Blackburn, citing a concern that Dos Remedios 
had no head-coaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither did Gary Bernardi," said Buchanan of Dos Remedios' predecessor, now 
an assistant at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Dos Remedios, who will become the fifth Burroughs coach in four years, did not 
attend the meeting. Neither did Blackburn, who was contacted at home during the 
closed session. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I want to make a statement at this point," said Blackburn, who 
was recommended by Bernardi.  
</P>
<P>
 "The players have voiced that they are supporting me and I have plenty of 
people in the community supporting me."

BOYS' TENNIS / SEASON PREVIEW; TSENG EXERCISING HIS RIGHT TO LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Harvard-Westlake High boys' tennis team -- powerful, well-conditioned, 
highly respected, ranked No. 2 in Southern Section Division II -- started the 
season sweating on a patch of campus grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of breezy afternoons at the club polishing their serves and drop 
shots, the Wolverines were stretching, running wind sprints, gasping for air in 
a boot-camp setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys were caught off-guard because leading the drills was Philip Tseng, 
possibly the section's foremost singles player. 
</P>
<P>
 Tseng, 17, is ranked 15th in the nation by the United States Tennis Assn. and 
No. 2 by the Southern California Tennis Assn. in the boys' 18-and-under 
division. At 15, he was a member of the USTA Junior National team, playing 
18-and-under tournaments in Italy and France. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines were surprised. A player of Tseng's caliber usually spends his 
afternoons getting custom rackets restrung or toenails clipped. Certainly, he 
does not play drill sergeant for his high school classmates and lead agility 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little apprehensive," said Wilton Park, a Harvard-Westlake singles 
player. "But we had confidence in him, being the player that he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Many top junior players don't find time to play for their high school teams, 
instead training under a private coach. But Tseng, a senior who could be headed 
to Stanford on a partial scholarship, is not just dropping in to play a set for 
the Wolverines every once in a while. He has made them a pet project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, the way teams practice is you hit balls for an hour and a half," 
Tseng said. "It's kind of humdrum. I think this will lead to more discipline. I 
know what it takes. I've been there." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season Tseng, a semifinalist in the 1993 section individual 
tournament, suggested that Harvard-Westlake could benefit by using his personal 
workout twice a week. Coach Harry Salamandra agreed, thinking better endurance 
might help the Wolverines. Even, perhaps, avenge their 1993 loss to Sunny Hills 
in the Division II team final. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills is ranked No. 1 in Division II this season, Harvard-Westlake No. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to me and said, 'How best can I help the team? I want to run this 
training program, because it helped me become the player I am,' " Salamandra 
said. "The other players have been impressed that he would even be willing to 
share that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tseng: "(My teammates) took it as a joke at first. But I think it's 
brought us together as a team more. We've got a lot of sophomores and juniors 
who were on the JV level before. They don't have experience dealing with 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to step forward and give some leadership. I'd like to try to be 
another guy out there, but Coach Sal tells me the younger guys look up to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Park, a junior who plays No. 2 singles behind Tseng: "At first, we asked 
why we were even doing this. It was like track or football workouts. But the 
next day, a lot of guys were hurting. We had a tendency to get tired at the end 
of matches. This showed we needed a lot of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was accepting it with open arms the whole time. Philip wants to teach and 
we need to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Tseng stands to reap more than the gratification from helping the other 
players. He is afforded the opportunity to be part of a team, an unusual 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most ranked kids that skip high school tennis miss a lot of 
friendships and intangibles that are very important," said Coach Clyde 
Richards, who led the Burbank boys' team to the Division III title last year. 
"Last fall, Corie Simmons, a ranked player on my girls' team, was burned out on 
tennis. The team rejuvenated her. What I like about Philip is he's played his 
team's matches." 
</P>
<P>
 The three best girls' players in this area -- Meilen Tu, Ania Bleszynski and 
Krissy Hamilton -- didn't play high school tennis last fall because they 
couldn't make part-time arrangements with the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really fortunate," Tseng said. "My coach is really very cooperative. He 
understands my situation, that outside practice is a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tseng also realizes this might be his only chance to play team sports, 
something he has dreamed of during his long, solitary upbringing on a tennis 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I was a kid, I've wanted to play soccer and Little League baseball," 
Tseng said. "But I've always had to stick to tennis. I also wanted to try 
football. There was always the possibility of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for me to have the chance to contribute to the school. It's 
not important to my game, because the competition is lower. But the camaraderie 
is good and I feel obligated. This school has done a lot for me." Teams to 
Watch: 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake: The defending Marmonte League champions have two strong singles 
players and enough firepower to justify a preseason No. 7 ranking in Division I 
by the Southern Section, said first-year Coach Grant Calkins. One concern: The 
Warriors have no seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 In singles, No. 1 player Nick Varvais, No. 2 Todd Campbell and No. 3 Seth 
Springer are sophomores. Calkins is also high on the No. 1 doubles team of 
Jason Joe and Justin Huffman, a pair of juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both could play No. 1 singles on a lot of teams," said Calkins, 54, a walk-on 
coach who is a computer software writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Singles is not a concern, but the development of the lower doubles teams is. 
Calkins must teach some singles players how to play in tandem. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake: Without Philip Tseng, the Wolverines wouldn't be ranked 
second in Division II. With him, they might be headed for a title rematch with 
Sunny Hills. Youth could work against Harvard-Westlake. Tseng is the only 
returnee from a squad that finished 17-3 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The other top singles players are sophomores David Brown and Farbod Nasseri, 
and junior Wilton Park. In doubles, seniors Ryan Taban and Johnny Levine, 
junior Jamie Green and sophomore David Hatkoff are expected to make big 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Salamandra, now in his 14th season as coach, usually has talent and 
knows what to do with it. Harvard-Westlake is a lock to win the Mission League 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank: The Bulldogs are defending Division III champions and ranked No. 1. 
They won't have a dominant singles players as they did last year. Doug Young 
has graduated. Vazghen Zaghiyan steps into the No. 1 role.  
</P>
<P>
 With a new Southern Section scoring system that awards 1 1/3 points for 
doubles victories, Richards has some interesting options for Phil Cano and Brad 
Warner, seniors who played together at No. 1 doubles last season. Warner likely 
will move to singles, but both could bolster the doubles ranks while playing 
with new partners. Or they could stay together at No. 1 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Much depends on the development of singles players Varand Ghazikhanian, Rafi 
Hovanessian and Yamil Sarmiento, and doubles players Tim Harris, Stratos 
Christianakis and Amerson Suson in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Also returning is the 1993 doubles team of Roy Kim and Jack Liu, who clinched 
the section title with a three-set victory against Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill: Once again, Coach Bill Lenaway will have better-than-average 
players and probably will make them excel. The Rebels have gone undefeated in 
the Golden League each of the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the players are aware they have a little reputation to uphold," 
Lenaway said. "I'm not afraid to put that on them. It gives them a vision. It 
gives them a little pressure, and they've got to get used to pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a challenge for Lenaway: He must find replacements for Kenny Park (No. 
1 singles) and Richard Harper (No. 1 doubles), who dropped out of the program. 
Top freshman Shahid Tahir also left after getting homesick for his native 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Yatin Patel and Val Valcarcel will vie to fill the void at No. 1 
singles. Jose Guerrero will play at No. 3. Quartz Hill, ranked fourth in 
Division III, has depth at doubles with Brian Kim, Bob Harkins, Ryan Drury, 
Stan Howdek, Rohan Dharma and Matt Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas: The Coyotes, ranked No. 1 in Division IV, are loaded with talent 
and littered with off-court snags. A bad back has kept No. 1 singles player 
Jason Weiss, a high-ranking junior, out of action. Conflicts have kept doubles 
players Darren Miller and Anupam Mishra on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 But with No. 2 singles player Jason Cook, another ranked junior, and No. 3 
Jeff Herz and seven capable doubles players in the mix, Calabasas (17-1 last 
year) should be the favorite for the section title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know all the Division IV teams are complaining about us being moved down 
from Division III," Coach Casey Allen said. "I know when we have all our guys, 
we can play with anybody in the state."

<P>
 Prime Minister Jim Bolger has called for New Zealand to cut its ties with the 
British monarchy by the year 2000, saying that would be an appropriate symbolic 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The move can be conducted without any rancor of any sort. The call now for 
true independence by electing our own head of state should surprise no one," he 
said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating last year set a similar target date for 
Australia to become a republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia and New Zealand are independent countries, but like Canada and some 
Caribbean states still recognize the British monarch as head of state.

TEXACO UNDER STATE INVESTIGATION ON SPILL; VENTURA: FISH AND GAME WARDEN 
ALLEGES THAT EMPLOYEES WAITED TO REPORT THE 370,000-GALLON LEAK. OFFICE RAID 
DISMAYS COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Texaco employees discovered one of the county's largest oil-related spills 
long before they reported it to authorities last year and then tried to pass 
the blame to neighboring oil companies, state investigators allege. 
</P>
<P>
 In a search warrant affidavit, a state Department of Fish and Game warden 
alleges that Texaco officials waited to report the 370,000-gallon leak of a 
gasoline-like liquid until they could no longer conceal it and kept quiet about 
a repaired pipeline to avoid responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Upon discovery (of the leak), I believe that Texaco knew the product was from 
the leak of the repaired pipeline," states Warden Holly Etheridge in the 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators did not discover that the broken Texaco pipeline was close 
to the spill until they found it eight months after Texaco's January, 1993, 
report, according to a Fish and Game spokesman who read the affidavit to The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 So much of the toxic liquid leaked that a slick 25 feet thick was eventually 
discovered atop an underground water basin beneath the spill. Officials 
estimate it will take years to pump all of the toxic liquid out of the ground 
and clean up the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco officials insist that the source of the spill is unknown. Spokeswoman 
Faye Cox said the company has cooperated fully in trying to clean up the site. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Texaco is dismayed that state and local investigators raided the 
company's oil field offices Tuesday night and continued its search for 
incriminating documents through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We notified Fish and Game and the proper authorities immediately," Cox said. 
"We have worked with Fish and Game throughout this whole process. That's why 
we're shocked by the actions taken." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, north Ventura residents who live along School Canyon Creek said 
they are outraged that neither Texaco nor the state notified them about the 
contamination. Heavy rains last year apparently forced some of the toxic liquid 
to the surface where it flowed down School Canyon to the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Many neighborhood children play in the creek and could have been exposed to 
highly toxic chemicals, several mothers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year later we find out," June Teran said. "A whole year after the kids have 
been back there. It isn't fair." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said Texaco would have notified residents if state investigators would 
have recommended such a move. "We had no reason to believe the public was in 
danger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators say they think Texaco suspected the toxic liquid might 
flow a mile down the creek past the residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Texaco probably knew that the material would not remain in one spot, that it 
would travel underground down the canyon and to the open creek and eventually 
to the Ventura River," said Fish and Game spokesman Bob Schlicting, 
paraphrasing the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 The basis for possible felony charges would be that Texaco knowingly 
discharged a toxic substance onto private property and into state waters, since 
some of the leaked substance was flushed by rain into the nearby creek and the 
Ventura River, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 If such charges are eventually filed and proved, Texaco could face fines of 
$50,000 for each day it failed to report the spill and company officials could 
be fined $10,000 and imprisoned for up to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors said Thursday that they have just begun to examine evidence 
gathered over the past year by state Fish and Game, the lead investigative 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in the process of collecting evidence," Assistant Dist. Atty. 
Colleen Toy White said. "But this is a serious case. Any release of this kind 
of substance has the potential for very significant impacts." 
</P>
<P>
 The spill is far larger than the Jan. 17 leak of 214,000 gallons of crude oil 
into the Santa Clara River and a spill of 84,000 gallons of crude into a lake 
at McGrath State Beach in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental cost of the School Canyon spill is still unknown. No dead or 
injured wildlife have been found in the area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the potential for problems is high, said Reed Smith, a pollution response 
coordinator for Fish and Game. "This stuff is really hot," he said. "It's an 
extremely toxic material." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the four components of the liquid are known or suspected of causing 
cancer. And both benzene and toluene also cause nervous system disorders. Ethyl 
benzene is a nervous system depressant and xylene may produce breathing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators said they do not know how much of the 370,000 gallons of 
lightweight, colorless natural gas condensate -- which is refined into gasoline 
and propane -- leaked into School Canyon Creek, nor what its effect has been 
downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they think that much of the liquid may still be contained within a 
small area, in soil saturated to a depth of 50 feet and floating in an 
underground water basin below. 
</P>
<P>
 The toxic liquid apparently remained in the spill area until last year's rains 
elevated the water table, pushing some of the liquid to the surface and down 
the canyon, Smith of Fish and Game said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said there is no evidence the liquid has migrated underground far 
enough to be detected in test wells drilled down the hill from the site. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sandy soil in the area could allow relatively rapid subterranean movement 
of up to one foot a day, county hydrologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are there any known drinking water wells nearby that could have been 
contaminated by the spill, local water officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all north Ventura residents receive city water and none of it is drawn 
from the oil field area, said Ventura water production supervisor Mike Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a possibility that some of the farmers in that area may have some 
wells, but I don't think they're used for potable water. I think they're used 
for irrigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents, however, said they they are nervous about the effects of the 
spill and angry they had not been told about it earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when something happens in your back yard, they should let you know," 
said Helen Loucado, 44, whose home backs up to School Canyon Creek. "You know 
how kids are. They like to get their hands in the dirt and stomp around." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said more than a dozen young birds have been found dead in recent 
months near the creek. And one resident said the spill has raised questions 
about recurring headaches and stomachaches her children have experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one quarter last year, my daughter had to miss 22 days of school," said 
Sarah Murillo, 29. "It makes you wonder." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond health considerations, investigators are weighing the legal 
implications of Texaco's response to the spill. Fish and Game's sworn affidavit 
lays out a series of events that allegedly show Texaco concealed information 
about the leak, Schlicting said. 
</P>
<P>
 The affidavit states that Texaco first notified Fish and Game Warden Etheridge 
about a small leak on Jan. 25, 1993, though the state Office of Emergency 
Services said it received a call from Texaco on Jan. 12. The OES is a 
clearinghouse where reports of toxic spills are disseminated to appropriate 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank MacCioli, the regulatory compliance officer for Texaco, told Etheridge 
that the spill was detected on Jan. 12 after heavy rains brought the toxic 
liquid to the surface. MacCioli said Texaco pressure-tested all its lines and 
found no leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 MacCioli said the most likely source was abandoned lines or lines operated by 
Shell Oil or owned by Southern California Gas. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 4, both Texaco and Shell Oil agreed to have their natural gas 
condensate sampled and "fingerprinted" to determine whose plant was the source 
of the spill. But after Texaco failed to submit a sample promptly, the warden 
drew her own sample. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 25, Fish and Game tests confirmed that the spill came from Texaco, and 
a month later notified the company, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a Texaco consulting firm discovered four small pipelines running 
across School Canyon near the spill site, where extensive contamination had 
been confirmed in the spring. The soil beneath the lines was wet with the toxic 
liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After finding that one of the pipelines had been repaired, state investigators 
were told by a Texaco field supervisor that the lines were not used under 
pressure and only carried gas vapors away from a natural gas plant. Under 
further questioning, the supervisor acknowledged that the pipelines had carried 
pressurized condensate until February, 1993, the month after Texaco reported 
the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Texaco denied previous knowledge of a spill or seep throughout the yearlong 
investigation . . . " said Schlicting, reading from the affidavit. "Texaco 
denied knowledge of repairs or records of repairs to that pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco's Cox said questions about the affidavit had been referred to the 
company's attorneys, who she said refused comment to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley is a Times staff writer and Hadly is a Times correspondent. Times 
correspondent Julie Fields contributed to this article. Volatile Compounds 
Found Gas condensate is a liquid byproduct from the processing of natural gas. 
The liquid smells and looks much like gasoline. Further processing converts the 
gas condensate to propane and gasoline. Four volatile compounds were discovered 
in the samples taken at the spill site. 
</P>
<P>
 Benzene: Found in gasoline, it is a known human carcinogen and highly toxic. 
Exposure may result in fatigue, anorexia and other central nervous system 
disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethylbenzene: A depressant to the central nervous system and a skin hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Toluene: Found in gasoline, it is a central nervous system depressant and skin 
hazard. Chronic exposure can result in anemia or leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Xylene: It is toxic, ignitable and may produce pulmonary edema. Oil Spill Site 
At least 370,000 gallons-or 8,800 barrels-of a petroleum byproduct spilled, 
state officials said, when a pipeline ruptured at a Texaco production plant in 
north Ventura. Cleanup of the underground spill could take three years.

MANY SPILLS NOT CHECKED, RECORDS SHOW; ENVIRONMENT: STATE SAYS IT DOES NOT HAVE 
STAFF TO VISIT EACH SITE, AND RELIES ON COMPANIES FOR AN ACCURATE ACCOUNTING. 
</P>

<P>
 The oil spill blamed on Texaco by state officials this week was one of dozens 
of on-land spills each year that are never inspected by the state Division of 
Oil and Gas, the chief agency responsible for looking into such spills. 
</P>
<P>
 Division records show that only one-third of on-land spills larger than 100 
barrels in Ventura County were inspected in person between 1988 and September, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller spills are almost never examined because division officials said they 
simply do not have the staff to visit every reported spill site. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, officials said, is a system that relies on the oil companies to 
provide an accurate accounting of how much oil has spilled, what caused the 
spill and how the oil is being recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Local environmental groups said oil companies cannot be trusted to report 
spills. And, because on-land spills are so difficult to detect, they said 
government agencies should be more vigilant in inspecting them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Guerard, the state oil and gas supervisor, said the agency cannot 
respond to every report of a spill because there are hundreds of incidents each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the manpower to look at every spill," he said. "We have to 
prioritize our tasks." 
</P>
<P>
 Guerard said the inspectors normally respond to incidents if the initial 
report indicates that oil has threatened an environmentally sensitive area. But 
in most instances, he said, the oil is contained behind walls or berms, and a 
visit to the oil field is not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the spill attributed to Texaco, division officials said they 
never even received a report of the mishap. Officials at the State Office of 
Emergency Services said the report was faxed to the Ventura office of the 
Division of Oil and Gas on Jan. 12, 1993, but inspectors in Ventura said it 
never arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they had received the report, division officials in Sacramento and 
Ventura said they still would not have visited the Texaco oil field because 
Texaco reported that the leak was minor and already contained in a 4-by-4-foot 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Morris, a spokeswoman for the division, which is an arm of the state 
Department of Conservation, said Thursday that the division has normally found 
oil companies to be reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found that 99% of the reports we get from the oil companies are 
accurate," Morris said. "It's been our experience what we hear from the 
companies closely resembles what we find on the site." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists said they do not approve of what they called "the buddy 
system" between the oil industry and the agency responsible for policing 
spills. 
</P>
<P>
 "History shows we simply cannot rely on oil companies to report the spills," 
said Henry Feniger, a past president of Get Oil Out, a Santa Barbara-based oil 
industry watchdog. "They know that it's not in their best interest to report a 
spill on land because chances are that no one will notice it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Texaco case is one of two recent glaring examples of spills that were not 
accurately reported. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 15, Unocal Corp. was ordered by a San Luis Obispo court to pay $1.5 
million for failing to report up to 8.5 million gallons of a diesel-like liquid 
that spilled at the company's Guadalupe oil field. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators in that case said they have collected evidence of 
discharges at that site since 1978 and have accused the company of attempting 
to cover up the leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty clear, based on what we've had occur in Santa Barbara and what 
has happened now in Ventura, that monitoring requirements are not what they 
should be," said Linda Krop, chief counsel for the Environmental Defense Center 
in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, government agencies are often underfunded and they therefore 
allow the oil industry to monitor itself," she said. "That simply doesn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Krop said the result of self-monitoring is a system of abuse in which many 
spills either go unreported or are not reported accurately. 
</P>
<P>
 According to division records, there were 14 on-land oil spills of 100 barrels 
or more in Ventura County since 1988, not including the Texaco incident or the 
recent spill at McGrath State Beach, which occurred on the Bush Oil field near 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those spills, including a 80,000-gallon leak at the Oxnard field of 
Chase Production Inc. and a 12,000-gallon leak at Texaco's Ventura field, were 
never visited by division inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The three inspectors in the Ventura office of the Division of Oil and Gas 
spend most of their time performing annual environmental inspections of about 
18,000 acres of oil fields in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Division Inspector Steve Mulqueen inspected the Texaco field in September, 
1993, and, according to his report, found no evidence of the 370,000-gallon 
spill, in spite of the fact that Texaco's own consultants found extensive soil 
contamination at the spill site in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Henderson, chief deputy for the division in Sacramento, said that because 
inspectors do not take soil samples, it is no surprise that the spill went 
unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is often some oil staining on the ground, so without a soil test, a 
spill like that could be missed by our inspector," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Guerard insists that enough is being done to prevent major spills, and 
oil industry officials agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend enormous sums of money on prevention," Shell Oil Co. spokeswoman 
Susan Hershberger said in an interview earlier this year. "We have all kinds of 
procedures set up to respond to spills, and we are firm about dealing with 
spills immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 But local environmental groups argue that, as evidenced by recent events, the 
power to police the oil industry may be safer in independent hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the oil companies can afford to self-monitor, they should be able to help 
pay for agencies like (the Division of Oil and Gas) to do the job 
independently," Krop said. "I think it's clear that if things stay the same, 
we're just inviting more abuse."

HOSPITAL CLERK ARRESTED IN THEFT OF CREDIT CARDS; CRIME: WORKER AT ST. JOHN'S 
IN OXNARD IS ACCUSED OF USING PATIENTS' ACCOUNTS TO SPEND MORE THAN $10,000.

<P>
 An emergency room clerk at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard was 
charged Thursday with stealing credit cards from sick and injured patients, 
then running up more than $10,000 in bills before being caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Elaine Peralta, a 26-year-old Oxnard woman who worked at the medical 
center almost four years, has been fired as a result of her arrest, hospital 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peralta was booked at Ventura County Jail on 10 felony counts of using stolen 
credit cards, authorities said. But she was released on her own recognizance 
about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday without having to spend the night in jail, records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 She is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police investigators said Peralta, who has no prior criminal record as 
an adult, charged more than $10,000 worth of clothes at a number of upscale 
department stores throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've traced the stolen card purchases back to November of 1992," said 
Detective Leonard Newcomb of the white-collar crimes unit. The 10 victims 
identified so far "all seemed to come in through the emergency room. That's the 
only pattern." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of stolen credit cards were found last month by someone police 
declined to identify, Newcomb said. The informant, who was not a hospital 
employee, alerted authorities to the suspected fraud and Peralta later turned 
herself in, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knew that the arrest was imminent," Newcomb said. "When I compiled all 
the evidence I needed for filing purposes, I simply called her up." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said it is likely that more emergency room patients than those 
identified so far were similarly swindled, but detectives have not completed 
their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We suspect that there probably are other victims," Newcomb said. "There are 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said Thursday that Peralta was terminated within hours of 
her arrest, which came as a surprise to administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no indication that a problem like this was even occurring," said 
spokeswoman Rita Schumacher. "Anything (criminal) that we're aware of, we do 
thoroughly investigate." 
</P>
<P>
 Peralta's job duties called for her to search the personal belongings of 
patients who are unconscious when admitted to the emergency room, Schumacher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the alleged victims ever complained to hospital security or 
administrators, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing had been reported to the security department," Schumacher said. "The 
people involved in this issue never reported any missing or stolen credit 
cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Peralta did not return phone calls to her Oxnard home Thursday. But co-workers 
at the hospital emergency room described her as a diligent, hard-working 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very congenial person to work with," said one colleague, who asked 
to remain unidentified. "It doesn't seem like the kind of thing she would do." 
</P>
<P>
 The thefts have prompted an internal investigation and a review of hospital 
rules, Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under existing policy, if a patient is brought to the medical center 
unconscious, admitting room employees are directed to fish through the 
patient's wallet or purse for identification or insurance forms, Schumacher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same policy also calls for cash and valuables to remain in the custody 
of at least two employees until properly sealed and locked up, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make out a detailed report of the description of the valuables, then we 
secure it in an envelope," said Schumacher, who said the rules governing the 
personal property of hospital patients would be tightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at the policy, we're looking at procedures and we're in the 
process of investigating it."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FIRMS' DONATIONS SAVE READING PROJECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County libraries will be able to continue their summer reading program 
for children this year, thanks to donations by private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading program, which has been conducted every summer since the 1970s, 
was nearly discontinued because of cuts in the county budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we did not have the donations, we wouldn't be able to have the program 
this summer," said Sonia J. "Sunny" Church, manager of Children's Services 
Division for Ventura County Library Services Agency.  
</P>
<P>
 The program is scheduled to start June 12 and will run through July 30 at the 
county's 15 libraries. Children can sign up for the program June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year more than 6,000 children enrolled. About 20% of them read 25 or more 
books, and about 35% read 15 or more books. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to teach them that reading can be fun as opposed to being just 
educational," Church said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost about $3,000 to run the summer program, Church said. On 
Wednesday, Wells Fargo Bank donated $1,000 and Patagonia of Ventura donated 
$500. The remaining $1,500 will come from the library's trust fund. CHRISTINA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; AT 80, SHARING TREASURES OF LIFE'S 
LESSONS

 Sharon Smith usually teaches a class of senior citizens at Thousand Oaks 
Residential Care Home, but the teacher recently sat among the students so one 
of the convalescent home's residents could take the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who comes to the facility weekly to run activities aimed at improving 
communication skills, yielded the floor to a student who served as a weather 
forecaster in the U.S. Navy during the 1940s. In the past, the convalescent 
home's residents have agreed to teach lessons on English literature and other 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way of getting the residents involved in sharing their own 
experiences," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Muriel Brown, 80, conducted experiments and discussed meteorology during her 
one-day stint as head of the class. Not only did her students learn, but Brown 
got a boost in self-esteem, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown taught the elderly students about air pressure by burning away the 
oxygen in a bottle with a match. Because the pressure inside the bottle was 
less than the pressure outside the bottle, a soft-boiled egg at the bottle's 
opening was pushed inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The class cheered wildly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know you had all that mental capacity," Pauline Hillman, a resident 
of the home, told Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Brown dazzled the audience again by mixing vinegar and baking soda 
inside the bottle to produce a fizzing gas that shot the egg back out of the 
narrow chute. 
</P>
<P>
 But not every experiment worked. Employees at the home said they suspected 
that a demonstration of the effects of density failed because the salt Brown 
added to water may have actually been a salt substitute from the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say you learn more by things that don't happen right, so I've learned 
quite a lot today," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown served as a Navy lieutenant for several years during World War II, she 
said. She received her master of arts at UCLA in meteorology and a master of 
science at Oregon State University in meteorology. 
</P>
<P>
 Glennie Hartzell, a resident of the home, said Brown's presentation was 
wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact that I know a lot more now than I did before I started," 
Hartzell said. BRENDA DAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FEBRUARY HOME SALES INCREASE 8% OVER '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 February home sales in Ventura County increased 8% over last year, reflecting 
an upward trend throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But an analyst for TRW-REDI Property Data, which monitors monthly home sales, 
said Thursday that the county's housing market is at best months away from full 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have leveled off and things are gradually improving," said Nima Nattagh, 
the analyst who publishes the data. "But we still need a consistent pattern 
like this for the next five or six months to say that the market has recovered. 
Then all will be well." 
</P>
<P>
 Nattagh said low interest rates have spurred sales. In most Southern 
California counties, sales were up, while prices dropped. But in Ventura 
County, prices were up nearly 3%, with the average home going for $234,361. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Schuepbach, a Ventura realtor with Schuepbach & Associates, which 
specializes in residential and mobile homes in Ventura and Oxnard, said her 
business has doubled since January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems if you have a house priced right for the county, at around 
$200,000, it really isn't going to be on the market very long," she said. 
"Within 90 days it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas of the county, gains were even more substantial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're up by about 20% from last February," said Camarillo realtor Bob Boyter, 
who is with Jon Douglas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyter said the combination of low interest rates, an improving market, and 
the number of people displaced by the earthquake and still seeking homes was 
responsible for the sales increase. MARY F. POLS

RECOVERY

<P>
 A Thousand Oaks senior citizens volunteer group has received a $16,000 federal 
grant to help in ongoing earthquake recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Retired Senior Volunteer Program will use the funds to pay mileage 
and meals for 75 volunteers who will help with earthquake projects throughout 
the community, program director Louise Danielle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers have already begun work at the Thousand Oaks Library, repairing and 
returning books to shelves. The library has been closed since the earthquake 
because of extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the funding will also be used to train volunteers for emergencies, 
Danielle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the earthquake, we had volunteers who wanted to help, but in some 
cases, it was hard to figure out where to send them and what exactly they 
should be doing," she said. "This funding will help us prepare for the next 
emergency." SARA CATANIA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ASSN. FOR RETARDED CITIZENS SEEKS AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Threatened with looming state budget cuts after already losing about $500,000 
in public funding, Ventura County's Assn. for Retarded Citizens is turning to 
private donors for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody needs money these days to stay afloat," said Fred Robinson, the 
association's executive director."This is new for us though. We've been 
dependent on public funds, but with future state budget cuts likely we need 
some stable source of funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said 80% of the association's $6-million budget comes from government 
grants and state programs. Most of that money goes to job training for the more 
than 700 retarded adults in the county that depend on the organization's 
services, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The training has led to a variety of jobs for clients, including a man who 
works as a clerk at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Clients also have 
been trained to work as janitors, bakers and stock clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're training people for independent living," Robinson said. "We teach them 
how to live, cook and pay the bills on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 The association wants to raise at least $2 million over the next two years by 
applying to private foundations for grants. The money will be invested in the 
form of an endowment. As the endowment grows interest from the funds will 
provide the association with a steady source of income, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The association has already received an $800,000 donation from a Pasadena 
couple, he said. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 31 TEACHERS ACCEPT BUYOUT PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 31 Simi Valley teachers will accept a voluntary buyout under an early 
retirement package being offered by school officials to reduce the number of 
teachers at the top of the pay scale, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Educators Assn., the union representing the district's 640 teachers, 
approved terms of the buyout plan Wednesday after a long discussion on the 
matter, union spokeswoman Peggie Noisette said.The buyout will be offered only 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, teachers age 55 to 59 with 10 years of service with the 
district can retire with full medical coverage until age 65. Teachers over age 
55 with 20 or more years with the district can receive medical coverage to 65 
or a $25,000 cash payment in three annual installments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be losing some wisdom, some experience, but the other side of 
it is, you want to make room for enthusiastic young people," Noisette said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Simi Valley Unified School District has cut 24 teaching 
positions from next year's budget to help trim a $2.5-million deficit in the 
$77.1-million spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Because enough teachers took the buyout, the district will not be forced to 
lay off permanent teachers to achieve the board's mandate for fewer teachers 
next year, Assistant Supt. Leon Mattingley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to issue any letters telling teachers they don't have jobs next 
year," Mattingley said. "We were very happy the association ratified it." 
</P>
<P>
 The buyout will cost the district $300,000 over three years, Mattingley said. 
No estimate was available on how much money will be saved, he said. The 
departing teachers all made more than $50,000 per year. Less experienced 
replacements would start off making $34,000 or less annually, he said. BRENDA

<P>
 The Moorpark City Council has decided against expanding city offices by 
purchasing a $190,000 portable building and has instead ordered staff members 
to study whether a more permanent expansion of City Hall might make more sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 0 Wednesday to instruct Deputy City Manager Richard 
Hare to research the costs and feasibility of building such an addition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The long-term solution is probably going to be, in the long run, the more 
economical one," Mayor Paul Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members had proposed to remedy their cramped office space by 
installing a second portable building outside City Hall at an estimated cost of 
$190,875. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; POLICE IDENTIFY 20 IN CHECK FRAUD SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura police have identified 20 people, including teen-agers, in a check 
fraud scam in which about $40,000 was stolen from local banks, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began early this year when detectives were contacted by an 
unnamed bank.Two detectives have been assigned full time to the case and the 
list of suspects has grown, Sgt. Gary McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made, but investigators hope to take their case to the 
district attorney's office in several weeks, McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked to almost all of the lower players, but as you go up the ladder, 
there are other more important players. And we haven't gotten to the top of our 
little ladder yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said the scam was not particularly sophisticated, but attracted a 
number of young people willing to let stolen checks be laundered through their 
bank accounts. Those individuals were paid to withdraw money deposited in their 
accounts with forged checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The forged checks were stolen in car and residential burglaries in Ventura, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaskill said investigators have so far identified more than a dozen 
instances of money being laundered through bank accounts. Many people whose 
accounts were used do not have prior criminal records, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the suspects are facing arrest on a range of charges including forgery, 
grand theft and burglary. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FESTIVAL PICKS 4 STRAWBERRY MASCOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After two days of sparsely attended auditions in Oxnard and Hollywood, four 
people have been picked to play Super Strawberry, official mascot of the 
upcoming California Strawberry Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten would-be berries took to the stage at the Richard Pryor Theatre in 
Hollywood on Wednesday, while only one showed up for auditions at the Oxnard 
Community Center on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those contestants, Terri George of Oxnard and Robert DiTillio, Adam Rocke 
and Tanya Chorin, all of Los Angeles, were selected to don giant red strawberry 
costumes and make public appearances between now and the festival, which will 
be held May 21 and 22 at College Park in Oxnard. The four winning berries will 
receive passes to the festival, a night's stay at the Radisson Suites Hotel and 
festival souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great. I think it's going to be fun," said George, who was 
disappointed that she was the sole Ventura County berry. "I feel like it should 
be a local thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Aileen Stein, a spokeswoman for the festival, attributed the larger response 
in Los Angeles to the city's population of thespians. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is there are a lot of people in the Los Angeles area that are 
actors, and this kind of idea appeals to them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contestants at both auditions were judged on their speaking ability, 
enthusiasm, originality and a brief talent demonstration. The Hollywood 
audition was a sweet success as far as enthusiasm is concerned, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were seven judges. They had them dance and sing. The judges even sang 
their own rendition of 'Life Is a Bowl of Strawberries,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although festival representatives were disappointed by the turnout at 
auditions, they were optimistic that next year would bring a greater yield. 
This is the first year the festival has used mascots. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people see Super Strawberry around town," Stein said, "we might get more 
people." TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; JUDGE SAYS POLICY MAY BLOCK GOLF COURSE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A literal interpretation of Ventura County's water policy does not appear to 
allow officials to approve a private golf course in the Ojai Valley, a judge 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem I have is it's a very specific ordinance," said Superior Court 
Judge William A. Peck."I didn't draft it. I assume somebody in the county 
drafted it." 
</P>
<P>
 Peck is being asked by the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County to 
overturn a 1993 permit allowing the Farmont Corp. to build a private golf 
resort on 200 acres it owns along California 150. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge on Thursday continued the hearing to Monday, when he will probably 
take the matter under submission. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members contend that the county water policy requires that golf 
course developers use reclaimed water -- or treated sewer water -- to irrigate 
the greens, tees and fairways. 
</P>
<P>
 County planners included conditions in the permit they say require Farmont to 
begin using mostly reclaimed water on the golf course before 2001, in effect 
granting the developers an eight-year grace period. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors would be unlikely to shut down the golf course in 2001 just 
because Farmont failed to use reclaimed water to irrigate the course, said 
coalition attorney Philip A. Seymour. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; 2 HELD IN ALLEGED AUTO THEFT RING

<P>
 Oxnard police on Thursday were looking for more suspects in an alleged 
Tijuana-based auto theft ring after nabbing a pair who authorities say were in 
the process of dismantling two stolen cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Bike patrol Officer Billy Tatum arrested Jose Luis Bravo Sanchez, 31, of 
Tijuana and a 15-year-old juvenile after stumbling on the operation during his 
rounds in south Oxnard on Wednesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatum was pedaling down an alley in the 5200 block of Charles Street about 1 
p.m. when a man leaving a garage appeared startled to see him, officials said. 
The man went back into the garage and then fled with three other suspects, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a short chase, Tatum arrested Sanchez and the juvenile, police said. The 
two other suspects got away, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found a 1992 Chevy Suburban and a 1987 Pontiac Firebird in the 
garage, both partially dismantled. They also found new locks on the cars and 
believe the vehicles were being prepared for transport to Tijuana, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The automobiles were recently reported stolen from residents in Newbury Park 
and Oxnard, police said. Police believe the juvenile, whose name was not 
released because of his age, is responsible for several other stolen vehicles 
in the Oxnard area. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MEINERS OAKS; RESIDENTS ASK FOR OJAI TROLLEY SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents living outside the areas served by the Ojai trolley would like to 
see the streetcar route extended to Meiners Oaks and the east end of the city, 
a county official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Webster, an administrative assistant to Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, said 
about 20 people showed up Wednesday night for a community meeting to discuss 
the Ojai Valley's transit needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what we're hearing, we ought to go ahead and try the (expanded) 
service," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey asked residents earlier this month whether they would be interested in 
riding the streetcar to downtown Ojai if its route was extended. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already has contracted for a new trolley, a larger streetcar that 
would serve more passengers than the aging green car that currently moves up 
and down Ojai Avenue. It is not scheduled for delivery, however, until late 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster said the county would contribute between $9,000 and $25,000 a year to 
pay for trolley service outside Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials have not yet decided how to incorporate the county's 
recommendation into the trolley schedule. Expanding service would either mean 
purchasing a second trolley or increasing the route length and time between 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Daniel Singer said the extension would mean Ojai riders 
would have to wait about 15 minutes longer for service. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN ARRESTED OVER STABBING IN BAR

<P>
 One man was stabbed and another hit over the head with a pool cue during an 
east Ventura bar brawl that police were called twice to quell, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dustin Lee Peck, 21, of Oxnard was arrested Wednesday for allegedly assaulting 
Robert Conrad Lemay with a knife after the pair clashed at The Petty Pub, 
Ventura police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemay, 35, of Ventura was treated for stab wounds at the Ventura County 
Medical Center and was released, said a nursing supervisor. Peck was treated 
for a head laceration and was released, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called to the bar at 1091 Scandia Ave. about 7:30 p.m., when Peck 
allegedly pulled a knife and began threatening Lemay, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck left with friends before police arrived but returned about 90 minutes 
later, officials said. Peck entered the pub and again confronted Lemay, 
stabbing him during the fight, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bar patrons jumped in and Peck was struck over the head with a pool cue, 
officials said. While the melee inside was taking place, a juvenile who 
returned to the bar with Peck slashed six tires outside the pub, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 That youth, whose name was not released, was cited for vandalism and released 
to his parents, authorities said. Peck was released pending a review of the 
case by the district attorney's office, police said. KAY SAILLANT

PART OF SIMI VALLEY DUE 11% WATER RATE HIKE; UTILITIES: PUC APPROVES INCREASE 
TO HELP OFFSET BOOST IMPOSED BY SUPPLIERS LAST YEAR. NEW LEVELS GO INTO EFFECT 
MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Water rates for one-third of Simi Valley's residents will jump by as much as 
11.7% starting Monday, a private water distributor has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Water Co. has gained approval from the state Public 
Utilities Commission to hike its rates to help offset increases made by its 
suppliers last year, said Dan Dell'Osa, the company's tariff manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The average residential bill will climb about 11%, from $388.44 to $430.56 
annually. Customers with larger bills will see a slightly bigger increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The company made its last rate hike of 12.7% in October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Both increases were made to cover the rising price of water, Dell'Osa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs us more to buy the water, so we have to make up for that by charging 
more when we sell it," Dell'Osa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Water buys its water from the Calleguas Municipal Water 
District, the largest supplier in Ventura County, which in turn taps into 
reservoirs owned by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD earlier this month announced its fourth annual rate hike, upping rates by 
7%, and compelling Calleguas and local water distributors to absorb the 
additional cost or pass it on to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas board members will meet March 30 to decide whether to pass MWD's 
increase on to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ironing out the details right now," said Don Kendall, general manager 
for Calleguas. "We'd like to make this as equitable as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Water's new rates will offset a 19% price increase that 
MWD passed on to its suppliers in 1993. It applied to the PUC for the increase 
in May and had hoped for approval by the time MWD's rate hike went into effect 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The lag was caused by delays in getting approval from the PUC, Dell'Osa said. 
As a private company, Southern California Water must gain the commission's 
approval for any rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohsen Kazemzadeh, PUC associate engineer, said calculation mistakes in the 
company's application contributed to the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made some errors," he said. "It went back and forth a few times, so it 
took awhile to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 The company may have to apply for another increase in May if Calleguas raises 
its rates in response to MWD's price hike earlier this month, Dell'Osa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Water District No. 8, a city-owned company that provides water to 
the rest of the area, may also increase its rates if Calleguas' prices go up, 
district engineer Michael Kleinbrodt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Water rates for residents supplied by District 8 are about the same as those 
charged by Southern California Water, Kleinbrodt said.

LOS ANGELES SHERIFF'S DEPUTY FILES DEFAMATION SUIT AGAINST D.A.; COURTS: THE 
OFFICER'S ACTION AGAINST DIST. ATTY. MICHAEL D. BRADBURY STEMS FROM THE KILLING 
OF MALIBU MILLIONAIRE DONALD SCOTT DURING A 1992 DRUG RAID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One year after being criticized by Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury for his role in the shooting death of a Malibu millionaire during a 
drug raid, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy has sued Bradbury for 
defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit -- filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court by Deputy 
Gary Spencer -- also charges Bradbury and four of his staff members with libel, 
slander, inflicting emotional distress and several civil-rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer is seeking undisclosed compensatory and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is the latest in a series of developments since the Oct. 2, 1992, 
death of Donald Scott, a 61-year-old heir to a Europe-based chemical fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer shot and killed a gun-wielding Scott during the raid on Scott's 
200-acre ranch across the Ventura County line from Malibu. No drugs were found, 
but Scott had high levels of alcohol and Valium in his body, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason why it was filed was to vindicate Gary Spencer's name," Spencer's 
attorney, Jeff Giordano, said Thursday of the lawsuit. "I think at the end of 
the day the irony will be that it's Mike Bradbury, and not Deputy Spencer, who 
will have lost his moral compass." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury repeatedly has referred to Spencer as "a good officer . . . who lost 
his moral compass," the lawsuit said. Bradbury on Thursday refused to comment 
on the lawsuit, but Noel Klebaum, an assistant counsel for Ventura County, 
called the court complaint "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the allegations in the complaint are simply dead wrong," Klebaum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary L. Bostwick, a prominent Los Angeles attorney specializing in First 
Amendment and defamation cases, said in general prosecutors have a privilege 
that protects them against such lawsuits based on comments made relating to 
their official duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not known in any case that I can think of where a prosecutor's report 
can be used in a defamation case," said Bostwick, who has represented 
defendants and plaintiffs in several high-profile defamation suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury's 64-page report blamed Scott's death on the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department and said Spencer may have lied to get the warrant for the 
search of the dead man's ranch. However, the report said Spencer was justified 
in shooting Scott because Scott was armed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County prosecutor's findings angered Los Angeles County Sheriff 
Sherman Block and led to a two-month review of the Scott case by state Atty. 
Gen. Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, Lungren issued a report disputing Bradbury's report and 
essentially clearing Spencer and other law enforcement officers who 
participated in the raid of any wrongdoing. Lungren also concluded that 
Bradbury's report contained "unsupported and provocative language." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury, however, has not backed away from his report, although he has said 
on several occasions that the matter is over and done with as far as he is 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer's lawsuit Wednesday appears to have reopened the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano said Bradbury should have filed charges against Spencer if there was 
wrongdoing on Spencer's part. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bradbury had the power to prosecute and yet did nothing," Giordano said. 
"What was the purpose of his report? What was the point?" 
</P>
<P>
 Klebaum said that because the report concluded that the shooting was 
justified, there was no law under which Bradbury could have charged the Los 
Angeles County deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of Mr. Bradbury's report was to inform the public of what 
happened," Klebaum said. "To inform the public of why the deputies who killed 
Donald Scott were not prosecuted, and to inform the public of what 
law-enforcement practices are and how they can be improved to avoid the killing 
of people like Mr. Scott." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Bradbury, the suit names as defendants Ventura County and the 
district attorney's office. Other defendants are Ventura County Deputy Dist. 
Attys. Kevin J. McGee, Kevin G. DeNoce and Michael D. Schwartz and investigator 
Richard C. Haas. All declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer's lawsuit said Bradbury's removal of Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol 
Nelson as lead investigator in the Scott shooting case was proof that the 
Ventura County prosecutor was more interested in defaming him. Nelson was 
removed from the case after her report found Spencer's actions to be justified, 
the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also accused Bradbury of having a "cozy relationship" with Venice 
attorney Stephen Yagman, who represents the Scott estate. In a letter written 
to Bradbury last March, Yagman referred to the Ventura County prosecutor as 
"Mike." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Mr. Yagman and defendant Bradbury were on a first-name basis 
and had contact prior to the issuance of defendants' report speaks to an 
appearance of impropriety and an obvious lack of objectivity during the 
preparation of the report," the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman denied the charged. "How I address people in salutations in letters 
that I write is entirely up to me," Yagman said, adding that he and Bradbury 
started using first names while exchanging correspondences on another matter 
before the Scott case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no relationship with the Ventura County district attorney and, 
therefore, certainly nothing I said to Mr. Bradbury would have influenced any 
conclusions that were reached in his investigation," Yagman said. "Any claim 
that anyone improperly influenced Mr. Bradbury is baseless, preposterous and 
absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also charged Bradbury with making dozens of false statements to 
the media, including The Times. In particular, it accused Bradbury of making 
eight separate false statements during an appearance he made on the ABC News 
show "20/20" on April 2, 1993.

SUPERVISORIAL CANDIDATE WANTS EQUAL TV TIME; POLITICS: TRUDI K. LOH SAYS HER 
RIVAL'S SHOW GIVES THE THOUSAND OAKS COUNCILMAN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisorial candidate Trudi K. Loh is asking Thousand Oaks 
city officials to either pull the plug on Councilman Frank Schillo's cable 
television show, "Citizen Exchange," or give her campaign equal air time. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh said Thursday that her opponent's show, broadcast on Ventura County 
Cablevision's government Channel 10, gives him an unfair advantage in the 
supervisor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh is asking officials to either cancel Schillo's half-hour show or provide 
her the opportunity to air her own program. "Citizen Exchange" is authorized by 
the Thousand Oaks City Council and paid for with general fund money received 
from cable franchise fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that all of the other candidates in the race should have the same 
access," said Loh, an attorney. "A half-hour of television time is a great deal 
of exposure."  
</P>
<P>
 But Schillo, who began hosting the show in 1985, said the program focuses on 
local government matters and is not meant as a political forum. Schillo said he 
taped the latest segment on disaster preparedness on Tuesday, and that the show 
is set to run twice on April 8 and once on April 25. A new show is recorded 
every three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have people on there running for office," Schillo said. "This is to 
provide information to the public about what's going on in city government. I'm 
doing my job. And I'm not going to stop for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he saw no difference between his appearance on "Citizen Exchange" 
and the weekly cable television broadcast of City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we should black out my face on Tuesday nights, also," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Loh said she believes Schillo's half-hour program may be in violation 
of Fair Political Practices guidelines because of the extra exposure it 
provides him, the FPPC said that was not the case and that the city would not 
be in violation of any laws if it continues to sponsor Schillo's program during 
the supervisorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as he doesn't say during the show, 'Hey, by the way, vote for me in 
the next election,' it's OK," said Jeanette Turvill, a FPPC spokeswoman in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Loh said she believed there may be some "ambiguity in this area of 
the law" and plans to investigate the matter further with the Federal 
Communications Commission. In the meantime, she is still requesting equal 
access on the government channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Westen, the city's cable television legal consultant, said the city is 
not legally obligated to provide Loh with free air time since it is not a 
regular broadcast network and therefore not governed by the same rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Westen said the city could still grant Loh's request. "The law doesn't require 
the city to do one thing or the other," Westen said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they have asked Loh to write a letter with her request and 
that it will be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal issues aside, at least one other supervisorial candidate, H. Jere 
Robings, said he believed it was not appropriate for Schillo to continue to 
broadcast his show during the campaign. But he said he would not protest if 
Schillo did so. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's watching it anyway," said Robings, who along with Loh has never 
actually seen Schillo's program. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Madge L. Schaefer had no comment on the issue, other than to say 
that "I'll leave it to the lawyers to work out." Carter Ward, the fifth 
candidate in the race, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, David LaRue, president of Ventura County Cablevision, said Loh and 
other supervisorial candidates could produce their own television shows -- 
using the station's studio and equipment free of charge -- on public access 
Channel 8. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRue stressed, however, that such a show would have to be issue-oriented and 
free of politicking. Otherwise, the cable company's involvement would be 
considered a campaign contribution under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city officials agreed that a public access show would be an option 
for Loh to consider, Loh said she would first need to compare viewer markets 
for channels 8 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be a reasonable alternative," she said. "I'll have to see what all 
of my options are."

CAMARILLO ENDS DRY SPELL BY BEATING THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not often that a high school track coach gets doused with Gatorade, yet 
Camarillo's Dennis Riedmiller was dripping in the stuff Thursday after it was 
announced that the Scorpions defeated Thousand Oaks and Westlake in a Marmonte 
League meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has never happened to me before," Riedmiller said as he wiped Gatorade 
out of his eyes. "But it feels good. . . . It's been a long time since we've 
beaten Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 No one was sure exactly how long it had been since Camarillo beat Thousand 
Oaks, but assistant Mike Smith guessed the Scorpions' last victory over the 
Lancers came in 1979 when they were still in the Channel League. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, led by the triple winner Jeremy Fischer, totaled 80 points, 
followed by Thousand Oaks (74) and Westlake (16). 
</P>
<P>
 The Scorpions (3-0, 2-0 in league meets) won only three of the 10 track events 
-- Thousand Oaks won the other seven -- but were victorious in five of six 
field events. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer won the high jump (6 feet 4 inches), long jump (21-4 3/4) and triple 
jump (43-8). Matt Alecock won the pole vault at 12-6 and John Romansic won the 
discus with a personal best of 142-11. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came up huge in the field events," Riedmiller said. "And we knew that was 
going to be a key for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 53-52, after 10 events, Camarillo put the Lancers away over the next 
five events as Mike Wygant won the 300-meter intermediate hurdles in 41.9 
seconds, Fischer led a 1-2-4 Scorpion finish in the triple jump -- a event in 
which he was competing for the first time -- and Alecock headed a 1-3-4 placing 
in the pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Sadowsky finished second in the 200 with a time of 23.1 and Eleazar 
Hernandez capped the streak with a first-place time of 9 minutes 22.7 seconds 
in the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a total team effort," Riedmiller said. "Mike Wygant (who also won 
the 110 highs in 16.1) really came through for us in the hurdles, and Romansic 
and Ryan Fischer got us off to a great start with a one-two finish in the 
discus. That was eight points right off the bat." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Scherrei and Jeff Fischer led Thousand Oaks (1-1, 1-1). Scherrei won the 
100 in 11.1, the 200 in a personal best of 22.4 and anchored the 400 relay team 
to victory in 44.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer upset Hernandez in the 1,600, 4:25.6 to 4:29.2, and added a 
third-place finish in the 800 with a time of 2:02.7.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: SAUGUS' LIGHTS WERE OUT WITH NOBODY HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Saugus High's 11-inning, 4-3 loss to Palmdale on Tuesday mercifully 
ended with one of his players striking out with the bases loaded, Saugus Coach 
Doug Worley wondered if his batter even saw the Palmdale pitcher's offering.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the game ended about 7 o'clock," Worley said. "It was the darkest 
I've ever played, and I've been coaching about 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Paxton had led off the top of the 11th with a home run to give the 
Falcons the one-run lead. Worley's team started a rally in the bottom of the 
inning, but midway through it, the coach didn't care if his team won or lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the inning started, it was kind of that last little glow," said Worley, 
describing the sunset.  
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to the ump before the inning and said, 'I guess if you're going to 
start the inning, you're going to finish it.' I was telling him if they score, 
I want us to have our chance to score too. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was a long, involved (Saugus at-bat) and nothing happened. With us, it 
was nothing but full counts." MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Nice Start 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for the Thousand Oaks baseball team is it can only get easier. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first two games of the season, the Lancers faced Monroe's Joel 
Zamudio and El Camino Real's Randy Wolf, two of the top pitchers in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks beat Zamudio, 2-1, capitalizing on his throwing error in the 
eighth inning, and the Lancers lost to Wolf, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a challenge," Thousand Oaks Coach Jim Hansen said. "We knew 
their reputations. I think we did an outstanding job against them. Our kids are 
still talking about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel really honored that we got to face both of them, because there are a 
lot of people who are wondering just how good they are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks pitchers have performed well themselves, creating a nice 
problem for Hansen. Right-hander Tim Baron hasn't given up an earned run in 15 
innings, and left-hander Brian Downing has worked seven innings without 
yielding an earned run. Sophomore Micah Weathers also pitched six shutout 
innings in his varsity debut. 
</P>
<P>
 With two league games a week, Hansen will have to juggle to find enough 
innings for all three pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks misplayed balls on five consecutive batters Tuesday, but the 
Lancers gave up only two runs in the inning and still beat Cleveland, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth inning started with a fielding error by shortstop Matt Elam. The 
next batter bunted and the ball was misplayed by catcher Matt Kolkowski, but it 
was ruled a hit. Baron then fielded and threw away another bunt, third baseman 
Greg Aguilar threw away a ground ball, and Elam booted another. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Hansen came to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a little meeting to regain our composure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next two batters popped up and the third grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers responded just as you might expect when he was 
told Baseball America magazine had ranked the Pioneers sixth in the nation in 
its preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's unwarranted," he said. "We're young." 
</P>
<P>
 Only three starters -- Bill Scheffels, Ryan Hankins and Jeff Michael -- are 
back from the 1993 team that finished 27-4 and was the Southern Section 
Division I runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park's Keith Smith is off to a hot start. Smith is 3-0 with an 0.32 
earned-run average. He also hit safely in seven of his first 14 at-bats and is 
now batting .473. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Coach Dan Maye expected that his pitching would be the strength and 
carry the offense, but so far it has been the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders are batting .377, led by Adrian Mendoza (.550, 10 runs batted 
in), Joel Mellinger (.471, nine RBIs), Shawn Fossen (.444) and Phil Derryman 
(.429). 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, the weakest position in the lineup has been the cleanup spot. Maki 
Kramer is batting only .294. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our team, through the lineup, is hitting the ball better than most," 
Maye said, "but our pitching is not where I want it to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders are yielding 6.8 runs a game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't try to figure out the Channel Islands offense. The Raiders scored 15 
runs in their first four games, and that included losses of 1-0 and 2-1, but 
then they scored 18 runs in one game against Oxnard. They followed up that 
performance with a 4-0 loss to Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Luxury dugouts and a home clubhouse are under construction at Channel Islands, 
but red tape is standing in the way of completion.  
</P>
<P>
 Coach Al Tarazon expects the proper permits to be obtained and the project to 
be completed by May. 
</P>
<P>
 The home dugout will be 60 feet long and 10 feet deep, attached to a carpeted 
clubhouse with a refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 They're calling it Tarazon's Castle. Around the Leagues . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * Hueneme's Art Bolen is batting .555 with five RBIs, including the 
game-winning hits in the two Viking victories. 
</P>
<P>
 * Camarillo senior outfielder Robert Smith is batting .389 and already has 
nine stolen bases. He has been caught once and picked off once. The Scorpions 
have stolen 25 bases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marmonte League teams have won all four baseball games against the Channel 
League by a combined score of 40-10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harvard-Westlake freshman center Jason Collins set the school's 
single-season rebound record this season with 258 in 27 games. Wolverine senior 
Scott Garson broke the career record for three-point baskets with 69.

O.C. THEATER REVIEW; 'LIFETIME' FULL OF STOLEN MOMENTS; INVENTIVE DIRECTION AND 
FINE ACTING, ENHANCED BY A BEAUTIFUL LOOK AND SOUND, FIND THE DEPTH IN A SIMPLE 
IRISH LOVE STORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's one unmistakable note in the "new wave" of Irish plays of the past 
quarter century. It's a trend whose roots can be traced as far back as John 
Millington Synge: No matter how fervent the political content of the play -- 
and Irish politics are about as fervent as they can get -- the author's point 
is always made through a very personal story. 
</P>
<P>
 This was never truer than in Shirley Gee's "Never in My Lifetime" at Chapman 
University's Waltmar Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The anger at this most unproductive of wars, on the parts of both the Irish 
Republican characters and the British, are at the boiling point. But Gee's 
message is brought home profitably and dramatically in the simple story of Tom, 
a 19-year-old soldier from Yorkshire nearing the end of his service, and 
18-year-old Tessie, the girl he meets on the sly in Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Their love, their stolen moments away from the eyes of zealots on both sides 
and their ultimate tragedy are not only as eloquent an anti-war statement as 
can be made but also place in sharp perspective the fact that wars are not the 
business of those who fight them, but of political opportunists and religious 
bigots and their ilk. 
</P>
<P>
 In treating "Lifetime" as the simple tale it is, director Kamella Tate has 
done it a great service. 
</P>
<P>
 She has staged it inventively on Suzie K. Goff's impressive, detailed, 
multilayered setting, masterfully lit in David Darwin and Deborah Wissink's 
design, with a deliberately measured pace that is rarely broken except when the 
action demands it. Her guidance is illuminated by Daron L. Sorg's fine costume 
design and a memorable sound design by Craig Brown. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Brick and plaster walls spread out across two sides of the Waltmar stage, 
splattered with IRA graffiti, from "Brits Wank" to "Nuke the Paddies" to a 
quite outrageous suggestion for the Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side is a raised platform that holds the Belfast sitting room of 
Tessie's mother (Emily Delk); another platform is the London living room of the 
wife (Anita Bloom) left behind by Tom's pal Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
 These two women, in accomplished monologues, act as the consciences of those 
who keep the lamps burning for the young who fight. Both actresses deal 
effectively with difficult speeches addressed to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Larsen as Charlie has just the right unthinking dedication to a 
responsibility that has to be borne while he wears his country's uniform. 
Elizabeth Maher as Tessie's fiery IRA best friend Maire shows a powerful 
obsession with her ideals, her affection for Tessie and for survival in a 
dreadful world. 
</P>
<P>
 These performances are uniformly good, but Christina Vecchiato as Tessie and 
J. Scott Bramble as Tom are even more impressive. Theirs is a light, romantic 
relationship so typical of any wartime, two young hearts discovering themselves 
and each other for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Vecchiato is impeccable in her subtle shadings from the naive teen-ager 
willing to risk dishonor to the young woman shattered by her fateful decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Bramble is one of those natural actors who can pull off the impossible trick 
of playing innocence and making it look real, of speaking his character's words 
as if for the first time, as though they had just popped into his head. The 
fated romance is more touching through the actors' honesty.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'MOON' A CRUISE FULL OF EROTICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This much can be said for Roman Polanski's carnal hoot-fest "Bitter Moon" -- 
it keeps you wondering from scene to scene if the director has gone bonkers. No 
doubt a lot of the lunacy is intentional, but it's still lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
 And not terribly enjoyable lunacy either. The film plays like a dirty joke 
that somehow got lost in the translation. Polanski, with his screenwriters 
Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn, must have figured that an obsessive 
sadomasochistic love triangle (or is it a love parallelogram?) would work 
better if the whole thing was tarted up and fatuous -- equal parts put-down and 
put-on. They try for a rollicking, aghast tone to mimic the daffy mood-swings 
of sexual compulsion. And, to be sure, "Bitter Moon" holds your attention. How 
could it not when we're allowed into a world where our hero-heel, Peter 
Coyote's Oscar, indulges in sex games disguised as a giant oinker? 
</P>
<P>
 The film begins with a suggestively slow zoom in and out of a luxury cruise 
ship's portal -- a sly hint of subtleties to come. Nigel (Hugh Grant) and Fiona 
(Kristin Scott-Thomas) are a tight-lipped British couple Bombay-bound for their 
second honeymoon when they encounter Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner), a seriously 
smashed jeune fille throwing up in the ladies' room. (It's meet-cute time in 
Polanski World.) Nigel, a (yawn) Eurobond trader, is drawn to this 
messy-mouthed bundle of curves in spite of himself. That evening he wanders 
over to the bar and spots Mimi's little impromptu hoochie-coochie rumba numba 
and gets turned on by being brushed off. (He says "blimey" a lot, just in case 
we failed to recognize what a repressed twit he is.) She leaves the porthole of 
opportunity slight ajar though. This woman could smell a masochist five fathoms 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar, her husband, can too. Wolfish and wheelchair-bound, he encourages 
Nigel's itch. He dragoons the chap into a series of monologues about his 
marriage that have a heady, "Arabian Nights" effect on the poor man. Nigel 
keeps harrumphing and then coming back for more. Oscar, crazed and cackling 
about what a sick joke his life has become, regales Nigel with tales of how he 
fell desperately in love with Mimi and how that love eventually became sour and 
twisted. 
</P>
<P>
 The flashbacks, mostly set in a distinctly un-touristy, twilit Paris, come 
complete with Oscar's florid voice-over narration. Example: He describes his 
first communion with Mimi by saying, "I might have been Adam with the taste of 
apple fresh in my mouth." Oscar is supposed to be a failed American expatriate 
novelist -- a Henry Miller with the glands but not the talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi, a shy dancer who responds swoonily to Oscar's oo-la-la entrancements, 
first shows her mettle when she accidentally nicks him shaving. The blood 
tastes warm. Later she sort of accidentally spills a carton of milk on her 
breasts whereupon Oscar develops a powerful thirst. Even when she evolves into 
a dominatrix and uses Oscar for a privy or roots him out in his pig-man mode 
she's still his adoring co-conspirator. But Oscar becomes bored suiting up for 
decadence and his passion turns sadistic. He troops other women around his 
cramped, book-lined pad and turns Mimi into a frumpy clown. She's pathetic 
until you realize -- perhaps before Mimi does -- that she's biding her time for 
some pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bitter Moon" can be taken as a cockeyed allegory for what happens when love 
runs dry but lust doesn't (or maybe it's the other way around). It's a movie 
about the jollies of sexual degradation made by a martinet. Polanski, who is 
married to Seigner, is probably working out some sort of married-man crisis in 
this film. That's one of the advantages of being a movie director -- you get to 
really work out your crises with the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's disappointing about the shocks are how conventional they are. 
Polanski the expressionist libertine heads straight for the most bourgeois 
transgressions: Mimi's crowning insult to Oscar is to (gasp) get it on with a 
black man . Her final insult to Nigel is a naughty whopper that plays like a 
racier kicker to a "Love Boat" episode. The point of all the parading seems to 
be to reconcile Nigel and his wife in a there-but-for-the-grace-of-God 
rapprochement. Polanski ascends to the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
 He is at least a more interesting scourge than, say, the Louis Malle who made 
"Damage." The sexual obsession in that film was as heavy as a 10-ton shroud. By 
comparison, the Zalman King huff-a-thons, like "9 1/2 Weeks" and "Wild Orchid," 
are trashier and campier and more fun -- maybe because the women in them lose 
their marbles about as often as the men. But Polanski, like Malle, seems 
fixated on showing us how sex can turn men into dumbos -- or porkies. It's a 
deranged kind of alternate-universe feminism: It's OK for women to drive men 
nuts because men are pigs. Life is a wallow. 
</P>
<P>
 Could "Bitter Moon" be the date movie that brings the Bobbitts back together 
again?

PRIZED ANIMATOR; * ISADORE 'FRIZ' FRELENG, 88, WILL BE HONORED FOR A LIFETIME 
OF CARTOON ARTISTRY, INCLUDING CREATION OF BUGS BUNNY AND THE PINK PANTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thufferin' thuccotash! 
</P>
<P>
 Animation giant Isadore "Friz" Freleng will receive the first lifetime 
achievement award given by the Santa Clarita Valley International Film 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The 88-year-old Freleng will be honored Saturday night for a body of work that 
includes Oscar-winning cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam, Sylvester 
and Tweety, Speedy Gonzales and the Pink Panther. The prize will be known as 
the Friz. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the geniuses who put the "loon" in Looney Tunes, Freleng worked his 
goofy magic at Warner Bros. for more than 30 years. In 1963, he joined with 
David De Patie to create De Patie-Freleng Enterprises. There he fathered the 
Pink Panther, whose debut in the title sequence of Blake Edwards' film almost 
stole the show from star Peter Sellers. "Time magazine wrote it up and said it 
was better than the picture," Freleng recalled recently. "Blake didn't like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Freleng, who lives in Westwood with his wife of 61 years, taught himself 
animation from a book. As one of the shapers of Bugs, Daffy Duck and other 
animated zanies who zoom through the American subconscious, he gets stacks of 
mail from scholars and fans alike. He continues to produce original art in the 
style of animation cels, sold through Warner Bros. Studio stores for as much as 
$1,700. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his fellow animators never thought of their six-minute movies as 
tomorrow's classics. "We were just making a living," Freleng says. But the 
Warner Bros. artists always competed against each other, and they were ever 
ready to puncture the pretensions of their snooty rival, Disney. Today the 
Warner Bros. pantheon is nearly as famous as Mickey and his pals and even more 
fondly regarded by people who once got sent to their rooms without their 
supper. At this very moment, the Warner Bros. store in Topanga Plaza is selling 
shirts, address books and other merchandise featuring a scene from Freleng's 
1957 Oscar winner, "Birds Anonymous," in which Sylvester tries, and fails, to 
rise above being a puddy tat. 
</P>
<P>
 Freleng, Tex Avery, Chuck Jones and the other great Warner Bros. animators 
hold no rights to the characters they breathed such raucous life into. "The 
Pink Panther probably earns him more money than all his other work combined," 
says Norman M. Klein, a CalArts animation expert familiar with Freleng and his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Honored by the American Film Institute and other prestigious bodies, Freleng 
was the most musical of the Warner Bros. animators. "His sense of rhythm and 
timing was remarkably adept," Klein says. In his view, Freleng's genius is 
sometimes underrated by historians of animation because "it wasn't as flashy as 
some of the others." 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence of Freleng's intuitive understanding of what makes a cartoon 
comedy work, Klein points to the creation of Granny, a seemingly sweet old lady 
who manages to make Sylvester's life a living hell. "The cuter the character 
the more sadistic it can be," Klein reminds. He also cites the complexity and 
depth of character that Freleng brought to Tweety, who had been just another 
mean-spirited little canary in the hands of animator Bob Clampett. 
</P>
<P>
 Freleng's best work, says Klein, praising him very highly indeed, "is very 
elegant and silly." 
</P>
<P>
 When Freleng talks about his characters, he talks about acting. "We really 
became actors with a pencil," he says. "That's the difference between them and 
the characters you see today. We made them act." As a result, no one thinks of 
Bugs or Sylvester as drawings. "Today," Freleng says, "the dialogue does the 
acting, and the characters just move." 
</P>
<P>
 Bugs Bunny was so real, according to Freleng, that people would ask him where 
the wascally wabbit lived. And Freleng himself sometimes talks about his 
characters as if they were human actors with human attributes. "Nobody liked 
working with Porky Pig much because he was sort of a square," Freleng says. And 
the animator once told Klein, "I couldn't stand having Bugs up against Elmer 
because Elmer had the brains of a chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 And now the answer to the question on everybody's lips: Is Freleng really the 
model for Yosemite Sam? Yes, you varmints. "I have the same temperament," 
Freleng admits. "I'm small, and I used to have a red mustache." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>

TELLING OTHER HALF OF THE STORY; * AN AWARD-WINNING EXHIBIT ON THREE 
GENERATIONS OF JAPANESE AMERICAN WOMEN COMES TO LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the first Japanese American women came to the United States as 
"picture brides," kimonoed women brave enough or desperate enough to spend a 
month at sea to marry a man whose face they knew only from a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Their daughters -- the generation known in Japanese as Nisei -- thought of 
themselves as citizens like any other. But when the Japanese bombed Pearl 
Harbor, thousands of Japanese American citizens found themselves robbed of 
their possessions and shipped off to harsh detention camps because of the color 
of their skin. The third generation, called Sansei, include women like Kristi 
Yamaguchi, who skated her way to a gold medal for the United States at the 
Albertville Olympics in 1992. More than 50% of them marry non-Japanese men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strength & Diversity: Japanese-American Women 1885-1990" is the subject of an 
award-winning exhibit that opens Saturday at the Gene Autry Western Heritage 
Museum in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews with 50 Japanese American women, the show was originally 
organized by the National Japanese American Historical Society and the Oakland 
Museum, where it opened in 1990. In part because Japanese American soldiers, 
many fresh from the camps, fought so heroically during World War II, the story 
of Japanese American men has been told before. But as Rosalyn Tonai, one of the 
show's Bay Area organizers, points out, this is the first exhibit that tells 
the story of Japanese American women, often in their own words. 
</P>
<P>
 What distinguishes this show from other ethnic exhibits, even groundbreaking 
ones, is that, as it travels around the country, the show is customized to 
reflect the local experience. "It was very different in Hawaii than it was in 
Portland, Oregon," says Tonai. Southern California has the largest 
concentration of Japanese Americans in the country -- more than 130,000 in Los 
Angeles County alone. Working with the Japanese American National Museum in 
Little Tokyo, the Autry has tapped this rich community resource to give the 
show a local spin. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Michael Duchemin, curator of history at the Autry, the traveling 
portion of the show includes photographs, text -- much of it taken from the 
oral histories -- and some 70 objects that document the journey of Japanese 
American women from immigration to their varied roles in contemporary culture. 
The era of the picture bride, for instance, is vividly evoked by a kimono, iko 
or kimono rack and Japanese wicker suitcase that accompanied one hopeful woman 
across the Pacific. Local additions flesh out the basic show and allow visitors 
to see in concrete detail how their Japanese American neighbors fared during 
almost a century of tradition, trial and change. 
</P>
<P>
 Before World War II Japanese American women had even fewer job opportunities 
than their men. Many could only get jobs as domestic servants or at vegetable 
stands. But during the 1930s, some local Japanese American women attended the 
Gardena Dressmaking College. The show includes a photo of the class of 1936, 
plus a diploma and a program for the ceremony that marked them as full-fledged 
seamstresses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, some of the most powerful material involves the notorious 
"relocation centers." As a result of the racist exclusion order of 1942, many 
Japanese Americans were, in the words of writer Eugene V. Rostow, "sent to 
concentration camps on a record which wouldn't support a conviction for 
stealing a dog." Locally, many internees were concentrated at Santa Anita, 
where children did their lessons in front of the parimutuel windows in the 
grandstand because their mothers didn't want their educations interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tonai, whose mother was a teen-age internee in Rohwer, Ark., many 
people, however guiltless, were ashamed of being interned and never spoke about 
their camp experiences. The exhibit includes such eloquent objects as an oil 
painting titled "Family in Camp Room," done in Rohwer, that shows how internees 
tried to brighten the small, barracks-like spaces where they suffered 
marriage-testing lack of privacy and other indignities. Bad, decidedly 
un-Japanese food was another trial of camp life. Internees in Topaz, Utah, 
finally rioted after they were served liver once too often. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow the internees, especially women, managed to create some beauty in 
their lives and those of their families. Hand-crafted jewelry is part of the 
exhibit, including a flower corsage made from little white shells at the Gila 
River camp in Arizona. At the same camp Japanese Americans wove baskets in the 
style of the local Pima Indians. "It looks like the Indians may have been 
showing the internees how to make them," says Duchemin. The result is "a very 
interesting cross-cultural piece" that appears in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories of Nisei women are especially interesting because, even more than 
their mothers, they were aware of being, in the words of writer Mei Nakano, "in 
double jeopardy, objects of the sexism of the society-at-large as well as the 
deeply entrenched one of the traditional Japanese society." As you look at the 
pictures and read the words, you can almost imagine the parents of the Nisei 
women who became WACs and broke from tradition in other ways muttering the 
Japanese equivalent of oy veh.  
</P>
<P>
 Activists are also part of the story, including the women who fought for 
redress and reparations for the victims of Executive Order 9066. 
</P>
<P>
 The show includes a Life magazine cover that shows civil-rights activist Yuri 
Kochiyama cradling the head of fallen Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit also bears witness to the achievements of contemporary women. 
Included in the show is a robe worn by Fumiko Hachiya Wasserman as a Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge. As Duchemin notes, "It brings the story up to the 
present." WHERE AND WHEN

REMOTE AND IN CONTROL; * THE ARTISTS IN THE PIERCE COLLEGE SHOW INVESTIGATE THE 
MURKY FORCES THAT IMPOSE THEIR WILL ON SOCIETY. THE WORK IS ALSO ABOUT TAKING 
RESPONSIBILITY, THE GALLERY DIRECTOR SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly 
about art for The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Who has power in our society? The President and other elected officials? 
Corporate lobbyists and special interests? The media? Infamous talk show hosts? 
What about the people? 
</P>
<P>
 Artists living outside the mainstream have the power to question the way the 
world operates. In the Pierce College Art Gallery show "The Control of Power," 
four Los Angeles artists challenge not only the powers that be but the people 
who feel that they have no way to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is "about power, and taking responsibility if you have power," said 
gallery director Joan Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Dreager sees her installation "Who Killed Pinky?" as "a metaphor 
for who's killing this country," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One section of the work focuses on Ernest Suggs Jr., a homeless man who lived 
in a car in the Skid Row parking lot near Dreager's studio. When he needed 
money, he modeled for her. Two large photographs here depict Suggs as model: In 
one, his face is covered with a white mask. In the other, he stands astride a 
white fiberglass mold for a carousel horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreager took a series of smaller photographs of Suggs at the mortuary, after 
he was murdered in June, 1993. "I had to go there," she said. "I wanted him to 
live on. I knew I was going to do a piece. It was part of my letting go of 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying this part of the installation is a book, "For Memories That Last 
. . . Forever," which contains poetry that Dreager, her friends and people on 
Skid Row wrote in honor of Suggs. She had done several books on him when he was 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 A "wonderful musician" addicted to crack -- "he tried to get off but he 
couldn't," Dreager said -- he was "larger than life, a real presence, innately 
talented, and I liked him. He was a real decent human being." Dreager feels 
that his life and death "speak to our system and society of drugs and guns." 
</P>
<P>
 The other section of her installation concentrates on the perils women face in 
our society. A series of photographs of women's torsos -- not exactly the 
airbrushed images one finds in fashion magazines -- has been mounted on the 
wall under the threat of numerous small replicas of knives from the 
Philippines. They "were designed solely to rip your guts out," Dreager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Below the knives and photographs rests a pink negligee. On each side of the 
pictures is a photocopy of Thomas Gainsborough's painting "Pinky." Each is 
accessorized with symbols of femaleness. A vision of maleness stands at the 
center of the composition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time with the male ego and power," Dreager said. She sees her 
art as "a lifetime of experiences for me that I've collected and brought to the 
work." She wants viewers to "bring their own experiences to it and open up to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Lloyd created the 100-inch power tower and oil rig, "Desert Stor No M," 
as a model for a 100-foot, solar-powered sound sculpture he intends to install 
in the Mojave Desert on behalf of a local patron. A public-band radio would 
broadcast sounds from the site, including those of coyotes and cactus in the 
wind, within a 10-mile radius. An elementary school in the area would receive 
transmissions and send back their own. 
</P>

 Signs in four languages would alert visitors to the fact that what they say 
could be heard by others. The message Lloyd wants to convey: "When you're here, 
you're on, so be responsible. People are listening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Placing works is the exciting part for me. This work is connected to a city, 
site, population and a social responsibility rather than determined by a 
market-driven gallery / museum complex. Artists can take responsibility by 
putting art in the right place."

 Ed Colver "plays with simple icons," he said, in making his assemblages and 
his bitingly witty commentaries on corporate and institutional power. 
</P>
<P>
 On first glance, "Unlimited Edition" looks like a set of encyclopedias. But 
these books, 112 volumes, are titled "Corruption in American Politics." 
</P>
<P>
 The life-size figure "Mr. Humble" has needles coming out of his head. "Mrs. 
Humble" has flags coming out of hers, and she seems to be regurgitating her 
lunch. The strains of striving to obtain the American Dream seem to have gotten 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should fight against corporations every day of their lives," Colver 
said. "They are building Big Brother. You won't have a choice of a place to 
shop." 
</P>
<P>
 John O'Brien's steel, paint, canvas, neon and wood "Untitled (Rift)" 
sculptural installation piece considers the changes in the East-West power 
struggle. It incorporates a small red star for communism and a much bigger 
peace symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a screen within the work seems to indicate that we don't really know 
what's going on, that some important information is being screened out. The 
question is, by whom? WHERE AND WHEN

<P>
 What: "The Control of Power."

COMIC RELIEF; * TRINITY THEATRE COMPANY HAD TO START OVER AFTER QUAKE. DUO'S 
SHOW WILL SEEK TO ELEVATE SPIRITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Few Valley theater companies made it through the Jan. 17 quake without 
disastrous fallout. Some made cosmetic repairs and went on. Others had to move 
imminent productions to new venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinity Theatre Company, whose comedy show Tonna & Vincent -- "Just Add Water" 
is opening tonight at the Limelight Playhouse, has had to start all over. 
</P>
<P>
 According to producer Adam Gordon, the company's production of "Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern Are Dead" was to open the week after the quake. They had spent 
thousands on the staging. But the disaster ended the effort, partly because of 
damage to the homes of people connected with the show. Two of the actors were 
so shaken they left town. Three actors' homes were red-tagged, forcing them 
into tents. The costume designer lost not only his home, but the "Rosencrantz" 
costumes as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to laugh," Gordon says. And the answer was the self-contained act 
of company member Arthur Tonna and his longtime partner Diane Vincent. The duo 
had done their show at a couple of fund-raisers for Trinity, particularly for 
"Rosencrantz," and getting it into a theater would not only provide Valley 
audiences with comic relief during the quake's aftermath, but also would raise 
the company's spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonna and Vincent met in 1986 during a production of "How to Succeed in 
Business Without Really Trying." They began dating but eventually realized that 
they had more going as a comedy team than as a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, while building and honing their material, they've played the 
Comedy Store, the Improv, all the standard clubs, and they've played Las Vegas 
and Reno. That's along with following their separate courses in parallel. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonna and Vincent are both actors. "But," Tonna says, "Diane is more 
successful at that than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wanna bet?" Vincent snaps back with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tonna goes on to explain that as an actor who had done a lot of 99-seat 
theater, he really wasn't happy. "I wasn't satisfied," he says. "I would bring 
home a script, usually a comedy, and I should have been excited. People were 
going to see me, and blah-blah-blah. But I wasn't happy. I said, 'I think I can 
write better than this, something more entertaining.' So I said, 'All right, 
big shot, then do it.' So I started writing my own stuff. And I have more 
control now. If you're in a play and you don't like the second act, there's 
nothing you can do about it. With our show, if we don't like the second act, we 
can change it. If something doesn't work, get rid of it. It's always evolving, 
always changing. Out of necessity I became a writer." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent's first love is musical comedy. She started as a tap-dancer and 
singer. "And I love comedy," she says. "So musical comedy offers me all three 
of those." And she frequently gets to show that love, most recently in the Long 
Beach production of "From the Top" with Carol Burnett. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the pieces in their show they've been doing for a couple of years, but 
a lot of the material is new for this production. This is also the first time 
they've put themselves into the hands of a director, Trinity's Ken McFarlane. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing at the Limelight with Ken," Vincent says, "is something 
we've been trying to do for a long, long time, a theatrical presentation of our 
stuff. It's not your basic comedy for clubs, because it requires props and 
lights, and that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonna laughs as he says, "You go into a place like the Comedy Store with props 
and hats and whatnot, you're lucky to get two microphones that work. When they 
see us coming they go, 'Oh, oh, here come the actors.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent agrees. "That's why this particular act we're doing right now really 
belongs in a theater. There's too much froufrou involved. It's not just jokes 
and microphones." 
</P>
<P>
 Director McFarlane remembers when Tonna and Vincent did sketches for the 
company's fund-raisers. "That's what gave us the idea to make it a full show. 
It's something they've always wanted, and we said, 'Let's go with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane's influence is mostly as a third eye, he says, for the overall view, 
the look and feel of the show, providing a consistent pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonna & Vincent -- "Just Add Water" runs for four weeks, but Arthur Tonna is 
also appearing in William Inge's "The Call," one of three one-acts that will 
play during the fifth Trinity week at the Limelight, also directed by 
McFarlane. The others are Frederick Stroppel's "Do Over," and "The Great Nebula 
in Orion" by Lanford Wilson. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: Tonna & Vincent -- "Just Add Water" and "An Evening of One-Acts." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Limelight Playhouse, 10634 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Both shows: 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. 7 p.m. Sundays. "Just Add 
Water" ends April 10. "One-Acts" April 15-17 only. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; ACME PUTS ON 'SURVIVAL' OF THE FUNNIEST; * THE PLAYERS' LATEST 
SHOW IS HARDLY AN IMAGINATIVE CONCEPT, BUT IS CARRIED OUT WITH A FRESH 
APPROACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to worry about the title of the Acme Players' new sketch show, "Acme 
Survival Kit." A night of earthquake jokes? 
</P>
<P>
 Almost none, actually, until the closing number, when the company sings an 
I-Will-Survive-in-L. A. romp to the tune of "There Is Nothin' Like a Dame." 
It's a good sign when a comedy group, naturally driven by the topical, keeps 
the obvious topics under control. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also has a sense of quality control, which in sketch comedy means 
some balance between the acting and writing, with neither necessarily leading 
the way. Sometimes, under M. D. Sweeney's direction at the Acme Comedy Theatre, 
this can produce that kind of special skit that leaves one wondering: Where did 
that come from? 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne Offutt's solo scene, for instance. It's about a cartoonishly geeky kid 
with giant buck teeth who tells about finding a yellow ball with an ugly face 
painted on it. He thinks it looks like him (although it doesn't strike him as 
ugly). He even begins to feel as if he's bruising his face when he bounces the 
ball on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did this come from? It's one of those stories that seems to drop from 
the sky, very askew and very true, like one of Donald Barthelme's great weird 
tales. And Offutt's focused, obsessive performance makes it truly indelible. 
</P>
<P>
 Other, less special instances in which the acting and writing are joined at 
the hip include a nutty encounter between a Yankee businessman (Brian Kerrigan) 
and three nitwit Cajun motel operators (Kate Donahue, Susie Geiser and Doug 
Jackson); an insanely neurotic pediatrician (Brett Baer) and his at-wit's-end 
assistant (Jackson); a Marine private (Ted Hardwick) with his own "Harvey"-type 
friend (Kerrigan), and "Sunset Boulevard" retold by a struggling sketch comedy 
writer (Baer) done in by an aging comedy queen (Donahue). 
</P>
<P>
 This list also indicates that the Acme folks are not nearly so TV-addicted as 
other L. A. comedy groups. Sure, there are the inevitable spoofs of ads (such 
as Marc Drotman's obnoxious pitchman for "Protecto Pants 2000" to ward off all 
potential Lorena Bobbitts), cable access (Hardwick's and Drotman's heterosexual 
cross-dressers in the Valley) and info shows (Kerrigan's funny British host 
explaining obscure moments in art history). And the less said about a Polish 
version of "Saturday Night Live," the better. 
</P>
<P>
 This "Survival Kit," though, is packed with some care -- even with the sense, 
rare for a sketch show, of a running theme: How do normal people deal with 
crazies, and not become crazy themselves? In one case, in which Kerrigan plays 
a diner customer waiting and waiting and waiting to be served by Donahue's 
smacking waitress, Kerrigan ends up doing his best Chris Farley act. Offutt's 
sharp drill instructor in the "Harvey" scene is another guy being pushed to the 
edge, and a bit with demon-kid Chelsea Clinton (a funny Geiser) suggests that 
the inmates are running the White House asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Jonathan Green's over-synthesized, sample-mad music may 
drive an audience over the edge, and it's all too rare when a scene ends when 
it's called for. As Jack Benny once noted, a comic almost never knows when to 
get off stage. WHERE AND WHEN

 What: "Acme Survival Kit."

FULLY BOOKED; THE VALLEY IS WELL-STOCKED WITH USED VOLUMES -- THE SIMPLY 
SECONDHAND TO THE REALLY RARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If your idea of a bookstore is a clean, well-lighted place, filled with 
unthumbed copies of the new Tom Clancy, this story isn't for you. This is a 
guide to the Valley's other bookstores, the sometimes dark, sometimes dusty 
places filled with books as old as your parents, out-of-print titles on 
everything from aerospace to zoology. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's many used-book stores are typically visited by two types of 
people. First, there are the readers -- individuals whose best times are had in 
their heads, exploring other worlds or becoming other people. These are the 
customers who peruse the shelves with half-smiles on their faces, touching the 
waiting spines as if engaged in a kind of foreplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, there are the book collectors. These are people who spend a great deal 
of time and money seeking a Grail known only to them -- an obscure novel to cap 
their collection of whaling books or the WPA guide to the state of Idaho, the 
only one they don't already have. Collectors tend to yelp unself-consciously 
when they hit it big. They also tend to be male, for reasons known only to God. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinary used books sell for half their cover price or less. But some 
secondhand prose can cost a bundle. In recent years, book collecting has been 
roiled by a phenomenon called garping . As Denver book dealer and writer John 
Dunning explains, garping is the process whereby a relatively new book, and not 
necessarily a distinguished one, suddenly begins commanding princely sums on 
the resale market. Often the jump in price leaves even dealers shaking their 
heads. The term refers to John Irving's novel "The World According to Garp." As 
soon as "Garp" hit the bestseller list in 1978, Dunning says, Irving's earlier 
books, which had languished on book-dealer's shelves, garped, or shot up in 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 John Grisham's early work has also garped. Dunning recently saw a copy of 
Grisham's maiden novel, "A Time to Kill" (1988), for $3,000. That's what you 
would pay for a decent first edition of Mark Twain's "Adventures of Huckleberry 
Finn." Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fancy-schmancy antiquarian bookstores have ritzy addresses, but most 
used-book stores are in neighborhoods where rents are low. The San Fernando 
Valley offers a surprising range of stores, places where you can find 
everything from books by L. Frank Baum to back issues of Collier's magazine. 
The following is a non-inclusive list. It starts in the east, in Glendale, and 
ends in the West Valley. Virtually all the stores buy books and many will 
conduct a search for a particular title. The focus is on stores that carry 
hardbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Brand Books, 231 N. Brand Blvd., Glendale. Owner Jerome Joseph estimates he 
has about 100,000 books, and he and his staff can often help you find a 
particular title in this large, well-organized shop. One of the best things 
about Brand Books is its high turnover, much valued by habitual book shoppers. 
One appreciative regular is Eloisa Mondrus of Mount Washington. She stops by 
twice a month to check out the Judaica section and books on her native Cuba. 
With titles in all categories, the store is strong in philosophy, religion and 
film, and has large, orderly paperback sections as well. Open nightly. "People 
walk at night here," Joseph explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday 
and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday. (818) 507-5943.  
</P>
<P>
 Mystery & Imagination Bookshop, 515 1/2 E. Broadway, Glendale. This is the 
only used-book store in the Valley that specializes in mystery and suspense, a 
booming area of book collecting. (Mitchell Books in Pasadena is the premier 
place for mysteries in the San Gabriel Valley; Mysterious Bookshop, the best of 
the Westside stores.) Among the 7,500 books on the shelves are literature and 
fiction of all kinds. Recent goodies included a first edition of "Burning 
Daylight," signed by author Jack London. Priced at $550, the book also includes 
London's personal bookplate featuring a wolf. Co-owner Christine Bell says 
interest in book collecting seems to be surging lately. "A great many of our 
customers are brand new collectors within the last year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: noon to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. (818) 545-0206.  
</P>
<P>
 Book City Burbank, 308 N. San Fernando Blvd., Burbank. The offspring of 
mammoth Book City Hollywood, Book City Burbank is a huge, bright, orderly 
operation in the middle of the gentrified Burbank mall. According to manager 
Mitch Siegel, there are 500,000 books at the two Book City locations and their 
warehouse. Ladders are placed throughout the store so customers can explore the 
upper shelves. Siegel can't get over how much the area, now full of restaurants 
and shoppers in full Gap chic, has changed since the store opened in 1980. "It 
went from Mayberry to Manhattan," he says. Book City Burbank is a great place 
to look for material on the arts, including movie and TV scripts. It has also 
started selling autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sunday. 
(818) 848-4417.  
</P>
<P>
 Book Castle, 200 N. San Fernando Blvd., Burbank. Co-owner Paul Hunt describes 
Book Castle on the Burbank mall as "one of the last of the big, old general 
bookstores." Big it is -- about 10,000 square feet with even Hunt doesn't know 
how many books. Book Castle isn't the best organized store in the world, and 
some of its stock is tired, but it has something for everyone, including a vast 
collection of back-issue magazines.  
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Friday and 
Saturday. (818) 845-1563.  
</P>
<P>
 Book Castle is the flagship of a modest bibliographic armada. Under the same 
ownership is much smaller Bond Street Books, nearby at 144 S. San Fernando 
Blvd., Burbank. Bond Street Books used to be worth checking out for its 
literature and foreign literature in translation, in particular, if you didn't 
mind taking a deep breath when somebody tried to pass you in the narrow aisles. 
According to co-owner Hunt, most of the good literature titles have been moved 
to the mall store. The new Bond Street concentrates on politics, military 
history, true crime, secret societies and the like. "We're very strong in 
conspiracy stuff right now," Hunt says. Conspiracy? "If you're paranoid," jokes 
Hunt, "you're welcome to our store." 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. (818) 845-6467.  
</P>
<P>
 In the minds of many serious collectors, the best Book Castle is the one at 
3604 W. Magnolia Blvd., Burbank. This is a somewhat dark but capacious store, 
with good offerings in history, including military history, and literature. The 
emphasis is on solid, scholarly books. Manager Ted Miller is a collector 
himself, of Irish history and fiction. He also keeps track of his neatly 
arranged stock. "It's really nice if somebody calls for a book if you know 
where it might be."  
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. (818) 842-6816.  
</P>
<P>
 Sam's Book City, 5249 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. This general 
used-book store is in the process of being revamped by co-owner Craig Klapman. 
Sam's Book City is vast, with some 65,000 books on all subjects, and Klapman 
hopes to expand it to its full 100,000-volume capacity. Klapman has begun to 
impose order on the store's shelves, has invested heavily in brighter light 
bulbs and has introduced such amenities as a children's book room, with toys. 
On Saturday mornings at 10:30 a.m., a storyteller will keep the little darlings 
amused, or at least distracted, for an hour while you browse in peace. Klapman, 
whose background is theater, says he took the job because it allows him to obey 
Henry David Thoreau's admonition to "beware of all enterprises that require new 
clothes." As for Sam, there is no Sam, Klapman admits, "although we have 
different stories for different people."  
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Sunday. (818) 985-6911.  
</P>
<P>
 Iliad Book Shop, 4820 Vineland Ave., North Hollywood. "I carry a little bit of 
everything, but I specialize in literature, the arts and counterculture," says 
owner Dan Weinstein. The last, he explains, includes everything from books on 
body piercing to the novels of Robert Anton Wilson. There are sofas so 
customers can hang out and a resident collie, Jack the Dog. Weinstein has a 
decent selection of modern firsts and collectible books. At press time he had a 
copy of Walt Whitman's "Autobiographia" for $150 and a special edition of 
"Alice in Wonderland" illustrated and signed by Salvador Dali for $2,700. There 
are also 50-cent paperbacks. Weinstein is a one of the younger members of what 
amounts to a book-dealing dynasty in Southern California. The Westside's 
Heritage Book Shop, the area's finest, is owned by uncles Ben and Lou 
Weinstein, and the family has ties to bookshops from Ventura to Orange 
counties. As one competitor says, "The Weinsteins have ink in their blood."  
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday, noon to 6 p.m. Sunday. 
(818) 509-2665.  
</P>
<P>
 Dutton's Books, 5146 Laurel Canyon Blvd., North Hollywood. Dutton's is one of 
the Valley best-known stores with a large, rather disheveled used-book section 
as well as a good selection of new books. A lot of books spilled onto the floor 
during the recent quake, but Dutton's was soon back in business with a 
"storewide seismic sale," offering 20% to 50% off. Specialties include 
literature, classics, humanities, the arts, history and philosophy. Dutton's 
has a branch with about half as many books at 3806 W. Magnolia Blvd. in 
Burbank, which is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m to 6 p.m. Call 
(818) 840-8003 for further information. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 9:30 a.m to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday 
and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. (818) 769-3866.  
</P>
<P>
 Bargain Books, 14426 Friar St., Van Nuys. Bargain Books is one of the few 
shops in the Valley that is strong in technical books. A general bookstore, it 
also has a good selection of art books, children's books and cookbooks. This is 
one of the places you didn't want to be during the recent quake. The aisles are 
snug for an anorexic, and books are often double-shelved. "We had over 50,000 
books fall," says Bill Wirt, who owns the store with his sister, Diane Sharrar. 
Stock is constantly turning over, which makes this shop a terrific place to 
pass your lunch hour if you're on jury duty at nearby Van Nuys courthouse. 
Insiders say the owners pay top prices for good books.  
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday. 
(818) 782-2782.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bookie Joint, 7426 Reseda Blvd., Reseda. After the Northridge earthquake, 
callers to the Bookie Joint heard a tape describing it as "the epicentric 
bookshop" and asking for volunteers to help clean up. Almost 20 years old, the 
store was badly shaken. Owner Rose Blaz reports that 50,000 books on all 
subjects and another 50,000 magazines were unshelved. Today the signs on the 
still boarded-up windows read "Trying to be open." Rose and husband Jerry are 
in there every day, attempting to bring some order to the chaos. Rose reports 
progress is being made -- all the back issues of Life magazine from 1936 to 
1955 have been organized, for instance. But most of the stock is still in 
boxes. "The doors are open, but people are having a hard time," Rose admits. 
"The other day someone wanted an art book, and she spent six hours finding it. 
I don't know how she did it."  
</P>
<P>
 The Blazes have been opening at 11 a.m. weekdays, 10:30 a.m. Saturdays and 
trying to stay open until 6 p.m. (818) 343-1055.  
</P>
<P>
 Books Plus, 17812 Chatsworth Ave., Granada Hills. Like many other small 
businesses in this part of the Valley, Books Plus was whacked by the quake. 
Owner Mary Watanabe lost 900 feet of shelving. "We were trashed," she says. 
Watanabe describes hers as a general used-book store, with strong holdings in 
literature, children's books and illustrated books. She is especially grateful 
to one of her customers, Han Chang-Min, who showed up after the quake and 
worked for weeks, helping her rescue the hip-high pile of books on the floor. 
She appreciated his humor, his managerial skills and the fact that he didn't 
step on the books as some other would-be helpers did. "He was the one who could 
cry with me when we found a really good book that was damaged," she recalls.

TITLES AS TREASURE; * DAVE ROBERTS HAS MADE A PROFITABLE CAREER FROM HUNTING 
DOWN DESIRABLE VOLUMES AND RESELLING THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Dave Roberts is king of the Valley book scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Book scouts are the people who scour garage and estate sales, private 
collections, Goodwill stores and other sources for desirable titles they can 
sell at a profit to used-book dealers who resell them in turn. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, according to Denver writer and book dealer John Dunning, 
when many book scouts were "borderline psychopaths who slept in their cars" and 
subsisted on the $30 or $40 a day they could make selling books to people like 
him. (Dunning, who owns Denver's Old Algonquin bookshop, is also the author of 
a highly collectible mystery, called "Booked to Die," that begins with the 
murder of a book scout.) But a new generation of what Dunning calls 
white-collar book scouts has begun to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go out to garage sales and you see doctors with knapsacks looking for 
books," says Dunning. Nouveau scouts such as Roberts have the same unerring 
nose for a profitable book as their more downscale predecessors, but they also 
have permanent addresses, college educations and Visa cards. There are a mere 
handful of Angelenos like Roberts who make a decent living scouting books. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, 35, came to Los Angeles in 1990 to break into the film business. A 
new graduate of San Francisco State, the Northern California native finagled 
his way into the production company of Roger Corman, king of the Bs, only to 
discover that he couldn't make enough to eat regularly working as an assistant 
to the head of distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Books bailed him out. As Roberts recalls, he first realized he could make a 
decent living at this after he bought five bags of used books for $1 each at a 
Laurel Plaza charity sale and resold them for $150. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid reader, Roberts figures he acquired his sense of what would and would 
not sell during the many hours of his youth he spent scrutinizing library 
shelves, category by category. He also bought books for a retail bookstore 
while in college. The owners of three local stores -- Bargain Books, Book 
Castle and Dutton's -- generously took him under their wing and schooled him in 
the specifics of the used-book business. Now, as a full-time book scout, he 
regularly supplies more than 25 dealers in the Los Angeles area and earns more 
than $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts looks for different kinds of books for different stores. He knows, for 
instance, that Berkelouw Books in Hollywood always wants books about the South 
Pacific and Australia, in particular. Sifting through thousands of books a 
week, some found at sources he zealously keeps to himself, he makes a 
split-second judgment about whether a particular item is a good title, then 
brings it home to examine more closely at his leisure. He has so many boxes of 
books in his Van Nuys home, he says, "the cars have been evicted from the 
garage." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a great town for book scouting, according to Roberts. The weather is 
such that you can work year-round without fear of chilblains, and there are no 
climate-related perils -- like the humidity -- that destroy so many books in 
the American Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a constant treasure hunt," Roberts says of the book trade. He is always 
on the lookout for desirable books in good condition. On the resale market, he 
reminds, goodness has little or nothing to do with literary merit. The key is 
"the perception of desirability." Thus, he always has his eyes peeled for the 
early works of Stephen King and other guaranteed resellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably find one book a week I can sell for $100, one book a month that I 
can sell for more than $100 and one book every four or five months that I can 
sell for $500 or more," he says. And then sometimes you get lucky.  
</P>
<P>
 Every successful book scout has a story about the big score. Roberts made his 
several years ago at a Thousand Oaks Library sale. He found a copy of "The 
Great Gatsby" inscribed by F. Scott Fitzgerald to a woman he was seeing. 
Roberts paid 50 cents for the book and sold it for $1,700. Had it had a dust 
jacket, which is routinely far more valuable than the book it protects, it 
would have been worth 10 times as much. 
</P>
<P>
 During his daily quest Roberts often has to explain to owners that books are 
not necessarily valuable simply because they are old. And he must often tell a 
disappointed private seller that what he or she thought was a valuable first 
edition is actually a book-club edition good only for reading. (Often the only 
clue, he says, is that the book-club edition will have a dot or other small 
mark in the lower right corner of the back cloth cover.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, Roberts is able to marry his love of film and his love of books. 
He sometimes goes shopping for celebrities who collect books but don't want to 
be bothered at stores. He also gets the occasional call from Disney or one of 
the other studios seeking a particular book for a film or TV project. One 
wanted a volume on orchids, another a book on turn-of-the-century apparatus for 
dispensing of soda water.  
</P>
<P>
 He has also begun working with art directors who want a library full of comely 
books or even a collection that reflects a particular character. Asked to 
provide a library, circa 1978, for a college-educated feminist who loves the 
outdoors, Roberts delivered books on backpacking, healthy eating and a 
collection of essays by Gloria Steinem. 
</P>
<P>
 Book scouting is more than a profession for Roberts. He is married to 
actress/comedian Caden McCort, whom he met at a garage sale -- "over books." 
And he has the sense, whenever he rescues a book from the mechanized jaws of 
the trash truck, that he is performing a cultural service. "If you don't take 
care of these books, they'll be lost for all eternity."

STEADILY UPBEAT; * VETERAN DRUMMER SHERMAN FERGUSON LOVES BEING A JAZZ 
MUSICIAN. HIS PEERS SAY THAT PLEASURE INFUSES HIS PLAYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As guitarist Kenny Burrell stood on the stage of the Jazz Bakery recently, 
playing a bubbling version of Blue Mitchell's "Funji Mama," drum mer Sherman 
Ferguson sat behind him, firm yet not rigid, smiling as he provided an array of 
pulsating drum beats that made the number dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, 49, is a drum vet who has served 30 years on jazz's front lines, 
giving a rhythmic boost to such greats as Burrell, Jimmy Rushing, Joe Williams, 
Bud Shank, Eddie Harris, Pat Martino, Teddy Edwards, Jimmy Smith, Ernie Andrews 
and many, many more. Ferguson has made more than 60 recordings, among them 
Shank's "New Bud Shank Sextet" (Candid) and guitarist Martino's "Consciousness" 
(Muse). 
</P>
<P>
 The drummer leads a trio with organist Bill Heid and guitarist Frank Potenza 
on Thursday at Chadney's. Acclaimed by other musicians for the joyful nature of 
his accompaniment, or as they put it, his "happy time," Ferguson says his 
musical style is simply a reflection of his upbeat personality and his pleasure 
at being able to make a living playing jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people ask me what I do, I don't tell them I'm a musician, I say I'm a 
jazz musician," he says. "I'm proud of it. I'd wear it as a statement on my 
forehead if I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching jazz drummers do their thing in small groups can be somewhat 
baffling. The drummer sits behind a battery of percussive items -- drums large 
and small, glowing brass cymbals -- and bangs, or taps, away, delivering the 
energy that spurs a soloist forward -- energy, which in conjunction with the 
bassist, offers the rhythmic glue that holds a jazz performance together. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all," Ferguson explains, "I'm supposed to keep steady time -- not 
let the beat speed up or slow down. This is where I have to work with the bass 
player, who is like my dancing partner, because if we don't hear the beat in 
the same place," the rhythm is going to be as awkward as a couple who don't 
dance well together. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Ferguson's creative approach to working within the band and 
interacting with the soloist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "First, I play melodically," he says. "I play the tune all the time; I'm 
singing the melody in my head. Then I'm responsive: I like to play off people. 
If someone, like Kenny, plays an idea, I want to offer something that 
complements that idea -- an accent, a drum or cymbal color -- or that is 
conversational. I want to stimulate the person in the spotlight without getting 
in their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm playing with the audience, too, playing for, and with, them. I want 
them to see what's going on between the musicians, so they might say, 'Hey, 
they're really into something,' appreciate what we're doing, like watching a 
well-turned double play" in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 This sensitive style is appreciated by other drummers too, among them Herb 
Graham Jr., co-leader of the solid band, the B Sharp Jazz Quartet. "Sherman 
always plays so economically, but he's so musical," Graham says. "I learn 
something when I hear him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's combo at Chadney's features Detroit resident Heid, who plays the 
Hammond B-3 in his hometown but will use synthesized keyboards during his Los 
Angeles sojourn to conjure up the floating swirls of sound that listeners 
associate with the jazz organ. "This guy can play. He's bad," says Ferguson. 
"He's a white guy who can play with some ham hocks and greens. He's greasy," 
the drummer says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ferguson, playing with Heid recalled his early years. A Philadelphia 
native, Ferguson used to travel from there to Atlantic City, N.J., playing with 
such renowned organists as Don Patterson, Charles Earland, Larry Young and 
Richard (Groove) Holmes.  
</P>
<P>
 He started playing drums at age 12 and was a working professional a few years 
later. He backed scores of name musicians in Philadelphia -- and for a year, in 
New York, before moving to Los Angeles in 1976, where he's been consistently 
active. The drummer currently spends most of his time working with Williams, 
Burrell, Shank and Benny Carter. He's also concentrating on teaching at a 
studio he's set up in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to teach young players to play melodically, to be musical," he says. 
"I want to give back to the music the way that people have shared it with me."

CONCERT CROSSES BORDERS; * TRIO NEOS WILL PRESENT WORKS BY U.S., PUERTO RICAN 
AND MEXICAN COMPOSERS IN A QUAKE RELIEF BENEFIT FOR CSUN STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For bassoonist Wendy Holdaway, there's some sense to the scheduling of her 
Trio Neos ensemble as the first classical music con cert sponsored by Cal State 
Northridge since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The American-born musician was already living and working in Mexico City when 
an 8.1-magnitude quake there Sept. 19, 1985 -- followed by a 7.3 quake a day 
later -- destroyed buildings and killed as many as 10,000 people. "I definitely 
have sympathy for anyone who has been through a major earthquake," Holdaway 
said, speaking by phone from the Mexican capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Her trio's Saturday performance of contemporary music from both sides of the 
border will not be on the CSUN campus as originally scheduled, but at Pierce 
College's Recital Hall in Woodland Hills. (Seismic damage to CSUN structures 
will keep live music out of the school's Recital Hall for an indefinite 
period.) 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the performance will be directed toward student earthquake 
relief, said William Toutant, associate dean for the CSUN School of the Arts. 
"A lot of music students were affected by that quake," he said. "Things are 
more difficult because there are no practice facilities on campus. Some of them 
lost their homes or cars." 
</P>
<P>
 The concert will be just one stop on a busy tour designed to foster cultural 
exchange between the United States and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Trio Neos will perform chamber music by U.S., Mexican and Puerto Rican 
composers. "We're doing this to try and cross some of these borders," said 
Holdaway, 38. "It's such a shame that between Mexico and the United States 
there exist tremendous cultural frontiers." 
</P>
<P>
 When Trio Neos was first established in 1986, the ensemble regularly sampled 
selections from the broader chamber music repertoire. But it began to find a 
preoccupation with contemporary Latin American music rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 That was particularly obvious during 1990 and 1991, when Trio Neos toured the 
United States in tandem with the "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" 
exhibition, which landed at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in October, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of that, there has been a tremendous outpouring of interest," she 
said. "People weren't even really aware that Mexico had music, or that there 
was a lot going on down here." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the group performed an all-Mexican concert at Carnegie Hall in 
New York and has released two albums of contemporary Mexican and Latin American 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the trio's members are Mexican-born musicians, though all live and 
perform there now. Clarinetist Eleanor Weingartner, 32, is from San Francisco. 
And pianist Ana Maria Tradatti, 44, comes from Cordova, Argentina. Like 
Holdaway, she is a member of Mexico's National Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Holdaway, who grew up in Oceanside, and attended the New England Conservatory 
of Music in Boston, first arrived in Mexico in 1982. "I thought I would come 
down here for a couple of years of experience and leave," she said. "Mexico 
really gets its hooks into you. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very vibrant place," she added. "There is so much going on here. In 
Mexico City alone, there are five full-time orchestras, and the music scene in 
the United States is pretty grim right now. A lot of orchestras are folding." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the works set for the CSUN concert is "Four Characteristic Pieces," 
composed by Toutant, who first met the members of Trio Neos when they first 
performed at CSUN in association with the "Splendors of Thirty Centuries" 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so impressed with them that I offered to write a piece for them," said 
Toutant, who traveled from Mexico City last May for the premiere of his work. 
"They are terrific musicians. They are tremendous supporters of contemporary 
composers. And they put a lot of care into everything they perform." WHERE AND 
WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: Trio Neos at Music Room 3400, Pierce College, Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 8 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $6.50 general admission, $3.50 students and seniors.

ON TRAIL OF PERFECT SOLUTION; * A GROUP CALLED SINGLE PARENT HIKERS LETS PEOPLE 
ENJOY THE OUTDOORS WHILE IT FURNISHES PLAYMATES FOR THEIR CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA HALLET, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Lisa Hallett is a Laguna Niguel writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Roger Haft and his ex-wife divorced, she got custody of the friends with 
children. And having someone for your offspring to play with when they're 
staying with you on your designated days is probably something that doesn't 
occur to most parents during a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Haft found his solution in Single Parent Hikers, a nonprofit group of single 
parents and their children, whose common denominator is being part of 
non-nuclear households and having unabashed pleasure in spending time outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was formed about four years ago by some hiking enthusiasts, and Haft 
assumed leadership a year or so later. Haft and a few other active participants 
have built the group to about 180 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 50% of its members are from the San Fernando Valley, says Therese 
Schwartz, of Encino and the group's vice president. A few come from as far away 
as Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Single Parent Hikers have something going almost every weekend. Hiking 
destinations have included Orcutt Ranch in Canoga Park, Balboa Park in Encino, 
Malibu Creek State Park in Malibu and various sites in the local mountains. An 
orienteering expedition will be held at 10 a.m. Sunday at Griffith Park. 
(Orienteering refers to a hike that uses a topographical or detailed map. 
Participants must find a series of checkpoints or flags that have been 
indicated on the map.) The group also visits cultural establishments, as long 
as there is some walking and outdoor activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly was a thousand times more fun going to the Natural History 
Museum with 30 other kids and having a picnic on the ground than it would have 
been had I taken my sons there alone," says James David Weinstock, a member and 
divorced father from Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 For many members, Single Parent Hikers is their first experience with hiking, 
but major equipment isn't necessary. A sturdy pair of running shoes, long pants 
to protect against poison oak, poison ivy or brush and a knapsack for lunch and 
essentials are all a hiker needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once in a while someone will show up, and you have to tell them their shoes 
may not work very well. But for the most part, these are people who have some 
affinity for the outdoors. A lot of times on our camping trips we'll find 
people are first-time campers. But I don't think we've ever had anyone 
discouraged by the rigors of camping," Haft says. 
</P>
<P>
 Haft and Schwartz put the male-female ratio at about 50-50. Some events, like 
a not-so-strenuous walk through Descanso Gardens in La Canada, bring out the 
female members, whereas outings in the snow or on more rugged terrain attract 
more fathers and children. Parents range from about 25 to 50, and most of the 
children are under 10, including many preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Usually two hikes are embarked on once everyone has arrived at the spot 
designated in the organization's newsletter. A shorter one is planned for small 
children, followed by a longer, more arduous venture for older kids and more 
experienced hikers. Picnics break up the two hikes and give children and 
parents time to hang out together. 
</P>
<P>
 Hikes are staggered to take place Saturdays or Sundays. "Some parents only 
have their kids on Saturdays or Sundays, while others have their kids every 
other week," Haft says. 
</P>
<P>
 Socializing with those in the same boat is a draw for Fernando Serrano of 
Encino, who has two daughters, ages 10 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "There don't seem to be many support systems out there for single fathers," 
Serrano says. "This group offers a good mix of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Haft, of Venice, looked into other single-parents groups before his 
involvement with Single Parent Hikers. "The other things I found didn't really 
work for me and didn't seem to provide interaction between parents and kids. 
They seemed to have more of a 'single's club' atmosphere. While we've had a 
couple of marriages that have occurred as a result of our group, it's not the 
major thrust." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz says, "It was great to find a group where I could actually be with my 
daughter and with other people who weren't couples. . . . "It feels so good to 
have a group with which I can identify." WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: Single Parent Hikers join the L. A. Orienteering Club for a hike in 
Griffith Park.

 Location: Griffith Park, Vermont Avenue north entrance. Group will meet in 
parking lot opposite the Greek Theater.

A DAY AT THE RACES; * SANTA ANITA PARK IN ARCADIA OFFERS PLENTY FOR FAMILIES TO 
SEE AND DO BEFORE THE ANNOUNCER CALLS, 'THEY'RE OFF!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There's a place to take the kids that's a combination amusement park, animal 
viewing area, picnic site and playground -- but it's actually designed for 
adults. It's Santa Anita Park, where the thoroughbreds race. 
</P>
<P>
 Activities start early at Santa Anita: Beginning at 7:30 a.m., families can 
come any day of the week to watch the horses work out. They'll see America's 
premier jockeys, such as Gary Stevens or Kent Desormeaux, riding the top horses 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In amusement park fashion, kids and adults can take a 12-minute tram ride 
through the stable area, which is otherwise closed to the public. On the tram, 
which operates between 8 and 9:15 a.m. every Saturday and Sunday, visitors can 
glimpse the routine caring of the 2,000-plus horses stabled at Santa Anita as 
they are washed, walked, examined, groomed, saddled, brushed and ridden. 
</P>
<P>
 You may see veterinarians and jockeys, plus get a glimpse of some of the 800 
to 900 men and women who live in stable-area housing facilities and dine in the 
recently renovated cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to horses, there are cats, dogs, goats, chickens and parrots. 
"It's like a small barnyard here," said tram guide Nancy Carbajal. "The cats 
help keep the rodent population down, and the goats keep the horses company. 
The roosters crow in the morning, and I don't know why there are parrots," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tram leaves from the owners' and trainers' parking lot near Clockers' 
Corner every 15 minutes. The ride is free, and passengers will often stay for a 
second tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Clockers' Corner is the morning gathering place for owners, trainers and 
jockeys. Continental breakfasts are available daily, and visitors can have a 
doughnut and hot chocolate or hot coffee to brace against the cold morning air 
as they stand near the track to watch the thoroughbreds work. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, an announcer alerts the crowd, which on busy days grows to about 
300, to popular riders and horses. 
</P>
<P>
 On racing days, complete breakfasts are served by the track from 7:30 to 9:30 
a.m. at Clockers' Corner. The menu includes such racing fare as the Churchill 
Downs (sausage biscuit sandwich for $1.75) or the Ascot (fried egg sandwich for 
$2.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Children can get a close look at horses by visiting the hackneys, the 
high-stepping horses that pull the black carriages used to transport officials 
between races. The hackneys are stabled near the racing office and can be 
viewed whenever the park is open. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight hackneys, which the park calls the "Rolls-Royces of carriage 
horses," start getting groomed and tacked about 10:30 a.m. on race days and are 
on the track by noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The playground, called "Anita Chiquita," is on the infield area of the 
310-acre park. In the afternoons when the play area gets busy during the races, 
there is a supervisor -- sometimes there are two or more, depending on demand 
-- to ensure that the children play safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rules of safety are enforced at the playground," said Mary Saenz, a Santa 
Anita spokeswoman, "so if the merry-go-round is going too fast, the supervisor 
will stop it, but she's not there to be a baby-sitter." 
</P>
<P>
 The playground has colorful slides, swings, a geometric climbing dome, a 
merry-go-round and a climbing fort with bridges and observation platforms. The 
play area is covered with a safety-cushioned, rubberized mat. 
</P>
<P>
 Picnicking is available on a large grassy area near the playground. Visitors 
can bring lunches into the park. Santa Anita's only restrictions are no glass 
or alcoholic beverages. A number of concession stands with food and drink are 
also available. 
</P>
<P>
 For a closer look at real thoroughbreds, children can visit the paddock area 
to watch the horses being saddled and the jockeys mounting them before each 
race. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: Behind the scenes at Santa Anita Park, Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Off the 210 Freeway at Baldwin Avenue or Santa Anita Avenue; follow 
the signs to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Open daily from 7:30 to 10 a.m. for workouts; reopens at 10:30 a.m. for 
racing, which starts at 12:30 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: Parking and admission are free from 7:30 to 10 a.m. After 10:30 a.m., 
parking is $3 and admission starts at $3. Children under 17 are free with an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Call: (818) 574-RACE.

SLAPPED SILLY ON THE SLOPES; * BUMPS AND BRUISES ARE A GIVEN FOR ANY ADULT WHO 
TRIES LEARNING THE YOUTH- DRIVEN SPORT OF SNOW BOARDING. BUT A FEW SECRETS WILL 
MAKE IT EASIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike and Don try to figure it out on their own. With rented snowboards 
underfoot, they grab a chairlift to the mid-heights of Mammoth Mountain and 
begin their descent. Twenty minutes later, sore and exhausted, they tumble to 
the bottom. "Nightmare" is the word they use to describe the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're taking a lesson, which is where I join in. Unlike these two law 
students -- whose names have been changed to protect their egos -- I have been 
warned about learning to snowboard on my own. This is what everyone says: You 
can teach yourself to board in one day, but it will be a hellish day of bumps 
and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem for a 14-year-old. Snowboarding is, after all, a sport of the young 
with its snow slang and rock 'n' roll fashions, its ultra-baggy grunge with 
dangling jester beanies and big gloves. And there are the wild acrobatics. 
Inverted aerials. Riding fakie. Grabbing mute. But Mike and Don aren't 
teen-agers. At this point, they'd settle for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 As for me, I'm 32 and I had enough trouble putting on my snowboard boots, 
which mysteriously feature laces on the inside and outside. Like many aspects 
of the sport, it is difficult to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce, the instructor who shows up for our beginner's lesson, smiles and nods. 
Snowboarding is a little easier, he says, if you learn a few secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret No. 1: Beginners look spastic. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson begins on flat ground. My front leg is strapped to my board. My 
back leg remains free to provide push. Learning to walk in this way, I stumble 
and slip, arms waggling. Mike and Don suffer a likewise fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry," Bruce assures us, smiling. He smiles a lot. "You're doing 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Next he teaches us to fall, curling into a ball and keeping our fists clenched 
to prevent broken wrists. The technique comes in handy as we wobble through a 
half-dozen practice slides. Secret No. 2: The trick to snowboarding involves a 
delicate blend of balance, shifting hips and twisting shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 As I said, it's difficult to explain. We must lean perilously over the nose of 
our boards. The effort is made more harrowing by the fact that our feet are 
locked into place. Wherever the board goes, we go. And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bruce demonstrates, he looks surfer-cool with arms outstretched, tilting 
his body at supple angles against the force of gravity. When we try, Don 
collides with Mike and nearly wrecks his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, minutes later, the four of us are riding the chairlift. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perfect day for learning," Bruce says. "It's warm so the snow will be softer 
when you fall." 
</P>
<P>
 He surfs cleanly off the lift while we struggle to stay upright. After such a 
shaky start, we strap our back feet onto our boards. It's time to go downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret No. 3: Your butt gets as cold as an ice cube. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because you spend a good deal of time lying on the snow, struggling to 
get up. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first slide-tumble down the bunny hill is pure slapstick, with every twist 
and spill imaginable. I shout. Mike mumbles. Don slaps his hat against the snow 
in frustration. At least the frozen ground produces a numbness that allows us 
to ignore multiple contusions that might otherwise send us to a soft chair in 
the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bottom of the hill, we encounter another beginner, a young woman 
sitting near the lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have the same look," she says. "Like we've been beaten." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike tells her that his right buttock is particularly sore. She complains 
about her left side. My pain is equally distributed. We curse the madman who 
invented this sport -- Sherman Poppen of Muskegon, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the people at Transworld Snowboarding magazine, Poppen developed 
a crude precursor to the snowboard in 1965. His "snurfer" was fashioned of wood 
with a rope attached to the nose. Riders held on for dear life as they sailed 
downhill. Poppen sold a million of these contraptions over the course of 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's snowboards look high-tech by comparison. Their wooden cores are 
encased in sheets of aluminum or plastic and coated with fiberglass or Kevlar 
fabric. The edges are capped with metal for carving turns. Gone is the nose 
rope. And the boards are specialized, some stiff and narrow for high-speed 
slaloms, others wide and flexible for the kind of brazen acrobatics that make 
the sport look deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret No. 4: Snowboarding is no more dangerous than skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 That's according to an Australian study cited in a recent issue of Health 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 I chant this, a mantra, throughout my first bumbling day. But another 
statistic interrupts. Snowboarding is a young man's pursuit. Fran Richards of 
Transworld Snowboarding says that among the estimated 1.8 million boarders 
nationwide, the vast majority are under 20. Such youth explains the sport's 
reputation for obnoxious devotees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken all the 17-year-olds who were jerks on skis and we've put them on 
snowboards," Richards says. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of obnoxious skiers remain on the slopes, of course. And as the first 
generation of snowboarders matures, the sport has earned respect for its 
gracefully carved turns and balletic aerials, maneuvers learned through years 
of sometimes bruising experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys can do that stuff, too," Bruce tells us at the lesson's end. "Just 
keep at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike nods. Stubbornness has got the best of him as he vows to return with his 
board the following morning. Don is already shuffling toward the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret No. 5: Those who snowboard and ski say snowboarding is harder to learn 
at first but easier to improve at thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you're over the first-day hump, you can become an intermediate much more 
rapidly," Richards says. "That's why the sport has taken off." 
</P>
<P>
 So I, too, venture out a second day, allowing a wave of enthusiasm to mask the 
pain of battered muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 On my first run, tempting fate and the laws of physics, I use scant experience 
to surf fast across the snow and end up taking a hard fall. My legs twist in 
inhuman ways. My sunglasses fly through the air. My girlfriend, following on 
skis, scans the hillside for a medic. 
</P>
<P>
 But I get up. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something to this sport, something beyond the repetitious humiliation 
and self-flagellation, something that keeps me going. And by midmorning, I'm 
negotiating the intermediate slopes in a style that is upright, if not pretty. 
Even better, my butt stays warm. 
</P>
<P>
 I am surviving. I am snowboarding. I know a few secrets.

THE CULINARY LIBRARY; * JANET JARVITS' BOOKSTORE IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE VALLEY 
ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO COOKBOOKS. IT'S A CORNUCOPIA OF TITLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Janet Jarvits realized her dreams were getting too big for her when she 
couldn't sleep nights. It wasn't because she was anxious about the future, but 
rather that she was losing valuable living space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had books everywhere," Jarvits recalls. "I could barely get around my 
living room and kitchen. I had to move books off my bed at night to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvits cleaned up her room last May, when she opened the only bookstore in 
the San Fernando Valley area entirely devoted to the best-selling books of all 
time: cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love cookbooks," Jarvits says. "I know chefs who read them in bed at 
nights like they would a novel." 
</P>
<P>
 Browsing through Jarvits' tiny store on South San Fernando Boulevard near 
Angeleno Avenue in Burbank is like taking a walk through time and culture. You 
can imagine Julia Child enjoying "Cooking as Therapy -- How to Keep Your 
Souffle Up," or Wolfgang Puck engrossed with "The Lewd Food Book of 
Aphrodisiacs." 
</P>
<P>
 After recently acquiring nearly 10,000 books from the private collection of 
chef and author Helen E. Brown, Jarvits, 27, has made her used-book store a 
cornucopia of titles and subjects. She's got everything from the simple 
(traditional Betty Crocker) to the ridiculous ("How to Cook for Your Cat") to 
the sublime ("Foods From Bible Days"). If we eat it, she's got it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvits describes the three types of customers she draws. "A lot of people 
want a specific book. They'll say, 'My mother used this book, do you have it?' 
" Browsers come in just to look. And people researching a subject come in for 
help. "Literary books like 'The Fifteenth Century Cookery Book' or 'Dining with 
Sherlock Holmes' key into specific periods by how people ate," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvits, who graduated from Occidental College with a degree in English 
literature, says her love of cookbooks comes more from a historical and 
sociological bent, rather than a culinary one. One of her favorite books is 
"The Anthropologist's Cookbook," a field guide to what native people such as 
Pygmies and aborigines ate centuries ago and eat today.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's very comfortable in Janet's store; it's not stuffy," says Susan Staples, 
a cookbook collector. Jarvits located for Staples the rare English version of 
"The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook" that includes the famous unedited "Hash Brownie" 
recipe. "It was signed too!" Staples exclaims. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did Jarvits become the curator of lost cookbooks?  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't plan this at all," she says with a laugh. After graduating from 
college in 1988, Jarvits worked at a publishing house, but when the company 
moved out of the area, she found a job at Bond Street Books, which is two doors 
down from her own store. Here she discovered her passion. "Little by little, I 
realized I enjoyed talking with the customers about older books," she 
remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point for her came when a colleague made her a deal she couldn't 
refuse -- 40 boxes of books from a recent auction, for only $200. In the 
collection there were enough cookbooks for her to start the library in her 
bedroom. That was four years and thousands of books ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always fun going into Janet's store," says Kathleen Scopaz, a student at 
the Westlake Culinary Institute. Scopaz showed Jarvits her instructor's 
suggested reading list, with her own added selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a huge list, and Janet had all but two of the books," Scopaz says. "I 
was amazed. And her prices are good." Jarvits says her prices are generally 20% 
lower than other used-book stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvits offers free cookbook searches for obscure out-of-print books, having 
developed an intricate computerized cross-reference system. Once a month she'll 
attend various book and antiquarian fairs, searching for customer requests, 
re-establishing ties with her book-dealer friends and increasing her own 
store's inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvits accepts trade-ins for credit, although most customers leave with as 
many books as they came with. She also runs a mail-order service with quarterly 
catalogues describing additions to her library, and has 400 people on the 
mailing list, she says. WHERE AND WHEN

RESTAURANT REVIEW; MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE; * TRIBECA IN ENCINO OFFERS AN 
ECLECTIC MENU, BUT THE KITCHEN IS PROBABLY BEST AT PREPARING AMERICAN GRILL 
ITEMS.

<P>
 Tribeca stands for Triangle Below Canal (Street), the Manhattan neighborhood 
where struggling artists rub elbows with movers and shakers from New York's 
financial district. It's also the name of a popular Beverly Hills restaurant, 
which has opened a branch in Encino's Courtyard Shops. 
</P>
<P>
 It picked a struggler's sort of location. The previous occupant, Broadway 
Deli, lasted only a couple of months here. Tribeca's owners have refurbished 
this long, narrow space with translucent amber lampshades, odd-looking floral 
print upholstery and lots of stained oak, but the concept does not feel 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 The main dining area (separate from the bar, where about half the seating is 
located) has a quaint structure: tables out in the middle of the room flanked 
by booths on one side and an odd series of purely decorative French doors on 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the spacious bar area, it's still struggling with the question of 
whether it's really a bar or a dining room. The area is attractively done, but 
the table arrangement -- about 20 undersized tables furnished with handsome, 
hard-backed chairs -- is a problem. It isn't quite comfortable or romantic 
enough for a fine dining establishment, so the main dining area fills up first, 
often leaving patrons literally on the outside looking in. 
</P>
<P>
 To judge from the menu, Tribeca wants to be many things. It's an easygoing 
pizza and pasta place; no, it's an upscale American grill; no, it's a casual 
restaurant for salads and sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, what you eat here is likely to be a function of the time of day. 
At lunch, everyone seems to be eating entree salads such as tuna Nicoise and 
Caesar with grilled chicken, or nibbling on sandwiches like blackened turkey 
loaf and salmon melt. In the evening, people go for things like crab cakes, 
shrimp melts and pizzas, perhaps finishing off with a pasta or something from 
the grill. 
</P>
<P>
 One appetizer that defies any equation for this restaurant is the California 
roll of marinated salmon. It's Osaka-style sushi, essentially, meaning that the 
fish is wrapped around the outside of the rice roll. And it's quite well done, 
too -- four big pieces served with a pile of fresh ginger and cucumber.  
</P>
<P>
 The miniature Maryland crab cakes that made the Beverly Hills Tribeca famous 
are delicious as well, if on the salty side. They come two to an order: tiny, 
crisp and golden brown, atop a wonderful Creole remoulade sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The bubbly-crusted appetizer-size pizzas are fine as long as they don't come 
to the party overdressed. Spicy chicken pizza, for instance, adds black beans, 
jalapenos and white corn to the mix and would be better off with fewer 
ingredients. So would the barbecued chicken pizza, which is mostly chicken and 
barbecue sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The sandwiches, made with good fresh breads (Tribeca has its own bakery), also 
tend to have one ingredient too many. Salmon melt, for instance, includes 
avocado, and sun-dried tomato sauce on a dill roll, with sliced cheese melted 
over the salmon, cheeseburger fashion. Whew. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen is probably at its best during the evening, when it cooks up solid 
American grill items. I've had an absolutely terrific piece of swordfish, 
wonderfully firm and tender, just slightly browned with a sauce of Roma tomato, 
basil, olive oil and capers.  
</P>
<P>
 Blackened anything has become a cliche, but Tribeca's blackened prime rib is 
different. It's a revelation -- juicy and complex, crusted with a symphony of 
hot spices. 
</P>
<P>
 And by all means save room for Tribeca's desserts. I challenge anyone to 
choose between the unusual pear shortcake, the tart plum cobbler with crunchy 
streusel topping and vanilla bean ice cream, or the bittersweet cappuccino 
creme brulee.  
</P>
<P>
 Or my favorite, banana cream pie with a brownie crust. Getting through one of 
these is no struggle at all. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>

SIX AIRLINES SETTLE SUIT OVER FARES; TRANSPORTATION: THEY HAD BEEN CHARGED BY 
JUSTICE DEPT. WITH INFLATING TICKET PRICES BY UP TO $1.9 BILLION. CONSENT 
DECREE LIMITS USE OF A JOINTLY OWNED COMPUTERIZED TICKET RESERVATION SYSTEM.

<P>
 Six major airlines on Thursday agreed to permanently change their pricing 
practices to settle a federal lawsuit charging them with illegally raising air 
fares, in a scheme that investigators say inflated ticket prices by up to $1.9 
billion between 1988 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which the Justice Department filed in December, 1992, charged the 
airlines with conspiring to fix air fares through the misuse of a computerized 
ticket reservation system operated by the Airline Tariff Publishing Co., which 
is jointly owned by the airlines and known as ATP. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airlines used the ATP fare dissemination system to carry on conversations 
just as direct and detailed as those traditionally conducted by conspirators 
over the telephone or in hotel rooms," Assistant Atty. Gen. Anne K. Bingaman 
said in a statement Thursday. "Although their method was novel, their conduct 
amounted to price fixing, plain and simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice officials said they found more than 50 separate incidents of price 
fixing over hundreds of routes. In one case, fares between Chicago and Dallas 
were raised by as much as $138 as a result of the airline practice, the 
government said.  
</P>
<P>
 The six airlines involved in the Justice Department settlement are Alaska 
Airlines, American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest 
Airlines and Trans World Airlines. None of the six admitted guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates hailed the settlement Thursday as one that will let 
airlines know their pricing practices are under close scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the agreement is not likely to result in immediate changes for the 
traveling public because the six airlines have been abiding by the provisions 
of the settlement more than a year while vowing to fight the Justice Department 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government's consent decree, which still must be approved by a federal 
judge, ends the dispute and assures air travelers that the new system for 
publicizing fares and making ticket reservations will become permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the guidelines agreed to on Thursday, new fares must be available for 
sale when filed with the ATP, denying airlines the chance of signaling plans to 
competitors, the Justice Department said. In addition, airlines can not say 
when a fare -- including discounts -- will expire unless the information 
already has been advertised in newspapers or other general interest media. 
</P>
<P>
 Two airlines -- United Airlines and USAir -- also have been following the new 
rules after entering into a consent degree to settle the charges in December, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlines at that time also agreed to settle a separate class-action 
lawsuit, which was based on the Justice Department's investigation, by planning 
to issue nearly $500 million in airline ticket vouchers to travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Used as an electronic clearinghouse, the ATP digests and organizes the massive 
amounts of fare information supplied by individual airlines. Then the 
information is distributed to airline reservations systems, which are used by 
travel agents and carriers to reserve and buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 But during a three-year-long probe, the Justice Department said it found 
evidence that the airlines were using the system to "float trial-balloon price 
increases, make and receive counter proposals, and reach consensus on the 
amount and timing of price increases or the removal of discounts." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, an airline might file a proposed fare cut in ATP only to withdraw 
the change if other carriers failed to go along, federal investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, airlines that had filed plans to cuts fares sometimes met with 
retaliation by competitors, which threatened to file even deeper discounts in 
the ATP. That would force the fare-cutting airline to drop its proposed 
discount. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal guidelines were designed to prevent these incidents. However, one 
element of the settlement had triggered a wave of protest from travel agents 
and consumer advocates. By forbidding airlines from specifying when a sale 
would end, consumers might end up missing out on discounts and end up paying 
higher fares, travel observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 But few consumers have complained about paying higher fares as a result of the 
changes, travel agents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great fear was totally unwarranted," said travel agency president Thomas 
Nulty. "The airlines have been good about advertising their sales, and 
customers are adapting well. I can't think of a single problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But some say the airlines have found loopholes within the new Justice 
Department guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares magazines, notes that airlines have filed 
fare increases on the weekend -- when business is very slow -- and later drop 
the increase by Monday when other carriers have not followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way the program will truly work is to disallow fare increases over 
the weekend," Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also doubt whether the Justice Department guidelines will lead to lower 
air fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to say now whether any airline that had been precluded (from 
offering) a $99 fare will now offer the discount and consumers will save 
money," said Con Hitchcock, an aviation specialist with Washington, D.C.-based 
Public Citizen, consumer advocate Ralph Nader's group. 
</P>
<P>
 * AIRLINE PACT EXTENDED: Reservation-code sharing by British Airways and USAir 
was extended for a year. D1 Explaining the Rules 
</P>
<P>
 Six major airlines settled a federal price fixing suit and agreed to 
permanently adopt guidelines regarding the filing of fares with the Airline 
Tariff Publishing Co.: 
</P>
<P>
 * Any new fare must be available for sale when filed into the computer system. 
Airlines in the past often filed fares that would go into effect at a later 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 * The only time an airline can indicate the beginning and end of a fare sale 
is when the promotion has been widely advertised in newspapers or other general 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
 * What Airline Tariff Publishing Co. does: Jointly owned by the airlines, it 
collects and distributes fare information from participating carriers. The 
information is supplied to airline reservations systems, which are used by 
travel agents and carriers to book and purchase tickets.

CLINTONS TRY TO BUCKLE UP FOR BUMPY REPORT ON TAXES; INQUIRY: SIGNS POINT TO 
UNDERPAYMENTS, DATING BACK 15 YEARS. FIRST LADY, AIDES PLAY DOWN POSSIBLE 
PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As indications grow that the Clintons may have underpaid their income taxes 
for 15 years, the White House has begun a concerted effort to cushion the 
political impact of a new finding of possible financial violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons themselves, along with senior aides, are conceding in public and 
in private that tax complications and mistakes are not uncommon in complex 
business affairs and should not be taken as serious ethical lapses, if that 
proves to be one of the Whitewater investigation's findings about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a series of preemptive acknowledgments 
over the last several days, has said that she and President Clinton may have 
claimed Whitewater-related income tax deductions to which they were not 
entitled. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that as new information about the poorly documented Whitewater real 
estate project is uncovered, it may reveal previously unknown tax liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A soon-to-be-published audit of the Clintons' tax returns from 1980 through 
1992 conducted by Money magazine concluded that the Clintons may have underpaid 
their taxes by $16,358 and that their total liability for the period, including 
Internal Revenue Service interest, could total $45,411. The magazine said about 
$8,000 of the possible underpayment stems from questionable Whitewater 
deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials hope that a strategy of early disclosure and playing 
down the tax issue now will help when special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
issues his report on Whitewater or if news organizations publish evidence of 
financial impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides fear that new disclosures about the Clintons' finances will 
feed a public perception that the Administration suffers from a pattern of 
ethics violations and that the Clintons themselves are untrustworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recent presidents, including Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and George 
Bush, were criticized over problems with taxes and private investments. Former 
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew was driven from office after pleading no contest 
to a federal charge of income tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 While such revelations in themselves have not been fatal to a presidency, they 
tend to reinforce existing perceptions of the character of the officeholder, 
according to political analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 An inadvertent error is likely to be less damaging than a pattern of 
questionable deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A miscalculation or the underreporting of a few thousand is not going to be 
the kind of thing to take down a President. But the problem is that this 
President has ethical clouds hanging over his head, and another one won't do 
him any good," said Stu Rothenberg, publisher of the Political Report, a 
Washington newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be a mistake to dismiss it as 'only' income taxes and 
underreporting," he added. "That underestimates the extent to which the public 
considers taxes a significant factor in their lives. And if they (ordinary 
citizens) had to pay a few thousand, they couldn't get away with just saying 
it's an oversight." 
</P>
<P>
 David E. Kendall, the Clintons' private attorney, is reviewing all of the 
Clintons' tax records and the admittedly incomplete documentation of their 
Whitewater investment in an effort to determine how much they really lost on 
the land deal and whether their tax returns were accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House aide said it now appears that the Clintons may have lost 
less on the Whitewater project than the $68,900 they have been claiming for the 
last two years. The aide, who asked not to be named, said Thursday: "As more 
complete documentation has been assembled, we've had an opportunity to take a 
real hard look (at the Whitewater finances). If that yields different numbers, 
so be it. We don't want to pretend that we have an absolute hard number." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons' Whitewater partner, Arkansas businessman James B. McDougal, has 
said the Clintons lost at most $13,000 on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House aide said that any underpayment of taxes or misreporting of 
the financial condition of Whitewater would be the result of "oversight and 
bookkeeping errors, not a pattern of abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons already have acknowledged taking $2,156 in unjustified tax 
deductions for Whitewater-related interest payments in 1984 and 1985. They 
voluntarily repaid the government $4,000 in back taxes and interest during the 
1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Money magazine study, conducted by Los Angeles tax attorney and former IRS 
tax audit group manager Mary L. Sprouse, found that the Clintons committed 
three "glaring mistakes" in the preparation of their taxes in the 1980s and 
early 1990s: They kept inadequate records, they overestimated the value of many 
of their deductions and they relied too much on their tax preparers. The 
magazine also reviewed Whitewater deductions for 1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, the biggest errors came on poorly documented 
Whitewater deductions of $24,154 for interest payments on three separate loans. 
The study contends that the Clintons probably owe more than $8,000 in 
additional tax because of those questionable deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine also questioned the Clintons' deductions for charitable 
contributions, including $15 for a pair of Bill Clinton's used long underwear, 
$80 for a pair of brown shoes and $30 for three old shower curtains. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoly Redden, the Clintons' Little Rock tax preparer for most of these years, 
declined to discuss her clients' tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidential counselor David Gergen said in an interview that a thorough 
review of the Clintons' finances over the last decade or more could result in a 
relatively small amount of back taxes due. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, if they owe some taxes, they're going to pay the taxes. I don't 
think that's an issue," Gergen said. "If all of this at the end of the day -- 
after tons of ink has been spread across this, and after lots and lots of 
government money is spent -- if at the end of the day there are some minor 
adjustments on the books of Whitewater or whatever it may be to clean up some 
tax questions, I think a lot of us would be asking, what was all that about? 
Was that sound and fury signifying nothing? I think that's a legitimate 
question."

SERIAL RAPIST PAROLED AMID DEATH THREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A notorious serial rapist who confessed to attacking more than 100 women was 
paroled Thursday in the tiny Modoc County town of Alturas, where residents 
promptly threatened to kill him and a judge issued an order seeking to banish 
him from the region. 
</P>
<P>
 State corrections officials said Melvin A. Carter, whose parole has sparked an 
outcry because he served only half of his 25-year sentence, arrived about noon 
at a prison work camp just outside Alturas, an outpost of 3,200 people in 
California's northeastern corner. He will live at the compound under close 
supervision, leaving only when accompanied by a parole agent, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, 49, was initially scheduled to be released in Alameda County, where he 
committed many of his crimes. But public fury and political pressure prompted 
Gov. Pete Wilson to abruptly change that decision and order him set free in "as 
remote a location as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Carter's new neighbors rebelled. Rallying at the Modoc County 
courthouse, more than 1,500 angry people waved hand-lettered signs and said 
that paroling the rapist in Alturas would forever alter life in a town where 
nobody locks the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor obviously believes women in the country don't count as much as 
women in the city," said hairstylist Cherrie Crites. "It's an outrage. . . . 
Instead of being laid back and feeling secure, we've now got to look over our 
shoulder and feel paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
 While some residents worried, others threatened to kill Carter if he shows his 
face in town. Police Chief Larry Pickett, who oversees a force of seven 
officers, said, "Every other fellow I run into tells me he'll blow this guy 
away. Lots of people have guns around here. There's no way we can protect him." 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Ruth Sorensen, meanwhile, tried other means to keep Carter out of 
Alturas, obtaining a court order that seeks to block the state from housing him 
there. Sorensen argued that the state violated its own rules, which require 
parolees go to the county where they were convicted unless special 
circumstances exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do whatever necessary to keep Melvin Carter out of Modoc County," 
said Sorensen, who rousted Superior Court Judge Guy Martin Young from the 
shower to obtain the court order first thing Thursday morning. "We refuse to be 
a dumping ground for another county's hazardous waste." 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials said their attorneys were studying the order Thursday 
and had not determined its impact. A hearing was set for April 1 in Alturas, 
and until then Carter is likely to remain at the Devil's Garden Conservation 
Camp, seven miles outside of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Each month, the state's prisons release 250 rapists, child molesters and other 
sex offenders, whose time behind bars averages less than 3 1/2 years -- 41.6 
months. Despite such numbers, the parole of Carter and the near-release of 
another serial rapist, Christopher Evans Hubbart, have stirred uproars at 
opposite ends of California this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, residents of Claremont protested after learning that Hubbart, 
believed to be responsible for 50 rapes over 22 years, was to be released 
there. After failing a psychiatric exam, Hubbart was returned to the state 
prison in Chino, where he will probably remain another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, a former engineer, confessed to raping more than 100 women over a 
dozen years, beginning when he moved to California from Colorado in 1968. He 
told police that he targeted neighborhoods near college campuses and searched 
for women who lived alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a jumpsuit and surgical gloves, Carter struck at night, typically 
cutting phone and power lines before raping his victims with a knife at their 
throats. He was dubbed the College Terrace rapist and committed most of his 
known crimes in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Carter was convicted of 12 rapes and sentenced to 25 years in prison. 
He is eligible for release now because laws in effect when he was convicted 
allowed him to reduce his sentence by working and behaving himself. By 
contrast, the new "three strikes and you're out" law sharply restricts some 
inmates' ability to cut their sentences with so-called "good time" credits. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Carter's pending release surfaced last week. Hayward, an East Bay Area 
city, was rumored to be the state's parole destination of choice, and residents 
there quickly staged demonstrations and flooded the governor's office with 
phone calls and faxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Locating him in a community that so closely resembles his 'old hunting 
grounds' is irresponsible at the least and blatantly reckless at worst," Mayor 
Michael Sweeney wrote in a letter to Wilson, noting that Hayward is home to two 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ruckus mushroomed, it caught the eye of state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, 
who is running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Brown declared that 
missteps by Wilson's Department of Corrections had allowed the rapist to go 
free two years early and charged that the governor was all talk and no action 
on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Wilson stepped into the fray. Calling Carter "an animal," he 
ordered him released "out in the wilderness someplace where he will have 
absolutely the least possible opportunity to hurt another young woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, who has long sought tougher prison terms for rapists, called 
Brown's charges "utterly false." He said his office took special steps to 
ensure that Carter's parole is subject to the strictest possible conditions, 
including electronic monitoring, psychiatric evaluations, frequent polygraph 
tests and limits on how far from his parole site he may go. 
</P>
<P>
 Devil's Garden Conservation Camp houses 122 minimum security inmates who are 
nearing their parole dates and work on fire crews and other projects. Christine 
May, a spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections, said Carter will live "as 
a parolee, not an inmate of the camp" and will serve a maximum of three years 
on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Protecting the citizens of Modoc County is a high priority. We want them to 
know we have taken every precaution for their safety," said state Corrections 
Department Director James H. Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 Such assurances did not seem to assuage fears in Alturas, where residents 
forgo conveniences such as shopping malls and fancy hospitals for a sense that 
their children are safe on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Bookkeeper Debbie Mason, a mother of two children, said, "You never lock your 
door in Alturas, and you don't worry about your kids playing outdoors. 
Suddenly, that's going to change, and people are upset. It doesn't seem fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Bernie Richter (R-Chico), who represents Modoc County, said he 
understands Wilson's quandary but believes the governor failed to understand 
the dynamics of a small town. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't release a guy like that here, because he would stand out like 
a sore thumb," said Richter. "Everybody would be aware of his every move, and 
that would completely disrupt life." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's saga closely mirrors the case of Lawrence Singleton, who raped a 
15-year-old girl in 1978 and hacked off her forearms with an ax. Like Carter, 
Singleton had his sentence reduced because he worked and behaved while behind 
bars, and encountered a storm of protest when his parole date came up. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition was so strong that corrections officials were forced to move 
Singleton around Northern California in secrecy. On one occasion, he had to be 
removed under police guard from an apartment after his whereabouts were learned 
and a crowd of 500 surrounded the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Gov. George Deukmejian ordered him housed on the grounds of San 
Quentin prison. His last known address was in Florida, where he was once picked 
up for shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts blame Carter's release on a 1977 law that requires convicts be 
sentenced to a set term, rather than a range of years, such as one to 25. Under 
the system, known as determinate sentencing, the state parole board no longer 
has authority to judge an inmate's suitability for release. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of this law, his release was mandated and there was nothing they 
could do about it," said Jerome H. Skolnick, a professor of law and social 
policy at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall. "We need some restructuring of the system. 
Someone who raped 100 women ought to be behind bars for a very, very long 
time."  
</P>
<P>
 Carter's attorney, Tom Nolan of Palo Alto, did not return telephone calls 
Thursday. But last week, he told the San Francisco Examiner that the public 
need not fear his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a threat," Nolan said. "He is very guilt-ridden and remorseful . . . 
and sensitive to community concern." Parole Furor 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of tiny Alturas, in northeastern California, are up in arms over the 
parole of a serial rapist to a state prison camp just outside town. The fate of 
Melvin Carter remains uncertain because a judge ordered him banned from Modoc 
County.

IN SOWETO, DE KLERK PLAYS IT VERY SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Frederik W. de Klerk, who will likely go down in history as this 
country's last white president, has not had an easy time recently campaigning 
for next month's democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been spat upon, hit in the neck with a small stone, grabbed in a headlock 
and drowned out by chanting crowds of angry blacks. A local paper has dubbed 
his effort "Mission: Impossible." His chief opponent, Nelson Mandela, has 
belittled him as a "weakling," a "leper" and "unstable." 
</P>
<P>
 So when De Klerk, head of the ruling National Party, took his campaign 
roadshow to Soweto on Thursday -- his first visit in 3 1/2 years to South 
Africa's largest black township and city -- he took no chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Police helicopters buzzed overhead. Dozens of paramilitary riot troops, 
festooned with tear-gas canisters, guns and flak jackets, manned roadblocks and 
guarded the area with armored vehicles. Others stood stony-faced by a tall 
fence and gate, bristling with razor-sharp barbed wire. Inside, De Klerk's own, 
mostly white security detail kept a tight, nervous circle around him. 
</P>
<P>
 All this was for a polite invitation-only lunch under a huge white tent filled 
largely with several hundred trucked-in black party workers, several dozen 
anxious-looking whites and more than a few beefy plainclothes police in dark 
glasses who tried in vain to occupy the numerous empty tables. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk, a polished politician given to upbeat pronouncements and optimistic 
forecasts, did not try to gloss over his problems in a virtually all black 
semi-urban slum that has become synonymous with the indignities and violence of 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 His support here, he conceded, is underwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there are tens of thousands of votes for the National Party here in 
Soweto," he told the luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Soweto, however, is home to an estimated 4 million blacks. That is almost the 
total number of whites in South Africa. Soweto, an acronym for South West 
Townships, is a 38.6-square-mile sprawl of 32 townships and squatter camps 
built since the 1930s around the dusty yellow mining dumps southwest of 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls have consistently shown that De Klerk's party is unlikely to win more 
than 1% or 2% of the total ballots cast by the estimated 18 million blacks who 
will vote for the first time ever April 26-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites, Indians and Colored voters are expected to give him about 20% of the 
total tally, with Mandela's African National Congress sweeping much of the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, De Klerk promised to "take Soweto by storm" on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be easy," he admitted. "It's a big city, and the ANC is 
very strong. But we are growing and they are shrinking." 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk complained that his black supporters are being intimidated here. And 
many of the blacks at the lunch agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonngani Mngomezulu, 28, a senior organizer for the National Party in Soweto, 
gave a chilling account of the threats against him and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came one time with guns looking for me," he said in an interview. "They 
told my wife they would do to me what they did to my brother in 1984. They 
burned him. Twice. First they necklaced him (put a burning tire around his 
neck) and burned his house. Then, during the funeral, they stopped the hearse 
and burned his casket." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem obviously perplexes De Klerk and his mostly white aides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost feel guilty calling people here asking for support," said one 
well-dressed white woman, a National Party candidate for the provincial 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Even De Klerk's lunch venue, the Ernest Oppenheimer Memorial Park in Jabavu 
township, was not chosen with local sensitivities in mind. The whites who 
helped administer Soweto in the 1970s took a bequest from the father of the 
famed mining magnate to build the park. It was a target in subsequent 
anti-apartheid riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to destroy that park," Queen Mokgopo, a black tour guide, 
complained later. "It's under security all the time. There's all that barbed 
wire. We can't go in there." 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier, when De Klerk's motorcade made two quick roadside stops at a 
Soweto pharmacy and outdoor fruit market, he got a polite, bemused reception -- 
at best. 
</P>
<P>
 A local ANC organizer, who gave his name as Comrade Dougie, explained the 
skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a lion says to you, 'Now I'm normal, I'm a new lion, I'm not going to eat 
you any more,' would you go into its den?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The dual reality of post-apartheid election politics was amply illustrated 
half a mile from De Klerk's lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 There, a hastily organized ANC rally in the open-air Jabulani Amphitheater 
drew about 12,000 exuberant blacks to sing, dance and chant under the scorching 
afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas De Klerk's supporters have been forced to read from cue cards to sing 
"Nkosi Sikelel'i Africa," the call-and-response hymn that was used for years as 
a black liberation anthem and has now been declared one of two national anthems 
for the new South Africa, here it roared as a deafening, shout-out and 
thunder-back that echoed in the still air. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a white tent, the crowd shielded themselves with cardboard campaign 
posters and tattered umbrellas. And rather than red wine and small talk, they 
blared bugles, waved huge ANC flags, thrust their fists in the air and screamed 
in delight when Tokyo Sexwale, a senior ANC leader, led them on-stage in the 
stomping, romping dance known as toyi-toyi.  
</P>
<P>
 While the crowd, mostly schoolchildren and teen-agers, was peaceful, outside 
was a grim reminder of the violence that permeates Soweto politics. Graffiti on 
the wall read, "De Klerk will be killed." 
</P>
<P>
 The president's final affront, perhaps, was the flatbed trucks that carried 
his black supporters home after the lunch. As they rolled past the ANC rally, 
the blacks on the back quickly shed the new National Party sun-visors and flags 
they had been issued, littering the dusty road with the stuff of which campaign 
dreams are made.

FRENCHMAN ON TRIAL FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY; WORLD WAR II: OFFICER IN THE 
PRO-NAZI MILITIA ALLEGEDLY ORDERED JEWS EXECUTED. DEFENSE LIKENS HIM TO 
SCHINDLER. 
</P>

<P>
 Still wrestling with its World War II past, France put Paul Touvier, the 
78-year-old former intelligence chief of the pro-Nazi French militia, on trial 
Thursday in a heavily guarded courthouse for crimes against humanity committed 
half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier -- now a balding, feeble man -- sat quietly in a bulletproof glass 
enclosure as a jury of nine, seven of whom were born after the war, began 
hearing allegations that he ordered the execution of seven Jewish hostages in 
Rillieux-la-Pape, near Lyon, on June 29, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial in Versailles, on the southwest edge of Paris, and the difficult 
legal battle that was waged to bring Touvier to court have touched a raw nerve 
throughout France. 
</P>
<P>
 The country, painfully fractured during World War II by the Nazi-installed 
Vichy government's collaboration with the German occupation, is again divided. 
</P>
<P>
 Many French see the trial, which is expected to last five weeks, as a way to 
finally exorcise the ghosts of the past, allowing the country to celebrate the 
50th anniversary of the D-Day Allied landings in Normandy in June with a clear 
conscience. Only with such a trial, they say, can the country truly heal the 
wounds of its past. 
</P>
<P>
 But others in France see the proceedings, against an elderly man with prostate 
cancer, as a waste of time and taxpayers' money. And they say it is time now to 
forgive, once and for all, their German adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are, by far, the European country that has had the most trouble managing 
and digesting its collective attitude toward World War II," Bertrand 
Poirot-Delpech, of the French Academy, wrote recently. "The Versailles trial 
will not be in vain if the past finally finds its place there." 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier is the first Frenchman to be tried for crimes against humanity, 
although his former boss, Klaus Barbie, the Nazi police chief of Lyon, was 
convicted of crimes against humanity in 1987. Barbie died in a prison hospital 
in Lyon in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 This landmark case, which, like Barbie's, is being filmed for posterity, began 
Thursday with a defense motion to dismiss 33 of 34 plaintiffs in the case, most 
of whom are Holocaust survivors or relatives of the executed Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard Weltzer, a lawyer for one of the civil plaintiffs, argued that Touvier 
"does not want to hear his victims speak." The motion was dismissed by Henri 
Boulard, the presiding judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred people packed the courtroom, including almost 40 lawyers. 
Outside the courthouse, behind barricades manned by more than 100 riot police, 
several dozen relatives of Jews sent to Nazi death camps protested, unfurling 
banners that read: "Touvier-Barbie, Same Fight."  
</P>
<P>
 The protesters argue that France is trying to cover up the occupation 
government's role in the killing of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier was arrested in 1947, but escaped and spent 45 years concealed by 
conservative Roman Catholic priests and monks, mostly in Italy and France, and 
for a time received a regular pension from a Catholic charity. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested in 1989 at a monastery in Nice and released on bail. But he is 
being held in custody during the trial, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier has admitted that he handpicked the men who executed the seven Jews in 
reprisal for the assassination, by Resistance fighters, of the Vichy regime's 
propaganda chief, Philippe Henriot, after the D-Day landing. The victims, ages 
23 to 64, were lined up against a cemetery wall, shot in the back, then in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 But Touvier's attorneys intend to argue that, in selecting seven Jews for 
execution, Touvier saved 93 other Jewish hostages whom the Nazis wanted to kill 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Jacques Tremolet de Villers, has compared Touvier to Oskar 
Schindler, the German industrialist and Nazi party member who saved more than 
1,100 people from death camps. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution, however, along with relatives of the victims as plaintiffs, 
blames Touvier for dozens, if not hundreds, of killings of Resistance fighters. 
And they contend that Touvier was one of 30,000 French militiamen who 
collaborated with the Nazis out of a shared desire to exterminate the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier was twice sentenced to death in absentia after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 He was pardoned in 1971 by then-President Georges Pompidou after appeals from 
Catholic clergy. Asked why he made that decision, Pompidou once said: "Must we 
keep the wounds of national discord eternally bleeding? Has not the moment come 
to cast a veil, to forget those days when the French people hated each other?" 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier, in a pamphlet that appeared in 1979, argued: "All I ever did was to 
protect the French state." 
</P>
<P>
 But another time, cited by the newspaper Le Monde, Touvier confided to a 
friend: "My whole life has been an enormous deception." 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier won an appeals court verdict in 1992 that barred the state from 
putting him on trial for other murders and acts of torture, which were deemed 
to be war crimes and, as such, covered by the statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the execution of the seven Jews qualified as a crime against humanity, 
for which there is no time limit for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 A crime against humanity, in French law, is defined as a crime willingly 
carried out as part of a deliberate policy of genocide. 
</P>
<P>
 Several current and former government officials are on the list of witnesses. 
But the judge said Thursday that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur had indicated 
that he would not testify. Balladur was a middle-level bureaucrat in Pompidou's 
office when the pardon was issued. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 French people were executed as collaborators after the war, often 
after summary trials. Those prosecutions ended in the 1950s as postwar French 
authorities attempted to downplay the activities of the Vichy regime and cast 
the French as a heroic people, betrayed by only a few traitors.

2ND SETTLER AIDED IN MASSACRE, SOLDIERS SAY; ISRAEL: TWO GUARDS ON DUTY SAY 
KILLER CAME WITH A DIFFERENT RIFLE. THEY ALSO ADMIT FIRING INSIDE MOSQUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Israeli soldiers, who were on guard duty at the mosque where a Jewish 
settler massacred about 30 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank last month, 
testified Thursday that the killer came with a rifle, but another settler 
carried the gun actually used in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony before a special Israeli commission investigating the massacre 
threw into serious doubt the Israeli army's assertion that Baruch Goldstein, 
the Brooklyn-born physician from the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba, had 
acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli Army's investigation now appears to have been greatly rushed in 
concluding that the atrocity was, as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin put it, "the 
work of a single lunatic, a mad man," and not a crime planned and executed by 
several people, perhaps members of extremist Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers also acknowledged firing their own weapons inside the mosque at 
the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, contradicting the army's assertions that 
they had only shot in the air outside the shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians have repeatedly asserted that Goldstein was joined by other 
Israelis, assumed from their uniforms to be soldiers, in shooting the rows of 
kneeling men at morning prayers in the Ibrahim Mosque. So far, however, 
Palestinian witnesses have refused to testify before the Israeli commission, 
believing it biased. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli panel had already heard last week that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Goldstein had left a still-unpublished "letter of confession," indicating 
that it was a planned political attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * He had been driven to the shrine that morning by an unidentified man, 
suggesting an accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bag in which he carried more ammunition was found in a room where 13 
Jewish settlers were praying at the time but, mysteriously, none saw him. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony Thursday raised additional questions because it indicated, even 
more strongly, that Goldstein had at least one accomplice in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Israeli military authorities had insisted that Goldstein was armed 
with a Galil, an Israeli-made, full-sized assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sgt. Kobi Yosef, one of the guards on duty, said Goldstein was carrying a 
standard, army-issue, U.S.-made M-16 rifle when he walked past him at 5:20 a.m. 
on Feb. 25. Five minutes later, Yosef continued, another man, also apparently a 
Jewish settler, entered the shrine with a Glilon, a compact Israeli-made rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 What was found next to Goldstein's body, however, and what had been used in 
the massacre -- Israeli military authorities now say -- was the Glilon, a 
smaller cousin of the Galil, modeled on the Soviet AK-47 and unmistakably 
different from an M-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Yosef's testimony, careful and unambiguous, stunned the five-member 
commission, which had been told by top Israeli generals as well as military 
investigators that all evidence showed Goldstein alone had fired upon the 
Muslim worshipers, firing 110 rounds from the Glilon and only from it. (The 
Galil and Glilon use the same ammunition.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you sure?" Chief Justice Meir Shamgar, the commission chairman, asked 
Yosef after nearly a minute of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, as sure as I can be," replied Yosef, who as a member of an Israeli tank 
battalion carries a Glilon himself. "I saw (Goldstein) from a meter away." 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned closely about the man who had carried the Glilon, Yosef said he 
could not identify him. "I saw another settler, a Jew, at least, and I assume a 
settler, carrying a Glilon," Yosef said. "I never saw him before, and I have 
not seen him since. I don't know who he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jews (who pray at the shrine), I know them all because I have been in the 
same place for four months, every morning at the same time," he added. "I know 
them all -- they're regulars. I did not recognize that specific Jew." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein himself was beaten to death by worshipers inside the mosque after he 
had apparently fired more than three magazines at the 500 men and boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Niv Drori, who was on duty with Yosef, testified that he too had seen 
Goldstein come with an M-16 and that another man came later with the Glilon. A 
third guard, Cpl. Erez Elimelech, also said Goldstein carried an M-16 when he 
entered. 
</P>
<P>
 Their platoon commander, 2nd Lt. Rotem Ravivi, testified that when he saw 
Goldstein a few minutes later, he was armed with the Glilon, not an M-16. The 
implication was that Goldstein and the unidentified settler had switched 
weapons inside the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him enter the place (where Jews were praying) carrying a Glilon," 
Ravivi said. "I saw no on else with a Glilon on that day." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravivi said he had spoken briefly with Goldstein, who was in uniform as an 
army reservist, asking whether he was on duty and being told yes. "I asked him 
how he was," Ravivi recounted. "The fact that he was in uniform caught my eye. 
I asked him if he was doing reserve service and he answered 'yes' and kept 
walking." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravivi said he had come to know Goldstein as an "OK guy" during the four 
months his tank unit had been on guard duty at the shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was an officer, I knew he was a doctor," Ravivi said, explaining 
why he was not suspicious of Goldstein despite his membership in Kach, a 
now-banned ultranationalist group. "He had a two-way radio and a weapon from 
the army. I had talked with him quite a few times, and he seemed quite 
reasonable. All that gave me nothing to suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Yosef and Drori also told the commission that they had both fired inside the 
shrine when they heard the shooting and believed it to be an Arab attack on 
Jews. But they insisted that their shots, even those chest-high, did not hit 
any of the fleeing worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 A Palestinian panel, appointed by the Palestine Liberation Organization to 
investigate the massacre independently, said earlier this week that its 
witnesses indicated that at least one man was killed and several more were 
wounded by army gunfire as they tried to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Danny Yatom, the top army commander in the West Bank, had told the 
commission that the soldiers fired only into the air and that no Palestinians 
were wounded or killed by army gunfire near the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yosef said he and Drori at first believed that an Arab terrorist was shooting 
in the shrine and they had fired to prevent his escape. "We wanted to create a 
jam at the door," Yosef said. "We were afraid the shooter, if he was an Arab, 
would come outside . . . and would also hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Yosef said they stopped firing when a wounded man, a Palestinian, staggered 
out. "He was full of blood. We understood that a Jew was firing inside, not an 
Arab," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They then locked the main gate, forcing worshipers to take a longer route to 
another exit to evacuate the wounded. "We made their way longer, but we also 
made our lives longer," Yosef said. "They would have trampled us to death. One 
little boy, who was wounded in the leg, fell and was trampled to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinians in a 
gunfight, the army reported. A Palestinian gunman reportedly fired from his car 
at a passing Israeli patrol on the coastal road in Khan Yunis, according to 
military authorities, and the soldiers shot back, killing him and an Arab 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Protests also erupted at two West Bank universities, Birzeit and Bethlehem, 
where tension has been high ever since the massacre, with soldiers firing tear 
gas and rubber bullets to disperse students, according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 At Birzeit, a traditional hotbed of protest, about 1,000 demonstrating 
students burned tires, barricaded roads and stoned an army outpost to protest 
the killings in Khan Yunis. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said 10 students were injured by rubber bullets, none 
seriously. Troops also fired tear gas and briefly surrounded the campus. The 
two sides reached a truce and the students dispersed. The Smoking Gun? 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli military authorities had insisted gunman Baruch Goldstein was armed 
with a Galil, an Israeli-made, full-sized assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 But two Israeli soldiers testified Thursday that the killer came with an M-16. 
However, a Galil, was found next to the body, military officials now say.

 Nobody just barges into lawyer Michelle Scully's office in downtown San 
Francisco. She keeps her door locked and peeks through a peephole to size up 
visitors before letting anyone pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Scully, 28, has plenty of reason to be security-conscious while on the job. 
Last July, she was wounded and her husband was killed in one of the nation's 
worst outbreaks of workplace violence -- a shooting spree that left nine people 
dead at a high-rise in San Francisco's financial district. 
</P>
<P>
 A preoccupation with crime has swept into America's shops, offices and 
factories. Bloody episodes are prodding workers and employers into action, and 
are spurring government officials to seek solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital nurses and doctors turn their name tags upside-down, or hide them 
altogether, to avoid being identified by potentially dangerous patients. Postal 
workers file reports on colleagues who they fear could fly off the handle. 
Unions now negotiate with management for tighter security much the same way 
they push for better wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers quietly perform criminal records checks to screen out applicants who 
have had serious brushes with the law and who appear violence-prone. Other 
firms give psychological tests to prospective hires -- despite ethical 
questions and uncertainty about the exams' predictive powers. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep tempers from exploding when layoff time comes, more firms help workers 
find new jobs. And, in some cases, managers who hand out pink slips are 
reportedly wearing bullet-proof vests. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're vulnerable, you never know as an executive or manager whether an 
employee will snap and take a shot at you. That's the scary part of being a 
boss," said the owner of one manufacturing company who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, the number of bloody workplace rampages has mounted, 
snaring front-page news coverage and fraying nerves. "The safety and security 
of the work environment is being shattered," said Joseph A. Kinney, executive 
director of the National Safe Workplace Institute in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest reminder occurred Monday when three employees at a Santa Fe Springs 
electronics firm were killed by a recently fired worker who later shot himself 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the U.S. Labor Department, issuing its first major study on the 
topic, reported that homicides accounted for 1,004 work-related deaths in 1992, 
including 144 in California. In addition, the report said homicide was by far 
the leading cause of on-the-job fatalities for women. Including men and women, 
homicide ranked a close second to highway accidents as the most deadly 
workplace hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the toll taken by ordinary street violence, the number of 
sensational workplace murders by disgruntled former employees remains small. 
But those high-profile deaths -- along with hundreds more involving such 
job-related incidents as taxi holdups and police officers slain in the line of 
duty -- have begun to catch the eye of government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts blame the trend on the same social problems blamed for murders in 
society as a whole, especially the widespread availability of guns. They also 
point to rising workplace tensions fueled by massive layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Three bills are pending in the state Legislature aimed at stemming workplace 
violence, including one calling on regulators to scrutinize what all employers 
are doing to protect workers. Until recently, "when an act of violence occurred 
in the workplace, it was considered a police matter," said John Howard, chief 
of Cal/OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent statistics, Howard said, have given safety experts "a lot of 
concern. It's a brand-new ballgame now." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is drawing 
up a strategy of its own to curb workplace violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers, safety specialists and workers are severely hampered in what they 
can do. Tightly limiting access might make workplaces safer, but it usually is 
impractical: Stores must be open to the public, factories must receive 
shipments and police must patrol dangerous neighborhoods. "No workplace is 
totally safe," Howard said. "You can always have an employee who goes berserk." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Fe Springs plant was protected by special door locks that could be 
opened only by punching in a secret five-digit code. That's how the gunman, who 
had been fired 2 1/2 weeks earlier, was able to enter the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Scully concedes there are limits to the precautions that can be taken. 
"I've played the 'what if' game 100,000 times in my head, wondering if there 
was something we could have done to make the outcome different," she said of 
the San Francisco law firm shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the assailant -- who later killed himself -- looked like "a normal 
businessman," said Scully, who is on leave from her job as a lawyer to head the 
San Francisco chapter of the advocacy group Handgun Control Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses generally won't talk about their violence-prevention efforts for 
fear of drawing unwanted attention. However, a small army of psychologists and 
other management consultants claiming expertise in the field have emerged to 
counsel worried employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some employers have begun comprehensive programs to prevent violence. Take, 
for example, Semiconductor Systems Inc. of Fremont, a 135-employee company that 
makes equipment for computer chip manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm champions its policy of "zero tolerance" for violence. "The first 
time somebody shoves or pushes around someone else, they get suspended," said 
Douglas K. Amis, vice president for administration. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Semiconductor Systems fires someone, the company handles it as 
delicately as possible -- to try to avoid inflaming a discharged worker who may 
be violence-prone. All firings are handled by Amis, a licensed therapist with a 
doctorate in education psychology and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make sure that every person who is terminated, whatever the cause, can 
leave with dignity and gets help in their job search," Amis said. "There's no 
reason (in the firing process) to make someone feel like they are some lower 
form of life or a failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the company will augment its program by training its supervisors to look 
out for employees acting oddly, making threats or showing other types of 
bizarre behavior. The idea is to recognize and defuse tense situations before 
they turn violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not in the nature of the crime for someone to just come back and shoot" 
without first giving out warning signals, said Garry Mathiason, a San Francisco 
lawyer who specializes in workplace violence and who is advising Semiconductor 
Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of violence is especially threatening in tense work environments 
such as hospitals, particularly emergency rooms. A 1991 Pennsylvania State 
University study of 1,209 emergency-room registered nurses found that nearly 
one in four had been confronted by people with weapons. And nearly two-thirds 
of those surveyed said they were physically assaulted at least once, including 
36.3% in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk to the general public, they're totally aghast by the numbers. 
But if you talk to people who are in the profession, they're not at all 
surprised," said Beverly Saxton Mahoney, the Penn State assistant professor who 
conducted the study and is a former emergency room nurse herself. She suspects 
the problem is even worse today. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mahoney, the most revealing finding was that 60% of those surveyed 
reported turning their name tags upside-down at least once to prevent patients 
from determining their names. "It's out of fear," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Marie Prisbylla, an intensive-care nurse at a Veterans Administration 
hospital in Manchester, N.H., said she cuts her hair short and stuffs her 
stethoscope in her pocket so she can't be easily grabbed when she faces a 
potentially violent patient. "It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens 
enough that you worry about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the verbal abuse is worse than the physical threats, nurses say. 
"Someone throwing a swing at you is one thing, but it's not nearly as 
intimidating as someone looking at me straight in the eye and saying he's going 
to hurt me," Prisbylla said. "You can tie a patient down, but you can't as 
easily shut someone up." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to deadly violence, workplace murders by disgruntled current or 
former employees -- or jilted lovers -- have garnered the biggest headlines. 
But gangs and street violence are a bigger concern to many people who do 
construction, utility and delivery work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Kennedy, executive-secretary of the Los Angeles-Orange County Building 
Trades Council, which represents 120,000 to 130,000 Southland construction 
workers, said he has never heard any of his unions' members voice concerns 
about violence perpetrated by disgruntled co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, many construction workers avoid taking jobs in certain areas of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Some personnel specialists insist that fear of violence isn't a serious issue 
for their employees. "It's not the kind of thing I hear a lot about," said 
Karen Leibold, director of work-family programs at Stride Rite Corp., a big 
shoe-retailing company. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, as part of the company's ongoing "wellness" program, Stride 
Rite offered a three-hour workshop on personal safety, including such topics as 
how to avoid being mugged. 
</P>
<P>
 That program was attended by about 20 staffers, but when the company offered 
it again, the workshop was canceled for lack of interest; only three or four 
people signed up from among the 500 employees at Stride Rite's urban 
headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's compared to the 25 people who signed up for today's low-fat 
cooking class," Leibold said. "I'm not convinced it (workplace violence) is in 
the forefront of people's minds." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't tell that to Ken Buzzell, president of the United Firefighters of 
Los Angeles City. Buzzell says there still are far more applicants for 
firefighter jobs than there are openings, but that the threat of violence has 
played a role in prompting the retirement of some of his union's members. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect firefighters, the union pushed the city to provide bullet-proof 
vests and to cover the cabs and tiller buckets they ride in. For the union, the 
need for extra protection was dramatized during the 1992 riots when a city 
firefighter was seriously wounded by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that people recognized we were there to help. . . . It's 
becoming scary that people are attacking us when we're trying to help them," 
Buzzell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. postal offices, where some of the most sensational workplace murder 
sprees have occurred, tensions often run particularly high. In August -- nearly 
four months after deadly shootings occurred at post offices in Dana Point and 
Dearborn, Mich., on the same day -- the Postal Service named a 
background-checking firm to screen job candidates for criminal backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar Gonzalez, head of the American Postal Workers Union for the Los Angeles 
area, said workers have taken to filing reports against each other when there 
is only the slightest hint of trouble. "It's out-and-out paranoia," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone says I'm tired of this stuff, and I'm tired of that stuff, and 
that's why things happened in Oklahoma and Detroit, someone immediately writes 
it up as a threat instead of asking about what the problem is," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, workplace violence expert Mathiason says it's a sign of progress that 
workers and companies are beginning to watch out for signs of potential 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything good has happened over the past year, it's that the issue has 
been focused on," he said. How to Curb Workplace Violence 
</P>
<P>
 Some common suggestions from experts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Train supervisors to recognize worrisome behavior by employees. 
Psychologists say employers should watch out for extroverts who suddenly become 
withdrawn, introverts who suddenly become unusually boisterous or anyone who 
appears to be developing a worrisome obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide counseling programs for workers who make threats or who show other 
kinds of bizarre behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take all threats of violence seriously. People rarely resort to violence 
without giving off warning signals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't make counter-threats. That can escalate tensions and box potentially 
violent employees into a corner. Instead, try to find a way to let the employee 
save face. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beef up security. Among other things, get a court order to restrain a 
problem ex-employee from returning to work. That might not deter an irrational 
worker, but the police can take action if the person comes near your property. 
Also consider installing alarm buttons, metal detectors and special door locks 
to restrict access. 
</P>
<P>
 * Handle layoffs and individual dismissals sensitively. Some firms help 
workers they dismiss find new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Develop crisis-management procedures for responding to a violent incident. 
Set up a chain of command inside the company. Determine which authorities 
outside the company need to be contacted.

INTENDED CAPACITY OF NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a lawsuit by opponents of a proposed nuclear waste dump in the 
Mojave Desert, state officials are saying that the Ward Valley site is being 
designed to store about 7,000 times more toxic material than was disclosed in 
the environmental assessment of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The admission prompted U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to urge Gov. Pete 
Wilson on Thursday to revoke the facility's operating license. Boxer, a 
Democrat, has spearheaded political opposition to the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the dump is being designed to handle a large amount of toxic 
material, state officials said this is a remote, worst-case possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has issued a license for construction and operation of the dump, but 
the project has been on hold because of safety concerns expressed by Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt. The site, 20 miles from the Colorado River near 
Needles, is on federal land, and Babbitt must agree to transfer it to the state 
before work on the dump can proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, opponents have contended that opening the dump there raises the 
risk that radioactive waste will leak into ground water and eventually make its 
way into the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in legal papers, opponents have seized on the state's recent admission 
that it had clarified the public record on the proposed waste site, saying it 
is evidence of a "bait and switch" by which the public was lulled into 
believing that Ward Valley would be a repository of relatively benign nuclear 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials, along with U.S. Ecology, the firm licensed to operate the 
dump, have long argued that the bulk of the waste destined for Ward Valley is 
short-lived radioactive material from hospitals and biotechnology firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's environmental impact report on the project estimates that over the 
dump's 30-year operating life it will receive less than one curie, or roughly 
seven grams, of plutonium-239, the most toxic and long-lived radioactive 
material scheduled for disposal there. (A curie is a measurement of 
radioactivity.) Plutonium waste is generated by nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 But with its recent acknowledgment that the site might take much more, the 
state Department of Health Services, which issued the dump license, has fueled 
suspicion among critics that it has long known that the inventory of 
plutonium-239 will vastly exceed the amount stated in the environmental report. 
Instead of a few grams of plutonium-239, the project could accept as much as 
120 pounds of the material, opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The newly available information reveals that the California Department of 
Health Services intentionally withheld from the public accurate data about the 
waste that would be buried in unlined trenches at Ward Valley," Boxer wrote to 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer recommended that Wilson revoke the license and redo the environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials insist that they have not changed their estimate of the amount 
of plutonium-239 expected to end up at Ward Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials maintain that the information provided in the lawsuit 
illuminates what amounted to an academic exercise, reflecting a so-called 
worst-case scenario that was required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The 
commission required that it be included in the license application. 
</P>
<P>
 In part of the application, the officials gave a potential level of 3,448 
curies as part of that worst-case scenario, rather than the .45 curies 
mentioned in the initial environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the difference between a theoretical exercise and expected reality," 
said Peter Baldridge, a staff attorney with the health services department. In 
the worst-case analysis, officials said, they are required to assess the safety 
of the site under extraordinary circumstances. The officials pointed to 
language in the license application that reads: "It must be realized that this 
projection is considered to extremely overestimate the amount of (power plant) 
decontamination waste expected to be generated." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Elisabeth Brandt, the department's chief counsel, "the license 
application very clearly states that we are assuming (the larger amount of 
plutonium) for purposes of an analysis, and that it has nothing to do with what 
we actually expect to receive." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the worst-case analysis showed that "the site would be safe if 
you put 3,500 curies in it." Brandt said the worst-case analysis was not 
included in the environmental report because it measures anticipated effects. 
She added that the worst-case analysis, far from being hidden from the public, 
is included in a public record -- the license application. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt, however, conceded that the amount of plutonium-239 expected to go to 
Ward Valley could be higher than was estimated in the environmental impact 
report.  
</P>
<P>
 Boxer and other Ward Valley opponents said Brandt's comments only deepen their 
mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that under any scenario you choose to believe, (the Department of 
Health Service) has substantially underestimated the amount of plutonium going 
to Ward Valley," said Dan Hirsch, whose anti-nuclear organization, Bridge the 
Gap, has played a leading role in the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch said the department misled the public both in the environmental report 
and in the licensing application, contending that the .45 curiefigure appeared 
in both places until it was clarified. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer dismissed the state's explanation of the numbers as "a lame-brained 
attempt to confuse the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Her letter to Wilson also accuses the state of overestimating the amount of 
biomedical waste projected for Ward Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 In public documents, health services officials knowingly misstated that more 
than 90% of the waste going to Ward Valley would be tritium coming from biotech 
firms, Boxer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 By overestimating the amount of tritium, Boxer said, the department quietly 
was making room for the far larger amounts of nuclear power plant waste at Ward 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt acknowledged that the estimate of tritium contained in the 
environmental report was higher than officials expected to go to Ward Valley. 
But she said the industry that manufactures the material was in flux and 
officials did not want to run the risk of underestimating the need for space at 
the dump. Tritium, though not as toxic as plutonium, is long-lived and not easy 
to store safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used a number that the pharmaceutical manufacturers gave us," she said. 
"We thought it was outrageously high, but we didn't want anyone accusing us of 
(underestimating it). 
</P>
<P>
 But Brandt said that even if the tritium estimates are high, "it does not mean 
we are planning for more plutonium. That does not follow."

VALLEY FEVER DEATH MAY BE TIED TO QUAKE; AFTERMATH: SIMI VALLEY MAN SUCCUMBS TO 
RESPIRATORY AILMENT. HEALTH OFFICIALS REPORT HIGH NUMBER OF CASES AND SAY 
SHAKING MAY HAVE KICKED UP FUNGUS-LADEN DUST. 
</P>

<P>
 A 71-year-old Simi Valley man has died of so-called valley fever, a 
respiratory illness that may have been linked to the Northridge earthquake, 
health officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Walter Cole, a retired maintenance worker, received a diagnosis in 
February that he had the disease, which is contracted by breathing airborne 
spores that grow in the soil. He died March 2 in a North Hollywood hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials have speculated that the Jan. 17 earthquake kicked up 
fungus-laden dust that has infected many residents in the San Fernando Valley 
and eastern half of Ventura County, particularly in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centers for Disease Control has documented 170 cases of valley fever in 
Ventura County since the earthquake, more than half of them in Simi Valley, 
said Gary Feldman, director of the Ventura County Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cole's death is the only reported fatality, health officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of dust all over Simi Valley, maybe this was why he was 
infected," said Rana Hajjeh, an epidemiologist with the Atlanta-based center. 
Hajjeh added that Cole had other health problems that might have put him at 
risk. "He was a diabetic, and diabetes sometimes can weaken your immune 
response." 
</P>
<P>
 Cole's wife, Hazel, said her husband had a high fever and flu-like symptoms 
when he went to the emergency room Feb. 10. He was sent home after being 
diagnosed as having pneumonia. Two days later, he returned to the hospital with 
a 103.6-degree fever and was admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he left, he just said, 'See you tonight or in a couple of days.' That's 
how sure he was that it wasn't serious," Hazel Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he weakened quickly in the hospital and died March 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said the Health Department is investigating a possible link between 
the earthquake and the rise in valley fever cases and plans to test 450 
randomly selected Simi Valley residents to determine the magnitude of exposure 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said those who test positive for valley fever would be interviewed "to 
look at factors they were exposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of valley fever cases is above normal, health officials 
stress that death is uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even (among) those people who were sick enough to come to medical attention, 
very severe illness or fatality is quite rare," Feldman said. "To the ordinary 
person, the risk is really quite low, so much so that most people don't realize 
they have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Patients with valley fever report flu-like symptoms such as headaches, coughs, 
fatigue and muscle aches, said Dr. Susan Reef of the Centers for Disease 
Control.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think what is important to know is that 60% (of those infected) have no 
symptoms," Reef said. "Only .5% -- that's less than 1% -- have the form that 
goes throughout the body." 
</P>
<P>
 But health officials are taking note anyway. The Centers for Disease Control, 
which has set up a valley fever hot line, released a report Thursday that 
addresses the outbreak of the disease in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The increase in cases follows the Jan. 17 earthquake centered in Northridge, 
which may have exposed Ventura County residents to increased levels of airborne 
dust," the report states. "The California Department of Health Services, local 
public agencies and the CDC are conducting an investigation to determine the 
magnitude of the outbreak, risk factors for infection and its possible 
association with the Northridge earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Health Department's Simi Valley study could begin as early 
as Monday, Feldman said.

WOMAN HELD IN PERRIS IS SUSPECT IN SERIES OF KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 36-year-old woman was arrested Thursday as a suspected serial killer who 
preyed on elderly women who lived alone, ending a monthlong reign of terror in 
local retirement communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, identified by Perris police as Dana Sue Gray, an unemployed nurse 
from Wildomar near Lake Elsinore, was arrested as a suspect in one killing and 
is under investigation in two others and in the attempted murder of a fourth 
woman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray was arrested early Thursday by Perris police on suspicion of murdering 
June Roberts, 67. The woman, who lived alone in her Canyon Lakes home, was 
found strangled on Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray is under investigation in the slaying of Norma Davis, 86, who was found 
stabbed to death in her Canyon Lake home Feb. 14, and in the death of Dora 
Bebee, 87, of Sun City, whose body was discovered Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A bank teller tipped authorities to Gray after she tried to use a credit card 
that belonged to one of the victims, said Deputy Tom Lohman of the Riverside 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence at the scene of the Bebee killing was linked Wednesday to evidence at 
Gray's home, Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Perris Police Department spokesman said Thursday night that investigators 
were looking for additional evidence at Gray's home in Wildomar.  
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said Gray was picked out of a photographic lineup Thursday by a woman 
who survived an attack last Thursday. That woman, a Lake Elsinore antique 
dealer, said she was showing a woman some items in a back room when the woman 
told her to "relax" and began to choke her. She said she pretended to faint, 
and the woman fled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim got an excellent look at her," Lohman said.

REGENTS' PANEL INSISTS UC SEEK WAY OUT OF DEAL WITH MILKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying they wanted to leave no stone unturned, members of a University of 
California regents panel Thursday prevailed on administrators to look for a way 
out of a controversial contract that allows fallen junk bond king Michael 
Milken to keep 95% of profits from the sale of videotapes of his lectures at 
UCLA last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point raising their hands in a mock motion of solidarity, members of 
the regents' Finance Committee appeared unanimous in their determination to get 
out of the embarrassing legal obligation, which some branded as offensive and a 
raw deal for the university. 
</P>
<P>
 But they could not take formal action because the university's contract with 
Milken had been put on the agenda by President Jack W. Peltason only as a 
discussion item. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that technical hang-up, a spokesman said after the meeting that 
Peltason would abide by the regents' sentiments and direct the university's 
attorneys to "look into the contract and see if the other party will withdraw." 
</P>
<P>
 That will not be easy, UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young warned Thursday. 
Trying to dissuade the regents from tampering with the deal, Young said he 
would have "very great difficulty" approaching Milken about rescinding it and 
predicted that the convicted felon "will not be happy, and we are going to be 
faced with a confrontation that may very well result in a legal dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Regent John G. Davies of San Diego retorted that the "sense of the regents 
is we want to leave no stone unturned to see if we can get out of this 
contract. . . . We may have to have Mr. Milken's consent to do that, and he'll 
say no. But I want to know we tried everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Milken, the onetime junk bond dealer who was convicted of six securities 
violations, co-taught 10 three-hour lectures at UCLA's Anderson Graduate School 
of Management last fall. As part of the agreement, the school allowed his 
fledgling Educational Entertainment Network to tape the lectures and collect 
95% of the profits, leaving the university with 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although UC officials have defended Milken's participation as an exercise in 
academic freedom, it has become a public relations albatross for the 
university. UCLA was ridiculed in the nationally syndicated "Doonesbury" comic 
strip, and last month two state senators appeared before the regents demanding 
that they try to get out of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The senators accused Milken, who could not be reached for comment Thursday 
night, of trying to use UCLA's name to rehabilitate his reputation, and they 
said school officials were duped into a deal that gave them the short end of 
the profits while waiving virtually all their legal rights in relation to the 
videotapes.  
</P>
<P>
 They said UCLA officials, who signed the agreement last fall on behalf of the 
regents, were seduced by Milken and his family giving more than $3.3 million to 
the university, including $40,000 to the business school shortly before the 
contract was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Revisiting the controversy Thursday, UC officials said the contract did not 
appear to violate university rules regarding the use of its name or unofficial 
logo, but they conceded that there is no "comprehensive policy" to govern such 
commercial attempts to market lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 Regent Frank W. Clark Jr., senior partner in Los Angeles' Parker, Milken, 
Clark, O'Hara & Samuelian law firm, criticized the contract because it may have 
unintentionally created a partnership with Milken by sharing in the profits, 
instead of receiving a royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 As partners, he said, the university also would be forced to share in any 
legal liabilities incurred by Milken. Meanwhile, UCLA officials waived the 
university's right to rescind the agreement or even file an injunction against 
the former junk bond king, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are serious legal problems with this document," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regent Ward Connerly, a Sacramento land use consultant who was recently 
confirmed by the state Senate, called the contract terrible and "offensive to a 
lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Connerly suggested that it might be appropriate for the regents to take back 
some of the contract powers it delegates to campus administrators, saying the 
university's oversight panel should not have to find out about potentially 
embarrassing arrangements with notorious figures "after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want a contract with Louis Farrakhan or Charles Manson," he said. 
Regarding the Milken agreement, he added: "I guess what we're saying is that in 
this case poor judgment was exercised."

LEGISLATORS OK TOUGHER SMOG CHECKS; POLLUTION: WILSON IS EXPECTED TO SIGN 
COMPROMISE WITH EPA. ACTION APPEARS TO END YEARLONG FIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a compromise with federal officials who had threatened sanctions if the 
state failed to act, the Legislature overwhelmingly approved a beefed-up Smog 
Check program Thursday aimed at the dirtiest cars in the smoggiest regions of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, whose representatives joined legislators in negotiating the 
clean air agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency over the last 
three months, is expected to sign the bill soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement appeared to end a yearlong fight between the Wilson 
Administration and Clinton Administration over how best to bring California 
into compliance with the U.S. Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), lead legislative negotiator, told the 
lower house: "We have put in place the strongest, most creative program in the 
country, one that will clean up our air, be convenient for motorists and keep 
as many small (Smog Check) businesses as possible in operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, starting in 1995, 15% of the estimated 8 million cars and 
small trucks scheduled for testing each year in the smoggiest regions of 
California, including the South Coast Air Basin and Ventura and San Diego 
counties, would be routed into new privately operated inspection-only 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing would be more rigorous than the examinations performed at 
neighborhood garages that test and repair vehicles. Aimed at worst offenders, 
these would include vehicles whose smog controls had been tampered with, 
high-mileage vehicles, "gross polluters" and a 2% random sample collected by 
the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said, "10% of the vehicles cause 50% of the pollution." 
</P>
<P>
 Held up as a model for other states, the compromise would set up a novel 
program to use public funds to subsidize owners of "gross polluters" for repair 
costs up to $450 or give them up to $800 to junk their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidy is intended for low-income motorists whose older vehicles pollute 
heavily but who cannot afford costly repairs or the purchase of a new car that 
meets clean air standards. Wilson vetoed a similar bill last year because it 
would have obligated the state to pay up to $4,800 per car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either fix the cars or take them off the road," Katz said of the subsidy 
proposal, authored by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco). "We've never done 
that before." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, smog inspections are required every other year, when cars must 
be registered and upon change of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-bill package was carried by Katz, Kopp and Sen. Robert B. Presley 
(D-Riverside) and sent to Wilson on a series of bipartisan votes that more than 
satisfied the two-thirds requirement for passage. The key Katz bill won 55-0 
approval in the Assembly and 31-3 endorsement in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills supplement legislation signed by Wilson in January that rejected the 
EPA's demand that automobile inspections be separated from repair services 
conducted at about 9,000 licensed garages in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and the Legislature sided with Smog Check operators, who protested that 
separation of the services would throw thousands of mechanics out of work. The 
EPA complained that the new law failed to satisfy federal standards and would 
bring about imposition of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanctions could include hundreds of millions of dollars in lost federal 
highway construction funds and imposition of severe pollution discharge 
restrictions on new construction or expanded businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Wilson signed the law in January, the two sides returned to the 
negotiating table and drafted the compromise, which sailed through the 
Legislature with heavy bipartisan support Thursday. The next step will be 
filing the state's compliance plan with the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise included an agreement between the Wilson Administration and the 
federal EPA to drop the sanctions when the plan is submitted. Assistant EPA 
Administrator Mary Nichols called passage of the legislation a positive step. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters said the compromise contained safeguards to assure compliance even 
if some components of the package fail to work as expected. For example, if 
testing showed that federal requirements were not being met, the 15% test group 
could be expanded to include more vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 If failure persisted, however, federal sanctions probably would imposed, 
officials said. Other alternatives could include legislation, renewed 
negotiations or court fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats and Republicans alike boasted that the bill reflected a 
determination by California to resolve its own problems rather than give in to 
what they called federal dictates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big Brother and Big Sister in Washington didn't know the right way," Katz 
told his colleagues. "We know a better way in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a leading clean air advocate, was the only 
voice in either house to speak out against the bills. Siding with the American 
Lung Assn., Hayden said the compromise offered a false hope and only "put off 
the inevitable." Revised Rules 
</P>
<P>
 Effective in 1995, here are the key provisions of new smog check legislation 
expected to be signed by Gov. Pete Wilson: 
</P>
<P>
 * Eighty-five percent of vehicles would be checked the same way they are now, 
at neighborhood service stations that do both testing and repair. The cost of 
testing is not expected to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fifteen percent of the vehicles scheduled for smog inspections in the 
state's smoggiest regions would be directed to inspection-only stations that 
would use improved equipment. Included would be cars whose smog controls have 
been tampered with, taxis, high-mileage fleet vehicles, "gross polluters" and a 
2% sample chosen at random. 
</P>
<P>
 * High-tech roadside sensors would seek out gross-polluting vehicles and 
record their identities for action by authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 * In the high-smog regions, owners of gross-polluting vehicles can collect as 
much as $450 from the state to help pay for repairs or up to $800 to junk the 
vehicle and purchase a cleaner-running one.

EX-PATIENT REPORTS TWO EARLIER CASES OF HOSPITAL FUMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several weeks before mysterious fumes forced the evacuation of the Riverside 
General Hospital emergency room, a patient had to evacuate his own room after 
noxious fumes overcame him and his wife, the man said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Weiss, a 52-year-old cancer patient, said the stench was so strong it 
made him vomit before he covered his face with a blanket and his wife fled for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurse who responded remarked that such odors were not unusual, and blamed 
it on nurses on higher floors who dump various liquids into the hospital's 
plumbing system, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, chemical fumes again filled his room, Weiss said -- and for a 
second time, he and his visiting wife and daughter had to leave it until the 
air cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss reported the incidents to the attorney representing the family of Gloria 
Ramirez, the 31-year-old woman who died in the Riverside General Hospital 
emergency room Feb. 19 after mysterious fumes sickened six attendants and 
caused the evacuation of the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators said Thursday that the hospital's plumbing system is a 
primary focus of their inquiry into the source of the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 State and county public health experts have not yet determined the source of 
the fumes or what caused the death of Ramirez, who had cancer. She had gone to 
the hospital complaining of breathing difficulties and went into cardiac 
arrest.  
</P>
<P>
 The affected emergency room attendants said they got dizzy, and several 
collapsed and required hospitalization, after smelling an ammonia-like odor 
when a sample of the woman's blood was drawn into a syringe. The chief 
emergency room physician said he did not notice an odor, but detected crystals 
in the blood sample. 
</P>
<P>
 As his colleagues began to collapse around him, the physician, Dr. Humberto 
Ochoa, noticed liquids in the drain of an emergency room basin and flushed it, 
Riverside County spokesman Tom DeSantis said. "He was trying to rule it out as 
a possibility, right at the scene," DeSantis said. "That's normal procedure." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Riverside City Fire Department's hazardous-materials team tested the 
emergency room air several hours after the incident, they found nothing 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Schwartz, a Newport Beach attorney representing the Ramirez family, 
said Weiss gave a sworn declaration detailing his encounter with fumes at the 
hospital. Weiss' experience, Schwartz said, suggests that the hospital, and not 
Ramirez, was the source of the mystery fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Cal/OSHA, the state job safety agency, said Thursday that 
Riverside General Hospital was cited in 1990 and 1991 for a series of 
violations of exposure standards relating to the use of ethylene oxide, an 
extremely toxic gas that is used for sterilizing instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990 violations, the hospital was cited for not providing adequate 
respirators for use by staff members working with ethylene oxide, and for an 
inadequate system of alerting people to its presence. 
</P>
<P>
 The same violations were cited the following year, said Cal/OSHA spokesman 
Rick Rice. This time, because of the recurrence, the violations were deemed 
"willful and serious." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the hierarchy of Cal/OSHA violations, those are up near the top," Rice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six other serious citations relating to the handling of ethylene oxide at the 
hospital were made in 1991 before the problem was resolved the following year, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the hospital was cited in 1991 and 1992 for failing to maintain 
annual inspection records of its ventilation system, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ramirez case, Rice said, Cal/OSHA investigators are focusing on the 
hospital's plumbing system and method of disposing of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 In many California communities, the state's Department of Health Service 
monitors how hospitals dispose of their hazardous waste. But counties have the 
option of enforcing such state laws at the local level and, in the case of 
Riverside General Hospital, the monitoring is done by the county's 
Environmental Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack McGurk, who heads the state health department's biomedical waste 
management branch, said there is concern about how hospitals dump chemicals -- 
whether they are cleaning agents or dated medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases, there might not be a (disposal) problem. But, if you're 
cleaning the commode with one kind of cleaner, then drop Clorox in somewhere 
else, the two are incompatible and you can have something happen right then and 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things that a hospital's housekeeping staff should or would want to 
know about -- how are they disposing mop water, or cleaners and, on top of 
that, chemicals, solutions and outdated medicines." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis and Jenny Weiss said their first encounter with noxious odors at 
Riverside General occurred Jan. 13, during his five-day stay for chemotherapy 
treatment on the hospital's third floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the sink gurgling and then there was a horrible smell," Jenny Weiss 
said. "It was an awful smell, a toxic smell, and I knew if I stayed in the room 
any longer, I'd get sick."  
</P>
<P>
 Her husband said: "I've worked with chemicals all my life, but I can't 
describe what this was. I've never smelled anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the same thing happened. Weiss said he told nurses, "You'd 
better call a plumber." 
</P>
<P>
 The family did not formally complain to the hospital, or to the county of 
Riverside, which operates the hospital. But after hearing of the Ramirez 
incident , the family contacted attorney Schwartz.  
</P>
<P>
 DeSantis said Thursday that he could not comment on the Weiss incident, nor 
could he immediately determine if there was any history of complaints of foul 
fumes at the hospital.

LATIN AMERICA; FOR FIRST TIME IN YEARS, U.S. STAYING OUT OF SALVADOR VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, the United States has acted as a major player, for good or for bad, 
in the political events of El Salvador. Washington blessed presidential 
candidates, blocked others. It poured billions of dollars into El Salvador, 
sustaining governments and fattening an abusive army. It helped pay for a civil 
war against leftist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as more than 2 million Salvadorans prepare to vote in their first open, 
peacetime elections in decades, leaders on both the left and the right say the 
United States appears to have retreated to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first election in many, many years in which the government of the 
United States will not have a candidate to support, nor a candidate to sink," 
said Ruben Zamora, who is running for president at the head of a leftist 
coalition that includes the former guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 One explanation is an Administration less focused on Latin America, now that 
the Cold War and the perceived threat of communism have ended. 
</P>
<P>
 But another explanation, diplomats and politicians say, is that the political 
center -- which U.S. governments worked for years to fortify -- has 
disintegrated. The two leading candidacies in Sunday's election represent El 
Salvador's extremes: guerrillas whom the United States fought for 12 years, and 
the right-wing government, whose party is widely associated with death squads 
that killed thousands of students, leftists, union workers and peasants during 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. Embassy is maintaining a presence that is much more discreet," a 
Latin American diplomat said. "They've decided it's better to step back and let 
it be. And that's good, because there is a lot of resentment still toward the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 This neutrality represents a drastic change. In the 1984 presidential 
elections, for example, the CIA spent millions of dollars to bolster the 
candidacy of Jose Napoleon Duarte of the centrist Christian Democrats. With 
U.S. help, Duarte defeated Roberto D'Aubuisson, the reputed death squad founder 
who is widely believed to have ordered the 1980 murder of Roman Catholic 
Archbishop Oscar Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 For this election, U.S. officials here were said to have favored the candidacy 
of a centrist businessman who would give a moderate face to the ruling 
right-wing party, or who would rally a coalition of center-left parties in 
which the influence of the guerrillas would be diluted. Neither plan worked. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, instead 
backed one of its own hard-line members, Armando Calderon Sol. In U.S. 
government documents declassified late last year, Calderon Sol was linked to a 
kidnaping plot hatched by a right-wing paramilitary group. Calderon Sol was 
closely associated with D'Aubuisson, who died two years ago, and several of 
Calderon Sol's closest advisers are reputed to have helped organize death 
squads. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, U.S. officials told Zamora that as long as he hewed to free-market 
economic policies and stayed away from Marxism, they would not oppose his 
candidacy, according to a well-placed source in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Arena, U.S. officials also appear to be keeping their distance. They 
believe that some members have moved toward the center, diplomatic sources 
said, but they are not yet sure Calderon Sol is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, the United States, which has slashed aid to a fraction of what it 
was during the 1980s, is declaring neutrality and focusing on support for the 
troubled electoral process, providing $1.5 million for voter registration and 
similar projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look forward to working with whatever government (Salvadorans) freely 
elect to complete the task of national reconstruction," Brian Atwood, the 
director of the Agency for International Development, told the National 
Assembly last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Some former rebels still find it hard to believe the United States is keeping 
hands off or will be able to accept its onetime enemies as governors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who are still very afraid of us," said Ana 
Guadalupe Martinez, former rebel leader and a candidate for congress.

EUROPE; CELEBRATION OF D-DAY LANDING: A MESSY FLAP; KOHL IS IGNORED BY WORLD 
WAR II ALLIES. HE INSISTS IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE TO GO. GERMANS FEEL EVENTS 
SHOULD HIGHLIGHT RECONCILIATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 How many times must Chancellor Helmut Kohl's aides explain that, really, the 
German leader never nosed around for an invitation to the Allies' 50th 
anniversary celebration of D-Day in Normandy next June and does not feel 
snubbed at all that his good friends the French have not offered him one? 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl believes that it would be inappropriate to attend a celebration of the 
defeat of German soldiers, even if he were asked, aides say -- unless French 
President Francois Mitterrand were to personally do the asking. But then no one 
really expects that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Mon Dieu . Mein Gott . What an undiplomatic mess. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the 50th anniversary of the Allies' landing on the beaches of Normandy 
in Nazi-occupied France is turning out for Germany about as well as the 40th 
anniversary did in 1984, when Germany also was left out of the official 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Kohl arranged to meet with then-President Ronald Reagan in the 
Bitburg cemetery and insisted upon keeping the date even after it was 
discovered, to Reagan's embarrassment, that some of Hitler's Waffen-SS troops 
were buried there. 
</P>
<P>
 The commemoration of the Normandy invasion, which turned the tide of World War 
II in the Allies' favor, is the first event in more than a year of 
anniversaries, including that of an assassination attempt against Hitler on 
July 20, 1944, the liberation of Paris, the Battle of the Bulge, the crossing 
of the Rhine by Allied forces, the meeting of Russian and U.S. troops on the 
Elbe River and, finally, the capitulation of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 German sensitivity over the issue has reached such heights that Kohl has taken 
control of his country's commemorations himself and directed all ministries to 
refer queries to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl aides note that post-war Germany has been an unfailing friend and ally of 
the West, and they are perturbed that the D-Day activities aim to be more a 
celebration of victory over Germany than of democracy and reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I am good friends now with someone with whom I fought 50 years ago, I 
wouldn't celebrate my victory over them," a Kohl aide said. "How long will they 
be celebrating this? A hundred years? Two hundred? Or is this the end?" 
</P>
<P>
 The chancellor fears that Allied breast-beating might offend German 
nationalism during a crucial election year, and he has barred German diplomats 
from military-style ceremonies for D-Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The French and German governments actually are quite close. In 1984, 
Mitterrand and Kohl met in Verdun over the graves of World War I soldiers as a 
symbol of reconciliation, and Mitterrand apparently had promised Kohl a similar 
gesture this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But French efforts to appease Germany sensibilities so far have backfired. 
</P>
<P>
 French Defense Minister Francois Leotard announced last week that he and his 
German counterpart, Voker Ruehe, would tour a WWII cemetery together in 
Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leotard quickly withdrew the invitation when it turned out that, as in 
Bitburg, Nazi Waffen-SS were buried there. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Jean-Marie Girault, the mayor of the Normandy city of Caen, 
announced that Kohl was welcome to his city's evening celebration of D-Day, 
although the French government did not invite the chancellor to the main 
daytime event at Omaha Beach with President Clinton, Britain's Queen Elizabeth 
II and other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonn replied that the chancellor did not view this as a formal invitation. 
WWII Remembrances 
</P>
<P>
 Other World War II anniversaries to be marked beginning this summer: 
</P>
<P>
 Assassination attempt against Hitler: July 20, 1944 
</P>
<P>
 Liberation of Paris: Aug. 25, 1944 
</P>

RABIN ASKS POPE TO AID PEACE PROCESS; ARAFAT HOLDS FAST; MIDEAST: ISRAELI 
LEADER CALLS MOSQUE MASSACRE 'SHAMEFUL' IN TALK WITH PONTIFF. PLO CHAIRMAN 
INSISTS ON INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION FOR PALESTINIANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Thursday asked Pope John Paul II to 
help win peace in the Middle East, but Yasser Arafat, the Palestine Liberation 
Organization chairman, told a papal envoy that the talks could not resume 
without international protection for Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time Rabin met the Pope here Thursday morning, Arafat spoke 
with Archbishop Jean Louis Tauran, the Vatican's foreign minister, at PLO 
headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the United States, the Vatican wants to see resumption of talks, 
suspended after an Israeli settler massacred about 30 Palestinians in a Hebron 
mosque on Feb. 25. After meeting with Rabin on Wednesday in Washington, 
President Clinton appealed to Arafat to resume negotiations to avoid allowing 
extremists to short-circuit the historic process. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian leader, though, made plain to reporters after conferring with 
the senior Vatican diplomat that he was adamant. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is required now is that the United States, the two co-sponsors of the 
Middle East peace process and the Security Council respond to the just demands 
of the Palestinians to provide international protection to our children, our 
women and our holy places," the Associated Press quoted Arafat as saying in 
Tunis. "Our people have the right to know the council's opinion on the terrible 
massacre committed in the holy mosque. I need a clear answer to our demands." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, Arafat said, must allow the Security Council to vote on a 
resolution on the Hebron massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department says the United States will not impede a vote, if the PLO 
returns unconditionally to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican, which maintains embassies in more than 100 countries, including 
most Arab states, has raised its profile in the Middle East since agreeing with 
Israel in December to establish diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 En route home from Washington, Rabin briefed the Pope on his talks with 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time of crisis in the (peace) talks . . . my request to the Pope is 
essentially that he will give moral, religious support to a solution in the way 
of peace, in the way of negotiations," Rabin told reporters afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he asked John Paul to use his "influence on hundreds of millions (of 
his followers) to support the peace process and to influence elements in the 
Arab world to return to the talks." 
</P>
<P>
 An amicable half-hour meeting at the Vatican included renewal of a 
longstanding Israeli invitation to the pontiff to visit the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pope accepted the invitation, and said he hoped that circumstances will 
permit him to make this desired visit," papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 As reporters entered the room at the end of the private meeting in the papal 
apartments, John Paul was reiterating an oft-expressed wish to Rabin: "I hope 
to be able to visit Jerusalem. . . . I hope, I hope." No date is yet in 
prospect for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the audience, Rabin promised the Pope: "I will make every effort to 
bring peace and prosperity to the Holy Land." 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro said Rabin described the mosque massacre as "shameful" in his talk 
with John Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am uncomfortable that for almost three weeks, 100,000 residents of Hebron 
are under curfew because of 415 Jews," Rabin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 His government has banned two Jewish extremist groups, and Rabin said further 
action might be forthcoming against what he called "insane and extreme 
elements" among Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have taken steps, and more steps will be taken," he said.

EGYPT EXECUTES 2, SENTENCES 9 TO DIE FOR ATTACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Army firing squads executed two soldiers Thursday for a failed plot to kill 
President Hosni Mubarak, and nine men were sentenced to hang for a separate 
attack by Muslim militants on Egypt's prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants on trial for the failed assassination of Prime Minister Atef 
Sedki were defiant as they appeared before a military court Thursday in Cairo, 
chanting: "Tell Mubarak his turn is coming!" 
</P>
<P>
 Sedki escaped unhurt in the Nov. 25 attack, but a 12-year-old schoolgirl was 
killed and 21 people were wounded when a bomb exploded as his motorcade was 
leaving his home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic Jihad, which assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981, claimed 
responsibility for the attack, the third against a Cabinet minister last year. 
The group considers Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman its spiritual leader. The blind 
Egyptian cleric is being held in the United States on charges he masterminded 
the February, 1993, bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The death sentences Thursday were the greatest number handed down in one trial 
since extremists opened a campaign more than two years ago to topple the 
secular government and turn Egypt into an Islamic republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdicts bring to 49 the number of militants sentenced to death in Egypt's 
response to the campaign of violence. Thirty-two have been executed. The others 
were tried in absentia and are at large. 
</P>

 More than 320 people have been killed, including militants slain by police, in 
the last two years.

 As with the trial, held earlier this year, no announcement was made of the 
execution, which took place at an undisclosed location in northern Egypt.

RUSSIA TO JOIN NATO'S PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE PROGRAM; EUROPE: THE MOVE IS 
ANNOUNCED AS THE MOSCOW AND WASHINGTON DEFENSE CHIEFS MEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Russia said Thursday that it will join NATO's Partnership for Peace by the 
month's end and was assured by Defense Secretary William J. Perry of a major 
role in the post-Cold War military cooperation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, Russia's defense minister, made the announcement after 
meeting with his American counterpart. Grachev said Russia will sign up as soon 
as it prepares a detailed proposal for how it wants to collaborate with the 
16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we are a great power, we have a large amount of tasks to work out," 
Grachev told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials welcomed the decision as a sign that Russia, despite friction 
with NATO over the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the recent exposure of an 
alleged Russian mole inside the CIA, remains committed to working with the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secretary Perry repeated (in the meeting) that Partnership for Peace is 
something different countries will participate in to different extents 
depending upon their resources, their fundamental importance," a senior U.S. 
defense official told Reuters news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry told Grachev that "he expected, in view of the size and importance of 
Russia, that they would have a large and important role in the Partnership for 
Peace," the official was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Partnership for Peace emerged last year as a U.S. formula to enable countries 
of the former Soviet Bloc to engage in joint exercises, training and defense 
planning with NATO without gaining full membership. Twelve nations have joined 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula is a compromise. Former Soviet satellites -- particularly the 
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland -- seek NATO membership as a shield against 
future Russian aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia objects to an eastward expansion by NATO, which it views as a Cold War 
alliance that should be weakened. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials made it clear Thursday that they are joining Partnership for 
Peace not so much as a step toward embracing NATO as one toward redefining 
Europe's security arrangements under a broader umbrella with a new identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our accession to this program will enable us to sway its future evolution 
according to Russia's national interests," Yuri K. Nazarkin, chief of Russia's 
security council, told a hearing of the Duma, the lower house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Grachev's deputies, Gen. Pavel Zolotarev, said Russia hopes by joining 
the partnership to obtain "official recognition" from NATO nations of Moscow's 
"special responsibility" to police neighboring countries of the former Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no Western leader has been willing to give Moscow such carte blanche. 
</P>
<P>
 Zolotarev said Russia also hopes to develop a new "pan-European security 
system" that would effectively supplant NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he said Russia wants to work with NATO to train combat troops for 
peacekeeping operations, keep terrorists from stealing nuclear or chemical 
weapons and divide up conventional arms markets in the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials testified at the hearing that Russia risks isolation and 
even the loss of its arms market in Eastern Europe if it delays joining the 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be playing a role of outside observer of the political processes in 
Europe," Gen. Zolotarev said. "Our opinion would be given less and less heed." 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawmakers objected to Partnership for Peace because NATO will set the 
terms of cooperation by each new partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can only be described as dictating conditions to others," said Vladimir P. 
Lukin, chairman of the Duma's Foreign Affairs Commission and a former 
ambassador to the United States. "It reminds me of a compromise of a rapist" 
who offers his victim a choice between cooperation and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duma, led by an alliance of Communists and nationalists, has no power to 
block Russia's entry into the partnership or its growing cooperation with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian navy announced Thursday that it will take part for the first time 
in large-scale naval maneuvers with other European nations starting next Monday 
in the Sea of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 After their meeting, Perry said he and Grachev agreed to "work together as 
equal partners" for peace in Bosnia, despite Russia's objections to NATO 
threats of force against the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks with Grachev launched a weeklong visit by Perry to Russia, 
Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus -- the inheritors of the Soviet nuclear arsenal 
-- with an agenda of arms control and defense conversion. Having spoken with 
Grachev on a hot line linking Washington and Moscow, he said he wanted to forge 
closer ties between the two defense establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not an exaggeration to say that many important national security 
relationships in the entire world will be influenced by this relationship," 
Perry said. "All of the important substantive problems with which we have to 
work will go much better if we have a close personal understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 After the defense chiefs of the former superpower rivals had shaken hands, 
about 5,000 Russians still pining over the breakup of the Soviet Union held an 
outdoor rally in central Moscow to mark the third anniversary of the last 
referendum held in that country. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, 74% of the voters endorsed the idea of keeping the union together; 
within nine months it was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 People at the rally, mostly middle-aged and retired, had mixed views about the 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like a surrender!" exclaimed Anna S. Plyukhina, 64. "First it is this 
thing, then it will come to German generals coming to Russia, once again 
ordering us around." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the poor financial state of Russia's army, a demonstrator named 
Vladimir D. Fedotov, 61, said: "If (the government) doesn't want to give enough 
money to the army, then it is quite reasonable to join this partnership. Maybe 
there our army will get some badly needed dollars."

DESPITE ATTACKS, SINN FEIN LEADER CLAIMS IRA WANTS PEACE WITH BRITAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leader of the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, said Thursday that the 
republican guerrillas genuinely wanted peace, despite its mortar attacks on 
London's Heathrow airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remain convinced that the IRA is willing to deal positively with any new 
eventuality. It is crystal clear that the IRA are interested in developing a 
peace process," Gerry Adams said in a St. Patrick's Day message. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his most detailed assessment of an Anglo-Irish peace process since the 
Irish Republican Army, fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland, fired 
three salvos of mortars at the airport to demonstrate its ability to hit 
high-profile British targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams was addressing party faithful in Belfast hours before Irish Prime 
Minister Albert Reynolds was to meet President Bill Clinton to reaffirm support 
for the Downing Street peace initiative, which London and Dublin launched last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said it was illogical that Britain refused his 
request for clarification of the Anglo-Irish plan after having held secret 
contacts with Sinn Fein and the IRA for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the hard-line posturing from British politicians, realism and 
accommodation are not impossible," he said of London's refusal to talk to Sinn 
Fein until it gets the IRA to lay down its arms and itself renounces violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their (Britain's) current stance of refusing to provide clarification of the 
Downing Street Declaration, set against the background of three years of 
private contacts with Sinn Fein, is illogical," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was certain that Sinn Fein will again be in contact with the 
British government, despite Prime Minister John Major's adamant refusal to talk 
to the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain conceded last November that it had held secret communications with 
Sinn Fein and the IRA through intermediaries, but says the doors to further 
talks are now shut until Sinn Fein accepts the Downing Street peace framework. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said Sinn Fein favored an earlier blueprint drawn up by himself and John 
Hume, head of the Social Democratic and Labor party.

SERBS, MUSLIMS SIGN AGREEMENT TO LOOSEN 23-MONTH-LONG STRANGLEHOLD OF SARAJEVO 
</P>

<P>
 Serbs and Muslims gave Sarajevo hope Thursday for an end to the city's 
crippling 23-month siege: a breakthrough agreement to partly open a road to the 
outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N.-brokered agreement, which also links divided sectors of the capital 
to civilian traffic, is the latest sign that the Bosnian war is winding down. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, officials on both sides warned the city was far from free or united, 
and some residents expressed skepticism after nearly two years of bloodletting 
among neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The siege will not be over until all citizens can be transported freely," 
Hasan Muratovic, the Bosnian minister for relations with the United Nations, 
said after signing the agreement.

GERGEN FEARS WHITEWATER COULD DERAIL CLINTON AGENDA; PRESIDENCY: IN AN 
INTERVIEW, HE SAYS NEW 'FULL DISCLOSURE' STRATEGY IS HELPING. HE LASHES OUT AT 
'CLINTON HATERS,' CAPITAL'S 'OVERHEATED ATMOSPHERE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Presidential Counselor David Gergen expressed serious concern Thursday that 
the continuing Whitewater controversy could undermine President Clinton's 
ability to carry out his domestic agenda -- including health care. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that a new White House strategy emphasizing "full disclosure" has 
finally enabled the White House to turn "a significant page" in its efforts to 
keep controversy over the failed Arkansas land deal from shifting the focus 
away from health care reform and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the Clintons had turned aside many Whitewater questions, declaring 
that they had done nothing wrong and did not need to discuss the matter. More 
recently, under pressure from Republicans and jarred by repeated press 
disclosures, the President shifted his approach. 
</P>
<P>
 He supported the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the 
controversy, endorsed a new White House memo forbidding any unauthorized 
contacts between officials and regulators looking into the matter and promised 
full cooperation with the special counsel and any congressional hearing that 
may occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and the First Lady also began to give interviews and conduct lengthy 
press conferences to field questions about their involvement in the development 
and their handling of it so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen, discussing Whitewater during a breakfast session with the Times 
Washington Bureau, emphasized the need for the White House to be open about 
Whitewater. But at the same time, he lashed out at "Clinton haters" and an 
"overheated atmosphere" in Washington in which political enemies circulate 
false rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen said one of the things that the White House has been trying to combat 
is "an element of Clinton haters out there who have been trying to stir up 
things and make trouble for a very long period of time. Some of that started 
before he became President." 
</P>
<P>
 Such attitudes have caused serious concern among prominent Democrats, 
including Robert S. Strauss, former party chairman. Strauss recently said that 
he believes disdain for the Clintons has been even more intense than the 
well-known enmity that extremists aimed at President Franklin D. Roosevelt and 
his wife, Eleanor, more than half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen suggested that, in today's modern political arena, people like Clinton 
who are "charismatic on television stir people up more." The vehemence of some 
of Clinton's critics, he said, reflects in part a historical pattern of 
presidents arousing intense hatred -- even violence -- when they advocate the 
kind of sweeping changes that Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's totally coincidental that the two (recent) presidents who 
have been shot -- (John F.) Kennedy and then (Ronald) Reagan -- were both 
charismatic figures on television," he said. "I think that they somehow draw 
people out in a different way. . . . And people have been out in Arkansas to 
'get' Bill Clinton for a long, long time, and we all know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen, a former Reagan aide who served as an aide to President Richard Nixon 
during the Watergate scandal, rejected GOP comparisons of Whitewater with 
Watergate. He pointed out that so far there have been no charges of wrongdoing 
in the Whitewater controversy, whereas in Watergate numerous laws were 
violated, and there were abuses of the FBI, the CIA and the IRS after Nixon's 
Committee for the Reelection of the President burglarized and placed electronic 
eavesdropping devices in Democratic Party offices in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Watergate, said Gergen, who was not involved in the scandal, "was a very 
traumatic period in the lives of a lot of us there, and we made some egregious 
mistakes, as you all know, some of which involved the use of institutions in 
violation of the law." In Whitewater, he said, there has been "no credible 
allegation of wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen said that, until the Whitewater controversy flared, the White House had 
hoped for the kind of bipartisanship that helped win passage of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement to provide a foundation for action this year on 
the crime bill. And the House's handling of that legislation, he said, will be 
the first real test of whether the two parties can work together on important 
issues in the current political climate. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he senses a deep-seated feeling across the country that it is "time to 
put aside a lot of the partisan bickering" that has been "paralyzing us as a 
city, as a society." 
</P>
<P>
 And he cited Los Angeles and its Republican mayor, Richard Riordan, as an 
example of a city where people have rejected partisanship in their efforts to 
deal with major problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mayor Riordan indicates that people are not anxious . . . to let the 
partisanship get in the way of trying to get some things done," Gergen said. 
"That's a good example of the new kind of politics people want to practice."

REAGAN GETTING 'STEAMED' AT NORTH OVER REPORTED IRAN-CONTRA REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Ronald Reagan joined the verbal battle in the Virginia Senate 
race Thursday, saying he was "getting pretty steamed" over what he said were 
false statements by Republican candidate Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
 North was fired from Reagan's National Security Council staff during the 
Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan's comments came in an exchange of letters with former Nevada Sen. Paul 
Laxalt, who supports North's GOP opponent, former Reagan budget chief James C. 
Miller III. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan accused North of lying about the Iran-Contra scandal but stopped short 
of endorsing Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I do have to admit that I am getting pretty steamed about the statements 
coming from Oliver North. I never instructed him or anyone in my Administration 
to mislead Congress on Iran-Contra matters or anything else," Reagan wrote. "I 
certainly did not know anything about the Iran-Contra diversion. And the 
private meetings he said he had with me just didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In a feisty response, North said political opponents had made "blatant and 
intentional misrepresentations of things I have said," in order to secure the 
letter from Reagan, "a President that I revere and admire." 
</P>
<P>
 Laxalt's letter to Reagan had noted that the former Marine lieutenant colonel 
wrote in his book, "Under Fire," that Reagan knew everything about Iran-Contra 
and that North said in a recent television interview that the former President 
directed him to lie to Congress about the arms-for-hostages scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) has said North should not be a candidate because 
of his felony convictions. Those convictions were overturned on appeal.IRAN

LAWYER SAYS HE HELPED MRS. CLINTON WITH INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton made nearly $100,000 in the commodities market 16 years 
ago with the help of a friend who was the top lawyer for Tyson Foods Inc., the 
lawyer said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 James B. Blair said he gave Mrs. Clinton advice on how to play the market and 
used his investing skills to help guide her through a series of trades in 
cattle futures, which can be risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would advise her whether to go long or stay out of the market," Blair told 
the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a modest amount of money . . . but it grew, and she probably made 
about $30,000 in 1978, maybe twice that in 1979," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times, which first reported on Mrs. Clinton's investments in 
today's editions, did not accuse Mrs. Clinton of any impropriety. The money she 
invested, starting just before Bill Clinton was elected governor in 1978, was 
her own. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the newspaper said the relationship put the Clintons in a position of 
relying on the help of Blair, whom it described as one of the state's premier 
powerbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
 During Clinton's tenure as governor, Tyson -- the nation's biggest poultry 
company and one of the largest employers in Arkansas -- benefited from a 
variety of state actions, including $9 million in government loans and 
favorable decisions on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has repeatedly defended the help given to Tyson as good for the 
state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 David Kendall, the Clintons' personal lawyer, gave the newspaper a statement 
saying Mrs. Clinton traded "with her own funds and assumed the full risk of 
loss." He said she reported gains and losses on her tax returns as appropriate.

SENATE OKS WHITEWATER RESOLUTION; CONGRESS: LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES REACH 
AGREEMENT ON WHEN TO HOLD HEARINGS. CLINTON AIDE STEPHANOPOULOS IS SUBPOENAED 
TO TESTIFY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate, after weeks of fierce partisan wrangling, unanimously approved a 
resolution late Thursday calling for eventual congressional hearings into the 
Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, adopted 98 to 0, said simply that the leadership of both 
parties "should meet and determine the appropriate timetable, procedures and 
forum" for hearings into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Whitewater developments Thursday, White House adviser George 
Stephanopoulos was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury called by Robert 
B. Fiske Jr., the Whitewater special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement Thursday night, Stephanopoulos said: "I welcome the 
opportunity to give Mr. Fiske the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven White House aides now have been subpoenaed to make grand jury 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum appeared before the grand jury 
earlier in the day to answer questions about whether the Administration 
interfered with an investigation by the Resolution Trust Corp. into Madison 
Guaranty Savings & Loan, the failed thrift linked to the Whitewater 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is looking into allegations that President Clinton and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton may have benefited improperly from their association during the late 
1970s and 1980s with James B. McDougal, owner of the thrift and partner with 
the Clintons in a failed Ozark real estate investment known as Whitewater 
Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske also is investigating the role played by Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law 
Firm in representing Whitewater and Madison Guaranty and the apparent suicide 
last July of Deputy White House Council Vincent Foster, who had worked on 
Whitewater as a Rose partner and later at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate resolution was the result of a compromise worked out during 
day-long negotiations between Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 After intense negotiations, the Republicans agreed to drop their demand for 
immediate hearings after getting a commitment from the Democrats to permit them 
at a later, although unspecified, date. 
</P>
<P>
 That left both sides able to claim victory -- with Republicans saying they had 
forced the Democrats to agree to hearings and the Democrats asserting that they 
were able to put them off until after Fiske finishes his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-binding resolution requires that the hearings "be structured and 
sequenced" so that they will not interfere with Fiske's investigation. Learning 
from a mistake made during the Iran-Contra hearings, it also pledged that no 
witnesses would be granted immunity in return for their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is not whether there should be oversight hearings, but whether 
there should be oversight hearings when the special counsel has said they might 
undermine his investigation," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), ranking Republican on the Senate Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, said he was satisfied because the 
agreement means that the Senate finally will investigate "the abuse of power" 
that he asserted Whitewater represents. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, an emotional D'Amato charged that the Democrats' refusal to consider 
hearings until Fiske had finished his investigation represented a political 
double standard. "If you'd had a Republican in the White House, you'd have had 
hearings at the drop of a hat," he thundered, punching the air with his fist, 
as he spoke on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 While Whitewater occupied center stage in the Senate, Fiske met with House GOP 
leaders in an effort to persuade them to delay plans to disclose information 
gathered by Republican investigators at a hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranking Republican on the House Banking Finance and Urban Affairs 
Committee, Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, repeated his contention that the hearing, 
tentatively scheduled for next Thursday, could turn out to be a "blockbuster" 
if all of the 40 witnesses he has requested are allowed to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leach also complained that Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) has not yet 
called any of the witnesses and other sources said that Gonzalez has indicated 
that he will not call them on the grounds that their testimony is irrelevant to 
the Resolution Trust Corp. oversight hearing scheduled by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach, who has been conducting his own investigation of Whitewater, has said 
that he has evidence senior officials of the RTC may have "coerced" field 
investigators examining the failure of Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the witnesses Republicans had hoped to call at the Banking Committee 
hearing are five investigators from the Kansas City RTC field office that was 
responsible for developing criminal referrals in the Madison Guaranty case. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske told reporters after meeting with Leach and Minority Leader Robert H. 
Michel (R-Ill.) that he had reiterated his objections to having witnesses 
testify before a congressional hearing until he has completed his criminal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said that he would consider dropping some of the witnesses on his list 
at Fiske's request. But he indicated that, if the Kansas City investigators are 
not allowed to testify, he will still use the hearing to outline their 
allegations. "I plan at the hearing to outline the precise nature of their 
relevance," Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the political infighting over Whitewater continued in the House and the 
Senate, Nussbaum and Clinton adviser Harold Ickes spent several hours 
testifying before a grand jury that is examining the propriety of several 
meetings Nussbaum and other Administration aides had with RTC officials who 
were investigating the Madison thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum, who resigned under fire earlier this month after word of the 
meetings became public, told reporters that every one in the White House 
counsel's office had behaved "ethically and legally" and were "delighted to 
cooperate" with the grand jury because, "We have nothing to be ashamed of." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've responded to every question they put to me," Nussbaum added as he left 
the federal courthouse.

HOUSE PANEL OKS ANTI-CRIME PACKAGE; LEGISLATION: THE 13 BILLS INCLUDE 'THREE 
STRIKES' MEASURE AND A PREVENTION PROGRAM. VOTING FALLS ALONG PARTY LINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Moving swiftly to put a crime bill on the House floor before Congress' Easter 
recess, the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved a package of 13 
anti-crime bills, including a modified version of the "three strikes" 
legislation and a $6.3-billion crime prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee voted to authorize $3 billion to help states build prisons and 
to expand the federal death penalty to cover more than 50 crimes, including 
major drug dealing and espionage that results in the death of an American 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Votes on the separate bills were mainly along party lines, foreshadowing floor 
fights next week over tougher provisions that Republicans failed to get 
approved but are expected to offer again. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democratic leaders wanted to give rank-and-file members a chance to tell 
voters during the two-week spring break that they had approved President 
Clinton's crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 By a vote of 27 to 8, the panel approved a bill to impose mandatory life 
imprisonment without parole for criminals convicted of three violent crimes or 
of two violent crimes and a serious drug offense -- provided the third crime 
was one of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee modified the "three strikes" provision, however, to allow 
inmates older than 70 who had served 30 years in prison to be released if they 
pose no threat to society. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), who is 71, drew laughter when he remarked: "I 
can tell you that at age 70, you're not near as dangerous as you'd like to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials and other critics of the three-time-loser provision have 
warned that it could turn federal prisons into high-cost geriatric wards. The 
panel earlier rejected a proposal to allow the release of prisoners at age 60 
if they had served 25 years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the House bill is less sweeping than the legislation approved by 
the Senate in November. As soon as the House approves its version of the 
legislation, a Senate-House conference will meet to work out a compromise 
between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred on by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, the House panel included a 
multibillion-dollar program of grants to crime-prone areas. The grants would go 
for recreation, job training and other activities designed to steer young 
people away from lives of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans decried the $6.3-billion grant package as "vague and fuzzy" but 
did not attempt to defeat it or trim it back in committee, postponing serious 
opposition until the legislation reaches the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, on a 25-10 vote, approved dozens of additions to the list of 
crimes warranting the death penalty. They include drive-by killings, 
carjackings that result in death, and leading large narcotics rings with yearly 
revenues of $20 million or more -- even if no homicide is committed. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee rejected, 24-11, an attempt by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) to 
knock out all federal death penalties and substitute life imprisonment without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on another controversial provision, the committee modified a 
Senate-passed provision to require federal courts to prosecute 13-year-olds and 
14-year-olds as adults if they are charged with serious, violent crimes. The 
House panel changed the provision to allow prosecutors to decide whether such 
teen-agers should be tried as adults or follow procedures for juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 Projected cost of the legislation is $22 billion, with the lion's share going 
to put 100,000 more police officers on the streets and to provide grants to 
states for new prisons for violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation authorizes $3.4 billion for rehabilitation of criminals, 
including $1 billion for treatment of drug addicts in prison and $1.6 billion 
for "drug courts" that would provide supervised treatment outside of prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would come from funds the government would save through a 
much-touted plan to reduce the federal work force by 252,000 employees over the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Steven H. Schiff (R-N.M.) described the rush to fund crime prevention, 
strongly backed by the Clinton Administration and liberal Democrats, as "a 
license to raid the Treasury for anything and everything if you can say it's 
for fighting crime."

U.S. AGENCIES TO HELP IN FIGHT ON CRIME IN CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The FBI, U.S. Capitol Police, Park Police, the uniformed division of the 
Secret Service and the Drug Enforcement Agency will assist local police in 
fighting violent and drug-related crime in the nation's capital, federal 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers will be deployed in Washington neighborhoods to supplement local 
police in the District of Columbia, where 87 people have been slain already 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondary support will be provided by the Internal Revenue Service, the 
Federal Protective Service, the Customs Agency, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service and the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Ohlson, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, declined to elaborate 
on the role of each agency. But many will have arrest authority and other local 
police authority, other officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly proposed increased federal assistance in November 
after President Clinton refused her request for D.C. National Guard troops to 
supplement the city's 4,213 police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, to be announced today by U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr., the 
federal agencies will target specific police districts where their assistance 
and expertise are specially suited. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Capitol Police will provide second response and canine assistance 
in the area surrounding the federal enclave and Capitol Hill. They also have 
been given the same authority as D.C. police to handle violent crime throughout 
the city.

BABBITT TRIES AGAIN TO REFORM GRAZING RULES, RAISE FEES; RANCHING: THIRD 
PROPOSAL FAILS TO PLEASE ENVIRONMENTALISTS OR LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS. BUT 
CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES SAY THE PLAN WILL GO INTO EFFECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt on Thursday announced his third attempt to 
reform use of federal lands by ranchers -- a proposal that would double grazing 
fees -- but neither environmentalists nor livestock producers were pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides doubling fees that most ranchers pay to graze sheep and cattle on 
federal land, the plan would institute management reforms to improve the 
environmental health of the public ranges. But it also includes concessions 
sought by ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists charged that the package falls short by failing to ban 
grazing and order restoration of some highly eroded lands. Some expressed 
concerns that the package would continue to give ranching communities the 
strongest voice in setting local standards for the environmental management of 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranchers, in addition to decrying fee increases, are furious that the proposal 
allows environmentalists residing outside their states to play a role in 
setting standards for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranchers, joined by several senators from Western states, also objected 
that the package would impose universal standards and guidelines for the 
management of national lands. While Babbitt said he had altered his plans so 
the guidelines would be more flexible, ranchers called them "cookie-cutter 
standards" that will not fit the peculiarities of individual states. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the unhappiness, however, congressional observers predicted that the 
proposal would go into effect. It does not require congressional approval and 
could be in place by the end of this year, Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of the House Natural Resources 
Committee, said the proposal is not all he would like, but he praised it as an 
important step toward reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not as sweeping as we would have preferred," he said. "But given the 
necessity of balancing very polarized interests, the secretary has done a very 
impressive job of negotiating these reforms, and we want to work with him to 
implement them. Nobody is 100% satisfied, but anyone who thinks nothing's been 
done here is not looking at the same set of regulations that we are." 
</P>
<P>
 An increase in grazing fees would end what many regard as government largess 
that has outlived its purpose of encouraging settlement in the Western states. 
Each new proposal for the fees, however, has whittled away at the size of the 
increase and slightly shrunk the scope of other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest package would charge most ranchers $3.96 to graze an "animal unit 
month" -- a measure defined as five sheep or a cow and her calf grazing for a 
month -- on most of the 272 million acres of grassland owned by the federal 
government. The fee increases would be phased in over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranchers now pay as little as $1.86 per animal unit month, while government 
and private experts have assessed the monthly fair-market value of such use at 
$5 to $12. A proposal Babbitt put forth in August would have raised the rates 
to $4.28 in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, the third year of hikes could be re-evaluated if, as 
ranchers charge, the increase has a "significant negative impact" on ranchers' 
operations. The proposal does not explain how those effects would be measured. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to give ranchers incentives to improve the environment of the 
grazing lands, Babbitt also would offer those who meet higher environmental 
standards a rate of $2.77 per animal unit month. The government has yet to 
decide on those higher standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt's latest proposal also would abolish grazing advisory boards, which 
are rancher-dominated groups that have effectively decided who could graze 
livestock on public lands and how. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, those boards would be replaced by 15-member "multiple resource 
advisory councils." They would be made up of five environmentalists, five state 
or local officials or users of public lands and five representatives of the 
local commodity industries -- such as grazing, mining or timber.

EINSTEIN COLLEGE TO PAY $900,000 IN SEX BIAS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a court settlement that feminist organizations hailed as a bittersweet 
victory, Albert Einstein College in New York has agreed to pay $900,000 to end 
a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by a former researcher, principles in the 
case said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement brings to a close seven years of legal battles that began when 
Dr. Heidi S. Weissmann filed a lawsuit alleging that she had been wrongly 
discharged after being denied equal pay, promotions, raises and a sabbatical 
because she is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, which assisted 
Weissmann in the lawsuit, said the settlement is the largest known in a medical 
school sex discrimination case and would help "shatter the glass ceiling" for 
women in the medical field. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the college, however, said the settlement does not admit 
wrongdoing by the defendants. The school wanted to take the lawsuit to trial, 
he said, but agreed to settle to avoid prolonging the case and adding to legal 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Weissmann was hired in 1979 by Albert Einstein College, a school within 
Yeshiva University/Montefiore Medical Center. She was promoted to associate 
professor of nuclear medicine in 1984 and was promoted again to the radiology 
department two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal battle began in 1987 when Weissmann, now 43, filed an equal 
opportunity complaint against the college and her supervisor, Dr. Leonard 
Freeman. The college later placed her on probation and fired her in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Weissmann responded by filing a lawsuit claiming sex discrimination and 
wrongful discharge. Weissmann said Thursday that she rejected an offer from the 
college to settle the lawsuit in 1989 because the agreement would have barred 
her from discussing the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "By demanding gag orders, universities have robbed women of our history, the 
knowledge of other women's courage and success in fighting systemic 
discrimination, and our momentum for social change," Weissmann said Thursday. 
"I was determined that this would not happen yet again." 
</P>
<P>
 Weissmann said she has not been able to find a job in the medical field since 
suing the university. She said that part of her award, which she estimates will 
total $575,000 after paying legal costs, will go toward establishing a network 
and resource center to help women and whistle-blowers who face similar 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Smeal criticized the university for not taking any disciplinary action against 
Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the college, Philip R. Forlenza, denied Weissmann's claims, 
saying she was not qualified for the job at the time of her promotion and did 
not follow through on her commitment to obtain the qualifications.

$417 MILLION MORE OKD FOR AID TO QUAKE VICTIMS; ASSISTANCE: CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION APPROVES MONEY FOR LOW-INTEREST LOANS AND GRANTS. AMOUNT 
INCLUDES $47.5 MILLION FOR NEW VA FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Faced with a continuing influx of applications for aid from homeowners and 
businesses, the Clinton Administration announced Thursday that it is making 
$417 million in new emergency loans and grants available to victims of the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistance includes $326 million in low-interest loans to repair and 
rebuild homes and businesses under the auspices of the Small Business 
Administration and $90.8 million that was previously approved by Congress as 
part of a presidential contingency fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest grant will be $47.5 million to build a Veterans Affairs outpatient 
care and research facility to replace the 431-bed, quake-devastated hospital at 
the Sepulveda VA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The money for the grants is part of a $550-million contingency fund that was 
included in the congressionally approved $8.6-billion quake aid package but was 
left to President Clinton's discretion to spend. The new loans will be 
supported by $75 million remaining from a 1992 emergency spending measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget Director Leon E. Panetta said that the enormous number of applications 
to the SBA -- which are still arriving at a rate of 3,000 a day two months 
after the Jan. 17 temblor -- could mean that additional money will be needed to 
meet the agency's obligations. He indicated that the money could come from 
other programs, including $447 million remaining in contingency funds, or might 
require the Administration to seek new money from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA has received nearly 400,000 requests for applications. It was given 
loan authority of $1.1 billion in the emergency earthquake bill. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the SBA has approved $410.2 million in loans to cover damage to homes 
and personal property and $39.8 million for businesses, although only a small 
fraction of applicants have received checks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Panetta said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
which coordinates the federal disaster response and also provides short-term 
shelter and other aid, does not appear to be in danger of running short of 
money. FEMA received $4.7 billion in the emergency spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster agency reported Thursday that it has received 454,650 
applications for relief. Thus far, it has approved $472.9 million in grants to 
183,065 applicants for temporary housing and emergency home repairs.

 Air Force experts are checking for radioactive contamination at the site where 
a plane carrying an atomic bomb crashed in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists began collecting soil, water and vegetation samples for testing 
this week where the B-29 went down, killing 12 people and injuring 60 
others.The area is 50 miles northeast of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force confirmed last month that the plane had been on a secret mission 
and carried an atomic bomb, with its nuclear core removed but containing 
depleted uranium. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after the crash, Travis Elementary School was built about 100 yards 
from the crash site. The school has been closed for renovation for the past 
year and is scheduled to reopen in September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we don't see any need for the public to be concerned, 
especially about the area of the Travis Elementary School," base spokeswoman 
Lt. Nicole Foster said Thursday during a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gene Bonano, a health physicist from Brooks Air Force Base in Texas, said 
preliminary tests have revealed nothing so far. He said the likelihood of a 
health hazard from the crash is minimal.

 A Santa Ana man and his wife were released Thursday after Orange County 
authorities said they lacked evidence to charge the couple with shooting his 
mother to death on an apartment balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos Alvarez Roque and Maria Bruno Soto, both 24, had been arrested on 
Wednesday on suspicion of homicide.His mother, Valentina Roque, 55, was killed 
Sunday night by what police initially believed was random gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after the shooting, a tearful Roque had called for an end to 
gun violence. Police later said his account of the incident conflicted with his 
wife's and with evidence investigators discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Clyde Von Der Ahe said there was 
"insufficient evidence" to hold them. He added that the investigation is 
continuing.

 Santa Ana police Lt. Robert Helton said Thursday that his investigators are 
"convinced the shooting took place in the apartment."

ALLEGED SMUGGLER HELD AS CAR WITH 13 PASSENGERS CRASHES; CRIME: TWO PEOPLE 
SUFFER MINOR INJURIES WHEN AUTO HITS FREEWAY GUARDRAIL AFTER POLICE CHASE AT UP 
TO 110 M.P.H.

<P>
 A suspected smuggler of illegal immigrants was in federal custody Thursday 
after a high-speed chase across three counties that ended with the crash of a 
car that was jammed with 14 people, including four hidden in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people suffered minor injuries Wednesday night when the overloaded 1978 
automobile, driven by Jose Hernandez-Serrano, 28, of Pueblo, Mexico, smashed 
into a freeway guardrail in Santa Fe Springs, according to the California 
Highway Patrol and federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez-Serrano was taken into federal custody on charges of felony 
transportation of illegal immigrants after he and 13 other people emerged from 
the wreck. The CHP said the passengers from Mexico included two children -- 2 
and 3 years old -- and 11 adults, four of whom were riding in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the federal smuggling charges, Hernandez-Serrano faces state felony 
charges of causing injuries while evading arrest and driving recklessly, CHP 
Sgt. John Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase and crash occurred a week after a pickup rolled over near Barstow, 
killing 12 passengers who were illegal immigrants. The compact truck, equipped 
with a camper shell, was crammed with a driver and 19 people from Central 
America.  
</P>
<P>
 The chase involving the CHP and Hernandez-Serrano reached speeds up to 110 
m.p.h., said Jim Hayes, assistant district director of anti-smuggling for the 
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said that during the chase, the four immigrants hiding in the trunk of 
the car began pounding in terror on the inside of the vehicle in a futile 
effort to get the driver to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hernandez-Serrano), in order to serve the greed of these alien smugglers, 
was willing to initiate a high-speed chase with law enforcement officers with 
the risk of killing as many as 13 other people," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the immigrants had crossed the border Monday and hid in a house in San 
Diego until Wednesday night, when smugglers crammed them into the old car for 
the trip to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began about 11 p.m., Sellers said, when the CHP received a call 
reporting reckless driving on Interstate 15 near Temecula in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 When a CHP unit tried to stop Hernandez-Serrano, he sped up and headed west on 
California 91, authorities said. As the car sped through various CHP 
jurisdictions, Highway Patrol units dropped out and others took over the chase. 
</P>
<P>
 The car left California 91 and cut north on the Santa Ana Freeway in Orange 
County and crashed into a guardrail when it tried to head south on the San 
Gabriel River Freeway at Santa Fe Springs in Los Angeles County, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the passengers were treated for minor injuries and were released from a 
local hospital before federal authorities arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the other immigrants are to be deported to Mexico, but two or three 
will be kept in federal custody to testify against Hernandez-Serrano, Hayes 
said.

VENTURA D.A. IS SUED OVER REPORT ON RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One year after being criticized by Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury for his role in the shooting death of a Malibu-area millionaire during 
a drug raid, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy has sued Bradbury for 
defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court by Deputy 
Gary Spencer, also accuses Bradbury and four of his staff members of libel, 
slander, inflicting emotional distress and several civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer is seeking undisclosed compensatory and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is the latest in a series of developments since the Oct. 2, 1992 
death of Donald P. Scott, 61, heir to a Europe-based chemical fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott was shot and killed by Spencer during the raid on Scott's 200-acre ranch 
across the Ventura County line from Malibu. No drugs were found, but Scott was 
armed and had high levels of alcohol and Valium in his body, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason why it was filed was to vindicate Gary Spencer's name," Spencer's 
attorney, Jeff Giordano, said Thursday of the lawsuit. "I think at the end of 
the day the irony will be that it's Mike Bradbury, and not Deputy Spencer, who 
will have lost his moral compass." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury repeatedly has referred to Spencer as "a good officer . . . who lost 
his moral compass," the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury on Thursday refused to comment on the lawsuit. But Noel Klebaum, an 
assistant counsel for Ventura County, said "many of the allegations in the 
complaint are simply dead wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury's 64-page report blamed Scott's death on the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department and said Spencer may have lied to get the warrant for the 
search of Scott's ranch. However, the report said Spencer was justified in 
shooting Scott because Scott was armed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury's findings angered Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and led 
to a two-month review of the case by state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Lungren issued a report disputing Bradbury's report and 
essentially clearing Spencer and other law enforcement officers who 
participated in the raid of any wrongdoing. Lungren also concluded that 
Bradbury's report contained "unsupported and provocative language." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also accused Bradbury of having a "cozy relationship" with Venice 
attorney Stephen Yagman, who represents the Scott estate. In a letter written 
to Bradbury last March, Yagman referred to the Ventura County prosecutor as 
"Mike." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Mr. Yagman and defendant Bradbury were on a first-name basis 
and had contact prior to the issuance of defendants' report speaks to an 
appearance of impropriety," the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman denied the charge.

DRASTIC CHANGES IN U.S. SECRECY RULES EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of an overhaul of secrecy rules urged by President Clinton, the 
National Security Council has drafted an order that would make public millions 
of documents from the Cold War and slash the number of new secret records, it 
has been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times said in today's editions that the order would require the 
declassification of secret records after 25 years, while newly created secret 
documents would be declassified after 10 years at most. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the prevailing executive order issued by the Ronald Reagan 
Administration, the presumption was that most secret documents would remain so 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the head of an agency would have the power to stop a document's release 
under the new order, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 It added that the order would create the least secretive policy on government 
records since the birth of the nation's modern national security apparatus in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton signs the draft order, as expected, the new rules could begin to 
take effect by the end of the year, the newspaper said.UNITED STATES

STATE SEARCHES TEXACO OFFICES IN SPILL INQUIRY; POLLUTION: PROSECUTORS SAY 
LEAKAGE WAS SERIOUS AND COULD LEAD TO FELONY CHARGES. COMPANY DENIES 
ALLEGATIONS THAT IT FAILED TO REPORT CONTAMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State investigators have concluded that 370,000 gallons of a toxic 
gasoline-like liquid leaked from a corroded oil field pipeline near Ventura, 
and prosecutors are considering felony charges against Texaco officials for 
allegedly concealing what may be the largest oil-related spill in Ventura 
County history. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Fish and Game investigators searched offices at Texaco's 
Ventura field for a third day Thursday, seeking evidence that oil company 
officials discovered the spill long before they reported it to authorities in 
January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators allege in a search warrant affidavit that Texaco officials 
waited until they could no longer conceal the massive leak before reporting it 
as a small spill, then secretly repaired their pipeline to avoid 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 So much of the liquid leaked that it was floating 25 feet thick atop an 
underground water basin when it was discovered. It will take years to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Texaco probably knew that the material would not remain in one spot, that it 
would travel underground down the canyon and to the open creek and eventually 
to the Ventura River," said Fish and Game spokesman Bob Schlicting, 
paraphrasing his department's affidavit in support of the searches. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco spokeswoman Faye Cox said the company reported the spill promptly to 
state authorities and has cooperated fully in trying to clean up the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dismayed by the D.A.'s and Fish and Game's action, but are cooperating 
fully with the investigation," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The basis for possible felony charges would be that Texaco knowingly 
discharged a toxic substance onto private property and into state waters. Some 
of the leaked substance was flushed into a nearby creek and the Ventura River 
during rainstorms, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco could be forced to pay stiff fines and company officials could face 
three years in prison if such charges are filed and proved.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Thursday that they have just begun to examine evidence 
gathered over the last year by state Fish and Game, the lead investigative 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental cost of the spill is still unknown, authorities said. But 
the potential for problems is high, said Reed Smith, a pollution response 
coordinator for Fish and Game. "This stuff is really hot," he said. "It's an 
extremely toxic material." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the four components of the liquid are known or suspected carcinogens, 
and benzene and toluene can also cause nervous system disorders. Ethylbenzene 
is a nervous system depressant and xylene may produce pulmonary edema. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators said they do not know how much of the 370,000 gallons of 
lightweight, colorless natural gas condensate leaked into nearby School Canyon 
Creek, nor what its effect has been downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Correspondent Julie Fields also contributed to this story. Spill Site 
</P>
<P>
 At least 370,000 gallons -- or 8,800 barrels -- of a petroleum byproduct 
leaked, state officials said, from a corroded pipeline at a Texaco production 
plant in north Ventura. Cleanup of the underground spill could take three 
years.

LAX ACCOUNTING BLAMED IN $425,000 EMBEZZLEMENT; THEFT: AUDIT SHOWS THAT A UC 
SANTA CRUZ EMPLOYEE ORDERED AND CASHED PHONY HONORARIUM CHECKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A number of fundamental accounting lapses allowed a UC Santa Cruz 
administrative assistant to embezzle more than $425,000 over four years by 
ordering and endorsing phony speaking honorariums, according to an audit 
presented Thursday to University of California regents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Nicholls, 53, an employee of the campus' student services office, pleaded 
no contest in February and was convicted on 13 counts of grand theft, said 
Santa Cruz County Assistant Dist. Atty. Gary Brayton. She will be sentenced 
March 28 and faces up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Brayton said Nicholls was able to bilk the university because of 
"extraordinarily sloppy accounting and auditing procedures" at the Santa Cruz 
campus. During the time she was stealing funds, Nicholls was responsible for 
authorizing the checks, collecting them and reconciling them on university 
ledgers, campus officials concede. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit also noted that Nicholls was in line to be fired some time ago 
because her job performance was deemed "unacceptable because of errors and 
omissions," and her manager twice had her train potential replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theft occurred as a result of an individual gaining knowledge of 
weaknesses in her unit and campus internal controls and misusing her authority 
to request and obtain payments," the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 UC spokesman Jim Burns said Nicholls was fired in October and her supervisor 
was reassigned. Since then, the university has instituted more stringent 
accounting procedures, including dividing authority for ordering and handling 
such checks between two people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholls stole $429,975 between July 20, 1989, and Sept. 20, 1993, by ordering 
202 phony checks -- 199 for phantom guest lecturers and three for fictitious 
travel advances. At first, she picked up the checks personally from the campus 
payroll department but later had them sent to her by campus mail, the audit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her actions were not questioned because she was well known and the initial 
checks were for small amounts, the audit said. The checks were made out to 
fictitious names, and Nicholls then forged the name of the payee and cashed 
them at a market near her home or deposited them in her checking account, the 
audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The checks she deposited had "indecipherable circular signatures," and it was 
her bank that first raised questions last September about the number of 
third-party checks she brought in, said Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Brayton said it is still a mystery as to how Nicholls, who earned 
between $25,000 and $30,000 a year, spent the embezzled money, except that she 
gave much of it to relatives, especially her son. Despite taking large amounts 
of cash, he said Nicholls drove an older model car and lived in an $800-a-month 
rental. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't any evidence of flashy convertibles and flying off to Tahiti," 
he said. "There was no evidence of that kind of extravagance."

TWO O.C. CONGRESSMEN WIN LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Orange County congressmen claimed victories Thursday when House and Senate 
committees approved two separate bills aimed at imposing the death penalty in 
spy cases and reforming the federal budget process. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the recent arrest of CIA employee Aldrich H. Ames as an alleged 
spy for the former Soviet Union and Russia, the House Judiciary Committee 
approved an amendment drafted by Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) calling 
for the death penalty for espionage that results in the death of an individual 
acting on behalf of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment, approved by a voice vote, was offered on behalf of Dornan by 
Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), a member of the Judiciary Committee. The legislation 
will be included as part of a comprehensive crime bill to be considered by the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, said the Ames 
case demonstrated the need for the legislation since it is now suspected that 
as many as 10 Soviet citizens may have been executed as the result of 
disclosures allegedly made by Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated matter, Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) won the Senate 
Budget Committee's approval of a resolution aimed at reforming the federal 
budget process. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion by Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) -- identical to Cox's resolution 
adopted last week in the House -- calls for an end to "baseline budgeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Under current budgeting practice, a spending increase that is scaled back is 
considered a "cut." Cox said the President should submit a budget that compares 
the proposed spending levels for the next year with the current year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, a member of the House Budget Committee, said that under the current 
rules, Congress claimed in 1990 and 1993 to be cutting a total of $1 trillion 
when the actual spending will probably go up by more than twice that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a victory for integrity and common sense," Cox said. "We should 
recognize increases in spending for what they are."

CHEMICAL FIRM WINS RULING ON DAMAGES AT LOVE CANAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Occidental Chemical Corp. does not have to pay New York punitive damages for 
the Love Canal contamination that forced hundreds of people to abandon their 
homes, a judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 New York had sought penalties of up to $250 million from Occidental, the 
corporate successor to Hooker Chemicals & Plastics Corp., which dumped 22,000 
tons of hazardous waste at Love Canal in the 1940s and 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge John Curtin said state prosecutors failed to prove 
that the company showed "reckless disregard for the safety of others." 
</P>
<P>
 Hooker buried waste at Love Canal using disposal techniques that were 
acceptable for the era, Curtin said in his 190-page ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 He criticized the company for failing to warn Love Canal residents about the 
dangers of chemicals stored at the site, where homes were built in the 1950s. 
But he said Hooker was under no obligation to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing stinks, man," said Lois Gibbs, who led a homeowners' group that 
pushed New York and the federal government to buy their houses and relocate 
their families in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that was you or me who did these things, we would go to jail. We would be 
punished, which is what punitive damages are for," said Gibbs, now an 
environmental lobbyist in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental Chemical President J. Roger Hirl hailed the ruling. "You cannot 
judge people or companies based on today's knowledge for actions taken 40 to 50 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtin is still considering Occidental's claim that the federal, state and 
local governments should share in the cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and federal governments sued Occidental for cleanup costs and 
interest, which could total $350 million. Under the Superfund law, Occidental 
is liable for at least part of the cleanup.

COURT UPHOLDS SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION

<P>
 The state's 4-year-old law requiring sex offenders to register with the police 
is constitutional, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In its decision, the court said the statute did not violate the ban against 
applying laws after the fact, nor did it deny sex offenders due process or 
equal protection. 
</P>
<P>
 It rejected the argument that the requirement puts a "badge of infamy" on 
offenders.

VALLEY COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO REPLACE PIERCE HEAD; EDUCATION: BOTH SUFFERED 
FACULTY NO-CONFIDENCE MOTIONS. ERICKSON SAYS DISTRICT'S FINANCIAL TROUBLES ARE 
A CENTRAL FACTOR IN HIS DEPARTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 The president of Pierce College, the target of a no-confidence motion by his 
faculty last fall, is leaving and being replaced by the president of Valley 
College -- herself the object of a no-confidence vote by that school's faculty 
after the January quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Community College District officials will formally announce today 
that Pierce President Lowell Erickson will take a leave of absence and his post 
will be assumed by Valley College President Mary Lee, said district spokesman 
Fausto Capobianco Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming change was confirmed by the presidents of both 16,000-student 
campuses, both of whom said the no-confidence motions had no affect on their 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson said that his leave of absence is probably permanent and that he 
would probably not return to the nine-campus district, to which both schools 
belong. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake and budget problems have been factors in the decision but not 
the no-confidence vote by the faculty," said Erickson, 58. The Pierce faculty 
had scheduled a vote on a no-confidence motion in October, but the formal 
balloting was first postponed, and then apparently dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, 54, who has been president of Valley College for 13 years, was criticized 
by her faculty for reopening the Van Nuys campus two days after the 
6.8-magnitude Northridge earthquake Jan. 17. Some 88 of 90 participating 
faculty members voted for the no-confidence motion last month, contending that 
it was still unclear whether campus buildings -- which apparently were not 
seriously damaged -- were safe, and that teachers and students needed more time 
to grapple with quake damage in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson cited several reasons for leaving, primarily the district's dwindling 
financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
 He described the faculty no-confidence motion last fall as born of the same 
frustration he felt over budget shortfalls and enrollment losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty members at both colleges expressed surprise. At least one Pierce 
instructor expressed glee at Erickson's departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not pleased with Lowell's performance," said Mary Duxler, a speech and 
communications instructor at Pierce and an Academic Senate member. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't do anything. Decisions were made without faculty input. There 
wasn't any interest in what we were doing or any new programs. I didn't see him 
at faculty meetings, and he never once came to my department for any reason 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Duxler said she would be pleased to work under Lee, whom she described as a 
"strong leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce Academic Senate President Ronald Smetzer took a more conciliatory tone: 
"I liked Lowell," Smetzer said. "Some people are going to be unhappy no matter 
who is in there. And I certainly have my concerns knowing that Mary Lee 
received a no-confidence vote over at Valley, and that may affect how she deals 
with faculty at Pierce. But it may not." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Sterk, faculty president at Valley College, said Lee made the 
announcement as the monthly College Council meeting ended late Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was shocked," Sterk said. "No one knew what to say -- whether to say 
congratulations or say nothing. So we said nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Sterk said relations on the campus have been chilly since the faculty voted no 
confidence in Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lee denied that there was any connection between the vote and her decision 
to take the position at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the faculty members) were surprised. This has nothing to do with the 
vote of no confidence -- that was a small group of faculty. That's irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who has been an administrator at Valley College since 1978, said she was 
looking forward to taking the reins at Pierce, which began as an agricultural 
school, operating its own large farm, and still has classes in farm, crop and 
veterinary subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major issues facing the school is the future of the large swath of 
pasture land in a high-cost area of Woodland Hills, a tract that neighbors 
cherish as open space but that attracts frequent proposals for more lucrative 
use, such as a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Pierce is a unique institution and with the farm and the location the 
potential is unending," Lee said in a phone interview. "I've taken 24 units of 
agriculture. I live on horse property in Chatsworth. It is a wonderful 
opportunity for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson has worked for the community college district in various capacities 
since he was hired as the district director of public information in 1973. He 
came to Pierce College in May, 1991, from Mission College in Sylmar, where he 
was also president. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyree Wieder, 46, vice president of academic affairs at Valley College, will 
replace Lee as acting president. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, who grew up in South-Central Los Angeles, has been with the community 
college district since 1981, starting at Mission College. She has worked at 
Valley College since August, 1990.

SIMI MAN, 71, DIES OF VALLEY FEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 71-year-old Simi Valley man has died of Valley fever, a respiratory illness 
that may have been caused by the Northridge earthquake, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Walter Cole, a retired maintenance worker, was diagnosed in February 
with the disease, which is contracted by breathing airborne spores that grow in 
the soil. He died March 2 in a North Hollywood hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials have speculated that the Jan. 17 earthquake kicked up 
fungus-laden dust that has infected residents in the San Fernando Valley and 
eastern half of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centers for Disease Control has reported 170 cases of Valley fever in 
Ventura County since the earthquake, more than half of them in Simi Valley, 
said Gary Feldman, director of the Ventura County Department of Health. Cole's 
death is the only reported fatality, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of dust all over Simi Valley, maybe this was why he was 
infected," said Rana Hajjeh, an epidemiologist with the Atlanta-based Centers 
for Disease Control, who added that Cole had other health problems that might 
have put him at risk. "He was a diabetic, and diabetes sometimes can weaken 
your immune response." 
</P>
<P>
 Cole's wife, Hazel, said her husband had a high fever and flu-like symptoms 
when he went to the emergency room Feb. 10. He was sent home after being 
diagnosed with pneumonia. Two days later, he returned to the hospital with a 
103.6-degree fever and was admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he left, he just said, 'See you tonight or in a couple of days.' That's 
how sure he was that it wasn't serious," Hazel Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 He weakened quickly, however, in the hospital and died March 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just took over," said Cole's stepson, Raymond Dempsey. "The doctors tried 
everything they could to stop it. But it just spread so fast. Like wildfire. We 
knew it was just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey, who also lives in Simi Valley, said family members immediately 
suspected the earthquake was to blame for Cole's illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time the ground shook, you could see the dust rising from the hills," 
he said. "The grayish, black clouds were everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said the health department, which is investigating a possible link 
between the earthquake and the rise in Valley fever cases, plans to test 450 
randomly selected Simi Valley residents to determine the magnitude of exposure 
in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we're trying to find out is what the base infection rate 
is," he said. "We're trying to find out to what degree the earthquake has 
contributed to the outbreak of Valley fever. This is truly a new phenomenon, 
that is to say there's never been an outbreak attributed to an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said those who test positive for Valley fever would be interviewed "to 
look at factors they were exposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of Valley fever cases for Ventura County is dramatically 
above normal -- there were only 52 cases reported in 1993, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control -- health officials stress that death is uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even (among) those people who were sick enough to come to medical attention, 
very severe illness or fatality is quite rare," Feldman said. "To the ordinary 
person, the risk is really quite low, so much so that most people don't realize 
they have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Patients with Valley fever report flu-like symptoms such as headaches, coughs, 
fatigue and muscle aches, said Susan Reef, a physician with the Centers for 
Disease Control.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think what is important to know is that 60% (of those infected) have no 
symptoms," Reef said. "Only 0.5 -- that's less than 1% -- have the form that 
goes throughout the body." 
</P>
<P>
 But health officials are taking note anyway. The Centers for Disease Control, 
which has set up a Valley fever hot line, released a report Thursday that 
addresses the outbreak of the disease. The hot line number is (404) 332-4554. 
</P>
<P>
 "The increase in cases follows the Jan. 17 earthquake centered in Northridge, 
which may have exposed Ventura County residents to increased levels of airborne 
dust," the report states. "The California Department of Health Services, local 
public agencies and the CDC are conducting an investigation to determine the 
magnitude of the outbreak, risk factors for infection and its possible 
association with the Northridge earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Health Department's Simi Valley study could begin as early 
as Monday, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do a skin test first (that) shows whether a person has ever had 
experience with Valley fever," he said. Those who test positive will be asked 
to take a blood test that would indicate the time of exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said it will take the department about a week to conduct interviews 
and tests. County health officials don't expect to have any conclusions for at 
least two months, he said.

STUDENT EXCHANGES; AMERICAN, JAPANESE PUPILS GET A TASTE OF EACH OTHER'S 
CULTURES 
</P>

 It is lunchtime at Osaka Sangyo University in Studio City and students begin 
gathering at tables in the grassy lunch area.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hey man, what's up?" 13-year-old Jon Stoll calls out to a slight Japanese 
teen-ager. Takeshi Nagatomo, 17, looks up, unsure of what the American youth is 
saying. "No! I mean, how are you," Jon explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Still slightly confused, Takeshi raises his hand and slaps him a high five, a 
move he learned only a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The two students, from different continents, are making the best of a bad 
situation. The more than 200 kindergarten through eighth-grade students from 
St. Michael and All Angels Episcopal Church school were displaced by the Jan. 
17 earthquake and have been renting 15 classrooms at nearby Osaka. Meanwhile, 
54 students from Japan arrived on campus last week for intensive English and 
cultural awareness classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The mix has made for a unique cultural experience for both groups -- and 
important questions like "Do Super Mario Bros. video games come in Japanese?" 
and "How do you make an origami bird?" are being answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had our choice we would be at the old school," said Jim Lusby, 
headmaster at St. Michael's. "But we are here and we are having this great 
extra-cultural benefit with the Japanese students." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, and they are way more polite than us," Josh Rothman, 14, piped in. "And 
smarter, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese students, here for three weeks as part of their International 
Course at Osaka Toin High School in Osaka, Japan, have studied English for the 
past four years, "but they don't know how to converse because it is all book 
learning in Japan," said William Price, director of English education at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter St. Michael's students. They are the perfect group to practice newly 
acquired English skills on. "English is easy to understand when they speak it," 
said 17-year-old Sei Morimoto who, like all of his classmates, has been paired 
with a St. Michael's student during his stay. "My partner is only 12 and he was 
such a deep thinker. I was surprised."  
</P>
<P>
 In one corner of the lunch area, a group of American teen-agers is teaching 
Sei another important lesson. When asked about what was said, Sei smiles 
sheepishly and says the boys were helping him with American slang "that they 
told me not to use in public." 
</P>
<P>
 But American students are not the only ones doing the instructing. Several 
Japanese girls sit around a lunch table teaching American students the art of 
origami. Their swift fingers fold the perfectly squared paper until an elegant 
bird emerges, while St. Michael's students struggle to duplicate the 
centuries-old practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, the American students greet their Japanese counterparts in 
the hall with " konnichiwa ," or good afternoon, as the Japanese students 
practice a simple "hi" or "what's up!" 
</P>
<P>
 Shunsuke Mochizuki 17, said the best part of the school day is lunch, when 
students can socialize without the watchful eye of instructors and get down to 
the serious business of experimenting with American food. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a Japanese chef here, so we can get Japanese food, but it is fresh 
to have pizza," Shunsuke said, making use of a new slang word he recently 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Michael's campus buildings were yellow-tagged after the quake because two 
houses on a hill above the school are red-tagged and, therefore, unsafe. City 
officials deemed the school unusable until the houses are repaired or torn 
down, neither which has happened yet.  
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be going back any time soon," Lusby said. "No one really knows 
when." 
</P>
<P>
 The school is renting space at the university for $15,000 a month.  
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the lunch period, Natalie Farrell, 9, bids farewell to her new 
friend, Yoko Nakagawa, 17, after a brief discussion about which Disneyland is 
better, the one in Anaheim or Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 " Sayonara, " Natalie says. "I never knew sayonara was Japanese. I thought it 
was Spanish or something."

HUD COMES THROUGH FOR SENIORS AFFECTED BY EARTHQUAKE; ASSISTANCE: VAN NUYS 
APARTMENT BUILDING IS THE FIRST RECIPIENT OF HOUSING PROGRAM FUNDS. RESIDENTS 
LOOK FORWARD TO THE REPAIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Thursday afternoon bingo ladies at the Vistas retirement center have never 
met the folks doling out federal earthquake relief at the Los Angeles office of 
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to the HUD people, the avid bingo players -- and other residents of 
the Van Nuys apartments -- are looking forward to repairs being made to their 
damaged building in record time. 
</P>
<P>
 For once, government worked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vistas got a low-interest HUD loan for about $152,000 Thursday, becoming 
the first recipient of some of the $100 million of earthquake relief set aside 
for HUD-assisted apartment buildings damaged in the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents of such buildings are low- to middle-income seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds, earmarked specifically for multifamily housing damaged by the 
quake, are part of a total of $8.6 billion of federal disaster relief Congress 
has appropriated for Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange counties.  
</P>
<P>
 The Vistas' management company -- the nonprofit, Long Beach-based Retirement 
Housing Foundation -- applied for the special HUD funds after the earthquake 
left the six-story apartment building on Sherman Way without water and 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 All 90 residents of the 7-year-old building had to evacuate for six days until 
it could be made habitable again. Some Vistas residents, whose average age is 
78, stayed with relatives in the area, while others moved into another seniors 
apartment building less than a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Sara Hatcher, 86, and the other bingo ladies are happy they won't have to 
look at the cracks in their apartment walls much longer. Pointing to a web of 
cracks over her living room sofa, Hatcher said that without the HUD loan, "I 
know I would have had to live with this quite a while." 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been worse than that if the company had not had reserve funds 
that it could use for some emergency repairs, said Richard Washington, director 
of management and development for the apartment management company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vistas residents definitely would have been relocated more than six 
days," he said. "And, we would have had a project struggling just to meet its 
bills." 
</P>
<P>
 The management company has already put $90,000 of its own reserves into 
repairs at the Vistas. The work included replacing three rooftop water heaters 
that toppled in the quake, sending 400,000 gallons of waters pouring down the 
building's elevator shafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the grant will reimburse the management company for those post-quake 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get us a check in little more than six weeks is just phenomenal," 
Washington said. "If this is an example of new government, it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington said the 15-year HUD loan, which carries a fixed 1% interest rate, 
also will pay to repaint all of the Vistas' apartments and re-carpet the halls. 
 
</P>
<P>
 When she heard the news, Vista resident Elizabeth Cohen exclaimed: "Oh, I'm so 
relieved . . . the damage was bad, bad, bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said she lost a lot of antiques in the quake. But she and other Vistas 
residents have maintained a remarkably good attitude through it all.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the Thursday afternoon bingo players, who call themselves "The 
Gamblers," smiled and shrugged when she recalled the early morning of Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to laugh about it now," said 84-year-old Marie Feliciano. "What else 
are you going to do?"

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; 4 MOTELS APPEAL ORDERS FOR SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four out of five Van Nuys motels targeted by the city in an anti-crime 
crackdown have appealed orders that they hire extra security and take other 
steps to rid their businesses of prostitution and other illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, city zoning administrators imposed at least 27 conditions on 
the five motels, following an investigation and public hearing in which police 
and residents complained about crime in and around the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The motels targeted include: The Cinema Motel, 6242 Sepulveda Blvd.; the 
Chateau Motel, 6719 Sepulveda Blvd.; The Bali Hi Motel, 7041 Sepulveda Blvd.; 
the Town House Motel, 6957 Sepulveda Blvd., and the El Cortez Motel, 5746 
Sepulveda Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was the last day motel owners could file an appeal to the zoning 
administrators' ruling. Only the Chateau did not do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Zoning Administrator Dan Green said a hearing for the four motels 
will be held before the Board of Zoning Appeals within about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal could go all the way to the Los Angeles City Council, where it 
could be granted, struck down, or even denied with stronger conditions against 
the motels, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, Green, who investigated the motels at the behest of City 
Councilman Marvin Braude, called the businesses public nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
 He ordered the motels to hire an eight-hour-a-day security guard with 24-hour 
on-call security service; work more closely with police, and pay $4,052 to 
compensate the city for the investigation. Managers for the motels have said 
they can not afford to comply with Green's order and will not be required to do 
so until they have exhausted their appeals. The Chateau, however, must comply 
effective today, Green said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: STUDENTS SPEND SPRING BREAK FIXING QUAKE-DAMAGED HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Instead of swilling beer and baking on a beach somewhere, a group of Arizona 
State University students is spending spring break manning jackhammers and 
chiseling away at a damaged chimney in Eloise Derse's back yard in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The college students, 40 in all, are part of the Habitat for Humanity work 
force helping earthquake victims such as Derse repair and rebuild.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, 46 people have requested help from the nonprofit organization that 
helps finance and build houses for people who otherwise couldn't afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat International, based in Americus, Ga., has raised $2 million to help 
low-income families whose homes were damaged in earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of the Habitat affiliate in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita 
valleys, which is coordinating all the earthquake recovery efforts, say more is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need building materials; we need funds, and we need particularly skilled 
labor. Rehabilitation work is a little different from new construction," said 
Robert Lamishaw, the chapter's executive director. "Volunteers who are 
available during the week are critically needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners can qualify if their income falls below 80% of the median county 
income and they have no other funding alternative. They also must repay 
Habitat's no-interest loan. And, the hallmark of Habitat's sweat equity 
program, the homeowner must be willing to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 If homeowners can't help do the physical work, they can ask relatives or 
friends to substitute for them. They can answer telephones for Habitat, prepare 
food or sign people in at work sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people can do something and are perfectly willing to do so," Lamishaw 
said, adding that homeowners are expected to put in one hour of work for every 
$100 of costs involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat is offering aid for minor repairs, rehabilitation of homes with 
structural damage and construction of new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Derse, a retired teacher who lives with her disabled adult son, wandered out 
into her back yard Wednesday to watch the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a great bunch of kids," she said. "I think it's marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Hanley slumped in a lawn chair, her hands still covered with large grimy 
work gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tore down a shed," the 19-year-old sophomore said, cheerfully 
explaining her need to rest for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Wells looked through clear plastic goggles and the jackhammer she was 
guiding through concrete, trying to create a post hole for Derse's new fence. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the British student's first trip to California and her first time to 
swing a jackhammer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you notice?" she asked. 
</P>

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COMMUTER SHUTTLE MAY STAY IN SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Valleywide commuter shuttle service, funded by federal earthquake aid 
funds, may be here to stay, thanks to its popularity among Metrolink riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Hanson, executive director of the 12th District Transportation 
Management District, said that in its first two months of operation the 
emergency shuttle service has carried about 188 people per day -- about the 
number projected by local transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Three nonprofit business associations, the 12th District Transportation 
Management Assn., the Warner Center Transportation Management Organization and 
the Van Nuys Transportation Management Assn., were awarded about $1 million in 
federal aid for the service after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant is up for renewal April 17. That's when federal officials decide 
whether there are enough people using the service to warrant spending more. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said about 60 shuttles owned by private firms are now on duty at the 
Sylmar/San Fernando Metrolink Station. Commuters arriving from Santa Clarita 
and beyond tell attendants of the general area they're headed, and the trips 
are planned according to demand. In the afternoon, commuters call to arrange 
rides from work to the Metrolink station. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said ridership numbers were highest immediately following the quake and 
dropped shortly after, but are now holding steady. 
</P>
<P>
 Using private contractors holds down costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This system is very demand responsive, and it costs a lot less than running 
it through the entire MTA (Metropolitan Structure Authority) structure," he 
said. JILL LEOVY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; MAN GETS 3 MONTHS FOR TRESPASSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was sentenced to three months in jail after being convicted for a second 
time in less than three weeks of trespassing in earthquake-damaged buildings, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabindranath Goswami, 24, was taken into custody Wednesday to begin serving 
his jail term after a court commissioner found that the Silver Lake man had 
violated his probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Goswami was convicted March 1 for trespassing and spent four days in jail. 
Also, a court ordered him to stay away from buildings damaged during the Jan. 
17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goswami ignored the judicial order and entered a red-tagged building that 
had been fenced off. He was arrested for the second time last weekend when 
neighbors saw Goswami near an abandoned building in the 4300 block of Mammoth 
Avenue in Sherman Oaks. CHAU LAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; ACTIVISTS TO PROTEST MEXICAN RODEO EVENT

<P>
 In Mexico, the charreada , or rodeo, is the national sport, an honored 
tradition. The colorful outfits worn by the charros , or cowboys, are the 
national costume, and the national dance, the Mexican Hat Dance, is associated 
with the events. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, however, the popular Mexican-style rodeos have angered 
animal-rights groups, who are opposed to a central part of the entertainment -- 
one of the nine traditional charreada events, the mangana , in which charros 
fell broncos by roping their two front legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal-rights activists have planned a demonstration on Saturday at the Hansen 
Dam Sports Center on Foothill Boulevard in Lake View Terrace, much to the 
dismay of the nearby Equestrian Center, whose owner, Eddie J. Milligan, said no 
charreada has ever been scheduled in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not, and have not, hosted any event which contains inhumane treatment," 
he said. "We've never hosted a charro rodeo." Milligan also said charreadas are 
being unfairly singled out because of the ethnicity of the participants. Many 
charros do not perform the mangana anymore, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charreadas are popular in Los Angeles, and there are about 35 charro 
associations in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists say that they chose the location simply because it is large 
enough to hold a large group of people to protest manganas, not because 
charreadas were held nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see no point in the tripping of horses," said Dianne Welshann of Actors and 
Others for Animals, a North Hollywood-based animal-rights organization. "They 
end up with broken legs, broken necks. It's a very cruel thing. It may be a 
part of Mexican culture, but it's not part of ours, and we want it stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 The movement in favor of banning horse tripping appears to be gaining 
momentum. Last year, a state Assembly bill (AB1809) introduced by Assemblyman 
Joe Baca (D-San Bernardino) to ban the tripping of horses for sport died in 
committee, but a similar bill was recently introduced by Assemblyman John 
Burton (D-San Francisco). The bill passed out of the Public Safety Committee 
with an 8-0 vote last week, according to a Burton aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we're under pressure from people who don't understand us," said 
Pedro Vaca, the president of the Federacion de Charros, USA, an umbrella group 
representing charreada organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are not cruel, and we do not enjoy hurting animals." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans are trying to take away one of the greatest Mexican 
traditions," said Manuel Escobedo, a charreada organizer for the Pico Rivera 
Sports Arena. "Sure, animals are hurt in charreadas, and sometimes they die, 
but those are accidents." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

<P>
 Two women were injured when their catering truck rear-ended a gasoline tanker 
on San Diego Freeway in Granada Hills, shutting down three lanes of traffic for 
more than four hours, said a California Highway Patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the 47,000 gallons of gasoline in the tanker were spilled in the 6:15 
a.m. crash.The tanker's driver was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the catering truck, Susana Torres, 32, of Canyon Country 
suffered a broken arm and legs. The passenger, Morena Carranza, 39, of North 
Hills suffered broken legs, said the CHP. Both were treated at Holy Cross 
Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The catering truck was traveling about 50 m.p.h. when it hit the gasoline 
tanker, which had made a stop north of Devonshire Street, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash dented, but did not puncture, the rear of the tanker. "They could 
have been burned to death had it ruptured," the CHP spokesman said. CHAU LAM

<P>
 The crowd roared as Los Angeles Clippers forward Dominique Wilkins outpaced 
his contenders to score two points on a perfect layup. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of cheers from stands packed with season ticket holders, Wilkins 
was lauded by a sea of Glenoaks Elementary School students who lined up in the 
afternoon sun Wednesday to participate in a basketball clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, dwarfed by Wilkins 6-foot-8 frame, tried in vain to pitch free 
throws into a large, orange basketball hoop at the end of the school 
playground. Each wore a white baseball hat with "PRIDE" inscribed across the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who came to the Los Angeles Clippers earlier this year from the 
Atlanta Hawks, visited Glendale as part of the Neighborhood PRIDE program 
developed by ARCO Products Co. and the Clippers. The acronym PRIDE, created by 
National Basketball Assn. Community Relations Director Bob Lanier, stands for 
Positive mental attitude, Respect, Intelligent choices, Dreaming dreams and 
Effort in education. 
</P>
<P>
 The program aims to provide positive role models for youngsters and uses 
basketball to promote its message, said Steve Swayne, the Clippers' director of 
community relations. Team members have held 50 basketball clinics for more than 
10,000 kids since the program started two years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, ranked among the top 10 players in the NBA, advised children to "love 
and respect themselves and others" and told them to build self-confidence early 
in life. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-grader Aleen Bedrossian said she was surprised that Wilkins talked about 
things other than basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know he cared so much about kids," Aleen said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; ALUMNUS AIMS TO SPRUCE UP PIERCE CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WILLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clark stopped walking, bent down, and picked up a beer bottle lying in a 
street near Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's not a maintenance worker at Pierce, Clark's concern for the 
school's appearance compelled him to act. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campus should be an inspiration to learning, not a detraction," Clark 
said later as he discussed plans to improve his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 16, he plans to enlist the services of students and alumni to restore 
a sign that once spelled out the name of the college against a hill overlooking 
the football stadium. Last week, maintenance workers removed five-foot tall 
weeds that had kept the sign -- once visible from five miles away -- hidden for 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark made Pierce his project three years ago, when he returned to take music 
classes and saw that his school was not the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw shabby buildings, plants withered and trees dying," Clark said. "But 
more than that I saw a crushed spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 The administrators were singing the "no money blues," the class of '64 
graduate said. His reply: "So what are we going to do about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clark set out volunteering for the Foundation for Pierce College and, within a 
year, formed the Alumni Connection, an auxiliary of the foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who calls himself "an idea man," helped create Alumni Park -- a 
five-acre park filled with Christmas trees and wildflowers in 1992. Last fall, 
he called all alumni absent from the school for more than a decade home for a 
homecoming celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently persuaded a Calabasas nursery to donate plants for a campuswide 
sprucing up. Future goals include painting buildings that haven't seen new 
paint in 15 years, staging an alumni 10K race and an alumni golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark thinks that efforts have spawned hope among the administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can only be down so long," Clark said. "You either give into it or do 
something about it." TERESA WILLIS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; TRAIN STATION DESIGN INCLUDES CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An architect's proposed design for a Metrolink commuter railway station in 
Chatsworth, unveiled to the public this week, recalls an 1890s-era original, 
updated with the inclusion of a child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 Aleks Istanbullu, the Santa Monica-based architect who was hired to design the 
station, said his proposed plan owes its existence to an uncle with a passion 
for model trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Istanbullu said he was flipping through his uncle's train magazines and 
happened across a photo of Chatsworth's original Southern Pacific Station No. 
222, which was torn down in the early years of this century. The picture, and 
later historical research, provided the basis of design Istanbullu has proposed 
for the new station. 
</P>
<P>
 A citizens' committee reviewed the design Thursday. Members responded 
favorably, suggesting only that the architects give further thought to ways of 
sheltering the site from relentless Chatsworth winds. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.3-million train depot and child-care center, now in the beginning 
stages of development, will replace a platform and canopy now on the station 
site on Devonshire Street. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed, officials hope the train station will become the first 
building in a proposed town center on the site. Portions of the site may 
eventually pass to private developers to build living spaces, restaurants and 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Istanbullu's design is for a single-story 12,000-square-foot building and 
child-care play yard separated from the tracks by a nine-foot high wall. The 
building would have wood siding, a pitched roof and a two-story entry hall. 
Half the building would be devoted to child care -- an innovation introduced on 
the theory that more parents will ride the trains if it is convenient for them 
to drop off their children at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the station will be one among a planned 60 stations scattered 
throughout the Metrolink system. JILL LEOVY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; COURT TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION ON SOKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The curious fight over Soka University's scenic Calabasas campus took another 
unexpected turn Thursday as a state appeals court agreed to reconsider a key 
decision in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Without comment, the 2nd District Court of Appeal said it will look again at a 
ruling it made last month that cleared the way for a state parks agency to 
proceed with attempts to seize the campus for use as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision -- issued Feb. 15 -- is now void. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for both Soka and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy were 
uncertain why the court decided to review its decision or whether it means 
justices will be willing to consider new arguments by either side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows what they have in mind right now," said Soka attorney Hodge 
Dolle. "It could be that they change a paragraph or a punctuation mark in the 
original opinion. Or they could bite the bullet and rule on the merits." 
</P>
<P>
 The essence of the court's February ruling was that Soka should raise its 
objections to the conservancy's attempts to seize its land during eminent 
domain proceedings in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka had argued that the conservancy did not have proper authorization to 
launch the condemnation action and therefore there should be no eminent domain 
proceedings.  
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County Superior Court judge agreed with Soka attorneys, but she was 
overturned after the conservancy appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's surprise is but the latest twist in a tortuous fight between the 
school and some of its neighbors. Soka wants to expand its campus at the corner 
of Mulholland Highway and Las Virgenes Road into a liberal arts college, but 
state and federal parks officials want a large chunk of the land to be used for 
a visitors center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; OWNER OF PETTING ZOO FILES CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a petting zoo and pony ride in Reseda has filed a claim for 
damages of $750,000 against the city of Los Angeles alleging that she was 
arrested without probable cause and her ponies seized illegally by city animal 
regulation officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim is the second legal action Linda Menary has taken against the city 
in recent months.She recently sued the city to prevent officials from shutting 
down her Tampa Avenue business, called The Farm, after she tried and failed to 
get a land-use permit to keep it open. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Qualls, spokesman for City Atty. Jim Hahn, said his department had not 
had time to review the new claim and had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim grew out of a March 2 raid on property Menary owns on Chatsworth 
Street in Chatsworth, during which Menary was arrested and 12 of her ponies 
confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal Regulation officials conducted the raid after passersby reported that 
some of the animals Menary was keeping there were being neglected and needed 
their hoofs trimmed.  
</P>
<P>
 Menary accused the city of harassing her because of her lawsuit. Her animals 
were turned over to the West Valley Animal Shelter, where they were still being 
kept this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Menary's claim states that she suffered emotional damages from the incident.

 A jilted lover is among four men expected to be charged today in connection 
with the shooting of a Los Angeles man earlier this week, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested within hours of the 4 p.m. Wednesday shooting were Robert Young, 27, 
and Marcelo Flores, 26, both of Burbank; John Matthews Jr., 30, of Northridge, 
and Malcolm Alarca, 22, of Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old victim is in fair condition. Police did not identify the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the dispute centered on an unnamed woman who stopped dating Young 
in order to date the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was shot several times at close range as he entered his car parked 
in the 3200 block of San Fernando Boulevard, authorities said. No words were 
exchanged in the incident and police refused to name the triggerman. The weapon 
used in the shooting has not been recovered. CHAU LAM

BILL TO AID SIGNATURE DRIVE FOR SCHOOL BREAKUP VOTE IS DEFEATED; LEGISLATION: 
ASSEMBLY FALLS SHORT OF NEEDED MAJORITY TO ALLOW BACKERS OF DISTRICT SPLIT TO 
GATHER FEWER NAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill that would have paved the way for splitting up the massive Los Angeles 
Unified School District was defeated Thursday in the Assembly, severely 
diminishing the chances that the school breakup movement will make any headway 
in the Capitol this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation by Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) would have 
reduced the number of signatures required to put the question of splitting up 
the 640,000-student district before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that to place a school breakup question on a ballot, 25% of 
the registered voters in the district must sign a petition. Boland's bill would 
have reduced that to 10%, making it easier for breakup proponents to reach that 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland passionately urged her colleagues to go along with her, saying, "This 
bill does not break up the Los Angeles Unified School District. It only lets 
the parents gather signatures to put it on the ballot. This is strictly 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking against the bill, Assemblywoman Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-Los 
Angeles) said: "Those of you who think that breaking up the Los Angeles school 
district will do something for the poor, you are sadly mistaken. This is a 
false signal again." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Boland vowed to continue championing the cause for San Fernando 
Valley parents who want to secede from the district because they believe that 
it is too large to operate effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland said the Assembly's vote "just kills the bill. . . . But I'm going to 
plow ahead with this issue. I refuse to give up, and I'm not going to let the 
parents down." 
</P>
<P>
 Boland's bill needed 41 votes to pass, but gathered 35 in support. 
Thirty-three were opposed. Although technically the bill could be resurrected 
in a conference committee, observers said the outcome would be the same if it 
returned to the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown long ago announced his opposition to the 
breakup, saying he fears that the plan might lead to segregation and fewer 
educational opportunities for minority students. 
</P>
<P>
 As prospects appeared dim for the bill's passage, Boland blamed Democratic 
members of the Valley delegation for bowing to Assembly leaders' desire to 
defeat the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed that the Democrats who are in favor of the bill not 
only didn't speak up for it, but they didn't deliver any Democratic votes," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's Willie's power or (Assemblywoman) Delaine Eastin that 
wants to kill the bill," Boland said, noting that the powerful chairwoman of 
the Assembly Education Committee opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eastin, who was not at Thursday's vote, said she did not urge other 
members to vote the bill down. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, if you check Ms. Boland's record, she doesn't get a 
lot of bills through," Eastin said. "Until she deals with the issues of 
education quality in Los Angeles, she's not going to get the support she 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, prospects look dim for any of the Los Angeles schools breakup bills 
remaining on the table in Sacramento, said Eastin (D-Fremont), a candidate for 
state superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look good, not unless they are in the context of a broader reform 
plan. The members ought to give LEARN a chance to work," she said, referring to 
the education reform effort under way in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Boland said she will push hard for another bill she authored 
that is similar to the one defeated Thursday. The pending bill reduces petition 
signature requirements for districts of all sizes, not just those with 
enrollments of more than 200,000 students, as specified in the one killed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another bill -- this one by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) -- 
has been stalled by the Assembly Education Committee, which voted it down but 
granted Roberti permission to bring it up again later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti said last week that he had high hopes for Boland's bill, but he was 
not giving up on his own. At any rate, he noted, earthquake relief legislation 
has shot to the top of his priority list, pushing other matters aside for the 
time being. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who voted in favor of Boland's bill, said 
he too was disheartened that it did not pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to keep trying. It's a good idea that may take some time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Boland's complaint that Assembly Democrats failed to help her carry the 
ball, Katz said: "I voted for the bill, I talked to other Democrats, I did the 
best I could. Paula never talked to me about working the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who represents Encino, Sherman Oaks 
and Woodland Hills and has been a vocal advocate of school district reform, 
attributed Thursday's vote to the influence of campaign contributions from the 
California Teachers Assn., which opposes a breakup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never expected it to pass the Assembly," Hayden said. "I think the Assembly 
Democrats have made an unwise decision to go along with the hierarchy of the 
school district and the CTA, and they need to look at the decentralization 
issue more carefully."

SCHOOL TRANSFORMER TO BE MOVED; SAFETY: OFFICIALS RESPOND TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE

 Pressured by parents and a kindergarten teacher worried about potential health 
threats, school district officials will move an electrical transformer away 
from a bungalow classroom at Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 But the action, announced at a parents' meeting Thursday, did little to allay 
fears or temper outrage over possible long-term harm from the electromagnetic 
field of the transformer, which was installed less than a foot from the 
classroom wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage is done," said Julie Alpert, who has a 6-year-old daughter in the 
class, as she wiped away tears outside the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents assume the district is looking out for them," said Carol Wynans, who 
also has a young daughter in the class. "I'm here to say they're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Electromagnetic fields, often shortened to EMF, are present wherever an 
electric current passes through a wire. Several scientific studies have 
suggested that increased cases of childhood cancer may occur in locations with 
elevated magnetic fields. A smaller number of studies have found no connection, 
and the issue is still the subject of scientific debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has no standards for acceptable levels of EMF or regulations 
about how near a transformer may be located to a building. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the agreement to move the transformer at Dixie Canyon 
was not an admission that the EMF level was too high. In fact, there is no 
agreement about what level of magnetic field exposure -- if any -- poses a 
health hazard. In the average house, EMFs are under 2 milligauss. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts say a safe level may be as low as 1 milligauss, which would be 
found about a foot from an electric toaster. EMF levels drop off sharply with 
distance from the electrical source. In Room 27 at Dixie Canyon Elementary, 
where Christina Chan taught kindergarten to 33 5- and 6-year-olds, the highest 
measurement taken by the Department of Water and Power in December was 107 
milligauss at the teacher's chair. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, in a DWP demonstration for reporters, a hand-held meter 
registered 185 to 200 milligauss at a bulletin board, which hangs in the 
classroom on the opposite side of the wall adjacent to the transformer. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday the children were moved to the school library after the EMF readings 
were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said Thursday that the findings at Dixie Canyon prompted a 
survey of site plans at other schools to identify similar transformer 
configurations. To compensate for increased enrollment since 1988, the Los 
Angeles Unified School District has added as many as 100 portable classrooms 
with air conditioning to its campuses. Transformers needed to provide power to 
the air conditioners are often located near classrooms, courtyards and hallways 
for security and cost-effectiveness, said Doug Brown, the district's facilities 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to put transformers reasonably close to classrooms," Brown said. "It 
minimizes the cost of underground work." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 50 parents gathered at Thursday's meeting in the school auditorium, 
some shouting questions at representatives from the school district and the 
DWP. But many, including some district officials, left with more questions than 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't know what this all means," said Susie Wong, director of the 
district's environmental, health and safety branch, after the meeting. "No one 
will give us any guidance." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see things change," kindergarten teacher Chan said. "I want to see 
regulations made throughout the district. The only thing holding them back is 
the money, but you can't compare the life of a child to money." 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost about $100,000 to move the transformer, which converts electrical 
current from 480-volt high-power transmission lines to the 120-volt domestic 
standard, to another site on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has tested only two of its 840 school sites and centers for EMF 
levels related to electrical transformers, both at the request of parents. In 
June, parents at Mayall Street Elementary School in North Hills demanded that a 
transformer on the playground be tested. After the DWP registered readings of 
600 milligauss, the district installed a fence three feet from the transformer 
to keep children at a distance.

PROSECUTOR SAYS ACCUSED KILLER LIED; TRIAL: MAN CHARGED WITH BLUDGEONING HIS 
WIFE FABRICATED KEY FACTS, ATTORNEY CLAIMS IN CLOSING ARGUMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Disputing an accused killer's defense that he bludgeoned his wife as a 
reaction to years of abuse, a prosecutor charged Thursday that the man lied to 
a jury and that his family may have helped him cover up the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys gave impassioned closing arguments Thursday in the murder trial of 
Moosa Hanoukai, who is charged with killing his wife by hitting her nearly 50 
times with a blunt object and leaving her body in the garage of their Woodland 
Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai, 55, admitted killing Manijeh Hanoukai, 45, with a wrench, but 
mounted an unusual "cultural defense." The defendant, a Jewish immigrant from 
Iran, testified he snapped when she cursed him and the couple's daughter during 
a fight on the day that was both the Jewish Sabbath and Persian New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors want Hanoukai convicted of murder, while the defense asked the 
jury Thursday to return the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying the true story of the March 29, 1993, slaying may never be known, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen M. Cady concluded that Moosa Hanoukai fabricated 
several key facts in his story. 
</P>
<P>
 Triangular-shaped wounds and cuts in the victim's blouse do not match the 
shape of the open-ended wrench that Hanoukai said was the weapon used, Cady 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the beating, Manijeh Hanoukai lost two to three quarts of 
blood, but only tiny amounts of blood were found in the bedroom where Hanoukai 
said the beating occurred, according to the evidence. Hanoukai also said he did 
not clean up the body, but a coroner testified that the victim's underwear was 
wet. Cady also said blood had been washed from her hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows what he did with her body?" Cady said. "Who knows if he put her on 
ice?" 
</P>
<P>
 While the defense portrayed Hanoukai as a frail, browbeaten man, Cady told the 
jury that men working at the couple's home heard Hanoukai yelling at his wife 
during an argument on the day of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai, jealous of his wife's success at the family's Huntington Park 
clothing store, planned to kill his wife, according to Cady, but he panicked 
when he realized he would be held responsible for her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe someone from the family comes over to help clean up," Cady said, 
drawing gasps from Hanoukai's relatives. "You've got to remember the family 
didn't like her." 
</P>
<P>
 To support this theory, Cady cited phone calls between Hanoukai and his sister 
that, according to the defendant's account, took place five hours after he 
killed his wife. While Hanoukai admittedly dressed the corpse in fresh clothes, 
Cady suggested someone provided guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it wasn't him," she said. "Maybe it was someone helping him out. If you 
use your common sense, he didn't think of pantyhose." 
</P>
<P>
 As he has throughout the two-week trial, defense attorney James E. Blatt 
portrayed Hanoukai as a weak man who was left with no self-respect after his 
wife psychologically abused him for more than a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 "This act was not from a macho man, but from a dependent, depressed, weak 
individual," Blatt said as Hanoukai cried at the defense table. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai was forced to sleep on the floor for eight years, his wife constantly 
said he was stupid, and psychological testimony indicated he was in a 
"dissociative" state at the time of the killing, according to the defense 
attorney.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: DIAMOND'S REFORM PROVES NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED

 ANY REGRETS?: Back in 1972, when Roger Jon Diamond last ran for state 
Assembly, the Santa Monica attorney went to court to challenge California's 
system of ranking candidates on the printed ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond felt it unfair that the incumbent was listed first and that other 
candidates followed in alphabetical order. Being on top of the list gave the 
incumbent an advantage that translated into extra votes, Diamond contended. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Diamond lost that election to then-GOP incumbent Assemblyman Paul 
Priolo, whose name was listed above his Democratic opponent's on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond took his beef all the way to the California Supreme Court -- and won, 
forcing the secretary of state's office to discard the old system and come up 
with a random method of listing the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, the secretary of state's office dreamed up a way to reinvent the 
alphabet each election cycle. Officials now randomly draw letters and the 
candidate whose name starts with the first letter picked gets to appear at the 
top of the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Diamond became a victim of his own success. Now a candidate for 
the 41st District Assembly seat being vacated by Assemblyman Terry Friedman 
(D-Brentwood), he flew to Sacramento to attend the secretary of state's 
drawing. Lo and behold, the letter D did not fare well in the pickings. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he left well enough alone, Diamond would have ranked first in a simple 
alphabetical listing of the six candidates running for the seat. (There's no 
incumbent.) Instead, as a result of his pleadings before the Supreme Court, he 
came up last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went from the top to the bottom -- on my own case. It's ironic," Diamond 
noted.  
</P>

 MOUNTAIN MAN: Rich Sybert protests that he's only being a conscientious member 
of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. But others, including the office of 
U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), have suspected that Sybert 
has concocted a taxpayer-funded dog-and-pony show to advance his plan to oust 
Beilenson from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert is running in the GOP primary and aiming for Beilenson's seat, and he 
sits as Gov. Pete Wilson's appointee on the 10-member governing board of the 
conservancy. Recently, Sybert, the president of a toy-design firm, has asked 
the parks agency staff to organize, publicize and pay for seven public hearings 
to be held throughout the west San Fernando and Conejo valleys. Sybert would 
preside over these hearings, which would be held on top of the conservancy's 
normal bimonthly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The purported purpose of the meetings would be to give Sybert -- who only 
recently moved to Woodland Hills from Pasadena -- a chance to educate himself 
by soliciting the public's views about the conservancy and its work. Parks 
agency staff members say such one-man hearings are apparently unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did the uniqueness of the hearings escape the attention of Susan Little, 
Beilenson's environmental deputy. Little said she called conservancy staff to 
inquire about the hearings in part because, she said, there was a political 
concern. "He's playing a role there that we're keeping somewhat of an eye on," 
Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the matter with conservancy officials, Little concluded that 
"it sounded legitimate (but) it was curious that (the hearings) were being held 
outside the well-attended bimonthly conservancy meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Plotkin, conservancy press secretary, said the agency's staff had been 
warned to be "very careful" that the meetings not be turned into political 
events. "It was all on the up and up," said Plotkin, offering her view of the 
first meeting, held in Calabasas this week. Besides, only nine people showed up 
at the Calabasas confab.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the campaign manager of another Republican primary candidate said 
he saw the whole thing as a transparent attempt to use a public agency to gain 
free exposure for Sybert's candidacy. "I'm surprised the parks agency would 
allow itself to be used this way. I assumed it was more nonpartisan," said 
Chris Carter, who runs the campaign of Mark Boos Benhard, a Conejo Valley 
businessman who was previously an aide to former U.S. Rep. William Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Those questioning his motives are just "cynics," said Sybert, who was a former 
Cabinet-level official in the Wilson Administration. His intent is only to 
educate himself, he said, on conservancy issues. "I'm actually taking time out 
from the campaign so I can do a better job on the conservancy," he said. 
</P>
<P>

 JOINING FORCES: Al Dib, community activist, retired green grocer and perennial 
candidate, said this week that he has hired the controversial Manny Fernandez 
to run his campaign to recall state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys). Dib is one 
of five candidates seeking to oust Roberti in the April 12 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez was purged from the group that organized the recall because of his 
flamboyant and embarrassing statements. The most notable of these was his claim 
that the recall was nothing less than a bid by the gun lobby to avenge itself 
for Roberti's authorship of the state's 1989 ban on military-style 
semiautomatic weapons. It was, to say the least, a quote made in heaven for 
Roberti, who is trying to rally the gun-control movement behind his cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of the Coalition to Restore Governmental Integrity, the group that 
officially sponsored the recall, also have bristled at Fernandez's boast that 
the recall movement is really his creature. In any event, the desire to 
distance itself from Fernandez reached the point where the coalition finally 
issued a press release effectively announcing its estrangement from Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fernandez now has surfaced as Dib's top campaign adviser. "He just called 
and said he thought I could win, so I'm running," said Dib, who has run four 
times in 20 years for Los Angeles City Council seats. In 1989, he came in third 
running against then-Councilman Ernani Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the inducements Fernandez offered him to run was the endorsement of the 
National Rifle Assn., Dib said. "This is what he promised." 
</P>
<P>
 Has Fernandez delivered? Not yet, Dib said. Fernandez, on the other hand, 
denies that he gave Dib any reason to believe that if he ran, the NRA would get 
involved. "I couldn't in good faith make such a promise because I'm not an 
agent for the National Rifle Assn.," Fernandez said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Fernandez's colorful history of involvement in gun issues, including a 
1983 guilty plea to possession of a machine gun, Dib claims that his candidacy 
is not gun-driven. "I wish everyone would stop talking about guns," Dib said.

 TEAM EFFORT: In pursuit of federal earthquake-relief funds, various Valley 
business groups have joined forces to form the nonprofit Regional Economic 
Development Council of the San Fernando Valley to help rebuild the area's 
fractured economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Chambers of Commerce, the Valley Industry & Commerce Assn. and the 
Valley Economic Development Center Inc. got behind this venture at the 
recommendation of U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown. They have proposed a 
detailed program to retain and expand businesses in the wake of the Jan. 17 
temblor as well as attract and establish new enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The proponents hope to win some of the earthquake contingency funds that 
Commerce is seeking through its Economic Development Administration. The 
earthquake aid bill passed by Congress contained $550 million to be dispensed 
at the discretion of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first $90.8 million released Thursday, Commerce received $5 million to 
assist municipalities in developing long-term economic development plans. 
Commerce is seeking as much as $200 million in such funds but is competing 
against other federal government agencies. The EDA funds cannot go directly to 
businesses but must be channeled through nonprofit vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley coalition is one of many groups in Los Angeles and Ventura counties 
that have been asked to submit a comprehensive economic plan. It emphasizes the 
need to aid quake-damaged businesses that may not qualify for the usual 
government loan programs because they had already accumulated significant debt 
due to the economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could lose a lot of good, high-paying jobs and see further decline," said 
Benjamin Reznik, an Encino attorney and immediate past chairman of VICA. "We 
are making the pitch that we are the most important (applicant) and we're 
putting together a more innovative program." 
</P>
<P>
 A Commerce official said that the department is particularly interested in 
combining earthquake aid with creating new jobs through defense conversion. He 
said that this linkage could benefit the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley, which is the epicenter of the earthquake, is also the epicenter 
of defense conversion because so many of the businesses in that area are 
defense-dependent," the official said. "We see this as an opportunity to begin 
the recovery phase and begin the transition."

SUPERVISOR DONATES $40,000 NEEDED TO START DRUG COURT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman has donated the final funds necessary 
to launch a program that will offer treatment instead of jail to some 
nonviolent drug law offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which officials said signals a shift from the war-on-drugs' 
emphasis on incarceration, was supposed to begin last month at the downtown 
Hall of Justice. But after that building was severely damaged by the Northridge 
earthquake, officials found themselves short of funds to relocate the program 
to another county-owned building across from Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Edelman stepped in and contributed $40,000 from his office 
discretionary funds -- enough to pay the electricity bill and other operating 
costs of the new site for a year. "It's going to reduce jail overcrowding, and 
probably more importantly, people who are addicted to drugs will have an 
opportunity to get some treatment," Edelman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Now scheduled to begin at the end of April, the program is based on the highly 
touted Drug Court developed with the support of U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno when 
she was Miami's chief prosecutor. It will offer people arrested for the first 
time on felony drug possession charges the option of enrolling in a treatment 
program with regular testing, job training and acupuncture to curb addiction. 
It may eventually be offered to repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the county has only enough funds to treat 125 drug addicts for four 
months and must seek more than $300,000 from the federal government to keep the 
program running for the rest of the year. But Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge 
Stephen Marcus, who will preside over the Drug Court, is optimistic that the 
county will not only obtain enough funds to expand the pilot project, but 
eventually be able to establish several regional Drug Courts.  
</P>
<P>
 The Drug Court could end up saving the county thousands of dollars in jail 
costs, officials said. One in four inmates in county jails are doing time for 
drug possession or sales, according to the Sheriff's Department. The county 
spends about $25,000 for every inmate who remains in custody for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Drug Court program differs from existing drug diversion programs that 
offer only educational classes, not treatment. Also, unlike older programs that 
returned relapsed participants to jail immediately, the new Drug Court 
tolerates up to two relapses before addicts are jailed, Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, the program is in its fifth year and less than a fifth of its 6,500 
participants have been rearrested, said Dorothy Fletcher, assistant director of 
the Dade County Office of Substance Abuse.

INCONSISTENCY IN MINORITY HIRING CITED; JOBS: STATE REPORT SAYS HIGH SCHOOL 
DISTRICT RATE IS 31.5% BELOW THE AVAILABLE LABOR FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Minority employees in the Antelope Valley Union High School District are few 
and far between, according to an analysis by the state Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The state agency sent a letter earlier this month to the district saying that 
blacks, Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders are not employed at a rate 
consistent with the available labor force in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 14.9% of the high school district's 798 employees were minorities as of 
Dec. 6, according to the analysis. Minority representation is 31.5% below the 
available labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, not disputing the numbers, said the situation is the 
result of rapid growth that changed the racial makeup of the region and is 
compounded by financial troubles that have kept the district from hiring new 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our district has gone through a tremendous change," Supt. Robert Girolamo 
said. "We aggressively need to recruit staff to reflect our ethnic makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis of school district's work force is based on 1990 census data for 
the county, said Larry Laputz, office of compliance programs manager for the 
fair employment department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This report is simply telling them where they did not meet, where they 
exceeded or where they met labor force availability," Laputz said. "It is just 
a snapshot view of what their work force looks like." 
</P>
<P>
 Any public agency or private company that receives state funds must agree that 
it will not discriminate, he said. The state does not, however, set hiring 
quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 Women were well represented in the high school district, according to the 
analysis. Nearly 60% of district employees are female, which is 10.1% above the 
available labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 Hispanics were the most severely underrepresented minority group among the 
district's employees, something local Latino groups noted months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of Latino groups has asked the district to set goals for the 
recruitment, hiring and retention of Latino staff; provide recognition to 
Latino students; increase diversity awareness within the district and provide a 
yearly progress report to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 District trustees were scheduled Wednesday, the same time they received copies 
of the state's monitoring note, to adopt an affirmative action report. The item 
was tabled, however, because of concerns by a majority of board members about 
language in the resolution attached to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Sue Stokka objected to it because, she said, "affirmative action 
leads to quotas." 
</P>
<P>
 She objected to the word best in a statement in the affirmative action plan 
resolution that said, in part, "cultural diversity . . . can best be taught by 
the presence of staff in the school setting which reflects mixed races and 
ethnic groups. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 She also was opposed to the resolution's conclusion, which said the district 
reaffirms its support and commitment to the principles of affirmative action. 
She asked that the word commitment be removed from the resolution.

SCHOOLS STUDY SECURITY MEASURES; SAFETY: ANTELOPE VALLEY DISTRICT CONSIDERS 
WROUGHT-IRON FENCES AND SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.

<P>
 Antelope Valley high school administrators, looking to improve safety on their 
campuses, are considering installing 10-foot high, wrought-iron fences and 
surveillance cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have safe schools," said Robert Girolamo, superintendent of the 
Antelope Valley Union High School District. "We also want to have drug-free 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has been discussing ways to stem crime at its five comprehensive 
high schools and one continuation school. Principals, school-based sheriff's 
deputies and campus security officers got a chance Wednesday to tell the board 
of trustees what they thought should be done to create safer learning 
environments. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years, an average of 185 students a year have been 
recommended for expulsion, according to district records. So far this year, 
expulsion has been recommended for 116 students. Assault-battery, possession of 
a weapon and disruptive behavior are the most common reasons students face 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials want to be better able to keep students on campus and 
non-students off. They also want a greater presence of security personnel and 
equipment. Six security officers and one sheriff's deputy are based at each 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a concern there are not enough security people," said Susan Custer, 
Quartz Hill High principal. "Our campuses are very large." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the principals would even like metal detectors. "We'd feel that would 
probably help everything," said Beverley Louw, Desert Winds High principal. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting Wednesday, trustees approved a plan to allow metal 
detectors to be used when searching a student for weapons and also in random 
metal detector searches. In addition, trained dogs can be used to search out 
drugs in lockers, but not on any person. 
</P>
<P>
 Louw said the city park adjacent to the continuation school she oversees is a 
benefit to the school but is also becoming a problem with increasing gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley High Principal John Hutak said providing students and staff a 
safe campus is "a feeling, a nuance." Even so, he said, he would like to see 
his school better fenced and equipped with video and still cameras for use by 
security staff and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The solutions come at a cost and although the high school district is 
recovering from the financial problems of the past couple of years, officials 
said, money remains tight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to see some costing models," said Trustee Tony Welch, also commander 
of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. "There's no sense in building up 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Girolamo had said it would cost $30,000 to equip each school with modern 
security technology. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most expensive improvements, he said, would be telephones in every 
classroom. Only the district's two newest comprehensive high schools, Highland 
and Littlerock, have phones in every room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a strong concern with the lack of telephones in classrooms," Custer 
said. "I think a telephone in each classroom is really critical." 
</P>
<P>
 Custer's remarks were echoed by the principals of the other schools that lack 
the emergency phones. Palmdale High Principal Mikie Loughridge said phones were 
her "absolute No. 1 priority." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the cyclone fencing at her school was inadequate. "We 
desperately need some heavy-duty, wrought-iron fencing around our campus," she 
said.

EVERETT SET TO GO TO NEW ORLEANS; PRO FOOTBALL: RAMS CLOSE TO DEAL THAT WOULD 
SEND QUARTERBACKS TO SAINTS FOR A LOW-ROUND DRAFT CHOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Rams, hoping to free money under the salary cap and stay aggressive in the 
free-agent market, are expected to trade quarterback Jim Everett to the New 
Orleans Saints as soon as today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram officials indicated that if the deal is completed today, the team would 
receive in compensation a low draft pick, believed to be a seventh-rounder. New 
Orleans officials confirmed that the trade could be announced as early as 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett was believed to be on his way to New Orleans Thursday night, and must 
pass a physical before the trade can become official. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ram official, asked if Everett could be traded today, said: "I think it's a 
possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 At a staff meeting Thursday morning, the Rams decided to no longer demand a 
high draft pick in compensation for Everett and to unload his $2.65-million 
salary for next season and make contact with New Orleans, the only team to show 
interest in the struggling quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Demoff, Everett's agent, confirmed Thursday night that the Rams and 
Saints have been discussing a trade for Everett, but he declined comment when 
asked if it would be made today. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't be wrong by saying there have been discussions between the two," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams obtained Everett in a trade with Houston in 1986, giving up defensive 
end William Fuller, guard Kent Hill, first-round draft choices in 1987 and '88, 
and a fifth-round 1987 choice. Houston had made Everett the third overall 
selection in the 1986 draft behind running back Bo Jackson (Tampa Bay) and nose 
tackle Tony Casillas (Atlanta). 
</P>
<P>
 But after leading the Rams to three consecutive losing seasons, Everett was 
benched last season in favor of quarterback T.J. Rubley. The team considered 
cutting Everett in November to save money, but instead cut backup quarterback 
Mike Pagel. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett has two years left on his Rams contract, and in 1993 was designated as 
the team's transition player for the 1996 season, after his contract expired. 
By trading Everett, the Rams would retain the transition designation to use on 
another player. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have been shopping Everett since the trading period opened Feb. 17. 
Demoff said the Saints are the only team to show serious interest in Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a very limited market," Demoff said. "New Orleans has been Jim's 
first choice of where he wants to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have been uncharacteristically aggressive in the free-agent market, 
signing quarterback Chris Miller, defensive tackle Jimmie Jones and extending 
an offer sheet to Houston offensive lineman Kevin Donnalley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are facing problems with the new $33.8-million salary cap because 
they are trying to re-sign some of their 17 restricted and unrestricted free 
agents. They also are pursuing free-agent wide receiver Haywood Jeffires of 
Houston, who earned $900,000 last season but is seeking a $2-million annual 
salary. Denver, which lost Tim Brown to the Raiders Wednesday, is the 
front-runner for Jeffires. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett's pro playing career began in 1986, when he came off the bench to 
complete 12 of 19 passes for 193 yards and three touchdowns in a 30-28 loss to 
New England. He became the team's full-time starter in his first season, and 
passed for 1,018 yards with eight touchdowns and eight interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 His productivity grew the next three seasons as he developed into one of the 
league's top quarterbacks. He completed 59.6% of his passes in 1988 for 3,964 
yards with 31 touchdowns and 18 interceptions. In 1989, he became the first Ram 
to throw for more than 4,000 yards in a season (4,310), and led the Rams to the 
NFC championship game against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-3 loss to the 49ers included one of the defining moments in Everett's 
career -- "the Phantom Sack" in which he dropped back to pass and fell to the 
ground without being touched. 
</P>
<P>
 The following season, Everett threw for 3,989 yards and became the Rams' first 
Pro Bowl quarterback since Pat Haden in 1977. But the Rams finished 5-11, the 
first of four consecutive seasons in which they finished with fewer than seven 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the losing seasons, Everett started 87 consecutive games for the Rams, 
a streak that ended Oct. 31 at San Francisco, when he was benched after 
completing only one of nine pass attempts for 12 yards with one interception in 
a 16-13 loss to Detroit the previous week.LOS ANGELES RAMS (FOOTBALL TEAM)

POINT WITHOUT PEER; SINCE SHE WAS YOUNG, BREA-OLINDA'S ERICKSON HAS TAKEN 
CHARGE OF HER LIFE ON, OFF COURT 
</P>

 Sandy Erickson said her daughter has always been this way, strong-willed, 
stubborn and independent. Born under the sign of the bull, she has always been 
her own person. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in birth," Sandy Erickson said, "she did not want to come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Erickson took her sweet time -- 33 hours -- making her way into the 
world, but she quickly took to life's other milestones. She was walking and 
talking at 9 months. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a good vocabulary by the time she was 2, and she was roller skating, 
skateboarding and ice skating in her third year. "After we went around the rink 
once," said her father, Keith, "she pushed away from me and she went around, 
and I just followed her." 
</P>
<P>
 She never needed training wheels and never needed a doctor -- she never got 
hurt. Ever. She did everything on her own, whether it was sports or selecting 
her clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith and Sandy Erickson's second child, Kevin, didn't have it easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always kept comparing my son to Nicole, so I thought he was a little slow," 
Sandy Erickson said. "I thought something was wrong with him." 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing wrong with 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin, who is two years younger than Nicole, 17. He may have grown up in 
Nicole's shadow, but he is not alone -- nearly every girl who has played 
basketball the last four years has been in that shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a long shadow. 
</P>
<P>

 "She had a pass her sophomore year in a playoff game, most incredible high 
school pass you'll ever want to see. Three on one: She went behind her back -- 
caught it -- and then reversed it. Everyone's on their feet . When she came out 
of the game, she got another standing ovation. She would do that every day in 
practice and I told her, 'You've got to do it in a game.' She said, 'Don't you 
think it's hot-dogging?' I said, 'No -- we've got to entertain these people -- 
as long as it serves its purpose and you can do it.' If you've got da Vinci, 
you've got to let him paint. She's an artist and the court's her canvas." -- 
Mark Trakh Former Brea-Olinda coach now at Pepperdine 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sport came naturally for Erickson, who was a fourth-grader when she joined 
National Junior Basketball. Her first summer, she competed in the local 
Fullerton Elks' free-throw shooting contest and reached the national finals in 
Indianapolis, the first Fullerton representative to get that far. She reached 
the nationals again as a sixth-grader. She played competitively alongside boys 
her age until the eighth grade -- two years after she could have played with 
only the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 She was an extremist when it came to sports, whether it was golf (she played 
for six weeks, won a tournament and then quit) or softball (she played Bobby 
Sox one year, made the all-star team, started in center field and her team 
finished second in nationals) or basketball. She loved basketball and she 
practiced forever, dribbling in her room or shooting in her driveway while her 
brothers rebounded for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't see all the work she puts into it," Sandy Erickson said. "She is 
very talented, but it's not like 'This is Nicole Erickson and it just 
happened.' She's worked for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father told her to learn to handle the ball with both hands, and she does; 
she passes left-handed as well as right-handed. She learned to be aggressive 
competing against the boys, and she learned they don't slow down. Neither does 
she. She never gives up on a ball or a situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Never a situation: 
</P>
<P>
 * Alaska Invitational championship: Erickson scored nine points in the final 
seven minutes. Brea-Olinda, leading Lake Oswego (Ore.) Lakeridge by two with 
six minutes to go, wins by nine, 63-54. She finishes with 38 points, 10 more 
than Lakeridge's 6-foot-7 Stanford-bound center, Chandra Benton. Erickson is 
the tournament MVP. It is the closest game Brea-Olinda has had this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Alaska semifinals created a national championship-type setting. 
Fifth-ranked Brea-Olinda beat sixth-ranked Garfield Heights (Ohio) Trinity, 
65-55. Erickson scored 16, but more importantly, dominated Trinity's full-court 
press and had only two turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 * State Division II championship game, 1993: Erickson's 12-foot baseline 
jumper with 3.5 seconds to play gave Brea-Olinda a 42-41 victory over Fair Oaks 
Bella Vista. She finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Southern Regional semifinal, 1993: Erickson's three-pointer tied the score 
with 33 seconds left. She scored eight of Brea-Olinda's 10 points in overtime 
in a 64-55 victory over Carlsbad. She finished with 26. 
</P>
<P>
 * State Division III championship game, 1992: Erickson's three-point basket 
with 30 seconds left put away Healdsburg, 47-44. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson has spent her entire high school career as a starter for the 
Ladycats, who have won 96% of the time (129-5). Barring a catastrophe, they 
should win their fourth consecutive State title on Saturday when they play San 
Jose Archbishop Mitty. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been instrumental in Ladycat winning streaks of 55 and their current 
53 games -- the second- and third-longest streaks in Southern Section history. 
Only the Cheryl Miller-led Riverside Poly team won more (84), from 1978-82.  
</P>

 "I remember seeing her in an OCN interview after the title game last year, and 
you could just see it in her eyes. . . . She had incredible presence. It was 
like, 'That's what we're all about -- we came here to win.' When she's on the 
court, there isn't anyone else. She's one you would do anything for, I think, 
if you were a player." -- Eric Bangs Woodbridge coach * 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue has never been to the NCAA Final Four in women's basketball, but it has 
been to the Sweet 16 twice. The Boilermakers are top-seeded in the West Region 
this year. Erickson will be at Purdue next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think she's the type of point guard who can help us win a 
national championship because of her versatility," Purdue Coach Lin Dunn said. 
"I've had the opportunity to coach all the (U.S.) point guards in the last 
three Olympics, and I think Nicole has the potential to be in that league. . . 
. They're all much older than her, they're seasoned veterans, but she's in the 
elite category of point guards." 
</P>
<P>
 A former Purdue assistant, Gail Goestenkors, now the coach at Duke, saw 
Erickson at the AAU under-13 nationals and added her to the university's 
recruiting files. Goestenkors could see, even then, her competitiveness and the 
potential to be a great floor leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn attended AAU nationals in Chattanooga, Tenn., last summer looking for a 
point guard. She wanted someone like Michelle Joseph, a "tremendous scorer" and 
Purdue's all-time assist leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't usually recruit in California," Dunn said. "We usually stay in the 
Midwest, but I had heard so much about her and she had been in our files so 
long, and some alumni out there sent us clippings. So I was curious and when I 
saw her, I said, 'Wow, this is special.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Her ability to see the floor, to put it where she wanted to put it -- she was 
so competitive. I can see why they've won so many games -- she won't lose. In 
crucial situations, she wanted the basketball. I watched her play every game. 
In my mind, she's the No. 1 point guard in this year's class. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's perhaps one of the best ballhandlers I've ever seen, a natural 
ballhandler. She's tremendously unselfish, has the ability to score when she 
needs to, has the ability to get the ball to other people. But I think it's her 
leadership on the floor. You can just see that she's in charge of whatever team 
she's in charge of." 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue has not been without complications. Erickson and another recruit, 6-6 
center Michelle Van Gorp from Macomb (Mich.) Chippewa, were featured in 
Boilermaker uniforms on the cover of Gold and Black Illustrated, an independent 
publication for Purdue followers, a few days after they signed letters of 
intent. Recruiting services said the duo gave the Boilermakers one of the 
nation's top five recruiting classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lafayette (Ind.) Journal and Courier reported a month ago that the program 
was under investigation for as many as eight possible rule violations, 
including the posed-for picture on Erickson's recruiting trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said on Friday she could not comment on any investigation but said 
Erickson shouldn't lose any eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chances of winning a national championship are very important to me, and 
Purdue has a great chance," Erickson said upon signing her letter of intent. 
"Plus, it's Indiana. Indiana loves basketball, and that's what I want." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "She's always in control. That's why they win. She's going to do something big 
at the crucial time in the game . Nicole Erickson is the best Orange County 
player for her generation."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Mary Hauser Mater Dei coach and former Monarch standout * 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson was named Kodak All-American last week. She already had been named 
Gatorade State player of the year. She was a nominee for the Dial Award, given 
to the most outstanding female athlete in the country. She was a Street & Smith 
Preseason All-American and a four-time AAU age-group All-American. She was the 
State Division II player of the year last year, an All-State player as a 
sophomore, and an All-State Division III second team player as a freshman. She 
is a two-time Times Orange County player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows how she will be honored in the weeks ahead, but it's a pretty good 
showing for someone who was told by her father that she was never going to have 
great athletic ability, that she would never be the fastest player or the best 
jumper. She was told, simply, to "learn to handle the ball better than anyone 
else, learn to shoot better than anyone else." In short, do the things that can 
be practiced over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 She has done pretty well for a 5-foot-6 tomboy who was often mistaken for a 
boy by other players' parents until she let her hair grow in the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 She is Brea-Olinda's all-time leading scorer (1,976 points), playmaker 
(Southern Section record 868 assists), thief (488 steals) and three-point 
shooter (Southern Section record 209 of 494, 42.3%). Four years of high school, 
three State titles and maybe another one on the way. Her jersey No. 22 will be 
retired in April at the team banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a remarkable legacy accomplished the only way she knew how. Her way. The 
Erickson Era

THANKS TO HER CONFIDENCE, BURGESS IS UP TO ANY TASK; BASKETBALL: PLAYING 
BASKETBALL MAKES WOODBRIDGE'S 6-4 CENTER HAPPY TO BE TALL, FOR THE FIRST TIME 
OF HER LIFE.

<P>
 Teardrops trickled from Angela Burgess' reddened eyes as she heard more 
mean-spirited whispers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess, then a shy eighth-grader, was the subject of many of her classmates' 
derisive comments as she moved from one class to another. Several girls walked 
a few feet behind Burgess speaking in tones just loud enough to make sure 
Burgess heard their attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls huddled and giggled as they talked about Burgess, whose only 
transgression was that, at 6 feet 3, she had the misfortune of standing out 
from -- and towering over -- the crowd. Children can be cruel, and those who 
singled out Burgess learned well. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken and Sandi Burgess comforted their only daughter when she arrived home, but 
they knew the taunts would not stop. So to help Angela take her mind off the 
ugly words, Ken suggested that she begin playing organized basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 He hoped that becoming part of a team would help his daughter feel good about 
herself, especially since her height would be an asset in that sport. 
</P>
<P>
 She was not as optimistic. Reluctantly, however, she agreed to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, father knew best. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess, now 6-4, has developed into one of Orange County's top centers. And 
thanks in large part to the junior's continued improvement in the middle, the 
undefeated Woodbridge High girls' basketball team competes for its first State 
title tonight. Woodbridge plays Sacramento El Camino for the Division II 
championship at 6:15 at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess' height no longer brings the comments that once reduced her to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning so much has made everything a lot of fun," Burgess said. "People used 
to say, 'Look, there goes that tall girl,' and then just laugh at me. All the 
teasing was really hard on me. . . . I hated being so tall. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now people congratulate me for the things I do and the ways I help the 
team win. Being so tall used to hurt a lot, but now I look at it as a good 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Warrior Coach Eric Bangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really fortunate to have someone Angela's size because it's like having 
a 6-10 or 6-11 guy with the boys," Bangs said. "Her development over the last 
few months has been dramatic. She has really caught fire about basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire started slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she agreed to play basketball in the eighth grade at her father's 
behest, she was not giddy about the game. She was concerned about failing. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess was already the butt of jokes for being the tallest person at her 
junior high school. She had nightmares about how much worse the insults would 
become if her classmates found out a tall person wasn't good at basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I encouraged her to do it because Angela needed to be involved in something 
where people were cheering for her to do well," Ken said. "I thought this was 
the thing to help her self-confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Persuading his daughter to pick up the game was one hurdle -- a bigger one was 
finding a place where she could play. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken said there were no youth leagues for girls as inexperienced as Angela 
during that time in Irvine. In order for Angela to participate in a league, Ken 
agreed to coach a boys' team if his daughter was allowed to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard at the beginning," Ken said. "She was nervous trying to learn and 
it showed, but she made some real good friends on the team who helped." 
</P>
<P>
 The support of her family, though, was the biggest help. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken and Sandi understood firsthand the problems Angela faced. Ken is 6-6 and 
Sandi is almost 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in our family is very tall," Sandi said. "My brother is 6-8 and Ken 
is very tall, so we knew how the kids would turn out." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Angela's brothers are taller than 6-feet and the family's doctor said 
the other two will also surpass that height, Sandi said. Angela's brother Chris 
is 6-9 and a freshman center at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no doubt that Angela would not have the confidence she has today if it 
weren't for basketball," Ken said. "It was very important that she did this and 
be successful at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Success has come rapidly for Burgess. 
</P>
<P>
 She was promoted from junior varsity to varsity early in her freshman season. 
As a sophomore, Burgess had averages of 8.8 points and 10 rebounds, numbers 
good enough to earn a place on the All-Sea View League second team. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess continued to blossom this season, averaging 12.5 points and leading 
the team with 12.3 rebounds. She was selected first team all-league. 
</P>
<P>
 The accolades are quite an accomplishment for someone who only four years ago 
did not know the difference between a zone defense and a no-parking zone. To 
her credit, however, Burgess realizes she still has much to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have some talent and, with my height, I have a real chance to do 
something good," she said. "When a person doesn't think they have a lot of 
talent, they won't work hard to fulfill their potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I know I can play, I have to work to improve my quickness and 
strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior senior guard Jamie Oenning is pleased by her friend's positive 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really hard for someone to be happy with themselves when they're 
young no matter who they are," Oenning said. "I'm really happy that Angela now 
looks at her height as an attribute instead of as a detriment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people always tell me how lucky we are to have her on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess' newfound confidence also has manifested itself in her on-court 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading Woodbridge to a 46-41 victory over Mission Hills Alemany in the 
Southern California Regional Division II championship, several Alemany players 
complained to reporters that Burgess played too physical.  
</P>
<P>
 Burgess said she did nothing wrong, but simply the thought of opponents 
believing she has a little mean streak makes her coach smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good, now maybe I can get her to knock somebody down," Bangs said, jokingly. 
"But seriously, she is so nice and sweet that it was really hard to get her to 
growl a little bit on the court her first couple of seasons. I think now she 
knows you don't have to be mad or play dirty to go out and play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess also competes for the Woodbridge track and field team. She finished 
third in the discus and fourth in the shotput at the Orange County 
championships last season, and sixth in the Southern Section Division II meet 
in the shotput with a career-best throw of 35 feet 6 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess was a member of the school choir, but she had to resign because it 
conflicted with basketball. The decision, Burgess said, was simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe basketball a lot," she said. "I've made a lot of good friends playing 
and I've had a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I kind of felt like an outcast, but basketball helped me find 
myself."

SANTA ANA DISTRICT GETS HARD ECONOMICS LESSON; SCHOOLS: CRITICS RAISE HEAT AT 
REALIZATION THAT LOT BOUGHT FOR $18.5 MILLION HAD SOLD MONTHS EARLIER FOR $12.6 
MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 School planners eye the sprawling industrial lot here, dotted with piles of 
debris from a razed warehouse, and they see the promise of a brand-new 
headquarters and another school for a city forced to use hundreds of portable 
classrooms to teach its children. 
</P>
<P>
 For critics who have begun to question the Santa Ana Unified School District's 
spending habits with increasing stridence, however, the barren lot has become 
more than that. For them, it is now another symbol of conventional economics 
turned upside down at Orange County's biggest school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: The district bought the 18-acre property in 1990 from a private 
company for a total of $18.5 million. But as several board members only 
recently learned, the same property changed hands for $12.6 million just a few 
months before the district's offer, meaning a 50% markup for the middleman in 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members also just learned that the broker who handled both sales, 
and a general partner of the middleman firm, were both related by marriage to a 
director of the now-bankrupt corporation that originally sold the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We paid a very high price for that land -- and someone made a lot of money 
off the district," insists school board Trustee Rosemarie Avila, a frequent 
critic of district school-building policies who has led the fight against a 
current school proposal to buy part of a local shopping plaza. "Didn't we learn 
a lesson from that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The deal closed four years ago on the property at Grand and Chestnut avenues. 
But Avila and school board ally Tom Chaffee are now pressing the issue anew, 
demanding more information from the district on the sale because of what they 
see as parallels to the ongoing controversy over the purchase of space at the 
local shopping plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 In that proposal, the district is planning to spend nearly $22 million in 
state money to buy 11 acres at the back third of the Bristol Marketplace in 
Santa Ana and construct a two-story "space-saver" school that would be built 
above a parking lot there. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has already set aside money for the acquisition, but the plan has 
come under fire in recent weeks -- in part over its finances. Realty experts 
say the property appears to be worth less than half of what the district is 
planning to pay, and officials have disclosed that the HomeBase store there -- 
which the district would spend millions to relocate under the current plan -- 
had been considering a move from the site anyway because of its poor location. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the fresh controversy over the shopping plaza proposal, the debate 
over the purchase of what used to be the headquarters of an electronics 
manufacturer called EECO Inc. has intensified questions from critics about how 
the district goes about spending state school-building money -- and whether the 
system itself may be partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials are quick to defend their handling of both the EECO 
purchase and the Bristol Marketplace plan, saying that criticism from a 
minority bloc on the five-member school board is only serving to thwart efforts 
to solve a classroom-shortage "crisis."  
</P>
<P>
 The system for building new schools, said Michael Vail, the district's top 
facilities planner, is designed to ensure fairness and cost-efficiency. It has 
worked well, he said, allowing Santa Ana to build nine new schools in less than 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how all this debate is going to improve a system that's already 
manipulation-proof," Vail said in an interview, frustration evident in his 
voice. "Apparently, the strategy is to destroy the credibility of the finest 
school facilities office in the state. That's the only reason I can think of 
for the questions being asked." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics on the school board say otherwise.  
</P>
<P>
 They maintain that the prospect of a massive overpayment for the Bristol 
Marketplace site only threatens a repeat of mistakes the district may have made 
in the EECO purchase.  
</P>
<P>
 And Chaffee, elected to the board last year, said he is particularly bothered 
by what he sees as the repeated reluctance of school district staff members to 
release basic information on the EECO case -- even to elected board members 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really received (the information from district staff members) that I 
wanted," Chaffee said. "They're afraid it might stir up some controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 After requests from Avila and Chaffee, district staff members did distribute 
to school board members last month a report, prepared at the district's request 
by the Santa Ana law firm of Nyman, Johnson, Maguire & Dyer, that summarizes 
key issues in the EECO purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 That Feb. 15 report concluded that the $6-million profit on the EECO sale 
realized by the middleman in the deal, Burke-Santa Ana Partners, did not 
necessarily mean that the district paid too much for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the letter said, EECO Inc. sold the site initially to the Burke 
company "at something less than market value," and Burke was then able to turn 
around and sell the property within a period of months for millions more to the 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
 EECO, a manufacturer of electronic components, had developed the Chestnut 
Avenue site in Santa Ana beginning in the 1950s, building four structures on 
the site for production and storage. But by 1988, company debt had mounted -- 
it suffered a net loss of $13.2 million that year -- and EECO began to consider 
selling off the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke-Santa Ana, a commercial real estate partnership, bought the property for 
$12.6 million, closing the deal in December, 1988. Just a few weeks later, 
officials said, the school district made its first contact with a broker over 
possible interest in the same site. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's delay in identifying the site as a possible school 
grounds ultimately cost the state millions in the final acquisition. By the 
time the district became interested in the property, Burke had moved ahead with 
plans to market industrial lots there and, under state rules, it had to be 
compensated for its potential income from that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 So why had the district -- which had been looking for a site for an 
intermediate school in that area since the mid-1980s -- waited until after the 
initial sale to look at the EECO property? Essentially, school officials said, 
they were reluctant to consider any sites that would mean having children west 
of Grand Avenue walk across that major thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knew we were looking for property in that area," said Anthony 
Dalessi, a district administrator who oversaw the deal. "If we knew that that 
property was available before, we obviously ignored it because it was on the 
wrong side of Grand, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials changed their minds, Dalessi said, and they decided to 
look more closely at the property. One unforeseen attraction: Its 18-acre 
expanse would allow the district not only to start a new school, but also to 
build new administrative offices.  
</P>
<P>
 Under state requirements then in effect, the district in mid-1989 got two 
independent appraisals for the "highest and best use" of the property -- one 
coming in at $16.5 million, the other at $18.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Both appraisals cited the potential income that Burke could get from the 
property if it were to build industrial complexes there, as the company had 
considered. In fact, the Feb. 15 report from the law firm suggested that Burke 
was so intent on pushing its own project that it was "never interested" in 
selling and wanted the district to look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burke did sell -- without the district resorting to condemnation 
proceedings. Obligated by state guidelines to pay the higher of its two 
appraisals, the district agreed to pay a total of more than $18.5 million, 
including reimbursement for money that Burke had already spent to develop the 
site. The year before, the same property had been assessed by the county at 
$14.3 million, according to one of the school district's appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at the time, however, questions were raised about the manner in which the 
property had changed hands from EECO to Burke and ultimately to the school 
district, leading to threats of litigation by some EECO shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 A school district appraisal by Michael Frauenthal & Associates in June, 1989, 
concluded that the EECO-Burke sale "was not an arm's-length market 
transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 And in last month's report from the law firm, attorney Michael P. Maguire also 
took note of threatened litigation over allegations that the sale "was not for 
fair consideration and (was) prompted by the buyer obtaining inside information 
concerning the financial condition of EECO and a motive to create profit for 
familial members by at least one of the board members." 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling allegations that it was not an arms-length transaction was the fact 
that both Brian R. Burke, general partner of Burke-Santa Ana, and John Rothwell 
-- the commercial real-estate broker in Orange County who brokered both the 
land sales -- are sons-in-law to an EECO director named Jack Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 The family relationships, together with the $6-million profit made by the 
middleman, prompted officials of EECO -- now defunct after two bankruptcy 
filings -- to consider a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County attorney Steven Bergh, who represented EECO, acknowledged that 
he "threatened a lawsuit (against Burke), and it was settled" out of court. 
"There was a settlement, and the other side insisted on a confidentiality 
clause," he said, declining to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergh never filed a lawsuit, but he did assert some of his claims in legal 
filings in EECO's bankruptcy proceedings in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 He alleged that the EECO sale was "fraudulent" and that the Burke partnership 
had made a profit of $5.6 million without properly disclosing the family 
relationship between Brian Burke and Bishop, the EECO director. The Burke firm 
denied any wrongdoing and asked a judge to declare the claims unfounded. But 
the request was dismissed without a ruling, and lawyers said the matter was 
settled confidentially out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop could not be reached for comment. But Rothwell, who brokered both land 
sales and is married to one of Bishop's daughters, said in an interview that he 
found it "absurd" to think that his family ties had helped him profit from 
either deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothwell recalled rumblings to that effect at the time the deal was being 
made. At one point, in fact, he remembered an official involved in the 
negotiations quipping at one meeting that it seemed like a "family affair." But 
Rothwell said his father-in-law never played much of a part in the EECO 
transaction, and that he was never aware of the district's possible interest in 
the site at the time that he brokered the initial purchase for Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Burke, meanwhile, said his company had "absolutely no indication" at the 
time it bought the EECO property that the school district might be interested 
in it, and he was more surprised than anyone when the district began putting 
out feelers a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a hard time believing the school district could come along so quickly 
after we purchased the property," he said. "But the fact is that we competed on 
a fair-market basis with anyone else who wanted to buy that property. . . . We 
did nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the questions persist. 
</P>
<P>
 School Board President Sal Mendoza said that even while he would now like to 
see the debate over the EECO purchase laid to rest, the newly emerged details 
about the deal "bother me."  
</P>
<P>
 He said he wished district staff members had pointed out to him at the time, 
for instance, that the EECO property had sold for only $12.6 million shortly 
before the district purchased it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would've questioned it. . . . We didn't find this out until after the 
fact," he said. "I, as a board member, learned my lesson from (the purchase of) 
that site. We've got to make sure that we're not overpaying for a piece of 
property. I don't know if we did or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggest, however, that the new details that have emerged in recent weeks 
about the Santa Ana school district's purchases show that mistakes are bound to 
be repeated because of inherent problems in the state system for financing new 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a 1992 report by the Little Hoover Commission in Sacramento on the 
state's "school facilities crisis" found that the state "has created a 
cumbersome program that micromanages school construction projects" through an 
array of bureaucratic agencies and that it relies on "an elephantine gestation 
period" to build a new school. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn E. Noreen, a business manager for the private Fairmont Schools in 
Anaheim who has followed the debate in the Santa Ana district, says the 
labyrinth of appraisals, committee approvals and reviews plaguing the state 
system are largely responsible for the multimillion-dollar cost overruns that 
are common in school projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Noreen said his private school is planning a facility for 400 students at a 
onetime mansion in Anaheim for a total of $1.5 million -- a price so low that 
he says a public school could never achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system does not work. And the reason for that is that the people who make 
the decisions (at the local level) are not the ones that pay for it at the 
state," Noreen said.

<P>
 "Clearly," he said, "it's not working in Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
 As district officials in Santa Ana try to sort out whether or not the process 
did work there as it was supposed to, Brian Burke says he sometimes regrets 
having ever heard of the EECO property. Some of his partners say they, too, 
wish the firm had never become involved in the controversial purchase, because 
of all the dust that it managed to kick up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the deal that won't go away," Burke said.

18 LAUSD SCHOOLS SEEK MAGNET STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motivated by falling test scores and the loss of high-achieving students, 18 
schools -- three times the number that typically apply -- want to become part 
of the highly prized magnet system of the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools hope to offer specialized courses ranging from Latin music to 
journalism and media technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnets -- considered the gem of the school system -- offer smaller classes, 
more money for special activities and facilities, and a handpicked faculty. 
Students must apply for entrance and the competition is stiff. Application 
brochures are available beginning today at all schools and Los Angeles public 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the pull of the magnet is strong, funding could prevent many schools 
from achieving their goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the students and teachers choose magnets rather than being assigned to 
them, principals report lower absenteeism, higher staff morale, greater parent 
involvement, even higher test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our test scores are going down, down, down," said Jan Walsh, principal at 
Gledhill Elementary in North Hills. "We feel something is needed. We have to 
find something to turn these kids around. We're in a desperate situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The new magnets also could attract students who plan to leave regular schools. 
Principals across the district say they lose some of their high-achieving 
students to magnets. About 38,000 students apply to magnets every year for 
9,500 openings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lose many good kids," said Marilyn Erickson, principal at Haskell 
Elementary School in Granada Hills, which wants to specialize in math, science 
and technology. "It would be a way of keeping kids at my school and provide a 
program for parents who want magnet schools for their children." 
</P>
<P>
 At Millikan Middle School in Sherman Oaks, which is proposing to offer 
performing-arts courses, Principal Pete Ferry said the campus could tap parents 
who work in the entertainment industry for support. Students at the school 
already are excited about the prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "One boy told me he has to check with his agent to see if he could do these 
kinds of things for free," Ferry said. "But there's a lot of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Millikan also loses students to magnets and other campuses, Ferry said. The 
magnet center could attract students to the campus. "We're trying to plug up 
the drain," Ferry said. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever their intentions, the principals have hurdles ahead. The Board of 
Education must approve their requests and limited funding could be the death 
blow for schools' plans. The board likely will consider the applications in the 
next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Julie Korenstein, whose daughter attended magnet schools, said 
the problem is strictly financial. "I wish I could make every school a magnet," 
Korenstein said. "It's going to be a tough choice with the limited amount of 
funding we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein represents the district with the most magnet students: 8,086. She 
also has the greatest number of students on the district's waiting list -- 
6,367. The district expects to receive about 38,000 applications for the 108 
magnets next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever they are and whatever they specialize in, students are doing 
better," Korenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district receives about 80% of the magnets' funding from the state. A 
onetime, $10-million federal grant from the National Guard is paying in part 
for the math and science magnets. 
</P>
<P>
 That grant could be another reason for the increased number of schools 
applying to be magnets. "When there's money and the word goes out, applications 
start coming in," school board President Leticia Quezada said. "My preference 
is to establish the spirit and the environment in all our schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest benefit will be when all our schools become much more like our 
magnets," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Created during the divisive busing battles of the late 1970s, magnets are 
intended to provide students from across the sprawling district with smaller, 
ethnically diverse student bodies and specialized educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To many principals, the change will benefit parents who are seeking a better 
education for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magnets carry an aura of superior programs and instruction," said Merle 
Price, the principal of Palisades High School in Pacific Palisades. "With all 
the recent concern about the quality of public education, I think there's a 
built-in constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Anna McLinn, principal at Marvin Avenue Elementary in West Los Angeles: 
"I think it's a last chance for our district. To me, it's the answer to low 
test scores." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials are cautioning schools that becoming a magnet takes 
commitment and a strong desire to make the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just pin a label on the school door," said Richard Battaglia, who 
oversees the district's magnet program. "Doing a good job in a magnet takes 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from students, teachers also select magnets. Principals interview and 
hire teachers who are interested in their particular programs. At Granada Hills 
High, which launched a magnet last year, 60 teachers applied for seven 
openings. 
</P>
<P>
 After a month's delay, the magnet brochure and application -- entitled 
"Choices" -- is available and the deadline is April 15. Students who are 
currently enrolled in magnets are given priority, along with siblings of magnet 
students and those whose names already are on the waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 If any new magnets are approved, a supplemental application and brochure will 
be printed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day at Gledhill Elementary, about 20 students lined up to use the 
sole computer in the third-grade classroom. On another day, students showed up 
before and after school to use a classroom terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with eight other schools, Gledhill proposes to specialize in math, 
science and technology. "Children are so turned on by technology," said Walsh, 
the principal. "They need to be entertained all the time. The computers give 
them another vehicle for learning." The Pull of the Magnet 
</P>
<P>

centers next year. The following is a list of the schools with their proposed

PREP FANS IN FRENZY FOR 3 O.C. TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Galvez is bald. The self-professed ladies' man of the Pacifica High 
School basketball team has lost his beloved hairstyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, but the lucky ones got a piece of him Wednesday night. Galvez's locks were 
among the items auctioned off to help raise money for the Mariners' trip to 
Oakland for their first state championship game Saturday. Call it a hair fair 
for air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 For three Orange County high schools, interest in basketball is peaking as the 
prep version of March Madness reaches its conclusion. At the Oakland Coliseum 
Arena, the girls of Woodbridge High in Irvine will be going for their first 
state Division II title tonight. The Ladycats of Brea-Olinda, a perennial state 
powerhouse, play Saturday for a record fifth Division III championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real frenzy is in Garden Grove, where Galvez and his teammates at 
Pacifica have become local heroes during their drive from obscurity to 
Saturday's Division III final against Foothill High of Sacramento. A banner 
hangs across Chapman Avenue; players have spoken and made presentations at 
local functions; local businesses, service organizations and rival high schools 
have lent their support, and one rabid fan has even written poems in the team's 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember when people in the community have gotten this excited about 
a team," Mayor Frank Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing has been too outlandish at Pacifica. From their rabid following to 
their unconventional style of play, things have been fast and loose around the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, after all, a team that has its tall players shoot three-pointers from 
long range, while the smaller players post up inside. It's an upside-down 
philosophy that has turned opponents inside out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all a game, and it's all fun," said Bob Becker, the first-year coach. 
"It's just been a fun group. They have worked hard, and now they are enjoying 
the rewards of that hard work. They are going off to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, I have to say that to myself about 50 times. We're going off to Oakland. 
It's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch yourself, baby. It's real. 
</P>
<P>
 State championship games are almost run-of-the-mill stuff at Brea-Olinda, 
playing in its sixth consecutive title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Their send-off will be heartfelt but businesslike. The only pep rally will be 
held in Oakland, before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, interest is running high. About 300 to 500 fans are expected to make 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 At Woodbridge, students were released from school Thursday at 12:10 and given 
sticks of Big Red gum (the school's colors are red, white and gold) before 
attending a rally. 
</P>
<P>
 T-shirts emblazoned with the Warriors' motto -- "Play Like a Champion" -- were 
handed out to the players. The band played the school song, and faculty and 
students performed the tomahawk chop as the team boarded a bus for the airport. 
About 300 fans were expected to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Ladycats and Warriors are enjoying a moment in the sun, 
Pacifica's Mariners are getting a deep tan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, Pacifica students, school employees and the community turned 
out to watch a team scrimmage. Becker also held the silent auction to raise 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Galvez, a senior guard, did bring in a tidy little sum with his hair. "Charles 
claimed that we would raise enough money for the trip from his hair alone," 
Becker said. "Maybe if we sold it by the strand." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Surface, a senior forward, gave basketball shoes. Erik Maurer, a senior 
forward, donated his earrings. The always-dapper Chris Vlasic tossed in a 
nearly empty mousse can; it went for a dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have signed 100 autographs Wednesday night," Vlasic said. "It's kind 
of weird." 
</P>
<P>
 The team raised $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is talking about the team," Pacifica Principal Mike Lombardi said. 
"In stores and supermarkets and barbershops, everyone seems to be aware." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rotary Club chipped in $500 after Vlasic, a senior forward, spoke at the 
club's Tuesday afternoon meeting. That evening, he made a presentation to 
district officials at a school board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to send Chris to those meetings," Becker said. "He's the only one on 
the team that looks good in a suit. That includes the coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 But there has been more that just monetary support: 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents spent hours at a time painting the canvas banner on Chapman. They 
worked on it for three days -- nearly fainting because of paint fumes -- after 
the Mariners' victory over San Dimas in the Southern Section Division III-A 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 * The girls' basketball team from Rancho Alamitos, a rival school, has adopted 
the Mariners, supplying cookies, cupcakes and posters during the playoff run. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paul Gaughen, who doesn't have a kid on the team, has written a poem for 
each playoff game. Before a game against the Pasadena Blair Vikings, he wrote: 
"Tuesday evening, the Mariner ship was ready to leave; 45 miles is a long way 
to sail; It was a Viking vessel we were out to nail. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 How many basketball teams have a poet laureate? 
</P>
<P>
 "We had people in the community calling to offer kids tickets to the (Southern 
Section) championship game," Becker said. "They wanted to make sure that 
students who couldn't afford tickets still got to go to the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Never more so than last Thursday, after the Mariners' come-from-behind victory 
over San Diego St. Augustine in the regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Maurer sprained his ankle in the game and missed the entire second 
half. Afterward, a local chiropractor opened his office so Maurer could be 
treated. They were there until 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were walking out, and Erik's mom told me that she had offered him money 
for his services, but he wouldn't take it," Becker said. "She said, 'Do you 
believe these people?' " 
</P>
<P>
 What the community has fallen for is a team that has taken almost everyone by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica (30-1) has won 28 consecutive games, seven in the playoffs. But 
winning wasn't the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never used the word winning ," Becker said. "We talk about hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners got a new definition for that with Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 After coaching Rancho Alamitos' girls for four seasons, he was hired last 
spring. The players had no idea what was in store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the Rancho girls told us about him," senior forward Ramon Alliman 
said. "All the conditioning, the midnight practice and the drills. We didn't 
believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 About the time Alliman was running with a truck tire tied to his waist, he was 
ready to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "About a week into practice, Ramon came home and said, 'This guy is crazy,' " 
said Yvonne Alliman, his mother. "He was so exhausted that he would fall asleep 
wearing the same clothes he practiced in." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the only team to beat the Mariners is Orange, in a tournament final in 
early December. Since then, Pacifica has worn down one team after another with 
its press-until-they-stress style. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners rallied from 22 points down against St. Augustine. They were down 
by 11 at halftime against University of San Diego High in the regional final, 
then ran the Dons down and won, 60-55. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those Pacifica guys come at you 100 m.p.h. all the time," Dons center Josh 
Merrill said. "They never let up." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker always uses 11 players in the first quarter, then rotates them 
throughout the game. The style is unique, as is his offensive philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic, who is 6-5, is the team's top three-point shooter. Surface, who is 
6-8, is a close second. Meanwhile, the 6-1 Alliman works inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes us tough to defend," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also makes them fun to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are not only showing up for games, they have become a force that has 
pushed the team, with banners, painted faces and just plain noise. 
</P>
<P>
 This from a school that has cared little about basketball in the past. Yet, 
winning the Garden Grove League title -- the Mariners first since 1971 -- 
changed that. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Pathetica' used to be the mentality here," said Karen Boehnke, a 
16-year-old junior. "Now it's fun to able to brag about your school." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds have swelled with each victory. Approximately 700 fans are expected in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing can keep them from a Pacifica game. One night poet Gaughen's car broke 
down, so he rode his bicycle from Garden Grove to east Anaheim for a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a spirit here, a sense of belonging," Principal Lombardi said. "I 
think the students have seen the value of hard work, that it can get you where 
you want to go. That's not an easy lesson to teach." 
</P>
<P>
 And as role models, the Mariners have been ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monday after they won the sectional title, the players and coaches visited 
Children's Hospital of Orange County, handing out gifts and talking to the 
kids. They also participated in the community's Little League parade the day of 
the sectional championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 On the court, the players don't talk smack to opponents or make outrageous 
gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of enthusiasm from students that might not usually be that 
excited about high school," said Ron Malmquist, a social science and physical 
education teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 That excitement will send the team off this morning. After a pep rally, 
students will form a human tunnel, leading from the gym to the bus. Hurdles 
will be placed along the route, 31 of them, representing each game. 
</P>
<P>
 Corny? Sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Fun? Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since basketball started, I've been going to games with people I really 
hadn't done that much with before," said Joi Guenther, a senior. "Everybody now 
has basketball in common."

MARINES RETURN TO TUSTIN AFTER STINT IN SOMALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Welcome Home Barry," read one hand-lettered sign. "Welcome Home Keano," read 
a banner. Nearby, in a child's writing: "Welcome Home Miguel." 
</P>
<P>
 With bright yellow ribbons affixed to tree trunks, colorful balloons flying 
above the bushes and placards saying, "Welcome Home Guys" scattered around the 
base, a helicopter squadron of 250 U.S. Marines landed here Thursday morning 
after a 6 1/2-month mission, most of it in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from Operation Restore Hope II, the Marines were anxious to restore 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Most scampered off to be with their families, while the bachelors drained a 
government-issue keg of beer, lined up at the pay phones and relearned how to 
drive. They had missed the fires, the floods and the earthquakes while 
providing troop support and humanitarian aid in Mogadishu. But what they had 
missed most, perhaps, was non-military food and beds that do not move with the 
waves of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody just came in and, like you do anytime after you get off a ship for 
six months, you cram six months of partying into three hours," said Sgt. Derek 
Somerville, who returned early from Somalia and helped prepare the hangar and 
the barracks for the troops. "Then, after that, some guys took off for dinner 
and a lot of them just went to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 By 4 p.m., nearly seven hours after landing, Cpl. Norman Lapinskas was still 
in his khaki uniform, all his civilian clothes churning loudly in the laundry 
machine near his room. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide smile plastered on his face, Lance Cpl. Dennis Martin, 21, had snuck 
into blue jeans but was still carrying his cup from the day's party as the sun 
began to set. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the pizza was delivered.  
</P>
<P>
 "Fantastic. More than that. It's indescribable," Lapinskas said when asked how 
it feels to be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day, you wake up, you're in the same spot, you do the same thing. Every 
day," said Martin, recalling the 84 days the squadron spent on the ship or in 
the air, never touching the ground. "You don't know what movies are out, you 
don't know what songs are on, you don't know what's going on. It's kind of like 
you're frozen for six months and someone thaws you out." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall, two guys in shorts and T-shirts huddled over telephone 
receivers, their fingers plugging their other ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is Jodi there?" one asked, expectantly. "This is Joe. . . . Yes, ma'am." And 
then, relieved: "Not much. . . . It's good to be home. Yeah. Got home today." 
</P>
<P>
 These Marines were part of Squadron 268, the Red Dragons. They left San Diego 
last Sept. 3 for training in Japan and Hong Kong, but were redeployed to 
Somalia when the conflict there heated up in October. 
</P>
<P>
 In Somalia, the Red Dragons transported nearly 20,000 passengers and more than 
3 million pounds of cargo while amassing more than 4,000 flight hours in their 
16 helicopters. They also participated in medical and dental aid to Somali 
civilians, along with forces from Morocco, Nigeria, Italy and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Tustin squadron has replaced them in Somalia, Marine officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday morning, the squadron's helicopters flew in formation, then, upon 
landing, were greeted by Marine Corps dignitaries and parents, sisters, 
brothers, spouses, and babies some had never seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the troops said what they saw in Somalia was not as bad as the 
pictures on television, and some Desert Storm veterans said the months during 
Operation Restore Hope passed quickly and uneventfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst part about it was the heat -- after that, just missing home," said 
Lance Cpl. Jason Feeney, who at 22 has already spent 4 1/2 years in the 
military, including a month and a half in Saudi Arabia and three months in 
Mogadishu. "It really wasn't that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Feeney, who was married just a year ago, had a happy reunion with his wife, 
Esmeralda. Then, he got back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing she said was, 'Is this all your bags?' " he said, grinning. 
"Then, it was, 'I missed you,' and great big hugs that lasted all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Rick Eppard, who left the mission a few weeks early to help prepare the 
Tustin base for the rest of the squadron's arrival, said there was a mixture of 
anxiety and excitement among the troops when they learned they were going to 
Somalia. He fondly remembered the humanitarian aid operations, but recalled 
with fear the constant violence on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to put Band-Aids on large problems -- it's kind of a quick fix," 
Eppard said of the medical and dental aid they provided. "They really need 
extended treatment, but we do what we can to help them." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the local warlords, he added: "They call them tribes, but it's 
similar to an L.A. gang: You go into one part of the city and this tribe owns 
it. If you're not part of that tribe, you're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the afternoon, Eppard and some of the other Marines who had flown 
back early brought the squadron's aircraft into the hangar and began 
maintenance work. The base was quiet, with the festivities over and the troops 
either asleep or gone for a long weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get four days off," Eppard explained. "Then they come back and we start 
it all over again."

 The state Senate approved a bill Thursday that provides tax relief to 
homeowners in Laguna Beach and other Southern California cities who lost their 
homes during the firestorms that swept the region last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 30-0 vote, the Senate sent the measure, by state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach), to the desk of Gov. Pete Wilson, who has promised to sign 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure provides enhanced tax write-offs for residents who lost their 
homes in the fires, which caused $1 billion in damage to private and public 
property over the course of a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bill authorizes an estimated $1.3 million in state aid to the 
six counties that stand to lose revenue because property tax assessments were 
adjusted downward for residents whose homes were destroyed by fire. The 
counties hit by fires were Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, 
Ventura and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar tax benefits were provided in other regions hit by recent disasters, 
such as the Oakland Hills fire and the Loma Prieta earthquake in the San 
Francisco Bay Area. Earlier this week, Wilson signed tax relief legislation for 
residents devastated by the powerful Northridge earthquake in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson said she tried to push the legislation so that residents can take 
advantage of it before the April 15 deadline for filing personal income tax 
returns. She said Wilson will probably sign the bill as soon as it hits his 
desk in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult to put into words the destruction the fire caused in Laguna 
Beach alone," Bergeson said. "California has had to endure so many disasters 
lately, such as the Northridge earthquake, that many people have forgotten the 
horrific fires of October and November. I guarantee that those affected have 
not been forgotten."

$417 MILLION MORE IN QUAKE AID OKD; ASSISTANCE: CLINTON ADMINISTRATION APPROVES 
MONEY FOR LOW-INTEREST LOANS AND GRANTS. AMOUNT INCLUDES $47.5 MILLION FOR NEW 
VALLEY VA FACILITY. 
</P>

<P>
 Faced with a continuing influx of applications for aid from homeowners and 
businesses, the Clinton Administration announced Thursday that it is making 
$417 million in new emergency loans and grants available to victims of the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistance includes $326 million in low-interest loans to repair and 
rebuild homes and businesses under the auspices of the Small Business 
Administration and $90.8 million that was previously approved by Congress as 
part of a presidential contingency fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest grant will be $47.5 million to build a veterans affairs outpatient 
care and research facility to replace the 431-bed, quake-devastated hospital at 
the Sepulveda VA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The money for the grants is part of a $550-million contingency fund included 
in the congressionally approved $8.6-billion quake aid package but was left to 
President Clinton's discretion to spend. The new loans will be supported by $75 
million remaining from a 1992 emergency spending measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget Director Leon E. Panetta said the enormous number of applications to 
the SBA -- which are still arriving at a rate of 3,000 a day two months after 
the Jan. 17 temblor -- could mean that additional money will be needed to meet 
the agency's obligations. He indicated that the money could come from other 
programs, including $447 million remaining in contingency funds, or might 
require the Administration to seek new money from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA has received nearly 400,000 requests for applications. It was given 
loan authority of $1.1 billion in the emergency earthquake bill. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the SBA has approved $410.2 million in loans to cover damage to homes 
and personal property and $39.8 million for businesses, although only a small 
fraction of applicants have received checks. Typically, about 40% of the 
applications sent out are returned for processing and 50% to 65% are 
subsequently approved, budget officials said. The average loan is $35,000 to 
$45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key right now is to see how much is going to be approved and at what 
level," Panetta said. "We have not, as far as I know, in this country 
experienced the dimensions of the kind of disaster we saw in Los Angeles. . . . 
What we're seeing now in the numbers of applications and the numbers of people 
that are being served is unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Panetta said the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which 
coordinates the federal disaster response and also provides short-term shelter 
and other aid, does not appear to be in danger of running short of money. FEMA 
received $4.7 billion in the emergency spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA reported Thursday that it has received 454,650 applications for relief. 
Thus far, it has approved $472.9 million in grants to 183,065 applicants for 
temporary housing and emergency home repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA said the total number of applications far exceeds the previous record for 
a U. S. disaster -- 304,000 after Hurricane Hugo in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Other grants include $28 million to finance about 2,200 temporary jobs for 
dislocated workers to clean up, repair and rebuild quake-damaged properties; $8 
million for local economic development planning and assistance to minority 
businesses, and $2.8 million for repair efforts in hard-hit, low-income 
communities.

LAPD PAY PLAN LEADS 'BLUE FLU' TO FIZZLE; LABOR: ONLY 10 OFFICERS FAIL TO 
REPORT FOR DUTY. BUT NEWS OF A PROPOSED 6% RAISE FOR POLICE ANGERS UNIONS 
REPRESENTING TRASH HAULERS, ENGINEERS AND OTHER CITY WORKERS. 
</P>

<P>
 A planned sickout by Los Angeles police fizzled Thursday when few officers 
failed to report for duty, but trouble erupted among other city unions angered 
that they have not been offered the same raises proposed for police. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-collar workers and engineers had been close to contract settlements that 
would have given them little or no raises, but they have pulled back after 
reports that Mayor Richard Riordan is prepared to offer police about 6% over 
two years, sources familiar with negotiations said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry union representatives said Thursday that they felt betrayed by Riordan 
because he is favoring public safety employees with raises. Two City Council 
members privately accused the mayor of botching negotiations by announcing his 
intent to offer police and firefighters a raise before concluding negotiations 
with other unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three-quarters of the city's 44,000 employees remain without contracts. 
They are represented by about 25 unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's staff on Thursday defended the mayor's announcement Wednesday that 
he intended to propose an unspecified raise, the city's first such offer in 21 
months of negotiations. David Novak, Riordan's press secretary, said Riordan 
has stated in the past that he would like to give police a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor's priority is to make Los Angeles safe," Novak said. "He has said 
that from a safe Los Angeles all else follows. (Police) are being paid a 
competitive salary to put their lives on the line for the people of Los 
Angeles. That is a very different type of public service than when people are 
not putting their life in danger or at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also said that when his proposal is unveiled next week, he will call 
for rule changes that make it easier for police supervisors to transfer 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Riordan would not say how much he would increase police officers' 
pay, sources familiar with the proposal said it would give them about 6% over 
the two years beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has promised firefighters that they will receive whatever raises the 
police get. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of other city workers said they feel slighted and will 
have more trouble settling their differences with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we were in the closing stages of our negotiations," said David 
Trowbridge of the Service Employees International Local 347, which represents 
custodians, trash haulers and other blue-collar workers. "But an announcement 
that the police officers and firefighters are going to get this increase really 
throws a monkey wrench into the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we all provide very essential services to the city and we should get 
the same recognition and respect for the services we provide," Trowbridge said. 
"This proposal shows a preference for one group." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the union had been prepared to settle for a short-term contract 
with no expectation of an increase on July 1, when the raises for public safety 
employees would begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Trowbridge declined to discuss specifics, he said union members are 
agitating for more aggressive action. He noted that Department of Water and 
Power workers got a raise last fall after going on strike and that the 
announcement of a raise for police came on the day that a renegade group of 
officers had threatened the sickout. 
</P>
<P>
 One city architect said the union that represents the city's engineers and 
architects also had been prepared to settle for little or no raises, but now 
will push hard to win the same raise that police and firefighters receive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have created in the mind of every employee organization the expectation 
that there is definitely going to be a significant salary increase," said the 
architect, who did not want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Two council members described Riordan's handling of the pay issue as naive and 
ham-fisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor's trademark is to push ahead and do things now," said one council 
member who did not want to be identified. "There are times when that is 
appropriate, like after the earthquake, and we praised him then. But if you 
have the same style for every situation then you might end up where we are 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 The critiques of Riordan came a day after the Police Department revealed that 
notices had been sent to an unknown number of officers, asking them to call in 
sick this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The call, which was publicly criticized by police union officials, had no 
impact on attendance Thursday, several police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, only 10 police officers called in sick, far fewer than normal. A 
preliminary investigation of those 10 officers suggested that all were 
legitimately ill, according to department sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department's management and executives at the Los Angeles Police 
Protective League had issued a rare joint communique urging officers not to 
take part in the sickout. It was unclear how many officers had planned the job 
action or whether the union's opposition had succeeded in heading it off. 
</P>
<P>
 But police union officials said they hoped their efforts had created goodwill 
that would lead to a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, leaders of the league complained that some details of the proposed 
contract as described to them appear unacceptable -- particularly one provision 
that would make it easier to transfer detectives back to patrol and another 
that would cut into the pay of officers who are injured on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to sell that thing to the membership," one league official 
said. "They'd never go for it."

THE PULL OF MAGNETS; EDUCATION: POOR TEST SCORES AND THE LOSS OF TOP STUDENTS 
PROMPT A FLURRY OF APPLICATIONS BY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOLS TO JOIN SPECIAL 
PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Motivated by falling test scores and the loss of high-achieving students, 18 
schools -- three times the number that typically apply -- want to become part 
of the highly prized magnet system in the L.A. Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools hope to offer specialized courses ranging from Latin music to 
journalism and media technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnets -- considered the gems of the school system -- offer smaller classes, 
more money for special activities and facilities and a handpicked faculty. 
Students must apply for entrance and the competition is stiff. Application 
brochures are available beginning today at all schools and Los Angeles public 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the pull of the magnets is strong, lack of funds could prevent many 
schools from achieving their goals. The smaller classes and enrichment 
activities cost more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the students and teachers choose magnets -- and are not just assigned 
to them -- principals of schools that have applied for that status say magnets 
have lower absenteeism, higher staff morale, more involved parents, higher test 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our test scores are going down, down, down," said Jan Walsh, the principal at 
Gledhill Elementary in North Hills. "We feel something is needed. We have to 
find something to turn these kids around. We're in a desperate situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The magnets also could attract students who plan to leave regular schools. 
Across the district, principals say they lose some of their high-achieving 
students to magnets. About 38,000 students apply to magnets every year for 
about 9,500 openings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lose many good kids," said Marilyn Erickson, the principal at Haskell 
Elementary in Granada Hills, which wants to specialize in math, science and 
technology. "It would be a way of keeping kids at my school and provide a 
program for parents who want magnet schools for their children." 
</P>
<P>
 At Millikan Middle School in Sherman Oaks, which is proposing to offer 
performing arts courses, Principal Pete Ferry said the campus could tap parents 
who work in the entertainment industry for support. Students at the school 
already are excited about the prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "One boy told me he has to check with his agent to see if he could do these 
kinds of things for free," Ferry said. "But there's a lot of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Millikan also loses students to magnets and other campuses, Ferry said. The 
magnet center could attract students to the campus. "We're trying to plug up 
the drain," Ferry said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever their intentions, the principals have a tough hurdle ahead. The 
Board of Education must approve their requests, and limited funding could be 
the death blow for schools' plans. The board probably will consider the 
applications in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Julie Korenstein, whose daughter attended magnets, said the 
problem is strictly financial. "I wish I could make every school a magnet," 
Korenstein said. "It's going to be a tough choice with the limited amount of 
funding we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein represents the board district with the most magnet students -- 
8,086. She also has the most students on the district's waiting list -- 6,367. 
The district expects to receive about 38,000 applications for the 108 magnets 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever they are and whatever they specialize in, students are doing 
better," Korenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district receives about 80% of the magnet funding from the state. A 
one-time, $10-million federal grant is paying in part for the math and science 
magnets. 
</P>
<P>
 That grant could be another reason for the increased number of schools 
applying to be magnets. "When there's money and the word goes out, applications 
start coming in," said school board President Leticia Quezada. "My preference 
is to establish the spirit and the environment in all our schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest benefit will be when all our schools become much more like our 
magnets," Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Created during the divisive busing battles in the late 1970s, magnets are 
intended to provide students from throughout the sprawling district with 
smaller, integrated and more specialized educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many principals believe the change will benefit parents who are seeking a 
better education for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magnets carry an aura of superior programs and instruction," said Merle 
Price, principal of Palisades High School in Pacific Palisades. "With all the 
recent concern about the quality of public education, I think there's a 
built-in constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Anna McLinn, principal of Marvin Avenue Elementary in West Los Angeles: 
"I think it's a last chance for our district. To me, it's the answer to low 
test scores." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials caution schools that becoming a magnet takes commitment and 
the desire on the part of the staff to make the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just pin a label on the school door," said Richard Battaglia, who 
oversees the district's magnet program. "Doing a good job in a magnet takes 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from students, teachers also select magnets. Principals interview and 
hire teachers who are interested in their specific programs. At Granada Hills 
High, which opened a magnet last year, 60 teachers applied for seven openings. 
</P>
<P>
 After a month's delay, the magnet brochure and application -- called "Choices" 
-- is available, and the deadline is April 15. Students currently enrolled in 
magnets are given priority along with siblings of magnet students and those 
whose names already are on the waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 If any new magnets are approved, a supplemental application and brochure will 
be printed, officials said.

DISPARITY IN ELDERLY HEALTH CARE REPORTED; MEDICARE: STUDY SAYS LOW-INCOME 
AREAS HAVE FAR HIGHER HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR PREVENTABLE CONDITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even with Medicare coverage, there are large and potentially life-threatening 
disparities in hospital admission patterns between rich and poor, rural and 
urban, and among black, Latino and white populations in Los Angeles County, a 
new study showed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, by the Los Angeles-based Center for Health Care Rights, found that 
people age 65 and over who live in low-income communities, particularly African 
Americans, are more likely than their counterparts in high-income areas to be 
hospitalized for medical conditions that could have been avoided with good 
preventive or primary care. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the study showed that high-income elderly people living on 
the Westside, as well as the state's elderly population as a whole, were 
significantly more likely than low-income African Americans and Latinos to 
undergo hip replacement, mastectomy and coronary bypass surgeries, where 
physician referrals are important. 
</P>
<P>
 "The study findings indicate that the provision of health care is not 
colorblind," said Geraldine Dallek, the executive director of the center and 
author of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report will not be officially released until today, but a copy was 
obtained in advance by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the study particularly noteworthy is that the population studied is 
insured through Medicare, a federally financed health care system that provides 
a uniform package of benefits to nearly everyone age 65 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 The study concluded that the red, white and blue Medicare card, which it 
called elderly peoples' "passport to virtually all physicians and hospitals in 
this country," in fact "does not buy equal access to health care in Los Angeles 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 It said access problems were experienced by all low-income elderly people in 
the county, but especially among blacks and Latinos. The center did not cite 
reasons for the problem, but suggested a range of shortcomings, such as a 
shortage of physicians in low-income communities, a higher likelihood of 
disease or disability in poorer areas, inadequate home care and high 
out-of-pocket expenses for medical services and drugs that are not covered by 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, previously known as the Medicare Advocacy Project, is an advocacy 
group for Medicare recipients with a history of doing exhaustive research into 
the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study is further confirmation of evidence that has turned up in many 
other studies by academic and health researchers showing that there is a 
division along economic, racial and ethnic lines in the distribution of health 
care services that contributes to higher death and morbidity rates in 
low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The results also raise questions about one of the underlying premises of 
national health care reform, which is that providing all Americans with health 
insurance cards will solve many of the nation's health care distribution 
problems.  
</P>
<P>
 "This shows that it is not enough just to furnish a health insurance card to 
people. You have to address other problems in the health care delivery system," 
Dallek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallek said she finds Los Angeles County a perfect place for comparative 
health studies because of its vast geographic area, its diverse ethnic and 
racial mix, and the clearly defined wealthy and impoverished communities. She 
generated the numbers in the new study by dividing the county into 65 hospital 
market areas. The study analyzed age- and sex-adjusted hospital admission rates 
in 1990 and 1991 in Los Angeles County and compared them to those of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 She found that in Watts, where 77% of the elderly population is black, 
Medicare recipients were 57% more likely than the state's Medicare population 
as a whole to be hospitalized for gastroenteritis, 76% more likely to be 
hospitalized for kidney or urinary tract infections, 85% more likely to be 
hospitalized for asthma, 210% more likely to be hospitalized for congestive 
heart failure and diabetes and 451% more likely to be hospitalized for 
hypertension. All of these conditions can be treated on an outpatient basis 
with preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the same comparisons with the statewide Medicare population, the study 
found that elderly people in the high-income, predominantly white Santa Monica 
area were significantly less likely to be hospitalized for those conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the question of surgeries, in the low-income, predominantly Latino 
community of Boyle Heights, elderly people were 45% less likely than the 
state's elderly population as a whole to undergo a hip joint replacement, 29% 
less likely to undergo a mastectomy, 21% less likely to receive a coronary 
artery bypass and 39% less likely to undergo a coronary angioplasty. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles' predominantly white Westside, elderly people were 34% more 
likely to undergo a coronary artery bypass and 50% more likely to receive a 
coronary angioplasty, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 David Langness, a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California, 
said: "We've known for a long time that people in poor neighborhoods are 
hospitalized more often because they tend not to have a primary care physician 
or go in for for regular checkups and care. Their conditions worsen until they 
need hospital care." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Leonard Lawrence, president of the National Medical Assn., an association 
of black physicians, and an associate dean at the University of Texas Health 
Science Center in San Antonio, said he did not think issues raised in the study 
"are that unique" to Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Access means more than a card or a clinic. It means people being able to come 
into a care-giving system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Langness said he found the statistics on surgeries surprising, and was at a 
loss to explain possible reasons. He said the study "raised some serious 
questions that we will have to examine."

UCLA'S SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO REMAIN INTACT IN RESTRUCTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UCLA School of Public Health, scheduled to be "disestablished" in a 
cost-cutting restructuring effort, has been reprieved and will continue to 
function as a separate school, Abdelmonem Afifi, dean of the school, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's budget will be cut by about 25% over three to five years, 
however.  
</P>
<P>
 In the original restructuring proposal announced last June, some of the 
school's departments were to be folded into a new School of Public Policy. As a 
compromise, a new department of health policy studies will be established in 
the School of Public Policy and many researchers in the School of Public Health 
will hold joint appointments, according to a proposal in a letter sent to the 
UCLA Academic Senate by Chancellor Charles E. Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes in the proposed restructuring affecting the undergraduate School 
of Nursing and the School of Architecture and Urban Planning, among others, are 
proceeding as planned, but are still subject to approval by the Academic 
Senate.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're ecstatic, of course," Afifi said. "It's much easier to come back from a 
budget cut than to come back from the dead."  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes were necessitated by cutbacks in UC funding imposed by 
the legislature. Young chose to meet those restraints by selective cuts of 
campus programs rather than by imposing across-the-board reductions he has said 
could lead the university to mediocrity.  
</P>
<P>
 Under Young's original plan, the schools of Public Health and Architecture and 
Urban Planning would be dismantled and their courses incorporated into other 
disciplines. The School of Social Welfare and the School of Library and 
Information Sciences would also be downgraded. Many of the courses would be 
reconstituted in a new School of Public Policy. In addition, Young plans to 
shut down the undergraduate degree program for nursing and the master's and 
doctoral programs in library studies.  
</P>
<P>
 Response to the proposed closings has been vociferous, especially with regard 
to the schools of public health and nursing, which have come to new prominence 
in this time of health care reform. The public health school, especially, has 
had active programs in violence prevention and AIDS education and prevention, 
Afifi said, and the faculty has been active in the debate over health care 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The school must still solve its funding problems, however. "We've been told 
that the campus will do its best to make the phase-in (of funding cuts) in such 
a way as to protect the academic program and to allow us to seek extramural 
funding to compensate for the loss," Afifi said. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged, however, that finding new funds will not be easy in the 
current economic climate.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WOODLAND HILLS; VALLEY 
COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO REPLACE PIERCE COLLEGE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of Pierce College, the target of a no-confidence motion by his 
faculty last fall, is being replaced by the president of Valley College -- 
herself the object of a no-confidence vote by that school's faculty after the 
January quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Community College District officials are expected to announce 
today that Pierce President Lowell Erickson will take a leave of absence and 
his post will be assumed by Valley College President Mary Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming change was confirmed by the presidents of both 16,000-student 
campuses Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson said he would "probably not" return to the nine-campus district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake and budget problems have been factors in the decision but not 
the no-confidence vote by the faculty," said Erickson, 58. The Pierce faculty 
had scheduled a vote on a no-confidence motion last October, but the formal 
balloting was postponed and no vote was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, 54, who has been president of Valley College for 13 years, was criticized 
by her faculty for reopening the Van Nuys campus two days after the Jan. 17 
quake. A total of 88 of 90 faculty members voted for the criticism, contending 
it was still unclear whether campus buildings -- which apparently were not 
seriously damaged -- were safe.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BREAK ON 
LOANS SOUGHT FOR TWO-TIME DISASTER VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that many Korean American merchants have suffered more than their share 
of economic damage and personal anguish during the last two years, a Korean 
American advocacy group Thursday called on the federal government to forgive 
payment on federal riot disaster loans to merchants who were "double victims" 
of the 1992 Los Angeles riots and 1994 Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're calling for the Small Business Administration to think of this as an 
investment in the community," said Bong Hwan Kim, executive director of the 
Korean Youth & Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 200 Korean Americans whose businesses were looted or set on fire 
during the riots also suffered damage to their homes or businesses in the Jan. 
17 quake, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the loan forgiveness plea was lukewarm among other speakers 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean-American Grocers' Victims Assn. President Jae Yul Kim, who received 
approval for a $400,000 federal riot disaster loan, suffered $4,000 in 
earthquake damage to personal possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, who has been unable to reopen his South-Central mini-market because of 
opposition from community activists seeking to limit inner city liquor 
licenses, said he would be satisfied if the SBA postponed monthly riot loan 
payments until he can start a new business. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my case, the American government is helping good, helping real good," he 
said. "The community, they don't want a liquor store."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CRA OPTS 
TO NEGOTIATE WITH MALL DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Community Redevelopment Agency board opted Thursday to negotiate, rather 
than sue, to settle a dispute with a mall developer over the city's interests 
in the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza.  
</P>
<P>
 The board met for three hours before making its decision, CRA spokesman Marc 
Littman said.The city's negotiators will report back on April 7. 
</P>
<P>
 CRA commissioners believe the city was entitled to half the proceeds when 
Manhattan Beach developer Alexander Haagen sold the mall to a real estate 
investment trust that he controls. The city has invested $50 million in the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall had been built under an agreement between Haagen and the CRA, but 
Haagen's representatives contend that the sale netted nothing for the city 
because the mall was sold at a loss.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MEASURE ON 
SPLITTING UP SCHOOL DISTRICT DEFEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill that would have paved the way for splitting up the massive Los Angeles 
Unified School District was defeated Thursday in the Assembly, severely 
diminishing the chances that the school break-up movement will make any headway 
in the Capitol this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation by Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) would have 
reduced the number of signatures required to put the question of splitting up 
the 640,000-student school district before Los Angeles voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland said the Assembly's 35-33 vote "just kills the bill. . . . But I'm 
going to plow ahead with this issue. I refuse to give up and I'm not going to 
let the parents down." Boland's bill needed 41 votes to pass. Although 
technically it could be resurrected in a conference committee, observers said 
the outcome would be the same if it returned to the Assembly floor.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HAHN HAS MOST ELECTION 
FOES (15), MOLINA HAS LEAST (0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles County Assessor Kenneth P. Hahn will face a crowded field of 15 
challengers in the June 7 primary, while Supervisor Gloria Molina will run 
unopposed for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block will face seven challengers in his bid for reelection, 
and four candidates will vie to succeed retiring five-term Supervisor Ed 
Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing deadline for most countywide seats was last Friday. The deadline 
was extended to Wednesday for Edelman's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessor's race shapes up as perhaps the most spirited battle. Hahn will 
be challenged by the man he replaced four years ago, John J. Lynch, now a tax 
assessment adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the other contenders are also current or former employees in the 
assessor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Those running are Alan Bato, a deputy county assessor from Walnut; Robert 
Burman, a manager in the assessor's office from Sunland; Roy Z. Cossio, a 
deputy assessor from Maywood; Ruben Vasquez Chagoy, a deputy assessor from Los 
Angeles; Richard B. Forsch, a Beverly Hills attorney; Khalil Khalil, an 
engineer and consultant from Los Angeles, and John Carl Brogdon, a taxpayer's 
appeals representative from Long Beach who also ran for the job four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates: Dennis C. Kumaus, a deputy assessor from Palmdale; Roy R. 
Sharman, a chief appraiser from Valencia; Marsha G. Tuton, a deputy assessor 
from Whittier; William R. Lenney Jr., a deputy assessor/contractor from Pomona; 
Harley Lee Outten, an assessor's representative from Valencia; Nick Stansfield, 
a deputy assessor from Long Beach, and Lancaster businesswoman Janet Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 The field for sheriff is only slightly less packed and also includes a number 
of challengers from within the department, including Deputy Sheriff Gil 
Carrillo of Los Angeles, Deputy Sheriff Tab Rhodes of Whittier and Sheriff's 
Sgt. John Stites of the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Other contenders are Robert Irmas, a businessman and reserve captain from Los 
Angeles; John Bernard Kihm III, a state contractor and investigator from Los 
Angeles; Robert H. Lewis Jr., a Metro Transit police officer from West Covina, 
and Joseph G. Senteno, a custodian supervisor from Lennox. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates for Edelman's 3rd District supervisorial seat are Los Angeles 
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky; Don Wallace of Calabasas, a former fire 
captain and ex-deputy to Edelman; Michael S. Hirsch, an environmental 
consultant from Van Nuys, and Elgin Trammell Sr., an attorney from Lake View 
Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Bond, a campaign consultant Supervisor Molina, expressed surprise at the 
lack of opposition in that race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't got the vaguest idea why nobody ran against her, but it's kind of 
nice to have that happen," Bond said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; OFFICER 
WOUNDS SUSPECTED BANK ROBBERS AFTER CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Torrance police officer shot two bank robbery suspects Thursday after they 
led authorities on a brief high-speed chase. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Los Angeles teen-agers, 16 and 17 years old, were in stable condition 
in the jail ward at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, said Torrance Police 
Lt. Dennis Addington.He said an officer fired a single shot that struck one 
teen-ager in the knee and the other in the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also arrested a third suspect, Amar Malik Moseley, 18, of Los Angeles, 
who was not wounded, Addington said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were booked on suspicion of robbing the Home Savings branch on 
Torrance Boulevard. Witnesses said three gunmen burst into the bank at 9:42 
a.m. and ordered employees and customers to lie on the floor. No one was hurt, 
but the robbers fled with an undisclosed amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects had lost control of their car and crashed into a curb before the 
officer fired the shot that wounded two of them.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORWALK; TRIAL SET FOR 
EX-TV HOST ACCUSED OF MURDER PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An April 27 trial date was set Thursday for a former cable TV talk show host 
and his father, who allegedly tried to hire a hit man to kill a girl whose 
testimony eventually helped convict the younger man of rape.  
</P>
<P>
 Tito David Valdez Jr., 23, was sentenced on March 4 to 14 years in prison for 
rape and child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 13-year-old girl's testimony during the trial, the younger 
Valdez picked her up at her home around midnight on April 28, 1993, to 
interview her for a job on his program, "Hollywood Haze." Valdez claimed it was 
the only time he could be free to interview her. He then took her to his Downey 
home and raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez and his father will be tried for solicitation to commit murder and 
conspiracy to commit murder. They allegedly paid an undercover Downey police 
officer to shoot the girl so she could not testify in the rape trial.

RON HARRIS: SOMETIMES THE GOOD GUYS ARE HARD TO FIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Politically, I never think of anything good coming out of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, it's largely a bland place populated by little hard brains, the kind of 
people who brought us Nixon and Deukmejian, who yearn for Reagan and who in 
their longing have established California's only chapter of the national Rush 
Limbaugh Fan Club. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Rep. William E. Dannemeyer of Fullerton, a man who suggests that AIDS 
victims be numbered and quarantined and who, on one of his better days, likened 
Nelson Mandela to a convicted murderer and called Mandela's appearance before 
the joint houses of Congress a "national disgrace." It's Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
of Garden Grove, a man who calls men who support abortion rights "women trapped 
in men's bodies . . . who are looking for an easy lay." 
</P>
<P>
 Like I said, I never think of anything good coming out of Orange County. 
Except for a guy named Michael Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher is the head of Orange County's Probation Department. For the past 
18 years he's been wrestling with the question of how to reduce juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he's come up with something intriguing -- not a hunch, not an 
emotion-driven guess, but a plan rooted in hard evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort dubbed the "Eight Percent" study, Schumacher and his probation 
officers tracked first-time juvenile offenders in Orange County for up to six 
years after their first brush with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what they found. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of children, 71%, are never arrested again after their first 
brush with the law. Twenty-one percent may get popped a second or third time, 
but after that their flirtation with delinquency ends. 
</P>
<P>
 But a small group, 8% of the kids, become chronic, repeat offenders, arrested 
as many as eight times. And that tiny hard knot commits more than half of all 
the juvenile offenses in Orange County, graduating from petty crimes to hard 
stuff such as armed robbery, rape and drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 What is most significant is that Schumacher's staff has developed a criterion 
for identifying those potential "eight percenters" from the first time they 
stroll through the detention doors on some minor offense. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it? 
</P>
<P>
 They are the kids with problems, lots of problems: family problems, school 
problems, drug and alcohol problems. Many are kids who live in X-rated 
neighborhoods and X-rated homes: abused kids, neglected kids, lost kids, the 
kids about whom teachers often say to me, "They have so many problems it's a 
miracle that they even make it to school every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher has taken this new data and come up with the idea that if he can 
provide this now identifiable group the kinds of things they so desperately 
need -- drug and alcohol rehabilitation, stable homes, family counseling, close 
personal supervision -- they won't come back through his door again.  
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of his strategy is a simple notion: It is better for you and me 
not to get robbed, beaten or killed than to send some kid away forever after 
we've been robbed, beaten or killed. 
</P>
<P>
 From a very selfish standpoint, I like his approach. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Schumacher is trying to marshal enough resources and coordination through 
the various agencies to deal with those kids' problems early. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we help these kids," he says, "society on the whole will benefit. There 
will be fewer victims, fewer wasted lives and far less costs to taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Schumacher is no softy, no bleeding-heart liberal. He's more of a 
pragmatist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't argue that people who victimize other people have to be dealt with 
sternly," he says. "And it would be naive to think that we'll be able to turn 
all these kids around, but any significant number has a tremendous long-term 
impact on society. If we don't find a way to turn these kids around at first 
offense, there will never be an end to this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of people are excited about what Schumacher has found. His office has 
already gotten about 150 requests for copies of his studies from agencies and 
operations across the nation, and even as far away as Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 So, you'd think that those state representatives from Orange County would be 
standing in line to help come up with money to support Schumacher's efforts. 
Well, you'd be wrong. The only legislator so far to propose funding his effort 
is Assemblyman Tom Connolly from San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Like I said, politically, I never think of anything good coming out of Orange 
County.

A REAL BLOWOUT; JEANNE HUM, A PERFORMER OF NOTE HERSELF, IS EXPECTING CHAMPION 
WHISTLERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD AT ANNUAL PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She doesn't hum. 
</P>
<P>
 Nope, Jeanne Hum whistles. And when she whistles each year at this time, her 
friends come running. 
</P>
<P>
 Hum, a championship whistler, has summoned other whistlers and whistle-music 
enthusiasts to bring their green hats and pursed lips to her Rolling Hills 
Estates home tonight for her annual St. Patrick's Day party. 
</P>
<P>
 With five international and national champion whistlers in the crowd, it's a 
good bet that nobody will be wishing there was a bagpipe around to pump some 
feeling into "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Among this country's 50 or so professional whistlers, Hum's yearly party is 
famous. She and her husband, Bob, have turned their place into a St. Patrick's 
Day whistle stop for nearly 25 years. This year's 45 guests are coming from 
Australia, Canada and as far east as Florida. Some even RSVP'd before the 
invitations were sent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to promote whistling as an art form. We take it very seriously. But we 
have fun too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hum, 64, has had fun ever since she discovered her unique talent at age 5. She 
said nuns at her Youngstown, Ohio, elementary school at first tried to blow the 
whistle on her music, saying it was unladylike. 
</P>
<P>
 But she found plenty of support at home. Whistler's mother happily chauffeured 
her girl around town to perform. In fact, it was during one of those outings -- 
to a club audition at age 15 -- that Hum met the man she would eventually 
marry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to my mother that Hum was the dumbest name. But I've always liked 
being Hum. I tell people that now they know a whistling Hum." She even titled 
her first album "Hum Whistles." 
</P>
<P>
 Hum has done whistle-overs for two movies and won seven trophies at 
international "whistle-off" competitions in the United States and at the 
European Whistling Championships. And some travelers consider the unusual music 
she provided for one U.S. airline's in-flight audio system to be a breath of 
fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll keep tonight's party humming with traditional Irish food and drink. But 
don't expect much Irish whiskey to be downed early: Her friends know better 
than to wet their whistles with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "One drink, OK," Hum explained. "Two drinks you start downhill. Three drinks 
and it's over. It makes your mouth too dry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Alan Lomax, a national champion from Murietta, Calif., who is known for 
the classical music he whistles, said he has been looking forward all year to 
tonight. "It's a nice way for whistlers to get together," the 33-year-old 
electronics technician said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Bell, a former national grand champion and 74-year-old retired plumber 
from Sunnyvale, said he may pucker up tonight for one of his favorite tunes: 
"Danny Boy." "It's difficult because it's got a lot of high notes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests include Bob Larson, a Mesa, Ariz., resident who is current 
president of the International Assn. of Whistlers, and international champion 
Herman Smith of Palmdale.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get people to realize that there's a lot more to whistling 
than bird calls," said Larson, 69, a retired cardboard company designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of tonight's invitees are whistlers, Hum said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if anybody shows up thinking her kind of music isn't really music, she 
predicts they'll be whistling a different tune when they leave.

CONSTRUCTION FAULTS ALLEGED IN BUILDING COLLAPSE; QUAKE: MATERIALS USED IN 
NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS ALLEGEDLY DID NOT COMPLY WITH ARCHITECTS' PLANS, ENGINEER 
SAYS. BUILDER'S LAWYER SAYS THE COMPLEX MET CODE REQUIREMENTS.

 The fractured walls and floors of the Northridge Meadows apartment complex 
reveal alleged "construction defects" that may have contributed to the 
building's collapse during the Jan. 17 earthquake, according to a consultant 
who says he has reviewed the original building plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard J. Phillips, a former president of the Structural Engineers Assn. of 
Southern California, said Thursday that he also has reviewed photographs of the 
building and other documentation gathered by attorneys representing the 
families of two of the 16 people killed in the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said the documentation indicates that some wooden and metal supports 
in the building were less strong than those specified by the building's 
architects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly all these things go together with the apparent lack of quality 
control in the . . . construction of this building, which (apparently) led to 
its failure," said Phillips, who was hired by The Times to review the 
documentation. He heads a city task force on seismic hazard reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Heller Construction of Westlake Village, which built the complex, 
said that it complied with codes when the structure was built in the early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is whether or not it complied with the standards in existence at 
that time, rather than whether it complied with a certain set of plans," said 
Jon Mower, Heller's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit has been filed on behalf of the families of Northridge Meadows 
residents Ann Cerone and Bea Reskin, who were killed in the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 A March 1 court order by San Fernando Superior Court Judge Judith Meisels 
Ashmann stalled demolition of the 163-unit complex indefinitely so that 
evidence regarding the collapse could be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing today in Van Nuys, the attorney for building owners Shashikant 
and Renuka Jogani, who purchased the apartments about a decade after they were 
built, will seek another court order to block or limit public release of the 
findings and to bar the families' attorney, Joel B. Castro, from speaking about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the alleged defects that Phillips said have been identified by engineers 
and other consultants working for the plaintiffs: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nails used throughout the building were smaller than the nails required by 
the building plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joist hangers that secured beams to the walls were half the size of those 
specified in the plans. The plans also called for nine-inch joist hangers to be 
secured by nails; pronged four-inch joist hangers were used instead.  
</P>
<P>
 * Diagonal strips of 1-by-6-inch wood were used under 1 1/2 inches of concrete 
laid to form the second and third floors, instead of plywood, as called for in 
the plans. The 8-by-4-foot sheets of plywood would have provided more 
resistance to the forces of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Metal pipes supporting apartment units built over parking spaces were not as 
strong as specified. The wall of the circular pipe should have been 
one-half-inch thick, but was only one-quarter of an inch thick. All four of the 
parking bays at the complex collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said several engineers, architects and other experts are analyzing the 
findings for his office. They include structural engineers from Conrad 
Associates of Van Nuys, architects from O'Leary Terrasawa Partners of Los 
Angeles, and Robert Powell, a leading expert on wood technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Mower said none of the defects suggested by Castro's consultants have been 
found by a structural engineer retained by that firm. He declined to name the 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have looked at it and we have not identified problems with either the 
plans or the construction," said Keith Koeller, another attorney representing 
Heller. 
</P>
<P>
 Koeller said that building plans routinely change as construction progresses, 
and he is trying to reconstruct the building history in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Meadows was built before building codes were tightened after the 
1971 Sylmar earthquake. Officials have said the construction met codes in force 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineering study, undertaken as part of a lawsuit seeking damages for the 
deaths in the apartment, has assessed only whether builders matched the design 
of the architect, not whether building codes were followed, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspection records of the complex have been destroyed in a routine purge of 
old records, according to Ron Nelson, records management coordinator for the 
Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Meadows did not appear to be constructed any differently from many 
other buildings of its era, and similar construction problems were detected in 
other buildings after the quake, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortcuts, he said, are commonplace in apartment construction -- and the 
inspections and quality controls for high-rises and other large commercial 
structures are more thorough than those applied to most apartment building 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said that further examinations of the pancaked first floor and 
foundation of the Northridge Meadows Apartments are likely to reveal other 
clues to the three-story structure's collapse. But these areas can not be 
examined until the top two floors are dismantled and removed during a costly 
controlled demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the quake, engineers and officials with the city's Building and 
Safety department said the lack of plywood-reinforced shear walls probably 
played a role in the collapse. The plywood reinforcements were not required in 
1970, when the building plans were approved. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Joganis, The suit names Heller and his construction 
company; architect Morris Brown, and structural engineer Woodward Tom. Alleged 
Defects at Northridge Meadows * The earthquake-triggerd collapse of the 
apartment building killed 16 people. Lawyers working for relatives of two fo 
the victims have allegedly found evidence of construction defects that may have 
contributed to the building's collapse. * Support pipes were too thin * The 
walls of the hollow, 4-inch pipe columns supporting units above parking garages 
were 1/4 inch thick instead of 1/2 inch, as architect's plans specified. * 
Weaker nails substituted * The "sinker" nails they used throughout the building 
were weaker than the "common" nails called for. The ones used were shorter and 
thinner. * Incorrect joist hangers used * Joist hangers that secured vertical 
weight-bearing wooden beams to the walls were half the size of the joists 
called for in the plans. The hangers were supposed to be secured by nails, but 
inspectors found some of them secured only by clamps. * Floors supported 
insufficiently * Diagonal strips of 1-by-6-inch wood were used under the 
concrete laid to form the floors, instead of plywood. The 4-by 8 foot sheets of 
plywood would have been stronger and more able to sustain the movement caused 
by the quake.

BRITISH AIRWAYS, USAIR GET OK TO EXTEND PACT; AIRLINES: SECRETARY OF 
TRANSPORTATION EXTENDS THE DEAL A YEAR BUT SAYS HE IS UNHAPPY WITH ACCESS GIVEN 
TO U.S. CARRIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena on Thursday approved a one-year 
extension of a controversial aviation pact between British Airways and USAir, 
despite dissatisfaction with the pace of government talks to give U.S. airlines 
greater access to British airports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been very disappointed with the lack of progress in the negotiations," 
Pena said. "Over the last year, the British government has demonstrated no real 
interest in pursuing a new and more liberal aviation regime that would give 
U.S. airlines comparable competitive opportunities to those of U.K. carriers." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the U.S. Department of Transportation granted USAir and British 
Airways authority to share airline reservation codes to a number of U.S. cities 
to facilitate the coordination of British Airways' international routes with 
USAir's domestic lines. That agreement was set to expire Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The code-sharing agreement -- which allows travelers to make reservations to 
destinations of both carriers -- was made after British Airways announced it 
would invest up to $750 million in USAir over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the Department of Transportation made approval of the deal 
contingent on the British government allowing greater access by U.S. carriers 
to British airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argue that existing treaties do not give U.S. carriers enough access 
to British airports, including London's Heathrow, a major European 
transportation hub. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also told the carriers not to complete the final phase of the 
deal until it could review the nature of the ownership interest that British 
Airways would acquire in USAir as a result of its investment. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pena had decided not to extend the agreement, it could have thrown the two 
nations' talks on opening aviation markets into turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding Pena's comments Thursday, British Airways officials cheered 
his decision.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased that the traveling public will continue to be able to benefit 
from our code-sharing with USAir," company spokesman John Lampl said. "We 
remain committed to our partnership with USAir and our program of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also remain committed to the goal of a progressive liberalization of the 
bilateral relationship between the U.S.A. and the U.K., which is fair to the 
airlines of both countries," Lampl said. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines, which supported the agreement and has been seeking a similar 
arrangement with Lufthansa German Airlines, said in a statement that it is very 
pleased with the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 But American Airlines, which bitterly opposed the renewal, said in a statement 
that the agreement "gives (British Airways) extraordinary access to passengers 
who would otherwise be carried by U.S. carriers, without offering U.S. carriers 
any opportunity . . . (to compete) in B.A. markets beyond Heathrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials, meanwhile, have said that completion of British 
Airways' proposed investment in USAir would require Congress to modify 
restrictions on foreign ownership of U.S. airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the department said it would support legislation to allow a 
foreign firm to acquire up to 49% of the voting stock of a U.S. carrier, but it 
added that any such reform would depend on reciprocal agreements granting 
access rights for U.S. airlines and investors overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, British Airways indicated that it would not proceed with further 
investment in USAir, whose operating costs are among the highest in the airline 
industry. Its investment so far has been $400 million.

'STRAIGHT TALK' STUTTERS AGAIN; SECURITIES: PRUDENTIAL DROPS A SECOND AD TO 
HEAD OFF EMBARRASSMENT, BUT IT DEFENDS CAMPAIGN AND SAYS IT WILL STICK WITH IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two months ago, Prudential Securities launched its $20-million "straight talk" 
advertising campaign to try to resurrect the brokerage's badly damaged 
reputation. Instead, the campaign appears to be backfiring. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time, Prudential has taken the embarrassing step of withdrawing 
one of the ads after it ran. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad was yanked because it contained a false statement and because the 
Beverly Hills broker it features sold many limited partnership units -- the 
products that tattered Prudential's image in the first place, plunging the firm 
into a costly legal morass and costing small investors hundreds of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad is a full-page photo of broker Susan B. Gooding, with a series of 
statements superimposed on her image: "From where I sit, preserving integrity 
is not a lost art," says one. "Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy 
sleep," reads another. 
</P>
<P>
 The last statement: "One of my clients is my father." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Gooding says her father died in December, 1991 -- and was never her 
client. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential spokesman William J. Ahearn described the misstatement as a "typo," 
saying Gooding had filled out a questionnaire listing her father-in-law as a 
client. Prudential's marketing department misread her answer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooding, who had to tell her mother about the mistake, says she wishes 
Prudential executives had been more careful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always honest and up-front with my customers and in everything I do," 
Gooding said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad appears in the April issue of Architectural Digest, a Los Angeles-based 
magazine with a circulation of 750,000. It was scheduled to run in many other 
publications, but Prudential canceled it. Ahearn said Prudential tried to stop 
the ad from running in Architectural Digest but was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ahearn, Prudential decided to pull the ad in part because Gooding 
"had sold some partnership interests herself, and we didn't want to paint a 
bull's-eye on her forehead." The firm was concerned that the ad would invite 
lawsuits against Gooding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The review of the Gooding ad was sparked in February, when Prudential canceled 
a television commercial that was part of the same campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial featured Jeff Daggett, a broker in Prudential's Downtown Los 
Angeles branch. "I try to recommend investments that won't jeopardize my 
clients' last years on the planet," he said in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential pulled the commercial after an 81-year-old Roman Catholic priest 
filed suit against Daggett and the firm. Msgr. Maximos Mardelli accused them of 
costing him his retirement nest egg by misleading him into investing heavily in 
limited partnerships. Daggett has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential is under federal criminal investigation as a result of its sale of 
$8 billion in partnership units to some 400,000 investors, many of them 
retirees. The brokerage has settled civil securities fraud charges filed by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Without admitting or denying the charges, 
Prudential agreed to pay $41 million in fines and put at least $330 million 
into a fund to reimburse customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the miscues, Prudential says it has no plans to withdraw the ad 
campaign, developed in conjunction with the brokerage by Deutsch Advertising in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went out with a campaign we thought was right and we still think it's 
right," Ahearn said. Other ads in the campaign feature Prudential customers, 
Chief Executive Hardwick Simmons and other brokers.  
</P>
<P>
 John R. Perkins, Missouri's securities commissioner, expressed incredulity 
Thursday that Prudential has had to withdraw a second ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to have one of these occur, but to have it happen two times 
very clearly raises a concern about whether they (Prudential) really have 
changed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate development Thursday, California's top securities regulator said 
the state expects to sign a long-delayed settlement with Prudential within 10 
days. California has been the last holdout among the 50 states in settling 
state civil charges arising from the partnership fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations Commissioner Gary S. Mendoza said his negotiations with 
Prudential will mean that California's 42,000 limited partnership investors may 
receive about $30 million to $50 million more than they would have otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prudential sharply disputed those figures, saying investors nationwide 
will receive no more than $25 million extra as a result of an agreement about 
how partnership units still held by investors will be valued.

THRIFTY LIKELY TO MOVE FROM L.A. TO OREGON, RIORDAN SAYS; ECONOMY: MAYOR SAYS 
THE COMPANY INTENDS TO RELOCATE AFTER IT COMPLETES ITS PLANNED MERGER WITH 
PAYLESS CHAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE and JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another possible blow to Los Angeles' struggling economy, Mayor Richard 
Riordan said Thursday that Thrifty Drug Stores intends to move its headquarters 
to Oregon after it completes a planned merger with the PayLess drugstore chain. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Thrifty's principal owner, Leonard Green & Partners, said no 
decision has been made, but Riordan said he was told personally by Leonard 
Green, the firm's head, that the move will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Green was unavailable for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said Green told him that the new, combined company would be based in 
Wilsonville, Ore. -- a Willamette Valley town south of Portland -- largely 
because Tim McAlear, the head of PayLess, wants to maintain the headquarters 
there. The Times in December reported that McAlear would be named chief 
executive of the combined company under a merger plan approved by Green's 
investment partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, this is the way that the corporate world goes," Riordan said. 
"The corporate headquarters usually goes with the chief executive officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a move would sting the Los Angeles economy because Thrifty employs about 
800 people at its Wilshire Boulevard headquarters -- a payroll of about $40 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also mean a loss of tax revenue to the city and would probably have a 
negative ripple effect on hundreds of Southland companies that sell goods and 
services to managers at Thrifty headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he telephoned Green to try to persuade him to maintain Thrifty's 
corporate offices in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I offered to get together with him," Riordan said in an interview. "I said, 
'We will do anything' -- that we would come up with something. But, basically, 
being a businessman myself . . . he convinced me there was nothing we could 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting through a spokeswoman, Green denied that he told the mayor there 
had been a decision to move to Wilsonville. The partnership can make no 
decision on the headquarters site until the merger is complete, the spokeswoman 
said. She added that Green is willing to discuss possible incentives to remain 
in Los Angeles when the merger is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership is arranging financing to complete the $1.2-billion deal, 
which may be completed by early April. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one City Hall official said Riordan should have done more "arm 
twisting" of Green, whom he knows personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor blinked too early in this instance, and he bought what they were 
telling him," said the official, who asked not to be named. "He threw up his 
hands early, particularly for a person who used to be a professional card 
player when it came to corporate takeovers." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of Thrifty moving has been rumored for weeks. Concerned about 
the ripple effect of such a move, the Non-Food Merchandisers Assn. of the West 
recently asked Riordan to do "everything possible" to keep business in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the group's members are manufacturers' representatives, local firms that 
sell products to purchasing office managers at Thrifty's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "City officials aren't doing enough to keep businesses here," Ray Farris, 
president of the group, said in a recent interview.

THE BIZ / JOHN LIPPMAN AND JAMES BATES: DOLGEN CONSIDERED SHARP IN MORE WAYS 
THAN ONE 
</P>

 At Paramount, the afternoon growl has replaced the morning snarl. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Paramount Communications Inc. President Stanley Jaffe reportedly used 
to practice snarling in the mirror every morning as part of his routine to 
intimidate employees. New Paramount czar Jonathan Dolgen is known for growling 
during afternoon budget meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Those growls are said to strike terror in the hearts of his employees. But, in 
tapping Dolgen to head Viacom Entertainment Group -- which includes Paramount 
Pictures and other entertainment holdings -- Viacom Inc. has landed one of 
Hollywood's most astute cost cutters and deal makers, and a man who inspires 
intense loyalty in those employees who survive his regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen's first task will be melding Paramount's and Viacom's diverse cultures. 
But he must also keep the film and TV factories churning at a time when the 
parent company is laboring to pay off the sizable debt assumed in the 
$10-billion acquisition of Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen's solid business skills are what attracted the attention of Viacom 
Chairman Sumner Redstone and Chief Executive Frank Biondi, who have told Wall 
Street they expect to cut $200 million from corporate overhead in the wake of 
the merger. That's a task for which Dolgen is well prepared. As president of 
Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group, he brought film budgets into 
line, reduced overhead and even slashed peripheral expenses such as executive 
fruit basket deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Dolgen said the Viacom offer was too good to turn down. "If 
you've done what I've done for a living, it's a dream job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new capacity, he will oversee one of the largest production operations 
in Hollywood. The studio's businesses include movies, TV programming, TV 
stations and a proposed fifth broadcast network with Chris-Craft Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting to Dolgen will be Sherry Lansing and Kerry McCluggage, chairs of 
Paramount's motion picture and TV groups, respectively. In addition, Viacom's 
TV production and distribution divisions will be incorporated under McCluggage, 
who will stay on managing the combined $1.3-billion operation. Lansing, who 
said she was "thrilled" over Dolgen's appointment, is also expected to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Biondi called Dolgen his first choice for the job, adding: "He's one of the 
three or four smartest people working out there. He's got no learning curve. 
He's basically redone two studios in the way they have run." 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Braun, president of Viacom Entertainment and a protege of Biondi, is 
expected to be offered a new post, perhaps head of the proposed fifth network. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen would not discuss his immediate plans at Viacom other than to "try to 
figure out how the company is organized and then start marching through." He 
also downplayed a suggestion that he would bring in his own team, saying, 
"That's not my M.O." 
</P>
<P>
 One area in which Dolgen is expected to become aggressively involved is in 
raising money to back film projects and scouting partners for alliances -- 
activities that occupied much of his time at Sony and Fox and, before that, at 
Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen, a fast-talking executive whose style is sometimes likened to the 
wise-cracking delivery of comic Dennis Leary, has a short fuse that over the 
years has unnerved many subordinates -- even driven one into therapy. Dolgen's 
office half-jokingly was called "The House of Pain and Suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen is also known for a razor-sharp wit. He jokes that the damage to his 
house from the January earthquake was "within my price range." And he has a 
compassionate side: He once had an employee's injured son flown 4,000 miles at 
company expense to see a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, many of those who survived the Dolgen regime have gone on to 
high-level jobs in Hollywood. They include Fox Inc. Chief Operating Officer 
Chase Carey and Robert Kreek, president of cable TV network Comedy Central. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his reputation for toughness, several producers who have worked with 
Dolgen said they like him. They also predicted that he and Lansing will be able 
to work together, with Dolgen in effect playing the "bad cop" role Jaffe played 
to Lansing's "good cop." 
</P>
<P>
 Producers who have worked with Dolgen and Paramount said Redstone and Biondi 
no doubt wanted someone to keep spending under control. Cost is especially 
important, given the debt pressures Viacom will be under, and also because 
Viacom needs to assure Wall Street that it is watching every penny. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are East Coast guys suspicious of being snookered by the West Coast 
guys," said one producer who has worked with Dolgen. "They feel comfortable 
with a guy who knows this world well and who is extremely comfortable with the 
word no ." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another: "Sumner wants someone who is tough. There's a feeling that 
budgets have gotten out of control on some pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 One example is "Addams Family Values," a disappointing release last holiday 
season whose budget spiraled. Although it is a sequel to a box office hit, the 
film was a financial flop. Paramount specifically cited "Addams Family Values" 
as one major reason for the $36.6-million quarterly loss it announced earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when Redstone and Viacom and a team of other Viacom executives met 
with Paramount executives last week, they all but ignored the scripted 
presentations of projects in development and the talent roster. Instead, the 
Viacom team asked pointed questions about profit margins and costs. "It was all 
cash flow and projections," moaned one participant. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen, however, said he has not been hired to run a shrinking studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, Paramount is going to continue to be aggressive in their respective 
businesses," he said. "That's a given. There was no reason to do this 
transaction otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen's name was on the short list of candidates for the job. One executive 
approached for the post was Castle Rock Entertainment founding partner Alan 
Horn, a veteran studio executive who formerly headed Embassy Pictures and 
briefly, in the 1980s, was president of 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn is known to have been interested, but he was precluded from moving to 
Paramount because he is bound to Turner Broadcasting System in a contract 
stemming from the sale to Turner of film and television producer Castle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen was one of several top executives that Sony implied last year had been 
given contract extensions, but sources said it appears Dolgen and Sony never 
completed those negotiations and Dolgen's contract had at least one year 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen only recently was made part of a two-man team with Mark Canton to 
oversee Sony's Columbia and TriStar studios. Sources said Sony is expected 
eventually to name a replacement for Dolgen, but speculation is that the 
successor may not have equal footing with Canton. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen, acknowledging that he has a reputation for sometimes being a difficult 
taskmaster, hinted that even he may be mellowing somewhat. "We're all gentler 
and kinder versions of ourselves," he said. "I just want to be the best version 
of myself."

ON-LINE OVERLOAD; NETCOM STRUGGLES TO KEEP PACE WITH ITS RAPID GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Rieger wants to be a high-tech version of his hero, Henry Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Ford's goal was to put every American behind the wheel of a Model T, 
Rieger dreams of steering everyone to the Internet, that electronic information 
pastiche through which users can browse card catalogues of libraries worldwide, 
keep up with news as it's happening and chat on-line with kindred spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Rieger's biggest problem might be that he's succeeding too well. Lured by a 
flat monthly rate for dialing up the Internet through his service, so many new 
customers have subscribed to his Netcom On-Line Communication Services Inc. 
that the system at times has practically ground to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 Netcom's expansion -- and occasional stumbles -- illustrate the frenzied rush 
onto the Internet as users take to heart the notion of an "information 
superhighway" and seek the quickest on-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Other types of electronic information networks are having similar problems. In 
January, America Online, a booming on-line service that enables personal 
computer users to read news, shop for merchandise and exchange messages, had to 
shut down temporarily and revamp software to handle a subscriber overload. 
</P>
<P>
 Netcom is far from the only provider of Internet access, but it is surely one 
of the fastest growing, with a noticeable proportion of messages posted in 
Internet forums coming from Netcom users. Only 5 years old, Netcom is now the 
nation's fifth-largest Internet service provider, no mean achievement given its 
popularity with individuals as opposed to big corporations that access the 
Internet directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Having long ago outgrown the den of Rieger's house, Netcom is setting up shop 
in a San Jose office building where engineers hustling day and night cannot 
install modems fast enough to keep up with all the new subscribers hankering to 
dial up the Internet. Each day, the electronic-mail equivalent of 4 million 
pages of text passes through Netcom's equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Netcom was the first commercial company to provide individuals with access to 
the Internet, born about 20 years ago as a Defense Department network and long 
the province of the military-industrial complex, computer geeks and academics. 
Users gain access by dialing a local number at Netcom that patches them into 
the network. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the company expects to see sales explode by about 700%, from $2.8 
million in 1993. Its subscriber base is projected to shoot up from the current 
20,000 users (a user might be an individual or a company with dozens or 
hundreds of employees signing on). 
</P>
<P>
 A nationwide expansion is well underway, a new management team is in place, 
and an initial offering of stock to the public is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the problem? Rivals are popping up like crazy. (Most of them are 
small, regional operations, but on-line services such as America Online, 
Prodigy and CompuServe plan soon to provide a full array of services on the 
Internet, beyond electronic mail.) And disgruntled customers complain of 
sluggish response time during peak hours and difficulty in getting through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Netcom has been going through some growing pains," said Arthur R. McGee, a 
computer consultant in El Segundo who spends hours logged on each day. "But no 
one's about to abandon ship." 
</P>
<P>
 With its flat-rate pricing of $17.50 or $19.50 a month (plus a $20 set-up 
fee), McGee said, Netcom is "pioneering the way that will make the information 
superhighway more affordable." 
</P>
<P>
 As an aerospace company employee and night-school student in the 1980s, 
founder Rieger had a more modest goal: to help other students gain access 
through his personal computer to their university's computer facilities. When 
enough students signed up, Rieger began to charge a modest monthly fee so that 
he could buy more equipment. In exchange, his customers clamored for more 
services, so Rieger added electronic mail, software packages and some games. 
</P>
<P>
 After 18 months, Netcom outgrew Rieger's house. Besides, he added, "the noise, 
heat and racket drove my wife crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Relocating the phone lines and beefing up his computing resources required 
major funds and time. Rieger quit his job in artificial intelligence with 
Lockheed Missiles & Space and cashed in his retirement package, refinanced his 
house, sold a vehicle and borrowed from relatives to come up with the necessary 
$300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, Netcom has installed modems to connect customers to the Internet in 
nearly 30 cities, with many more planned. Figuring a way to track usage so that 
the company can plan for the right equipment and the proper number of phone 
lines is proving daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "People and systems are never in equilibrium," acknowledged Netcom's new 
president, John Anthony Whalen Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman and Chief Executive Rieger, 45, claims that the company has never 
lost money. But some industry watchers see some risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not all that difficult for a company to grow so fast and so well that . 
. . they outpace themselves," said Joel Maloff, a former telecommunications 
executive in Ann Arbor, Mich., who consults with businesses about how to use 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some hiccups, and they may have overextended," he added. "If 
not, fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also, "there's a risk that this Internet fever is going to be a fad," noted 
Victor Wheatman, a Santa Clara-based analyst for the Gartner Group, a 
technology research firm in Stamford, Conn. For companies and individuals with 
secrets to hide, he added, the information superhighway is a hostile 
environment, filled with computer hackers striving to uncover sensitive 
information. Wheatman also suspects that much of the Internet growth could 
vaporize. "I'd like to see a study of inactive (subscribers)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 5% of Netcom's users hogging 30% of the Internet action, Rieger 
fears that some sort of fee based on usage might be necessary, mainly to 
encourage use in off-peak hours. But his goal is to keep access as open as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want Aunt Molly not to be able to afford the Internet," he says. The 
Boom in Internet Access 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a rough survey, consultant Joel Maloff of Ann Arbor, Mich., projects 
that connecting organizations and individuals to the Internet by phone will be 
a $230-million business in 1994 in the United States, up from about $50 million 
last year. Here are companies that provide the links and their projected 1994

SMALLER ISSUES HIT NEW HIGH; DOW UP 16.99 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Small stocks soared to record highs and led the broad market 
upward in a solid rally. 
</P>
<P>
 * A renewed bout of bearishness ahead of the Federal Reserve Board's 
policy-making meeting next week sent long-term Treasury bond yields higher. 
Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks again paced the market's gains, led by a charge in technology 
and telecommunications shares. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller 
stocks jumped 4.86 points to a record 803.85, topping the previous peak of 
800.47 set Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue chips, meanwhile, meandered for much of the session before rising late in 
the day. The Dow industrial average gained 16.99 points to 3,865.14, still well 
below its record of 3,978.36. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners topped losers by a strong 1,721 to 1,381 on Nasdaq and by a less 
impressive 1,149 to 1,015 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said investors are concentrating on small-company stocks in part 
because of expectations of stronger earnings growth at those companies as the 
economy expands. 
</P>
<P>
 Small stocks are "becoming more and more the first call, the first source of 
investment ideas," said A.C. Moore, market analyst at SBCM/Argus in Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Dow led the market up in January, investors have been less willing 
to bet on those stocks since the Fed raised interest rates Feb. 4, its first 
credit tightening in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors are also wary of blue chips because of today's quarterly 
expiration of key stock index futures and options, which can result in wide 
swings in blue chip prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology issues leading the Nasdaq market higher included Lotus 
Development, up 5 3/4 to 85 1/2 after AT&T unveiled a long-awaited deal to 
supply Lotus Notes software applications to businesses over AT&T's public 
network. AT&T rose 3/4 to 53 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tech gainers included Adobe Systems, up 1 3/8 to 30 7/8; Filenet, up 1 
1/4 to 28 1/2; Oracle, up 1 1/4 to 34 3/4, and Software Toolworks, up 1 5/8 to 
11 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cable TV stocks revived. Cablevision Systems gained 1 3/8 to 58 5/8, Comcast 
A leaped 1 3/8 to 21 1/8 and Tele-Communications shot up 1 1/4 to 24 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy stocks continued to rise despite another slide in oil prices. Chevron 
jumped 1 3/4 to 91 1/2, Arco surged 2 3/4 to 101 7/8 and Louisiana Land zoomed 
2 1/2 to 41 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some industrials were strong. Caterpillar leaped 3 1/4 to 119 1/2, a new 
high. Monsanto rose 2 5/8 to 79 7/8, Alcoa gained 1 3/4 to 75 1/2 and DuPont 
surged 1 5/8 to 58 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Hong Kong shares continued to be hit by interest rate worries. The 
Hang Seng index dove 207.48 points to 9,513.13, and at midday today the index 
was off 261.59 points to 9,251.54. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo on Thursday, the Nikkei index eased 85.61 points to 20,592.16, while 
Frankfurt's DAX index eased 2.33 points to 2,175.06 and London's FTSE-100 index 
lost 12.8 points to 3,255.7. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index rose 14.44 points to 2,396.67. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields rose despite some reassuring inflation news in a Federal 
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia regional economic report. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's March business survey showed that prices and economic activity 
moderated. The bank's monthly assessments of business conditions in parts of 
the mid-Atlantic area are considered indicators of nationwide economic trends. 
</P>
<P>
 While bond yields fell initially on the news, sellers struck again as trading 
progressed. By the close, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond was at 
6.82%, up from 6.79% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said investors are mostly focused on the upcoming Tuesday meeting of 
the Federal Reserve Board's policy-making committee. The Fed could decide to 
raise short-term interest rates again at the meeting if it judges that economic 
growth is too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold prices dropped on the Comex. Near-term futures closed at $382.40 an 
ounce, off $2.50. Silver eased 2.3 cents to $5.35. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil futures sank on a wave of profit taking that set in above the 
$15-a-barrel level. On the New York Merc, April crude oil dropped 24 cents to 
$14.82 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the currency markets, the dollar finished slightly higher against most 
currencies, rebounding from a drop induced by the German central bank's refusal 
to reduce interest rates Thursday, as some analyst had expected.

 Kemper Rejects General Electric Bid: Kemper Corp.'s board voted unanimously to 
reject a $2.2-billion hostile takeover offer from General Electric Co. In a 
letter to General Electric Chairman John F. Welch, Kemper Chairman David B. 
Mathis called the GE bid a "low-ball proposal" and said that "Kemper's 
stockholders are best served by providing current management with the 
opportunity to realize Kemper's tremendous upside potential." But the mutual 
fund company's shareholders have been far more enthusiastic about a possible 
sale of the firm.

NORTHRIDGE QUAKE BILL RISES FOR 20TH CENTURY; INSURANCE: ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS 
COSTS IS DOUBLED TO $325 MILLION. BUT THE COMPANY REMAINS SOUND, A SPOKESMAN 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 20th Century Industries Inc., parent of 20th Century Insurance Co., on 
Thursday doubled its estimate of claims costs from the Northridge earthquake to 
$325 million, saying the damage was more severe and widespread than earlier 
believed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills-based insurer has its greatest market share in the San 
Fernando Valley, where the destruction was heaviest, and thus may have been 
proportionately harder hit by the Jan. 17 quake than any other carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was among our worst-case disaster scenarios," spokesman Rick Dinon said. 
</P>
<P>
 After taxes and reinsurance payments, quake-related claims are expected to 
result in a charge of about $161.7 million, or $3.15 per share, against 
first-quarter earnings, the company said in a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century will also incur a $13-million premium to reinstate its 
reinsurance, resulting in an additional after-tax charge against earnings of 
$8.5 million, or 16 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the net charges of nearly $170 million will wipe out 26% of the 
company's surplus, or cushion against claims, which stood at $655.2 million at 
the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the charges, 20th Century's ratio of premiums to surplus will be about 
2.5 to 1, a ratio the company called prudent. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century on Feb. 9 projected gross earthquake claims of $160 million. The 
number doubled after claims adjusters visited more homes and discovered that 
the average amount of damage was greater than first realized and that about 25% 
more claims were being filed than expected, Dinon said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, 20th Century had received 29,015 homeowner claims and 8,534 
auto claims arising from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinon said 20th Century remains financially secure, well able to pay claims 
and even able to grow. However, he acknowledged that the company is not 
advertising for customers and that there is a debate internally over whether it 
ought to add new business in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading in 20th Century's stock on the New York Stock Exchange was halted for 
the announcement at 2:35 p.m. EST on Thursday and did not resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares fell 25 cents to $25.125 for the day.

 Rival Group Sweetens America West Offer: An investment group whose takeover 
bid was spurned by America West Airlines offered $220 million in cash and loans 
for the bankrupt carrier. The new offer from New York-based AWA Partners, led 
by Michael Steinhardt, raises the stakes in its bidding war with a group led by 
Continental Airlines Chairman David Bonderman.AWA is offering $155 million in 
cash and $65 million in loans for 33.5% of America West's stock when it emerges 
from Bankruptcy Court protection. America West has accepted an offer from 
Bonderman's AmWest Partners that includes $120 million cash and $100 million in 
loans. The AmWest offer also involves an alliance with Houston-based 
Continental and regional carrier Mesa Airlines that the group has valued at $40 
million to $70 million a year.

 Whistle-Blower Wins $223,000 Judgment: Brian Hyatt, the Northrop engineer who 
raised the first fraud allegations against Northrop in 1986, won the judgment 
in federal court for wrongful termination.In October, 1986, Hyatt filed a 
federal whistle-blower suit that claimed Northrop had cheated the Air Force on 
the guidance system for the MX missile and that he was wrongfully fired by the 
company. Hyatt's charges languished in the courts for years, and eventually his 
charges that Northrop defrauded the government were dismissed. The 
wrongful-termination claims came to trial in January. Northrop said it might 
appeal.

 AT&T, Lotus in Networking Deal: American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and Lotus 
Development Corp. launched a new networking product through which businesses 
can sell electronic services, such as on-line newsletters and electronic 
mail.The service, called ATT Network Notes, incorporates Lotus' Notes software 
on AT&T's long-distance telephone network. Analysts say the new service lets 
AT&T's traditional network deliver the new age of multimedia information and 
will steer more traffic to AT&T while boosting Lotus' revenue. Lotus and AT&T 
also plan to target businesses that want to create companywide networks to 
connect employees at various offices and their homes. Lotus shot up $5.75 to 
$85.50 on Nasdaq and AT&T rose 75 cents to $53.50 on the NYSE.

lost $46 million in February and expects to lose more money in the first 
quarter than many on Wall Street had expected.AMR Corp. said its quarterly loss 
will be more than 24 cents a share, which would come to more than $18 million 
based on 76 million outstanding common shares. American, like other airlines, 
was hampered by a severe winter that closed airports and canceled flights. AMR

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: SMALL STOCKS STILL THE BIG STORY ON THE STREET THESE 
DAYS 
</P>

<P>
 If investors are troubled by rising interest rates, inflation jitters and the 
Clintons' messy Whitewater affair, it isn't showing up in prices of 
small-company stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Key indexes of smaller stocks have been quietly creeping to new highs this 
week, even as the blue chip Dow industrial average, at 3,865.14 on Thursday, 
remains off 2.8% from its peak. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller 
issues, for example, rose 4.86 points to a record 803.85 on Thursday, topping 
its previous peak of 800.47 set Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Russell 2,000 index, a purer measure of small stocks, hit its second 
consecutive record high Thursday, rising 0.68 point to 269.79. The Russell now 
is up 4.3% year-to-date, versus a 1% rise in the big-stock Standard & Poor's 
500 index. 
</P>
<P>
 Small stocks' leadership actually is becoming an old story to investors who 
pay attention to this market sector: The Nasdaq and Russell indexes outpaced 
the gains in most blue chip stock indexes in 1991, '92 and '93. So despite 
periodic interruptions to their bull market, small stocks remain the market's 
hottest longer-term story. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But why have small-company stocks been able to shake off the recent rise in 
interest rates so quickly, especially compared to bigger stocks? A few reasons, 
Wall Streeters say: 
</P>
<P>
 * Smaller companies' earnings gains have been more robust as the economy has 
picked up steam. Claudia Mott, small-stock analyst at Prudential Securities in 
New York, says 1993 earnings of the Russell 2,000 companies were up 18% on 
average, versus a 12.7% rise for companies in the Russell 1,000 index of bigger 
stocks. The data covers companies reporting through the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the variables that affect stock prices, only one is important in the 
long run, and that's earnings growth. Interest rates matter far less.  
</P>
<P>
 * Many small health care stocks, depressed last year by worries about health 
care reform, have bounced back as the Whitewater affair has raised the odds 
that serious reform will be delayed. A lower level of Angst about the stocks 
also has allowed investors to recognize that many health care firms will win 
even with eventual reform, says Ron Elijah, manager of the Robertson Stephens 
Value Plus Fund in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care stocks, including such smaller names as nursing home operator 
GranCare and HMOs PacifiCare and Coventry, comprise about one-third of his 
fund, which is up 14% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aggressive investors who were throwing dollars at international stock mutual 
funds in the second half of 1993 may be looking for alternatives closer to 
home, in the wake of many foreign markets' sharp declines this year. Gary 
Pilgrim, whose Wayne, Pa.-based PBHG Growth small-stock fund is up about 7.5% 
this year, says his appearance on CNBC-TV earlier this week resulted in 8,000 
investor calls for information. 
</P>
<P>
 Elijah, who was taking in $50,000 to $100,000 in fresh cash daily at the end 
of last year, has seen that balloon to $1 million to $1.5 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
 But the surging demand for smaller issues also is giving some pros pause. 
Keith Mullins, analyst at Smith Barney Shearson in New York, notes that, by 
far, the hottest sector of the small-stock market this year has been 
technology. Buoyed by continuing strong sales of computers and software, many 
tech firms' 1993 earnings were terrific, setting off a frenzy for the stocks, 
Mullins says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet tech stocks often follow a seasonal pattern, Mullins notes. And the 
seasonal peak for the stocks often comes in the spring -- which means the 
current rally's remaining days may be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins also warns that broad small-stock indexes have gone 21 months without 
a 15% "correction," or short-term pullback. The record period without a 15% 
pullback was a 24-month advance that ended in November, 1980, he says. So this 
rally is getting long in the tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Mullins remains a long-term bull on small stocks, with or without a 
near-term correction. History shows, he says, that cycles of small-company 
leadership in earnings growth and stock performance tend to last longer than 
three years. And investors in the stocks tend to make the most money late in 
the cycle, he says, when speculation heats up and small-stock prices rocket to 
extraordinary levels relative to earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 One oft-used proxy for small-stock valuation is T. Rowe Price's New Horizons 
stock fund. Today, the average price-to-earnings ratio of stocks in the fund, 
based on estimated 1994 earnings, is about 1.4 times the P-E of the blue chip 
S&P 500. At small-stock peaks, Mullins says, the New Horizons P-E tends to be 
about 2.0 times the S&P P-E. That suggests there's room to run. Small Is 
Profitable 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing the trend of the last three years, small-company stock indexes have 
led the market higher this year, despite the sharp upturn in interest rates.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: LAW WOULD MAKE CRIB SELLERS LIABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation proposed in California would make it unlawful to sell unsafe cribs 
and would make sellers liable for injuries resulting from their use. Though 
aimed primarily at thrift shops, which account for more than 25% of used crib 
sales, the bill would also affect people selling cribs at garage sales. 
</P>
<P>
 State Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-San Mateo) has introduced the bill at the 
behest of the Danny Foundation, an advocacy group formed by the parents of a 
child who suffered brain damage when his clothing caught on a crib post and 
choked him. The child, Danny Lineweaver of Alamo, Calif., died at age 11 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Walsh, director of the foundation, said his organization decided to seek 
legislation after unsuccessfully lobbying the U.S. Consumer Products Safety 
Commission to recall unsafe cribs. He said 13,000 infants are injured in cribs 
each year and that about 50 die of their injuries. His group estimates that 
three out of four infants sleep in secondhand cribs, some of which may be 
unsafe. The bill defines an unsafe crib as one that does not meet industry 
design standards. Corner crib posts should be no higher than a sixteenth of an 
inch. The mattress support should lock in place. Walsh said cribs manufactured 
after 1990 generally meet those standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters acknowledge that the legislation is tough on people who sell used 
cribs at garage sales and are unaware of possible hazards. The provision 
applying to them may not survive legislative compromise. "We'd like to see it 
in there but . . . this isn't the final form of the bill," Walsh said, noting 
that it must go through legislative committee hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said people can test a mattress support by kicking upward on it. (It 
shouldn't lift easily.) Most cribs meet a 1973 standard that set the distance 
between crib slats, he said. The distance is too wide if a can of soda fits 
between the slats.

 Return to sender: "Get hysterical," says the prepaid subscription insert card 
inside the March issue of Spy magazine, a publication devoted to tweaking the 
rich and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt people who mail in their card with a check enclosed for $16.95 will 
go hysterical. Spy is ceasing publication this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Rizack, president of Spy Corp. in New York, was answering the telephone 
in near-empty magazine offices this week when we called to find out why the 
final issue contains not one but two subscription solicitations. He said the 
decision to pull the plug on Spy was made after the magazine was put together. 
"That's why it doesn't say last issue," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizack said payments for new subscriptions will be returned. Current 
subscribers will receive either a refund or a new magazine if Spy manages to 
sell its subscription list to an existing publication, Rizack said.

 Consumer committee: Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt 
has named a consumer affairs advisory committee to give the SEC a stronger 
consumer focus. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is forming the 15-member committee because low interest rates have 
caused many less sophisticated investors to abandon certificates of deposit and 
other federally insured investments in favor of higher-yielding but riskier 
stocks and mutual funds. "We need, if you will, to protect people against 
themselves," Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said committee members, drawn from business, government, the securities 
industry and consumer organizations, will provide input on changes in SEC 
policy and rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Members include Price Club founder Sol Price and Bonnie Guiton Hill, formerly 
California's top consumer regulator and now dean of the University of 
Virginia's McIntire School of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Throwing the booklet at 'em: As part of its consumer initiative, the SEC wants 
securities brokers to give their clients a new 12-page booklet advising them to 
"talk with potential salespeople at several firms" before choosing a broker and 
to find out "how the sales representative is paid." Brokers may earn salary or 
commissions based on sales. Commissions may be higher on a firm's own 
investment products. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet also provides the phone numbers of 12 securities regulators to 
call with complaints, as well as a toll-free number ((800) 289-999) consumers 
can use to check on a broker's disciplinary history. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the kind of advice brokers typically dispense. Nonetheless, the 
SEC's Levitt thinks his agency can "persuade them to give the brochure to 
consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She's seen the enemy: Esther Peterson, a U.S. representative to the United 
Nations, urged a gathering of consumer organizations in Washington last week to 
"take on the enemy," commercial television advertising. She said commercials 
with sexual overtones disturb her most, and cited as an example the ads for 
Calvin Klein fragrances.

 * Television: In its first major diversification from film distribution, Savoy 
Pictures Entertainment is linking up with Fox Television Stations in a 
$100-million venture to buy stations that would be Fox affiliates.SF 
Broadcasting will be 58%-owned by Fox, 41%-owned by Savoy and 1%-owned by Savoy 
senior executives Victor Kaufman and Lewis J. Korman. Korman said the group's 
lawyers believe that Fox's passive role means any acquisitions by the venture 
will not count against limits on stations Fox can own under Federal 
Communications Commission rules. Thomas Herwitz, who ran the Fox-owned station 
in Washington, was named the venture's president. Separately, Savoy confirmed a 
non-exclusive film distribution deal overseas with Rank Organization. JAMES

OSCAR PARTIES: PLUMS FOR RESTAURANTS; * PUBLICITY: COMPETITION IS FIERCE FOR 
THE SOIREES, WHICH CAN DRIVE BUSINESS FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS. JUST ASK SPAGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "It ought to be one hell of a do," Irving (Swifty) Lazar once said of his 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar clearly understood the value of a good "do," judging by the attention 
lavished on the annual Academy Awards soiree he used to host at West 
Hollywood's Spago. But the late literary agent wasn't the only one who 
benefited from those parties, as the race to fill his void reveals. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurateurs say the star-studded events generate enough positive publicity 
to drive business for months or even years. The competition for parties tied to 
Monday's Academy Awards celebration was so intense this year that many 
restaurants offered to host them for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Spago) gained international stardom because of the party," says 
Wolfgang Puck, the restaurant's chef and owner. But he denies widespread 
reports that he footed the bill for Lazar. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who angled this year to join the exclusive Oscar night ranks is 
Victor Drai, owner of the trendy West Hollywood restaurant Drai's. 
</P>
<P>
 After plans to throw a party with CNN talk show host Larry King fell through, 
Drai says, he offered to host a party for Steven Spielberg, who is expected to 
walk off with an armful of statuettes for "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Drai, a sometime film producer: "If I do a party and it's the party of 
the year, it would cost me what, $10,000? It's worth hundreds of thousands of 
dollars. You have TV cameras. . . . It's broadcast all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Others agree that the return on investment is considerable, even if the cost 
reaches $30,000, which it reportedly did for Lazar's parties at Spago. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Leonard Schwartz, whose Maple Drive restaurant will serve dinner to about 
230 paying guests for its fifth annual Oscar night party -- this year an AIDS 
benefit hosted by Elton John -- says the event is already generating publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been interviewed (before) by German TV," says Schwartz, who was 
visited recently by a production crew from Berlin filming a segment on the 
Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz and others say it's impossible to put a price tag on the Oscar night 
return. Most restaurateurs agree, however, that the visibility it provides 
translates into increased business from both out-of-town visitors and locals 
and gives the establishment lasting leverage with important Hollywood types. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a subliminal message that this must be a good place if a party such 
as this happens here," Schwartz says. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Nicky Blair and Warner Bros. co-hosted a lavish affair for Clint 
Eastwood, who swept the Oscars with "Unforgiven," at the Sunset Boulevard 
eatery that bears Blair's name. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, "we had a thousand reservations for the following two weeks," 
according to Blair, who says the party cost Warner Bros. between $75,000 and 
$80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In Blair's case, the direct effect on business was somewhat short-lived, which 
he attributes mostly to a poor economy that hurt restaurants throughout the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair re-entered the Oscar derby this year, adding his name to the list of 
those more than willing to host a Spielberg party. (The director rejected all 
of the offers in favor of party hopping.) "I was desperate to get the 
'Schindler's List' party. . . . I thought it was a great asset for the future," 
Blair says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had had the Oscar party every year for the last three years, I would be 
packed every night now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many competitors feel that the best example of that theory is Spago, which 
held Lazar's party for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Spago is what it is because of that party every year," Drai says. 
</P>
<P>
 Puck says the party was only "the icing on the cake" for Spago and that it 
owes its success to more than a single event. But he concedes that he is still 
seeing the payoff from last year's Oscar party. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you read Vanity Fair this month, they still talk about his (Lazar's) last 
party here," Puck says, referring to the magazine's profile of Lazar in its 
April issue. "People read it and they say, 'Oh, God, this must be an 
interesting place.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Like any investment, however, an Oscar night party has its risks. Restaurant 
owners must be able to draw an all-star crowd or expect a lukewarm reaction 
from the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I do it, I have to have at least 80% of the stars," Drai says, adding that 
he is trying to organize a party for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 That usually requires a high-profile host. For Spago, the well-connected Lazar 
drew everyone from Walter Cronkite to Placido Domingo to Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an international jet set!" the Austrian-born Puck says. 
</P>
<P>
 A celebrity host can also relieve the owners of the responsibility of deciding 
who gets invited and who doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Puck and his wife, Barbara Lazaroff, hosted their own exclusive Academy Awards 
parties in the early 1980s, and they were a customer relations disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I alienated so many people doing it myself," Puck says. "Irving was a dream 
come true. He was the perfect solution because he could say no to anybody."

SHHHH: AND THE OSCAR PRESENTERS ARE . . .; MOVIES: NEXT TO THE NAMES OF 
WINNERS, THE BEST-KEPT ACADEMY AWARDS NIGHT SECRET HAS BEEN THE SHOW'S LINEUP 
-- UNTIL NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 What are the best-kept secrets in Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 The first, and obvious answer, is the names of the Oscar winners. 
</P>
<P>
 A second, but not so well-known answer, is the lineup of the presenters and 
performers for the Academy Awards show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keeping it a secret is part of what people go to see shows for," said Gil 
Cates, who as producer decides on the talent and lineup. Like his predecessors, 
Cates has kept the lineup a secret until the day of each of the four previous 
Oscar shows he has produced. 
</P>
<P>
 "One year I arranged to have an Oscar sent up with the Space Shuttle crew and 
televised from space during the show. A few days before the show (Daily Variety 
columnist) Army Archerd got wind of it and called me about it. I told him it 
wasn't true. Then, after the show, Army said to me, 'You lied.' I said, 'Yes, I 
wanted to keep it a surprise.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And so it has gone, show after show. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, a source has managed to sneak a copy of the lineup to The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to the hush-hush schedule -- which no doubt could undergo 
last-minute changes -- the first Oscar presented at Monday's 66th annual 
Academy Awards show will be given by Tom Hanks for the art direction category. 
The program will end some three hours later with Harrison Ford announcing the 
best picture. 
</P>
<P>
 In one unusual twist, the Oscar for director will be announced immediately 
before best picture, with Clint Eastwood, the winner of 1992's best director 
prize for "Unforgiven," doing the honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically in the history of the televised show, the Oscar for direction is 
fourth from last, preceding best actor and actress. The reason for the change 
this year is unclear, but the speculation is that the change was made because 
of the strong likelihood that "Schindler's List" will win Steven Spielberg the 
director's prize as well as the producer's prize for best picture. Such a 
back-to-back win would add to the night's drama. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the thinking that Spielberg, perhaps the world's most famous 
filmmaker, thanks to the top-grossing movies of all time -- "Jurassic Park" and 
"E.T." -- is, perhaps, a bigger attraction to the 1 billion or so in the 
international TV audience than any of the nominated actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere to be seen on the list are the names of presenters who last year made 
controversial political statements: Richard Gere, Tim Robbins and Susan 
Sarandon. Cates said because he believes such comments are inappropriate for 
the evening, they would not be invited back and it appears he kept his word. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to comment on the lineup, Cates declined, only saying that there have 
been occasions where he has made changes while the show was on the air. 
"There's just no way of knowing. . . . I don't know who's going to come down 
with a cold. . . . There was one year when Charlton Heston was to make a 
presentation, but his car had a flat tire, so Clint Eastwood stepped in. But 
just as Eastwood took the stage, Heston arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, rundowns change. Whatever you print is going to be wrong. That's one 
reason why we don't give out lineups. I don't think it's anybody's business. If 
(viewers are) curious they should sit down and watch the show." 
</P>
<P>
 If you are inclined to take Cates' advice, the show will be telecast live on 
Monday at 6 p.m. on ABC from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles 
Music Center. Lining Them Up for Oscar's Big Night

THIS 'BAD-BOY' ARTIST HAS LOTS OF THOUGHTS ON LOVE; ART: SEAN LANDERS' 'THOUGHT 
BUBBLE' AT REGAN PROJECTS MAY LOOK RACY TO CRITICS BUT 'PEOPLE CONFUSE TOTAL 
HONESTY WITH BEING BAD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as everyone in New York art society was waking up from the 1980s with 
what felt like a bad hangover, Sean Landers came onto the scene. His 1990 show 
at the Postmasters Gallery included a group of clay sculptures covered in 
plastic trash bags to disguise their apparent mediocrity. Sheets of yellow 
ledger paper taped to the gallery walls were filled with the diaristic writings 
of an artist whose life consisted of explicit but demeaning sexual exploits, 
grinding poverty and humiliating encounters with big-name galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the opposite of the anonymous or authoritarian voice typical of most 
of the text-based art of the '80s. The show received positive reviews, 
especially in the New Yorker, where the quality of the artist's writing was 
duly noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The writing was bracing and witty. It was obviously and heart-rendingly based 
on true-life experience, yet it was signed with the pseudonym of Chris Hamson. 
The actual author, Sean Landers, says that at that time he was "too timid to 
talk about these things. Once I found it wasn't that bad, I used myself. The 
character you see in the writings now, I like to think it's 100% me." 
</P>
<P>
 In his current show at Regan Projects Landers shows a 14-by-17 1/2-foot canvas 
that rolls off the wall and onto the floor. Titled "Thought Bubble," it 
obsessively chronicles Landers' thoughts on the relative usefulness of art, sex 
with Donna Reed, international relations, narcissism, low self-esteem and the 
future. By the time a typical gallery visitor finishes reading, he or she would 
be hard pressed to go on to the next canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 It is shorter but written in script. "They are meant to be read all the way 
through. It's about art and life but my most frequent topic is love," says 
Landers. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't he mean sex? "The sex is graphically described, so the fact that it's 
about love gets hidden," he counters. 
</P>
<P>
 Landers, 31, is tall and athletically built with broad features, very pale 
skin and black chin-length hair. He grew up in Palmer, a town of about 4,000 in 
western Massachusetts, and his ironic humor and deadpan delivery reveal his New 
England origins. He writes about Palmer and love in his new hand-written novel 
titled "(Sic)," published as a limited edition art book by Public Sphere. 
Already sold out, it is now being negotiated as a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 "(My parents) loved my book but wished I hadn't used so many swear words. 
Also, I named a lot of people in our hometown and my mother wishes I'd changed 
the names," the artist says. 
</P>
<P>
 Landers' family history is clearly one source for his writing. His Irish 
father is a policeman who also works for the phone company. Both his mother and 
grandmother are artists, and he learned to draw and paint from them. "I can do 
realistic drawing and painting, no problem," he says. "But the stuff I was 
making was always seen and scrutinized by them right away. So the private stuff 
came out in my writing -- which I was showing to nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 Landers received his undergraduate degree from Philadelphia College of Art; 
then he went on to graduate studies at Yale. There, he was most impressed by 
the liberal arts courses. "It felt like the college experience I hadn't had."  
</P>
<P>
 Yale had a high-profile visiting artist program, which had the paradoxical 
effect of deflating Landers' expectations. "All these art personalities I'd 
looked up to, it was myth-breaking. You'd expect a genius and get just another 
normal person," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "One teacher helped me," he continues. "An old figure-modeling teacher 
everybody wanted to kick out of the department who really knew how to sculpt a 
figure out of clay. I'd always scoffed at that notion but I was able to 
appreciate it more because of this visiting artist program." 
</P>
<P>
 Several years later, Landers began his wet-clay sculptures of casually 
observed characters like "Woman at K-Mart." His last show included a series of 
terra cotta leprechauns, undoubtedly a reference to his Irish ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drew for years and that's the best way to learn sculpture. Then I tried to 
avoid studio skills because I thought I had to be making real art," he says. 
"It's not like I think my work in clay is more art than the videotapes I make. 
It's all related. Though if I'm going through the (Metropolitan Museum of Art), 
I'll probably dwell more on the European paintings from the 1800s or the Greek 
sculpture." 
</P>
<P>
 Landers says he needs to write and make objects, that one activity feeds into 
the other. He writes about whatever comes to mind while standing with a wet 
brush in front of the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't edit, revise or, clearly, use a dictionary. His explicit 
descriptions of sexual yearning have caused critics to include him among the 
rosters of "bad-boy" artists for the '90s. "People confuse total honesty with 
being bad," Landers says. "I don't use it as a strategy to get people to look. 
This is how people think and it's not always pretty. It would be a facade to be 
politically correct in my fantasies." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sean Landers' "Thought Bubble" continues at Regan Projects, 629 N. Almont 
Drive, through April 9.

IS THE 'HOT ZONE' FILM TOO HOT FOR RIDLEY SCOTT?; MOVIES: FINANCIAL ISSUES 
CLOUD WHETHER THE DIRECTOR WILL CONTINUE ON THE FOX SUSPENSE DRAMA AS A RIVAL 
VIRUS MOVIE PROCEEDS AT WARNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fragile and difficult nature of putting together big Hollywood movies was 
underscored this week when the race to make two competing virus movies 
intensified between 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Fox-based producer Lynda Obst was struggling to save director 
Ridley Scott from falling out of her movie "Hot Zone," which is scheduled to 
begin production May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, across town, producer Arnold Kopelson was biting his nails waiting 
for a final draft on rival project "Outbreak," being written by Oscar-winning 
screenwriter Ted Tally ("Silence of the Lambs"), so he could begin shooting 
with director Wolfgang Petersen ("In the Line of Fire"). 
</P>
<P>
 While Kopelson is still looking for a star for his $40-million movie, Robert 
Redford's name has surfaced in Hollywood trade papers as the lead for "Hot 
Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 However, a key source close to Redford, said Thursday, "He is not attached to 
the project. As far as Bob is concerned, there is not a script he has committed 
to . . . it's nowhere near ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 For days, rumors have circulated in Hollywood that Obst was in danger of 
losing Scott. Complications arose with a deal for this movie and the existing 
$25-million financing and domestic distribution arrangement that Scott and his 
brother Tony have with Italy's RCS Films & TV, London's Majestic Films Intl. 
and 20th Century Fox. Last-minute negotiations to resolve financial issues were 
still underway by presstime Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi Polk, president of Scott's production company RCS/PMP Films, insisted 
that "we're proceeding forward to make this picture and feel that all the 
things can be worked out with Fox." She added, "It's a movie he's very 
enthusiastic about making with Bob Redford." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, sources suggested that Scott and Redford have had 
significant creative differences over the script. Polk denied that there was 
any conflict between Scott and Redford. 
</P>
<P>
 But a source said "Redford and Ridley are not getting along. They could not 
see eye to eye on changes in the existing script." 
</P>
<P>
 For days, there have been rumblings in Hollywood that not all was calm on the 
project, even that Scott had fallen out and that director Sydney Pollack ("The 
Firm") or John McTiernan ("Last Action Hero") were in the wings as possible 
replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 A source on the Fox lot insisted that "they're still making their deals . . . 
everybody is hanging in." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Obst found the project for the studio, Scott's production company was 
allowed to put its imprimatur on the project. However, because Scott retains 
foreign rights to films he makes, wrinkles developed that could affect a 
potential deal with Redford, sources said. Redford normally gets paid a 
multimillion-dollar fee up front against 10%-15% of the gross depending on how 
much the movie brings in at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kopelson's rival film "Outbreak" is trying to wind its way to 
production, sources said that it could be a doomed project if Obst gets hers 
off the ground first.  
</P>
<P>
 Both films center around deadly viruses, but have different story lines. "Hot 
Zone" is based on a New Yorker article about a U.S. Army biological strike 
team's race to stop a deadly virus from escaping into an American city. 
Kopelson would only say that "Outbreak" is about a "deadly virus that is out of 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopelson, whose "The Fugitive" is up for multiple Oscars including best 
picture, said that his original script, written by Laurence Dworet and Robert 
Pool, is now being polished by Tally, who is expected to deliver the draft in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the race is over," Kopelson said. "If, in fact, Ridley Scott is out 
of it and they are on the street looking for another director, they are going 
to have to do a lot of catching up. I suspect that with the Tally script, we're 
going to be out there first." 
</P>
<P>
 The race between Warner Bros. and Fox not only points up the complexities of 
putting together big-budget, star-driven movies, but is another example of how 
important it is for a studio to be the first out of the chute when there are 
competing projects.

COMMENTARY; ACTORS NEED TO CARRY SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO THE SCREEN; MOVIES: 
STARS SHOULD REALIZE THAT PORTRAYING CHARACTERS WHO DRINK AND SMOKE SENDS THE 
WRONG MESSAGE TO CHILDREN.

 It's Academy Awards time again and, as Elvis once said, I can feel my 
temperature risin'. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you recall last year that some of the Academy Awards show organizers got 
upset when Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon made impromptu political statements 
on behalf of 266 HIV-positive Haitian refugees being held by the U.S. military 
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba? Or that Richard Gere upset some people when he used 
the occasion to speak out about human rights abuses in China? No one questioned 
the validity of the causes that were invoked, but a lot of people thought the 
Oscar ceremony wasn't the place for political rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watch the ceremony Monday night, I expect to see Hollywood's best and 
brightest wearing ribbons and mentioning the homeless, rain forests, Haitians 
and other noble causes, just like they do year after year. 
</P>
<P>
 What bothers me is that these are the same people who, movie after movie, 
portray characters who smoke and consume alcohol in nearly every scene, sending 
a very dangerous message to impressionable young movie-goers (read: Target 
Audience). Hollywood's stars know these products are physically and mentally 
harmful, and highly addictive, yet they continue to promote their use. I think 
many of the folks I'll see at the Oscars are hypocrites who don't practice true 
social responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only Hollywood stars I can remember who didn't smoke or drink 
alcohol in their films had names like Bambi, Willy or Old Yeller. 
</P>
<P>
 And surely it's not an accident that when smoking and drinking are portrayed 
in movie after movie, brand names are often clearly displayed. Who's paying for 
that? 
</P>
<P>
 Let me share a few recent statistics with you. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Feb. 24 surgeon general's report, 434,000 Americans die every 
year from lung cancer attributed directly to smoking, and studies have shown 
that thousands of non-smokers die each year from second-hand smoke. Fully 
one-third of today's high school students will be addicted to tobacco by the 
time they graduate, and almost all adult smokers took their first drag before 
their high school graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 And each year, 100,000 Americans die from the effects of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 What would be socially responsible is for actors and actresses, major and 
minor, smoker and non-smoker, drinker and non-drinker, to have written into 
their contract the following clauses: 
</P>
<P>
 "(1) Unless it can be proven to be absolutely necessary for character 
development or the integrity of a particular scene, the character I portray 
will not smoke, consume alcohol, use illegal drugs or engage in unprotected 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "(2) Tobacco, alcohol and drug brand names shall not be included in any scene 
in the film, nor shall they be included in any advertisements shown in theaters 
before or after the film. Tobacco, alcohol and drug products (but not brand 
names) shall only be permitted when judged absolutely necessary to the 
integrity of a particular scene." 
</P>
<P>
 As a high school social studies teacher for 24 years, I would be the last 
person to suggest any law smacking of censorship of the arts. I would never 
support any legislation that hinted at chipping away at the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as a parent and as coordinator of the Student Assistance Program at 
South Gate High School, where I see the results of alcohol, tobacco and drug 
abuse every day in the support groups we offer our students and parents, I am 
extremely frustrated and angered by the hypocrisy and callousness of the film 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood is made up of powerful people who influence tens of millions, 
powerful people who could choose to take a stand and make a difference. 
Instead, they too often choose to suck up to the nearest dollar bill wrapped 
around a cigarette or a can of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it time for Hollywood's brightest stars to (1) recognize the seriousness 
of the problems of alcohol, tobacco and drug abuse, (2) admit their influence 
has contributed to these problems, and (3) take meaningful and appropriate 
action against them? 
</P>
<P>
 Who would like to be first? How about Susan Sarandon, who smoked and drank her 
way through "Thelma & Louise" and who last year made her statement about 266 
Haitians? Ms. Sarandon, I'll send you a "Thank You" card signed by a few 
thousand young people and a dozen red roses.

POP ALBUM CHART; SOUNDGARDEN KOS NAILS IN FIRST ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two honchos from the alternative scene are slugging it out for the top spot on 
the pop album chart. Soundgarden won the first round, debuting at No. 1 with 
"Superunknown." But don't be surprised if Nine Inch Nails, which entered at No. 
2 with "The Downward Spiral," claws its way to the top in the next few weeks. 
Speaking of downward spirals, look what's happening to Hammer: He's struggling 
in his new gangsta rap mode. After debuting at No. 12, his "The Funky 
Headhunter" slipped to No. 22. There's no hit single to help keep it alive. 
Notable debuts: Gang Starr's "Hard to Earn" (No. 25) and Elvis Costello's 
"Brutal Youth" (No. 34). Beck's "Mellow Gold" figured to drop after entering 
last week at No. 15, but the newcomer's album went in the other direction, 
notching up to No. 13. Ace of Base's "The Sign" is the top pop single for the 
third straight week. 04,38,06,08,08 Rank Rank 2 Weeks Last Weeks on the Week 
Ago Chart 1. "Superunknown," Soundgarden ... ... 1 2. "The Downward Spiral,"

sure selling. His new album jumped from No. 55 to No. 26 in two weeks. What's 
really impressive is that this is a live album. Not many get this high on the 
chart so quickly.

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; TOP 10 SHAPES UP AS REAL HORSE RACE

 Because of the unusually large number of releases in the last few weeks, the 
Top 10 is taking on a new look, with half the movies entering in the last two 
weeks -- a very high turnover for this chart. "Demolition Man," a hit 
($57.2-million gross) starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes, entered at 
No. 3 and could take over No. 1 in the next few weeks. This is the kind of 
no-nonsense action flick that genre fans love. It may have trouble, though, 
with the red-hot "The Fugitive," which should enter the chart next week. 
"Striking Distance," an action/mystery starring Bruce Willis, did OK box-office 
business for this kind of movie ($23.8 million) but should attract a sizable 
home-video audience. That's largely because Willis is a huge rental-market star 
due to his "Die Hard" movies. In its first week, "Striking Distance" is already 
within striking distance of the top, entering at No. 4. Looks like the last Top 
10 gasp for "Last Action Hero," which slipped from No. 3 to No. 10. The Top 10 
tenure of this January release was unusually short for an Arnold Schwarzenegger 
movie. "The Man Without a Face," featuring Mel Gibson as a recluse with a 
scarred face, moved up from No. 7 to No. 2. Clearly, to his legion of female 
fans who are doing the renting, he's more than just another pretty face. 
03,31,06,08 Rank Weeks Last on the Week Chart 1. "In the Line of Fire" 1 4 2. 
"The Man Without a Face" 7 3 3. "Demolition Man" ... 1 4. "Striking Distance"

Shakespeare usually does on the screen, grossing $22.5 million. But 
director-star Kenneth Branagh made it more palatable to mass tastes. The 
star-studded cast -- including Emma Thompson and Denzel Washington -- helped 
lure moviegoers, too. It debuted at No. 16 and should make it to the Top 10. If 
Thompson wins another Oscar on Monday, this movie will be even more attractive 
to renters.

DANA PARSONS: A LEGAL RAILROADING, BUT JUSTICE WAS AROUND THE BEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A decision this week by 12 jurors may fade quickly from the annals of local 
courtroom history, but it represents one of those quiet victories of our 
judicial system. As such, it should be applauded for what it was: 12 citizens 
who, instead of doing the popular thing, did the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney served up to them a 20-year-old illegal immigrant named 
Jose Garcia, who basically didn't contest charges that he raped then 
79-year-old Mary Ward in May of 1992. She died a month later, and the district 
attorney pressed a murder case against Garcia, contending that the rape so 
dispirited Ward that it contributed to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 The sexual assault was a crime that would shock anyone's sensibilities. The 
connection between the rape and Mary Ward's death is one that any of us, 
instinctively, might accept. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury was composed of 12 white, basically middle-age citizens, presumably 
sick of crime and, I'll hazard a guess, probably not too keen on illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, that jury returned a not-guilty verdict on the murder count, while 
convicting Garcia of several counts of rape and assault. 
</P>
<P>
 I met with John Brown, a 62-year-old career teacher and jury member, to find 
out why. It was his first time ever on a jury. He works at Rancho Alamitos High 
School, within walking distance of the crime scene. He's lived in Orange County 
since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was offended, a lot, by the crime," he said. "But I think you get 
over that initial feeling, and then you just start listening to the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 The first week of the trial, Brown said, "I thought I might be having 
nightmares over the whole thing. I would wake up every now and then thinking 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked whether his initial impulse wasn't to link the rape with her death: 
"Yeah, I think so. When the prosecution started its case, I thought, 'Wow, how 
are they ever going to defend this? It sounds like an open-and-shut case.' Then 
(deputy public defender Leonard) Gumlia started punching holes in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense showed that Mary Ward had previously undetected cancer. Gumlia 
also revealed that doctors performed another test that had the unintended 
effect of contributing to kidney failure. A cancer specialist testified that 
Ward died within the expected range for the cancer she had, given its late 
detection. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they began deliberating, jurors mounted a timeline display of Mary Ward's 
last few months of life, with appropriate medical entries and significant 
events. It helped focus the case, Brown said. At the start, all 12 jurors gave 
their overview of the key evidence. The initial indication was that jurors were 
leaning toward acquittal on the murder charge, although a few were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Deliberations essentially lasted for three full days. Jurors reviewed the 
evidence unemotionally, except for a lone juror, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the jurors came into the deliberations with a closed mind. She'd 
already decided he was guilty, and nothing was going to change that. We tried 
our best for a couple days to use tact. We asked on what she based her 
decisions, and it pretty much seemed to be her gut feeling. She couldn't 
explain to us on what basis she formed her decision, but her mind was made up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On what proved to be the final day of deliberations, Brown said, "The gloves 
came off. Everybody was coming down on her. We told her we had to follow the 
law, follow our oath (as jurors) and to base things on the evidence and law and 
not just opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman then took from her purse an envelope that appeared to contain a 
pre-written message. She summoned the bailiff and announced, "I'm outta here," 
Brown said. The woman was excused by the judge, although Brown doesn't know 
exactly why, and replaced by an alternate, who sided with the 11 others on the 
not-guilty murder verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Brown about impressions from his brush with the system: "First of all, 
you hear the public defenders being bad-mouthed frequently. This guy (Gumlia) 
did a great job. It's pretty hard to find a defendant you'd have less sympathy 
for, and he did a first-class job for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Brown said, Gumlia never acted as though he sympathized with his client 
for the assault. Brown also is left without a single recollection of Garcia 
ever raising his head during the lengthy trial or of Gumlia ever talking to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia will be sentenced in May and faces up to 40 years on the other 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggested to Brown that the jury could have convicted Garcia of murder 
without a peep of protest. "It feels good that justice was served," Brown 
answered. "Possibly we would have been heroes if we had convicted him, but 
you've got to have something you can live with afterward, and we just couldn't 
find it within ourselves to see any real evidence that he affected her (date of 
death)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Was the jury prepared to convict Garcia of murder, I asked? "Sure, I think 
everybody would have," Brown said. "Give us some evidence, and we'll convict 
him. But it comes down to, 'I'm going to have to live with this decision, and 
without evidence you just can't do it, even though you might want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Some might argue that there was nothing wrong with the district attorney 
bringing the murder charge and letting a jury decide. 
</P>
<P>
 I would disagree, citing a notion so archaic as citizen confidence in the 
judicial system and a prosecutor presenting a flimsy case against an unpopular 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't take my word for it. Here's Brown's assessment: "When all was said 
and done, one of the jurors made the comment, 'What a waste of taxpayers' 
money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if that bugged him and, if so, whether it was on money-wasting 
grounds: "It bugs me," he said, "because I don't think they had a case to begin 
with. I think they really tried to railroad this guy. He had what sounds like 
would have been the perfect chance to railroad somebody -- the rape, the 
citizenry issue, people are down on crime and they want something done about 
it, and Orange County is famous for being pretty conservative. . . . It's more 
than the money. It bothers me that they're trying to convict somebody of 
something where there isn't any real evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 A footnote on the jury: At the outset of deliberations, one juror -- 
apparently aware of juror "bonding" that often occurs -- asked for everyone's 
phone number, saying she wanted them all to get together for dinner when the 
trial was over. 
</P>
<P>
 That juror turned out to be the lone holdout who would later exasperate the 
other 11 until she asked to be removed from the case.

HEAD ENGINEER LEAVES POST AT IRVINE WATER DISTRICT; UTILITIES: JOHN T. MORRIS 
WILL WORK ON SPECIAL PROJECTS UNTIL OCTOBER. HE SAYS HE WAS NOT SURPRISED BY 
AUDIT'S FINDINGS AND THAT HE OPTED TO GIVE UP HIS JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A third-generation Metropolitan Water District official who was chief engineer 
at the Irvine Ranch Water District has left his engineering post following a 
critical internal audit. 
</P>
<P>
 John T. Morris, the grandson of Samuel Morris, an MWD founder for whom the 
Morris Dam in the San Gabriel Valley is named, will leave the district in 
October and work as a consultant, board Chairman Peer Swan said. Until then, 
Swan said, Morris will handle a number of special projects for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "John is very talented, but he's not a manager," Swan said. "The audit was 
done and John decided that he needed to do other things. He was not fired. The 
decision to leave the job came from John." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, who lives in San Marino, has been that city's representative on the 
MWD's 51-member board of directors since 1990, serving alongside his father, 
Brooks T. Morris, until the latter's death in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit of the Irvine district's engineering department uncovered a number 
of management problems, including Morris' frequent absences from the district 
because of his involvement as an MWD director. 
</P>
<P>
 The report concluded that the position of assistant director held by Greg 
Heiertz was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Morris' departure, Heiertz, whose position was targeted for 
elimination, now becomes acting director of the 52-person department. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, 49, said the audit, conducted by Seattle-based engineering consultant 
R.W. Beck & Associates, contained no surprises and, in fact, recommended 
certain changes that he and his assistant had already planned on implementing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not classify the audit as critical," Morris said. "I would say it was 
just an in-depth look at how we can improve. The direction of the department is 
to look internally. After a lot of soul-searching, I decided I wanted to go off 
on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, who makes $107,844 a year, joined the district in February, 1988, 
after working for a private engineering firm. He left his job as head of 
engineering and planning earlier this month and was given a number of special 
projects to complete, according to General Manager Ron Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan said Morris was granted permission to serve on the MWD board and was away 
on MWD business about once a week. Although Morris' service on the MWD board 
benefited the Irvine Ranch Water District in many ways, Swan said, it also 
meant he could not devote his full attention to running his department.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the department said it often was unclear whether Morris or Heiertz 
was running the office, and that under Morris' leadership the department lacked 
urgency and direction.

SON, HIS WIFE LET GO AFTER ARREST IN MOTHER'S DEATH; CRIME: PROSECUTORS SAY

THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHOOTING' AND WILL PURSUE PROBE.

 Just one day after being arrested on suspicion of murder, the son and 
daughter-in-law of a woman who had been mysteriously shot to death on her 
balcony were released Thursday when prosecutors acknowledged that they lacked 
enough evidence to hold them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Ana Lt. Robert Helton said police continue "to believe they're 
responsible for the shooting" and will seek evidence to charge the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos Alvarez Roque and Maria Bruno Soto, both 24, had been arrested 
Wednesday on suspicion of homicide in the death of his mother, 55-year-old 
Valentina Roque, on Sunday. Alvarez had told police that she was hit by a 
bullet fired from the street as she stood on a wooden balcony outside their 
second-floor apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Clyde Von Der Ahe said "there is insufficient evidence at 
this time" to bring a case against the couple but that the investigation is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said physical evidence in the apartment and evidence from the autopsy 
indicate "that the shooting did occur inside the apartment." They were the only 
two people in the apartment at the time, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We also know Alvarez does own a small-caliber handgun which we have not yet 
been able to locate," he said. The only weapon recovered, Helton said, was a 
pellet gun, which could not have been used in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're going to re-interview some people, re-interview the husband and 
wife and locate the handgun with which she was shot and file charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters said investigators had probable cause 
to arrest the pair, and they had conferred with the district attorney's office 
before making the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there was nothing unusual in making an arrest even without sufficient 
evidence to prosecute, saying arrests are "part of the investigative process."  
</P>
<P>
 "You can't wait until you've got an ironclad case before you arrest people," 
he said, "because they can do all kinds of things to destroy the case for you" 
once they know they are under suspicion, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like Columbo, where you can follow them around for weeks," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez, who was released with his wife at about 1:30 p.m. from the Santa Ana 
Detention Facility, said police "were only doing their duty. But to suspect 
that I would kill my mother . . . no. It (a mother) is all one has in this 
life. I wanted the best for her, and she wanted the best for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Roque's body was released by the coroner's office to a mortuary in Los 
Angeles, where most of the family members live. It will be flown to Mexico City 
today, according to Magda Maldonado, assistant manager of the mortuary. From 
there, it will be taken to a small town in Guerrero state for burial Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez and Soto plan to accompany the body. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've asked my family to send me my things," Alvarez said, holding a wet 
handkerchief. "We may not be back." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said that police knew the couple planned to go to Mexico and that it 
would not be a problem if they decide to rearrest them.  
</P>
<P>
 Police "don't have any way to restrict them from leaving the U.S.," Helton 
said. "They may choose not to come back, even if they said they would. We know 
that that is definitely a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get them back," Walters said. "We do it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez said: "All of this is an inexplicable thing. It is very painful for me 
to recount it. I want to forget it. To me, it was so very painful to see how my 
mother bled and agonized." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, who identified herself by her maiden name, Maria Soto Bruno, also 
said police "were in error." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez said his mother had no life insurance and that he paid her $40 a week 
each to care for their 2-year-old. She had been living with the couple since 
she arrived from Mexico about eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a clear conscience. I would like for police to come out with proof. We 
told police everything we had to say on this." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife said they and her mother-in-law "got along well. Why would we do such 
a thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 A short, wiry man, with black hair and a sparse beard and mustache, Alvarez 
denied police claims that there were inconsistencies in their accounts of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no way were there contradictions. I didn't say something here and then 
something else over there." 
</P>

BOATERS' BONANZA; MINNEY'S SHIP CHANDLERY IN NEWPORT IS CHOCK-FULL OF NAUTICAL 
PARAPHERNALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Inside Minney's Ship Chandlery, Geoff Turk is digging his way through crates 
filled with hundreds of metal doodads, hunting a particular cleat for his 
sailboat's deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to find just the right size so I don't have to drill any new holes," 
said Turk. "That's the beauty of a place like this: They've got so much stuff 
that you're bound to find something." 
</P>
<P>
 At Minney's, salesclerks don't exactly find things for you. You rummage for 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to know how people shop here?" said salesman Colin Emsley, 29. "Just 
listen. Whattaya hear?" 
</P>
<P>
 Boxes were heard being moved, scraped along the concrete floor by customers. 
Down another aisle, someone was plowing through old metal winches, sounding out 
a metallic cadence: plunk, plunk, poing! 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how they shop here," Emsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minney's is a 4,000-square-foot nautical bouillabaisse. And in its nearly 30 
years of operation since the current owner's father, George Ernest Minney Sr., 
opened the place off West Coast Highway, it has become an institution for local 
and visiting seafaring customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been up and down the coast from San Diego to San Pedro to San Luis 
Obispo," Turk said, "and there's really no place like this. This is your last 
stop if you can't find anything elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 You need a propeller? Minney's probably has it. An old sail? Some teak hatch 
covers? Got 'em, and at a discount. Need that nautical chart for the Fiji 
Islands? It's over in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 John Petruzziello, 59, a retired firefighter from Costa Mesa, left Orange 
County last May in a 32-foot motorized sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stopped in San Francisco, traded our boat for a larger one and ended up in 
Brookings, Ore.," Petruzziello said. "We're waiting for the weather to warm in 
the spring to go up to Alaska, and I came in here for a Charlie's." 
</P>
<P>
 A Charlie's? 
</P>
<P>
 It's sailor lingo for one of a number of books written by Charles E. Wood. In 
this case, Petruzziello was referring to "Charlie's North to Alaska." Don't 
look for this at your local bookstore. It was written as a supplement to 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration charts -- the bible of all 
charts used by sailors -- and includes detailed maps of docking areas and 
hand-drawn views from the water to the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "These books are really handy when your plans take you to unfamiliar 
territory," Petruzziello said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Alaska, over-the-counter conversations at Minney's can take a listener 
just as easily to the isthmus at Santa Catalina Island as to the South Pacific, 
always to someplace where boaters spend lazy days enjoying white-sand beaches 
and water the color of turquoise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had phone calls for parts from sail boaters as far away as Singapore 
and Costa Rica," said George (Ernie) Minney II, the store's 55-year-old owner. 
"I remember one guy called from Cocos Island, off Costa Rica. The guy had 
damage to his rigging from a storm. We had new rigging shipped to Panama, and 
it was waiting for him as he came north." 
</P>
<P>
 Minney's is known for that. You call; you give a credit card number. It'll get 
delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I know the person, usually we can deal with the money stuff later. Sailing 
is kind of like a fraternity," Minney said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saleswoman Gina Strong, 33, said it's amazing how far away one can go and 
still hear about the unique store. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I got married in Fiji," Strong said. "And during our 
honeymoon, we were sitting down, you know, just for a drink someplace, and we 
started talking to this nearby couple. When they heard we were from Southern 
California, they quickly asked us to please, if it were possible, stop at 
Minney's and pick up something they needed for their boat. They didn't know I 
worked there. And I really didn't need to hear about work on my honeymoon, but 
there it was!" 
</P>
<P>
 Scott and Kate Sims of Irvine, both 35, said they were in Minney's looking for 
extra parts and propellers for their 40-foot wooden boat, built in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're changing the engine in our boat, and we need a smaller propeller," 
Scott Sims said. "But I also like Minney's because they trade parts with 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Minney made headlines in 1980 when he took 2 1/2 years off from work and 
circumnavigated the globe. His father, a yacht broker, began the business, and 
Minney took it over after his father's death 15 years ago. The Minney family is 
well-known in Newport Beach. Brothers Owen and Joe, in addition to Ernie, take 
turns running Josh Slocum's, an unassuming boaters' hangout owned by the 
family. 
</P>

<P>
 Algernon Gaurowski, 57, a retired pilot from Moreno Valley, has been restoring 
a 35-foot 1921 yawl he bought in the California desert several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was once owned by actor John Ireland, and the story goes that he and James 
Cagney would sail her to and from Catalina," Gaurowski said. "It was originally 
named the Valdora and then Act III. From what I know, it ran aground, and the 
insurance company salvaged everything aboard the boat. When I saw it, it was on 
a trailer and parts were strewn all over a back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I climbed aboard, I saw this solid, deep, black mahogany deck, and I 
was impressed," he said. "I can't stand the new boats -- you know, all that 
fiberglass and glitz." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the restoration has gone beyond a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a continuing quest for hardware," Gaurowski said. "I'm looking for parts 
to construct a boom -- well, two booms, actually -- and I've already been in 
(Minney's) 50 times. Hobby? Hell, no! This is an obsession."

WOMAN IS KILLED BY POLICE AFTER ANAHEIM CARJACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police shot and killed a woman in a Ford Ranger that had been carjacked 10 
minutes earlier Thursday outside an Anaheim motel, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately known if she was a companion of the carjacker, but 
police said the owner of the car didn't know her. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police received a report of the carjacking at 7:25 p.m. from the 
Rustic Inn in the 900 block of South Beach Boulevard, Sgt. Mike W. Zigmund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A night shift clerk at the motel said that a man about 21 years of age ran 
into the lobby and said that he had stopped to aid a man who had motioned for 
help in the street. When he opened the door to the Ranger, the victim said, the 
man pulled a gun and ordered him out, according to the clerk, Mohammed Zaman. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim called 911 from the motel. An Anaheim police helicopter responding 
to that call spotted a pickup truck matching the description at Beach Boulevard 
and the Artesia Freeway. Other Anaheim police vehicles stopped the 1993 Ranger 
at a call box on the Artesia Freeway between Valley View and Walker streets, 
near the Orangethorpe off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting of the woman apparently occurred as she stepped out of the 
pickup. Police would not say Thursday night if anyone in the pickup fired a 
shot, or what circumstances led to the shooting.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some shooting occurred, and a female went down," said Sgt. Jeff C. 
Kirkpatrick, La Palma watch commander. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup owner told police that he had no idea who the woman might be, and 
that he had not seen a woman with the carjacker earlier, Anaheim Sgt. Ron 
Lovejoy said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; JUDGE ADDS SCHOOLS TO TRASH-HAULING SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge on Thursday ordered Waste Management Inc. and the city 
of Santa Ana to include the Santa Ana Unified School District in a lawsuit that 
seeks to stop a family-run business from picking up school garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 The city last year granted an exclusive contract to Great Western Reclamation, 
a subsidiary of trash giant Waste Management Inc., and also drafted an 
ordinance prohibiting any other trash hauler from working within city 
boundaries. The contract specifically includes "educational institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The city and Great Western Reclamation sued the Newport Beach-based 5-Star 
Rubbish Co., alleging that by hauling trash for the school district the company 
is violating that contract. The company is also complicating city efforts to 
comply with state recycling law, the suit alleges, because the city has no 
control over the garbage generated by the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Superior Court Judge Thomas M. Thrasher added the school district 
as a defendant in the civil case and said he would not hear arguments on the 
matter until April 7, in order to give the school district time to respond to 
the revised complaint.  
</P>
<P>
 "The school district is intimately involved in the question of the contract 
that it has granted to 5-Star," Thrasher said.  
</P>
<P>
 The district awarded its trash contract to 5-Star, owned by Dolores Otting, in 
January after a months-long argument with the city over whether the district 
had the right to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 By contracting with Otting, who submitted a bid significantly lower than Great 
Western Reclamation's, the school district also appears to be in violation of 
the city ordinance. But City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said no money has yet 
changed hands between the school district and Otting. 
</P>
<P>
 Otting said the lawsuit is quashing free enterprise in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad the city has to have such a vendetta against us. This is going 
to go on forever," Otting said. "If the city wants the school district to use 
Waste Management (as their hauler) then the city should pay for it. They have 
no right to dip into the school district's budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Some other Orange County school districts contract with small haulers even 
though cities where they are located have exclusive franchise agreements with 
Waste Management. But Great Western Reclamation President Robert J. Coyle said 
the fact that Santa Ana has a municipal ordinance prohibiting other haulers 
from working within city limits strengthens this case. LEE ROMNEY

<P>
 A group of Canyon High School students are semifinalists in a national science 
contest for their ideas about an implantable computer chip that would monitor 
its wearer's well-being and alert medical help in case of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest, which drew 4,500 entries, asks students of all grade levels to 
take an existing technology and project it 20 years into the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canyon High team is the only one from Orange County among the 48 
semifinalists. Each team has received $500 to make a video of their entry, and 
12 finalists will be honored at a ceremony in Washington in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon High's team is composed of four students -- Kristie Armentrout, Debbie 
Hehir, Heath Kula and Vic Kapoor. They are all juniors or seniors and 
participate in the school's pre-engineering program.  
</P>
<P>
 Students on the four first-place teams will each receive a $10,000 savings 
bond. Second-place finishers will receive $5,000 bonds. Their advisers and 
schools will receive products from Toshiba, which sponsors the contest. JODI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; STUDENTS CHALK IT UP TO SUCCESS 
</P>

 Thirteen-year-old Paul Marshman plays the oboe in a school band of mostly 
clarinet players. He says he loves being different. He wants to do most things 
his own way. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, Marshman showed he could also be a team player. His idea of a 
rabbit trying to reach for a carrot atop a mountain became the inspiration for 
the winning drawing at McGarvin Intermediate School's sidewalk art competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-member teams of seventh- and eighth-graders participated in the art 
contest. They turned the school quadrangle into an impromptu art gallery, 
making chalk drawings on the pavement to portray setting goals, solving 
problems and succeeding in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the kids to come together and work as a team," said school 
counselor Lynn Buckley, who organized the art competition as an annual event 
last year as part of a program to teach students how to succeed in life. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, "How to Be Successful in Less Than 10 Minutes a Day," also seeks 
to teach students basic skills to live and work well with other people, Buckley 
said. She said the competition allowed the students to show what they have 
learned in a creative way. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 4-foot-square illustrations had such titles as "Be Confident," "Be a 
Doer" and "Be a Risk Taker," and were associated with spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just popped in my mind," Marshman said of his team's drawing, which was 
picked by a panel of seven judges as best among entries from seventh-graders. 
He credited his teammates, however, for turning a "corny" idea to a "pretty 
good" work of art. 
</P>
<P>
 With Marshman on the team were Alex Hogan, Christina Tran, Jacklyn Valdez and 
Orlando Cisneros. The team was selected from the 15 students attending 
beginning band class, according to music teacher Lucy Ewell. 
</P>
<P>
 The math class of Greg Percy topped the eighth-grade competition with a 
drawing of a basketball player shooting over a defender labeled "Fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Linares said she got the idea from a television show, but the catchy 
caption, "If you miss your goal, catch the rebound and try again," was put 
together by her group. Cau Uyen and Donald Yee did most of the drawing. The 
other members of the team were Melissa Watanabe and Scott Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one teams took part in the competition, according to Buckley, the 
school counselor. The entries were judged on quality of drawing and 
inspirational value, she said. The winners received prizes donated by local 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 McGarvin Intermediate School is in the Garden Grove Unified School District 
and serves students from Westminster, Garden Grove, Fountain Valley and Santa 
Ana. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; EXPELLED PUBLISHER DROPS HIS LAWSUIT 
</P>

<P>
 An Anaheim Hills boy who was forced to leave Canyon High School for 
distributing a controversial underground newspaper has dropped his lawsuit to 
re-enroll at the Anaheim school. 
</P>
<P>
 Raihan Kadri has agreed to complete his senior year at Troy High School in 
Fullerton, said his attorney, Jack A. Fleischli. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a lengthy court battle and having already missed 10 days of classes, 
Kadri decided to drop the suit and prepare for graduation at the other school, 
Fleischli said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kadri, an honor student, was ordered to leave Canyon High last month after 
handing out 400 copies of "The Exploited," a six-page newspaper he created that 
school officials found "slanderous and defamatory." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Ralph Jameson said Kadri's newspaper went beyond merely expressing 
alternative views about campus-related issues, and instead "launched vicious 
personal attacks against staff and faculty." 
</P>
<P>
 Five school employees were the target of "offensive" cartoon and slanderous 
descriptions, according to Jameson. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadri was denied a restraining order this week by a Superior Court judge. It 
would have let him return to Canyon High. He said the newspaper was created to 
offer "new and different ideas" to a student body that had become "repressed 
and convoluted." 
</P>
<P>
 Kadri wrote an apology to school officials.  
</P>
<P>
 After learning of Kadri's decision to drop the lawsuit, Jameson said he is 
pleased "because now can move beyond this thing and get back to the work we are 
here for."E. J. GONG JR.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; WEDAA SAYS AQMD POST UNCONDITIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Councilman Henry W. Wedaa says his recent reelection as Orange County's 
representative to the South Coast Air Quality Management District has no 
strings attached, disputing claims by others that he had agreed to step down by 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no conditions, period," he said at Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last month, it appeared that the county would lose its representation on 
the air quality board because local mayors could not agree on whether to keep 
or replace Wedaa. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial councilman has angered some cities by pushing through 
smog-reduction regulations, one of them requiring companies with 100 or more 
employees to develop ride-sharing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But a plan proposed Feb. 14 by Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young and Anaheim 
Mayor Tom Daly offered a compromise. If he agreed to resign at the end of his 
council term and to abide by the decisions of a seven-member steering 
committee, Wedaa could maintain his spot, Daly and Young suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa was then reelected by the Orange County League of Cities selection 
committee, made up of mayors of the county's 31 cities.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John M. Gullixson, who was not at the selection meeting, raised the 
issue of Wedaa's alleged promises at Tuesday's meeting. He said Wedaa had 
agreed to both resign as the county's representative on the regulatory agency's 
board of directors on Dec. 15 and abide by the decisions of the steering 
committee, made up of council members from throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullixson acknowledged that the two conditions were not included in the motion 
to approve Wedaa's position, but said the controversial representative had 
verbally agreed to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either Hank's a person of his word or he's not," Gullixson said. "He told 
people, to get their vote, he would comply with those conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview Wednesday, Wedaa claims his reelection was unencumbered by 
any deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent my resignation to the mayors (of each city) two weeks before the 
(AQMD) election," Wedaa said. "I did it on my own. It was not a condition of 
reelection." 
</P>
<P>
 He also denied that he is obligated to accept as binding any decision made by 
the newly created steering committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not agree to that. It would be illegal," Wedaa said. "I cannot legally 
be bound by" the steering committee. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no consensus about what, if anything, Wedaa did agree to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Barbara Kiley contends that Wedaa accepted the conditions, a position 
supported by a memo from Bill Hodge, secretary of the selection committee and a 
League of Cities staff member. Hodge sent the memo to Orange County mayors. 
</P>
<P>
 "A motion to attach conditions to (Wedaa's) appointment was subsequently 
withdrawn after Mr. Wedaa agreed verbally to the conditions and provided a 
letter of resignation effective Dec. 15, 1994," Hodge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, including Placentia Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode, disputed that 
claim. "I assumed there were no conditions when I voted for him," Eckenrode 
said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SUSPECT SHOT, INJURED AFTER CAR HITS OFFICER

<P>
 A fleeing burglary suspect was shot and wounded by police in a quiet 
residential neighborhood early Thursday after he allegedly tried to run down a 
police officer with a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Tipped off by a neighbor, officers surprised four suspects apparently 
burglarizing a garage that had been left open in the 13400 block of Sioux Road 
about 4:30 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the suspects got into a car and tried to drive away, and a fourth 
escaped on foot. After one officer was hit by the car, a second fired at the 
driver, wounding him in the head, police said. The first officer was not 
seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers immediately arrested three suspects. The fourth managed to elude them 
for about seven hours, hiding in a tool shed four houses away until a homeowner 
found him and called police, who returned to the scene and arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured suspect, Quyen Nguyen, 21, of Westminster, underwent surgery at 
UCI Medical Center late Thursday afternoon and was in guarded condition in the 
surgical intensive care unit, a hospital spokeswoman said. He was being held on 
suspicion of burglary and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested on suspicion of burglary were Thanh Van Tran, 20, of 
Westminster, and Bao Nhat Nguyen, 21, and Quang Vu Nguyen, 19, both of Garden 
Grove. All are being held at Westminster jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators spent several hours combing the scene for evidence, unaware that 
Quang Nguyen was hiding nearby in the back yard of a home in the 6100 block of 
Chippewa Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The resident there had been unaware of the attempted burglary until he heard 
about it from a neighbor. He grew concerned after finding that a suspect was 
still at large, Lt. Rick Main said. 
</P>
<P>
 The resident then noticed that a screen had been removed from his shed, and on 
checking found a man inside. "The suspect told the (resident) he would give up 
to police and wait until they got there," Main said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, about a dozen officers arrived and made the arrest without 
incident. The officer who had been hit by the car was brought back to the scene 
and identified Nguyen as one of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredulous neighbors watched from their driveways as the morning's events 
unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I hope they've got them all now," said 68-year-old Richard Schaible, 
who had been awake since the first arrests and the shooting took place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the shots, so I came out to see what all the commotion was about," 
Schaible said. "I thought I might be able to be of help, but the policemen 
shouted at me to stay away. Everything was happening so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office will investigate the incident, as is standard 
procedure in all officer-involved shootings. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; MAN ARRESTED AFTER FREEWAY ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man and a child were injured Thursday afternoon when their car swerved into 
a second vehicle, spun out and struck a concrete bridge abutment on the 
northbound Santa Ana Freeway, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Luna Dimas, 18, was critically injured in the crash and taken to UCI 
Medical Center in Orange, where he was arrested on suspicion of felony drunk 
driving and child endangerment, said CHP officer Pete Gustafson. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimas' 2-year-old sister, who was sitting next to him in the front seat, 
suffered moderate injuries when Dimas was thrown onto her. Neither wore a seat 
belt, Gustafson said, although there was an empty child safety seat in the back 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 A 48-year-old Whittier man in the second car was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at 2:10 p.m., north of Chapman Avenue, blocking two 
freeway lanes for about 45 minutes. Northbound traffic was backed up for about 
three miles, Gustafson said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; BOBBY SOX LEAGUE TO OPEN NEW BALL 
FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the community pitching in the labor to build a new softball diamond, the 
Capistrano Valley Bobby Sox league will be busier than ever this year. And they 
love it. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be 130 more girls between the ages of 5 and 15 playing softball at 
Cook Park this year who wouldn't have participated last year, said league 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there will be much pride in the polished version of the diamond being 
unveiled Saturday, league organizers say they haven't lost sight of the reason 
it was built. 
</P>
<P>
 "The satisfaction will come from seeing all these girls out there that 
wouldn't have been able to participate last year," said Marlene Arnold, league 
president. "Softball is getting very popular. You've got girls getting 
scholarships at colleges all over the country who've never had that kind of 
advantage in the past."  
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a chronic shortage of space in the past, the league was forced to 
turn away girls who want to play ball. Finally last year, league officials had 
enough of disappointing young, aspiring softball players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got tired of saying no," said John Faulkner, a league board member and 
project manager. "We asked a few of the dads who were general contractors if 
this could get done. Then we started shaking some hands in the community and 
rounding up the help we needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Lining up volunteers and clearing the project with the city, which owns the 
park on Calle Arroyo, took several months. Finally, work began in early 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 The support was almost overwhelming, Faulkner said. Besides the hard, physical 
labor provided by league parents, there was help from people with no direct 
connection to the group, including a local architect and a welder who each 
poured thousands of dollars of free labor into building the ball field. 
</P>
<P>
 And once the red-brick infield dust was poured, the diamond began looking like 
the $65,000 gift to the community that it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an amenity that absolutely wouldn't have happened if the Bobby Soxers 
hadn't rolled up their sleeves and made it happen," said City Manager George 
Scarborough.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a reflection of the commitment that bobby sox softball has 
traditionally shown to solving field shortages," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, league officials will observe a special opening day at the new 
ball field. Just don't expect any long, self-congratulatory speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be very brief, just a few minutes to dedicate the field to San Juan 
Capistrano," Arnold said. "We've got a lot of ballgames to play on Saturday."

<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who did not know already, the Spring Psychic Fair is being held here 
on March 26 and 27.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the fair's organizer, veteran astrologer Kathleen Scott, people 
who specialize in handwriting analysis, past-life readings, palm readings and 
various psychic paraphernalia will congregate at the Hyatt Newporter for the 
two-day fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott encourages skeptics as well as believers to attend, "mostly for the fun 
of it and (out of) plain curiosity."  
</P>
<P>
 Scott does astrology readings using a 100-year calendar that tells her where 
the planets were positioned at the precise moment of a subject's birth. From 
that information, she interprets how the planets will influence a person's 
personality, and claims to have predicted pregnancies and job promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a lot of fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be vendors selling incense, candles and jewelry as well as readers 
of palms, Tarot cards and astrology charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is free but readings and such will cost. The Hyatt Newporter is at 
1107 Jamboree Road in Newport Beach.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; FORMER SCHOOL HIT BY FIRE; BOY, 13, HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have taken a 13-year-old boy into custody on suspicion that he and 
several companions set a fire that tore through a vacant continuation school 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the blaze, which burned a structure at the former site of 
Wintersburg High School at 17200 Golden West Ave.More than 25 firefighters 
responded to the fire after 1 p.m. and extinguished it in about 25 minutes, 
Huntington Beach Fire Department spokeswoman Martha Werth said.  
</P>
<P>
 The boy who was taken into custody is from Huntington Beach. "Apparently, he 
came back looking for some schoolbooks he had left," Werth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are also seeking as many as five other youths who allegedly 
participated in setting the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Flames caused about $140,000 damage to classrooms in the 6,000-square-foot 
building, Werth said. The fire started in what was a teachers' lounge.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe transients had been living in the tan, one-story 
building because they found adult-size clothes and a portable radio inside. "We 
also found adult reading material, for lack of a better term," firefighter Don 
Boland said, referring to magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 All doors in the building were locked, Boland said, except one leading into 
the lounge, where the fire is thought to have started. Heat from the fire blew 
out a window near the room, he said, and melted the goggles of firefighter Gary 
Durian when he tried to enter the lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 Arson investigators poked their heads into rooms Thursday while firefighters 
soaked down embers that sent smoke wafting from charcoal-blackened tables and 
tiles. Classrooms had not been used since September, 1991, when the school was 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes at Ocean View High School, about 200 yards away, were unaffected.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; STEIN-BRIEF GROUP SCALES DOWN PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gone are the plans for a grandiose, 27,000-square-foot headquarters for the 
Stein-Brief Group at the upscale corner of Pacific Coast Highway and Ritz 
Carlton Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the poor economy and a shift to new ventures, South County 
developers Barry Brief and David Stein have come up with a more modest plan for 
the corner spot now occupied by a cottage housing Monarch Beach Realty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dana Point City Council recently approved an amendment to the city General 
Plan that allows a 12,600-square-foot building to be located on the space. The 
project must still be approved by the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Theel, a spokesman for Brief and Stein, said the new building has been 
designed by Laguna Beach architect Morris Skenderian and will house a mixture 
of uses rather than be exclusively office space. 
</P>
<P>
 "The previous project was very controversial, extremely contemporary," Theel 
said. "It was eventually approved, but it was a battle. . . . This project has 
been relatively easy. " 
</P>
<P>
 The new project has been patterned after the nearby Ritz-Carlton hotel, Theel 
said, noting it will be two stories, with retail space on the ground floor and 
office space and a restaurant upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Monarch Beach Realty is expected to occupy one of the offices, with the 
Stein-Brief Group housed in another space. 
</P>
<P>
 Theel said ground could be broken on the project in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Once major developers in the South County, Brief and Stein have adopted a 
lower profile in the past few years. Stein, a former activist with the 
Democratic Party in the county, spends most of his time in Europe while Brief 
continues to live in Laguna Beach.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; PLAN UNIT APPROVES HEADLANDS PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial $500-million hotel and residential project proposed for the 
121-acre Headlands area moved ahead this week when the Planning Commission 
approved a development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted 4 to 1 Wednesday for the 64-page agreement, a legal 
contract that locks in a development plan for at least 10 years. Before it is 
binding, however, the plan and the development agreement must be approved by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the agreement's key elements are requirements that the developer 
dedicate 66 acres for parks and open space, spend $2.8 million on improvements 
for parks, and construct a public trail system on the property within 180 days 
of obtaining the first grading permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not yet approved, the plan calls for a 400-room hotel, two commercial 
centers and a maximum of 370 homes on the peninsula above Dana Point Harbor. 
The council is scheduled to vote on the plan April 5 and on the development 
agreement sometime after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commission Chairman Jim Hyde said the agreement protects the city and 
reflects the many changes his five-member panel had built into the plan during 
nearly nine months of review last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that it is a good agreement," said Hyde, noting that the 
commission had gone through the agreement page by page during a meeting lasting 
several hours. "We spent a lot of time on the plan and didn't leave many loose 
ends . . . and we didn't really make many comments on the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission did express concern over the order in which the development 
construction would take place. Although the agreement leaves that order -- 
called phasing -- up to the developer, the commission suggested that the 
commercial centers come early in the construction, not last as now proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked the council to somehow stipulate that the last phase not be the 
commercial phase . . . which provides income to the city," Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Robert Montgomery also called the agreement a good one, pointing 
out that it ties the dedication of most of the parkland and open space to the 
residential construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the residential phases most of the important things happen," 
Montgomery said. "That's when we get most of what we want as a city." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Robert F. Nichols Jr. cast the dissenting vote because he wanted 
more protections for the city written into the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very complex legal document," said Nichols, an attorney. "I don't 
think the city is as protected in this agreement as it could be." 
</P>
<P>
 The Headlands property is owned by the M.H. Sherman Co. and Chandis Securities 
Co. Chandis manages the holdings of the Chandler family, major stockholders in 
Times Mirror Co., which publishes The Times.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; SWAP MEET PLAN FOR RACECOURSE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to operate a swap meet for five years at Los Alamitos Race Course won 
City Council approval this week after three hours of scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Arnold, one of the racecourse owners, persuaded the council to vote 
unanimously for the plan by promising to pay for any street improvements needed 
to accommodate swap meet traffic.He also promised measures to deter shoppers 
from parking on neighborhood streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the racecourse had complained that the swap meet, which will 
operate Saturdays and Sundays from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., would create traffic and 
parking problems on their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're trying to do is just find a way to get some income and by doing so, 
the city gets income," Arnold said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Los Alamitos resident Lois Waddle said she is concerned about traffic and 
parking in her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just foresee a tremendous traffic jam," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The swap meet will sit on about 33 acres at the northwest corner of Katella 
Avenue and Walker Street, property that has been vacant for 50 years, Arnold 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expects to open the meet within five months. He said he expects no 
more than 7,000 visitors each day the swap meet is open. There will be no 
admission fee for the first two years, city officials and Arnold agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is allowing Arnold to operate the swap meet under several 
conditions. These include installing portable toilets and repairing and 
landscaping the entrance of the racetrack. MIMI KO

RAMS PRACTICE SITE OWNER GIVES GROUND; NEGOTIATIONS: IN EFFORT TO KEEP TEAM 
THERE, SCHOOL DISTRICT AGREES TO CONSIDER CAPPING RESTORATION COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to end a dispute over the lease for the Los Angeles Rams practice 
facility, the owners of the site have agreed to consider putting a cap on 
restoration costs the team would have to pay if it vacates the facility, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of how much the Rams should pay to restore the former school site to 
its original condition has been a point of contention in negotiations among the 
city, the ballclub and the Magnolia School District, which owns the property at 
the former Juliette Low Elementary School on Lincoln Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials have become increasingly frustrated with the Rams' 
refusal to renew the lease for the facility, which expired Dec. 31. The lease 
was extended for a month while the parties worked to resolve the situation. The 
Rams currently occupy the site without a lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has imposed a deadline on the Rams to sign the lease today or 
face possible eviction from the practice facility. In a complicated 
arrangement, the city subleases the site from the district and then leases it 
to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth said Thursday that the deadline might be extended 
if the district agrees to set a limit on the restoration costs. But, he said, 
it is a decision that must be made by district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district has been absolutely wonderful in trying to get this (lease) 
settled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials could not be reached for comment.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CLEARS OFFICER; INQUIRY: FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS EXAMINING 
FOUR FATAL SHOOTINGS BY ANAHEIM OFFICER LEE SMITH FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT HE 
VIOLATED CIVIL RIGHTS STATUTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A U.S. Department of Justice investigation has concluded that an Anaheim 
police officer did not commit criminal civil rights violations in any of the 
four fatal shootings he was involved in during the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found no evidence showing that Officer Lee Smith violated 
federal civil right statutes, it was announced Thursday by Myron Marlin, a 
spokesman for the Justice Department. He said the investigation, which was 
concluded Feb. 1, could be reopened "if further information regarding the 
shootings come to light." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 10-year veteran of the department, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Smith was named Anaheim Police Officer of the Year by a 
local community group. Currently, Smith works on the department's gang task 
force and is a member of the SWAT team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a tremendous policeman. Always has been," said Bruce Bottolfson, 
president of the Anaheim Police Assn. "This just validates everything everyone 
knew -- that he did nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal probe was sparked last May when relatives of one of the dead men, 
Gregory Alan Rosenberger, complained to the Justice Department. The FBI looked 
into the shootings and passed its findings on to the Justice Department for 
review. The Orange County district attorney's office had also conducted an 
investigation after each shooting, clearing Smith of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his actions have not been deemed criminal, they have cost the city 
nearly $200,000 in civil proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the City Council agreed to pay $175,000 to settle a lawsuit brought 
by the family of Rosenberger. Smith shot Rosenberger six times -- three times 
in the back -- during a scuffle on Oct. 10, 1989. Smith said he feared for his 
life when Rosenberger, who was a suspect in a drug investigation, grabbed the 
grip of his holstered gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The other fatalities involving Smith were: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Feb. 2, 1989, shooting of Robert Vincent Edson Jr., who led the officer 
on a 45-minute car chase and then appeared to go for a weapon in his waistband 
when cornered by officers. Edson was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Sept. 8, 1989, shooting death of Dennis William Smith, who allegedly 
shot and wounded an officer after a car chase and gun battle. Smith was part of 
a tactical police assault team that killed the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dec. 9, 1991, shooting death of a burglary suspect. The man, identified 
as Antonio V. Galindo, broke into Smith's condominium. He was armed with a 
knife.

TEEN, DOG KILLED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING ON ANAHEIM STREET

<P>
 A young man and a dog were killed in a drive-by shooting in a normally quiet 
neighborhood Thursday night, according to police and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not release the identity of the victim Thursday night, but 
neighbors said they saw the body of a teen-age boy, a crumpled bicycle, and a 
dead dog laying in the middle of Cliffrose Street about 9:30 p.m. The shooting 
happened at 8:35 p.m. and appeared to be gang-related, Sgt. Mike W. Zigmund 
said.He did not know Thursday night whether the victim lived in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Cliffrose and nearby streets said they heard a single shot, then 
a car screeching away. Many were shocked that guns and violence had entered 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard it, and I said to my granddaughter, 'What was that?' you know, 
because it sounded like a shot. She said, 'Oh, it must be just a backfire,' " 
said Betty Hadley, who has lived on Cliffrose since 1963. "It kind of scares 
you, because this isn't too bad of a neighborhood. I don't know, you hear about 
these drive-by shootings all over, but you don't think it's going to happen in 
your own neighborhood."

ACLU SPEAKS UP FOR GAY STUDENTS; SCHOOLS: CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION SAYS SUPPORT 
GROUP AT FOUNTAIN VALLEY HIGH IS BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY. DISTRICT OFFICIALS 
DECLINE TO COMMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union has sent two letters to the Huntington 
Beach Union High School District alleging that the rights of a gay support 
group at Fountain Valley High School have been violated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that gay students are being singled out and treated differently 
without any written standards," said Alan L. Friel, ACLU legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials Thursday declined to comment on the charges contained in 
the letters sent Thursday and March 11. But Friel said he plans to meet with 
district officials today. The ACLU alleges that, unlike other school groups, 
the Student Alliance has not been allowed to have guest speakers and that they 
were not allowed to participate in the International Week activities on campus 
with other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU also complained that the district's policy prohibiting the Student 
Alliance -- or any club -- from excluding people has forced them to suffer 
students at their meetings who are openly opposed to homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district's policy violates the Alliance students' rights of expressive 
association and right to be free from intimidation or violence," Friel wrote in 
a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Student Alliance also complained to the ACLU that they were not allowed 
show a videotape of an HBO movie about lesbian high school students who attend 
their prom.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, they're going to cease and desist their illegal activities and 
promulgate reasonable and non-discriminatory standards and policies," Friel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Jeff Edmonston, 18, a straight member of the alliance, said it is 
"being treated unfairly in relation to the other groups. We just want to be 
treated equally." 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. David J. Hagensaid Thursday that the district's high schools are 
re-examining the status of all clubs and organizations on campuses to determine 
whether they are related to the curriculum. Such clubs have privileges that 
groups such as the alliance aren't afforded. 
</P>
<P>
 But the alliance alleges that even some groups not related to the curriculum, 
such as the Key Club, enjoy privileges they don't have.  
</P>
<P>
 But in one letter, Friel said that the Student Alliance has "patiently allowed 
the district more than a reasonable amount of time in which to adjust its 
policies and to begin treating the Alliance in the same way as other groups are 
treated." 
</P>
<P>
 The Student Alliance and ACLU have also complained about the removal of the 
group's supervisor, English teacher Michael Poff, and his replacement by a 
school psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 District and school officials declined to discuss why Poff was removed. Poff 
said he believes it was triggered by an incident in which a member of the 
Future Good Boys of America, which is opposed to the gay group on campus, tried 
to push his way into a classroom adjacent to a room where the Student Alliance 
was meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The student alleged that Poff struck him. Police investigated, but no charges 
were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a sense of loss; (the students) have grown so much over the last few 
months. They're among the most decent groups I've worked with," Poff said.

TWO CHARGED IN SEPARATE WORKER'S COMP FRAUD CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Costa Mesa therapist and a former food service worker from Anaheim have been 
charged in unrelated cases of worker's compensation fraud, the Orange County 
district attorney's office announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that Dominic J. Bronell, 47, a marriage, family and child 
counselor, overbilled his patients' worker's compensation insurance companies 
by $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lourdes Romero, 40, a former food service worker for a school Head Start 
program, is accused of collecting $5,300 for a false worker's compensation 
claim she filed, the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Bronell followed a two-year investigation by the state 
Department of Consumer Affairs that began in July, 1991, after a patient 
complained of overbilling. Bronell was charged Wednesday with committing 22 
acts of insurance fraud, including allegations that he billed for services that 
were never performed. 
</P>
<P>
 When reached at his office Thursday night, Bronell said "the charges are 
unfounded." He declined further comment. He is scheduled to be arraigned April 
26. If convicted, Bronell faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and up to $1 
million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second case, Romero was charged March 10 with three counts of fraud for 
allegedly submitting a false claim, then lying to two doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero left her school job in January, 1993, and several weeks later filed for 
worker's compensation benefits, stating that her former job caused her physical 
injuries and stress. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors said Romero began working as a waitress in a restaurant 
shortly after filing the claim. Investigators also alleged that Romero lied to 
two examining physicians, telling them she was not working. 
</P>
<P>
 She faces a maximum of seven years in prison and $150,000 in fines. She could 
not be reached for comment.

CARD CLUB BACKERS TAKING SURVEYS, MAY TURN TO BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of investors whose plan for a $60-million card club failed to get the 
support of the City Council is conducting polls in Anaheim and other Orange 
County cities to determine whether to put its proposal on a ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see what the feeling of the community is," said James Trow, who is 
heading the investment group for the planned 200-table card club and 
entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Trow declined to say where other than Anaheim the group was polling residents. 
He said a decision on whether to pursue a ballot measure will made by 
mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors were initially hesitant about putting the issue before voters 
because of the costs involved with running a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But they changed their plans after being publicly rebuked by the council last 
November. At that time, the investors tried to bypass the voters and persuade 
the council to pass a law that would permit card club casinos in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal was met with criticism from city residents concerned that a 
casino would attract criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Swayed by the public outcry, the council refused to consider the matter. 
Furthermore, the city attorney questioned the legality of the investors' 
proposed law. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's rebuff took the investment group by surprise. For the past 
several months the group has been reviewing its options and meeting with 
community leaders. Several members of the investment group, formerly known as 
Southland Entertainment Properties Inc., have dropped out while others have 
been recruited, Trow said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons the group has not given up on the proposal, Trow said, is 
that it never got an opportunity to adequately discuss the project at a public 
hearing and detail the potential benefits of a card club to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 As presented to the council, the project would be the largest card club in 
Southern California and would include a restaurant, a retail shopping 
concourse, a theater and a corporate convention center. It would be built in 
the industrial area of northeast Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors said the casino would create about 2,200 jobs and could bring 
$11 million a year into city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Fred Hunter, who has long opposed the proposal, said Thursday that 
he believes there is little support in the community for a gambling center.

CHAIN REACTIONS; DEPARTMENT STORE GRANDDADDIES SEARS AND J C PENNEY HAVE SHED 
THEIR DOWDY IMAGES TO COMPETE IN THE STYLISH WOMEN'S APPAREL MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who still remember Sears and JCPenney for their harsh fluorescent 
lighting, tacky mannequins and dated polyester fashions probably haven't 
visited either of the retailing giants in years. Both department store chains 
have changed dramatically -- luring shoppers by putting new emphasis on women's 
apparel. They're attempting to offer trendier styles housed in appealing 
environments. "We are looking to attract those people who have given up on 
Sears because it had a dowdy, polyester, mundane image," says Janice Drummond, 
spokeswoman for Sears, Roebuck & Co. in Chicago. As have Kmart, Target and 
other chains that attract budget-minded clothes buyers, Sears and JC Penney 
have rediscovered the potentially lucrative women's apparel departments. 
</P>
<P>
 With its bank of televisions tuned to MTV, hip post-nuclear decor and racks of 
denim jackets and floral vintage-style dresses, the juniors department at Sears 
in Westminster Mall looks like any trendy young women's clothing store. Much of 
the clothing is the same carried at many juniors retailers, with recognizable 
brand names such as Union Bay and All That Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the aisle, the women's department offers career and sportswear in more 
subdued surroundings. A few tasteful black and white floral etchings hang on 
the walls, and soft lighting illuminates the racks of clothing. Where polyester 
once ruled, now silk blouses, cotton knit tops and rayon separates in neutral 
ethnic prints beckon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 15 years, and I've seen the polyester come and go," says Renee 
Shephard, sales manager for the Westminster Sears women's department. While she 
would like to see a better selection of career wear, she says Sears' fashion 
assortment has come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people are saying, 'Gosh, is Sears carrying this kind of stuff now?' Our 
look is new, and the clothes are new." 
</P>
<P>
 JCPenney in Brea Mall opened about six months ago, one of a growing number of 
stores throughout the chain that have an upscale look to go with their improved 
and expanded fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've increased the square footage for women's clothing, accessories and fine 
jewelry by 50%," says Alan Rogers, store manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Honey maple paneling and soft recessed lighting are found throughout the 
women's department. The floors are marble, and the displays feature understated 
decorator touches such as topiaries and silk flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of mannequins can be found on the entire women's floor. Rogers 
says competitors have been seen snapping photos of two female mannequins 
dressed in career wear who look almost human as they lean over the banister 
above the escalator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like a store to be dramatic but tasteful," Rogers says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although one can still find polyester pants at JCPenney, the emphasis is on 
trendier styles, including rayon and washed silk palazzos, jackets, skirts and 
tunic tops. Updated looks such as short palazzos in an ethnic print of brown, 
gold and purple rayon ($74) and matching long tunic ($94) by A.K.F., a national 
brand, are prominently displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 JCPenney and Sears decided to bolster their women's apparel because they did 
not want to lose their women customers to more fashion-conscious competitors. 
Both retailers are found in malls, and most mall shoppers are women buying 
clothes for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "In analyzing what customers were looking for at the (shopping centers), it 
was apparent they were looking for fashion merchandise. For things like 
automotive, they were going elsewhere," says Marshall Beere, divisional vice 
president and director of merchandising in charge of misses for JCPenney Co. 
Inc. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized if we were going to get our fair share of money being spent on 
(apparel), it was in our best interests to raise the assortment of fashion 
merchandise." 
</P>
<P>
 Sears also feared losing women to other mall shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to attract (women) who shopped in malls but never at Sears," says 
Janice Drummond, spokeswoman for Sears. Those women who were shopping at Sears 
tended to buy things for her husband or children, "but never herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Sears began to revamp its women's apparel in the late '80s. The company added 
new clothing buyers, began ordering apparel closer to the season so the styles 
would be current and established a new fashion office to monitor trends in 
fabric, color and silhouettes. 
</P>
<P>
 But something more was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still felt we were not attracting women who had been turned off" by the 
old Sears, Drummond says. So in September 1993, the company launched an ad 
campaign to call attention to the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "the softer side of Sears," the campaign invites women into the stores 
to see their updated apparel. The ads play off of Sears' traditional strong 
point -- hard-line merchandise such as tools and auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
 One print ad, for example, shows a car battery and reads: "I came in for a 
DieHard." The other half of the ad shows a model in a black evening dress with 
the words, "And I left with something drop dead." The TV ads also make puns, 
discussing garden shears while the camera focuses on hosiery or shock absorbers 
while a woman bounces around in athletic shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the most aggressive ad campaign in Sears history, with costs expected to 
exceed $40 million during the first eight months, Drummond says. Yet Sears 
already believes the investment is paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 For holiday 1993, Sears enjoyed a 13% increase in all merchandise sales from 
the same period in 1992, and the company credits women's apparel for the 
growth. Another sign the investment in apparel will pay off: The apparel 
business made up only 24% of Sears' revenue in 1992, but contributed 61% of the 
stores' profitability, Drummond says. 
</P>
<P>
 For lasting success, however, both retailers will have to satisfy their 
customers' fashion wants. 
</P>
<P>
 JCPenney conducts marketing focus groups and daily interviews with customers 
to figure out what merchandise is working and what isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has a team of brand development managers who "live, breathe and 
eat" fashion, Beere says. They keep on top of trends for Penney's private 
labels such as its career-minded Jacqueline Ferrar and the more casual Hunt 
Club. To do so, they shop all over the world, study designer collections and 
visit specialty fashion stores, Beere says. Penney has also increased its 
selection of national brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers who go to either store for avant-garde, fashion-forward looks might 
be disappointed. While they are updating their fashion images, neither retailer 
would be mistaken for a Barneys or Emporio Armani. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trend-setters, but we're right in there on the fashion 
cutting-edge," Rogers says. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, a few things haven't changed at the giant retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Drummond: "Sears still has garments for women who want elastic waist 
pants."

HE SAID, SHE SAID / PATRICK MOTT AND ANN CONWAY: TAKE US OUT TO THE BALLGAME: 
IF WE DON'T WIN, WE'RE STILL NOT LOSERS

 Y ou can smell it, right? Freshly cut outfield grass. And just the tiniest 
whiff of red clay and neatsfoot oil and horsehide and Ben-Gay. Sugary bubble 
gum and sticky Cracker Jack. Graceful fungoes and lazy sprints into center and 
hot hotdogs and cold cold beer and lovely long afternoons in the sun. The 
greatest show on dirt.  
</P>
<P>
 Wonderful baseball is nearly here. And we're planning to fill our quota of 
seats all season long. We're also planning to look appropriately spiffy while 
doing it. We owe it to Our Team.  
</P>
<P>
 HE: Thank God baseball doesn't attract the shave-your-head-and-paint-it-purple 
crowd until the playoffs. For most of the rest of the season, but particularly 
during the spring, fans get to dress about as comfortably as is humanly 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially at day games, my uniform consists of Levi's, the most garish aloha 
or Acapulco shirt I can get my hands on, a team cap, my trusty Ray-Ban aviators 
and No. 5 sun block. I put on that combination, and I find it impossible not to 
relax. Besides, if you're going to root with the proper abandon -- or, God 
willing, actually snag a foul ball -- you need fairly loose-fitting garments 
that are easily visible by everyone in the stadium (in case they want to cheer 
you when you make that catch). 
</P>
<P>
 I love to go to day games during the week and rag the guys in suits and ties 
who are playing hooky from work. At the same time, I feel sorry for the guys in 
suits and ties at night games. They haven't had time to go home and put on real 
game clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Well, take me out to the ballgame. Please. But forget the rowdy rags. If 
it's a blister of a day, you'll catch me in linen shorts, pristine tennies and 
a cool knit top. If it's a sticky one, you can bet I'll be in a loose cotton 
dress and straw hat. If it's somewhere between, say in the low 80s, I'll 
grandstand it in my favorite sportswear look -- a super lightweight linen suit 
and tank top. 
</P>
<P>
 I hate to see Levi's at baseball games. Football, yes. Our favorite pastime 
deserves a little respect. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Aw, c'mon. What's more American than baseball and Levi's? It's the 
national pastime, not the national cotillion. You have to figure that if you 
behave with the proper abandon during the game, you're going to spill a little 
something on yourself -- mustard, relish, beer, sushi (if it's at the Big A), a 
Cool-a-Coo ice cream sandwich (if it's Dodger Stadium). Levi's (or cotton print 
warm-up pants or khaki shorts, say) can take it. Foo-foo items like linen 
trousers and the kind of cotton slacks you wear to croquet matches can't. Also, 
bizarre, arabesque-like prints (remember the Acapulco shirt?) serve the same 
function as bizarre, arabesque-like carpets: You can spill stuff on them and it 
won't show. 
</P>
<P>
 And I don't want to hear any grousing about my being a slob. You try to grab a 
line drive foul hit into the stands with a lap full of cheesy nachos. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, what about being loyal and wearing the team colors and logo? Think 
it's worth the investment? 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Wait a minute. You're not getting off that easy. For starters, jeans are 
too hot for baseball. Second, they begin to feel like lead when we hit the 14th 
inning and the score is still tied. 
</P>
<P>
 Linen isn't foo-foo; it's fab-fab. It's cool. And it's supposed to be 
wrinkled. I don't have to worry about mustard or relish or melted cheese on my 
lap because I don't jump up every other second like you do. I'm too busy 
checking my lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
 Team colors? Too cute for my taste. But I will go for a team cap. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I actually went for a team jacket a few years ago. A really cool Dodger 
one, the kind that are made of nylon but look like satin. Quilted on the 
inside. A true warm-up jacket, the kind that keeps short relievers' arms warm 
through many late-night innings at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem: Unless there's an incredible cold snap in either April or (we can 
hope) October, the jacket's pretty useless in Southern California. I did wear 
it to a Dodger-Giant game once during a frigid September evening at Candlestick 
Park, but I was nearly stoned. It was a big hit when I wore it on vacation in 
Austria, though. You gotta pick your audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings up a point: Because women tend to get cold more easily than men, 
what would you suggest taking along to a night game as a proper wrap? You can 
have my Dodger jacket if we go anywhere but Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Women get cold more easily than men? Well, hairy men, maybe. In any case, 
I'd don your Dodger jacket in a big chill, but I'd rather slip on a vest under 
my linen blazer and toss a scarf around my neck. Vests are hotter than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: Spectators at sporting events should wear what makes them feel 
good and comfortable. And if they have to wear Levi's, then Levi's it shall be. 
But don't call it fashion. Fashion demands that you take a little time to stand 
out from the herd.

HOT PROPS / THE WORD ON WHAT'S HIP AND WHAT'S HYPE: BACK DRAFT

 It was added only to quell East Coast requests for outerwear. Designer Shane 
Ralston included a long fireman's jacket in the collection for his Long 
Beach-based street wear label, Crime Inc. What he didn't figure is the response 
out west would spread like wildfire. The stiff canvas coat is a hit among 
snowboarders, who dig the hood, quilted lining and water- and wind-resistant 
features, Ralston says. Matte Attack 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with matte lipsticks is their tendency to cake up as well as dry 
your kisser. But rather than giving up on them, an Australian teen created a 
long-lasting, pigment-rich stick with moisturizer. Now Poppy King, 21, is 
getting lip service from hip women and hip stores -- Barneys New York carries 
her line exclusively in the U.S. "Response to the quality of her line has been 
outstanding," says Elizabeth Richardson of the South Coast Plaza Barneys' 
store. That's even with the $16 price tag. "Poppy believes there really isn't 
one right color for a woman. It all depends on her mood." With colors named 
after the Seven Deadly Sins and other character attributes, there should be a 
shade for every occasion. Mad About Plaid 
</P>
<P>
 The apron dress takes on a new meaning for spring -- shorter, flirty and 
flounced. Spot Girl's version in cayenne or black plaid ($54) on ecru is picnic 
perfect. "Our customers can't get enough of plaids," says designer Dana Dartez 
of the Costa Mesa label. Plaids and stripes are featured through the 
collection's mix and mismatch story. The textured fabric fits current tastes 
for natural, raw materials, she adds, as do the handmade coconut shell buttons. 
Kramer Is King 
</P>
<P>
 He's dark, tall and has a knack for swank. He's Kramer, that quirky character 
of TV's "Seinfeld" (and Michael Richards in real life). And, as anyone with a 
trendy teen probably knows by now, his kitschy style is very cool. Local thrift 
shops are being raided for slinky Kramer-style shirts -- usually from the 
synthetic '60s. Store buyers in the know are seeking out newer versions. "It's 
like everyone picked up on it, and that's what (buyers) see," says designer 
Shawn Stussy, who's always done his takes on the look, inspired by his grandpa.

BEHIND THE SCENES: ARMANI NEUTRALIZES BEYOND THE PALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anything got through to the audience of 250 at last week's spring/summer 
presentation at the Emporio Armani store in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, it 
was this: Get a tan. 
</P>
<P>
 One bronzed model after another walked by in clothes from the men's and 
women's collections that were quintessentially Mediterranean -- airy, neutral 
and simple.The basic palette of ecru, wheat, white and black, with only a 
strike of color here and there of brick red, served to deepen the models' 
sun-bathed skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Generous cuts of linen, linen silk and rayon blends, sheer organzas, 
georgettes and chiffons have been shaped into some of the most comfortably 
fluid silhouettes. For her, sheers are layered softly; while his pieces, too, 
are layered, and the juxtaposition of linen with light cotton knits works 
handsomely. 
</P>
<P>
 Armani's hottest shape fits slimmer at the top, flares at the bottom and was 
presented as a suit jacket in both the men's and women's lines and as a sheer 
tunic that could serve as a top or dress in the women's. Another oft-seen 
jacket feature was little or no lapels. 
</P>
<P>
 Tan skin aside, the most marvelous items in the show were the accessories -- 
silk batik scarves around his neck and large circular pendants in bone, 
tortoise or wood around hers; the crochet shawl in natural and black, and, on 
everyone's feet, strappy sandals of leather or jute. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted in part by Elle, the 30-minute parade presented the magazine's choices 
as "Elle Essentials." ROSE APODACA

STYLE FILE: FITTING FIXES FOR WOMEN WITH SPINAL DISORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spinal disorders such as osteoporosis and scoliosis create image as well as 
health concerns. To help address appearance concerns, the staff of the 
Fullerton Internal Medicine Center presented a fashion show at the Brea Embassy 
Suites on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Modeling summer outfits from The Broadway were women who have osteoporosis or 
scoliosis. Their male escorts were members of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The two spinal conditions often change body shape in ways that can make it 
more difficult to choose clothing that fits well. Fractures, a result of 
osteoporosis, curve the spine, reduce height and distort posture. Ribs sink 
into the pelvis; the stomach protrudes, and the head is drawn forward. 
Experiencing similar body changes are adults with scoliosis, who may have 
rounded shoulders, a prominent shoulder blade and one hip higher than the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 These physical changes can make clothes ride up the back, fit poorly at the 
neck and shorten the look of the waist. However, certain styles, fabrics and 
alterations can help minimize these problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts at "Fashionable Fixes for Osteoporosis" said long, lean lines appear 
to straighten curves and give a sense of height. And flowing fabrics (wool, 
silk, crepe, rayon) don't cling to the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Other designer solutions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Neckline: Wear a high collar that hugs the neck, such as a mock turtleneck. 
The classic crew neckline works if two well-placed darts close any gaping 
material in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 * Protruding stomach: Straight, loose dresses with drop waists conceal the 
stomach. Blouses and jackets should not be fitted and should be long enough to 
cover hips. Double-breasted styles flatten the roundness and loose, 
unconstructed styles conceal imperfections. Pleated skirts and pants expand 
comfortably around the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spine: Wear something that draws the eye away from the curve. Pleats above 
the waist make a person look taller. Darts above the shoulder blades close the 
neck and open the back to accommodate a curve. A dress with a short attached 
cape or a waist-length cape with a plain, crew-necked dress is elegant night or 
day.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; WEST REGIONAL / AT OGDEN, UTAH; 
HAWAII'S STAY IS SHORT, NOT TOO SWEET IN LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They came, they were seen, they went home. If you're the Rainbows of Hawaii, 
it's not a bad bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Making their first NCAA tournament appearance since 1972, the Rainbows led 
fourth seeded Syracuse at the half, 44-41, before succumbing, 92-78. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii's senior guard Trevor Ruffin carried his teammates through a first half 
when he made four three-pointers and scored 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished with 24 points and the respect of the more famous Orangemen, who 
came over to shake his hand at the end of the game. Lawrence Moten, the 
Syracuse star, gave him a deep bow in salute. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hit some tough shots," Moten said. "I mean, deep!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was the end of a fairy tale for Hawaii, which started the season 0-4, 
losing by an average of 33 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The first loss was by 100-47 to Portland, the university, not the Trail 
Blazers. This was followed by a 78-49 whacking at the hands of Wake Forest, an 
83-48 loss to North Carolina State and a 92-77 defeat by North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainbows were 15-14 when they rose to win the Western Athletic Conference 
tournament, upsetting Brigham Young in Salt Lake City last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri 76, Navy 53 -- Having seen his Tigers booted out in the first round 
in six of its last eight tournament appearances, Norm Stewart was in no mood to 
mess around. 
</P>
<P>
 With Missouri, seeded No. 1 in the West, trailing No. 16 Navy, 20-19, he 
yanked his starters for the last five minutes of the half and played the last 
five subs. 
</P>
<P>
 The reserves put on a 9-6 run to put Missouri ahead at halftime. The regulars 
returned in the second half and put the Midshipmen to the torch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted them (his starters) to see if they could do what the other team 
did," Stewart said. "That was make an effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart also pulled out a piece of paper at the postgame news conference and 
read all the names of the first-round games Missouri had won. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin 80, Cincinnati 72 -- Michael Finley scored 22 points including two 
key three-point plays in the second half as the Badgers, making their first 
appearance, blew a 12-point lead but held off the tenacious Bearcats. Rashard 
Griffith, Wisconsin's 6-foot-11 freshman center, had 22 points and 15 rebounds.

O.C. JOBS RECOUNT MAKES RECESSION LESS DEPRESSING; EMPLOYMENT: STATE'S REVISED 
METHODS 'FIND' 15,000 MORE ON PAYROLLS THAN OLD FIGURES, MEANING SLUMP HASN'T 
BEEN QUITE SO SEVERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though the past three years were California's deepest and longest recession 
since the Great Depression, state employment officials say that the slump 
wasn't quite as bad as they had thought earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Using newly revised employment counting methods, the state Employment 
Development Department said Thursday it has "found" 15,000 jobs in Orange 
County that it thought had disappeared from local payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Total employment in Orange County for 1993, according to the report, fell just 
0.8% to 1,117,300 jobs from 1,126,000 in 1992 -- a net loss of 8,700 jobs for 
the year and 55,100 since the recession began. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the recount, the EDD had reported 1992 employment at 1,122,400 jobs and 
1993 employment at 1,106,700 jobs -- a loss of 15,700 jobs in one year and 
65,700 since the start of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the "new" jobs -- which EDD officials say were there all along but 
just weren't counted in past surveys -- are in service industries, particularly 
in health care, engineering and management and business services such as law, 
accounting and consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing, which was losing jobs even before the recession began, ended 
1993 with 205,900 workers in Orange County, down from 243,700 at the start of 
the recession. But that was 1,200 fewer jobs lost than earlier reports had 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty good news," said Eleanor Jordan, state labor market analyst for 
Orange County. "The recession here wasn't as bad as we thought." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new numbers aren't good enough to change economists' predictions that 
the recovery is going to proceed slowly this year and not pick up much momentum 
until mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average Joe still won't see much improvement" this year, said Adrian 
Sanchez, regional economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Orange County picture is brighter, Los Angeles County actually has 
lost more jobs than had been reported earlier. The new tally shows almost 
13,000 fewer jobs in 1992 than originally counted, putting Los Angeles' job 
loss in the recession at 420,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The state publishes monthly job tallies, by industry, for each county. Every 
March, the previous two years' numbers are revised under federal guidelines. 
And this year, federal Bureau of Labor Statistics officials say, the 
methodology was improved so that it includes positions that were ignored in 
previous tallies. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes have been significant. Before the 1992 job count for Orange County 
was revised a year ago, preliminary numbers showed that employers here had 
slashed about 80,000 jobs from their payrolls in just 30 months. After last 
March's revision, the figure dropped to 65,000 lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they're down to 55,000" jobs cut over a 42-month period, said economist 
Esmael Adibi, director of the Chapman University Center for Economic Research. 
"But it doesn't really change what we've been saying -- that we hit the bottom 
of the recession in 1993 and that we will show slight but positive job growth 
by the last half of 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Adibi, who prepares long-range economic outlook reports for the Orange-based 
private university, said such predictions may seem to be based on ever-shifting 
employment numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the changes are rarely of such magnitude as to require wholesale 
abandonment of forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said last year that all the signs we were seeing showed that it was going 
to be a better year than the EDD was reporting," Adibi said. "This new report 
backs us up." Jobs Picture Better Than Expected The number of jobs in Orange 
County is still below the peak reached in 1990, but the final 1993 numbers are 
higher than earlier estimates. The number of non-military, non-agricultural 
jobs and annual average unemployment rate in Orange County: Number of jobs 
1983: 876,717 1993: 1,117,325 Unemployment rate 1983: 7.08% 1993: 6.28 Source:

 Chrysler's Top Executives Reaped Handsome Rewards: Robert J. Eaton says 
Chrysler Corp. is a fun place to work.And a lucrative place, he might add. 
Eaton earned $9.3 million in 1993 as Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, 
the company disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
And he wasn't Chrysler's highest-paid executive. President Robert L. Lutz 
collected $9.7 million, thanks largely to $6 million in stock options. 
Chrysler's next three highest executives together collected $12 million, 
including salaries, bonuses, stock options and other compensation. The company 
said the whopping executive compensation packages reflect Chrysler's strong 
performance in 1993 -- record sales and operating profit and vast improvements 
in quality, customer satisfaction and market share.

BALDWIN BUILDERS DISMISSES IRVINE CONSTRUCTION EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Fleming is the latest Baldwin Builders executive to leave the Newport 
Beach home builder. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five months, all three of Baldwin's division presidents have 
either resigned or been terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming, who joined the company in 1987, was removed from his job as executive 
vice president of construction in Irvine on March 10. During his tenure he had 
overseen construction of more than 1,000 homes in Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 "We just laid him off because we're eliminating his position," Al Baldwin, 
company president, said Thursday. "This has nothing to do with the others; it's 
completely independent." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert B. Burns, the former head of Baldwin's Los Angeles-Ventura division, 
filed a $35-million breach of contract and fraud suit on Jan. 25 against the 
company and its owners, James and Al Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, filed after he resigned, Burns alleged that the Baldwin brothers 
made oral assurances that he was a 10% partner in all company projects in his 
division but failed to disclose that agreement to investors in a $155-million 
bond offering last year. If that were true, bondholders could raise questions 
about whether the company violated federal disclosure rules. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, in his first public comment on Burns' lawsuit, Al Baldwin said it 
was "completely without merit and untrue." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a management team that's very strong in home building," Baldwin said. 
"Our bondholders are not concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Orange County Division President Geoff Fearns, who resigned from the 
company in November, has filed an arbitration action against Baldwin charging 
breach of contract, forced resignation and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Another executive, former San Diego Division President Greg Smith, was 
terminated by the company, according to Burns' suit.

CHAIRMAN OF BROOKE GROUP SETTLES SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tobacco conglomerate Brooke Group Ltd. said Thursday that its chairman, 
Bennett S. LeBow, has repaid the company $16 million in loans and, in 
settlement of a shareholder suit, waived his right to receive $6.25 million of 
preferred dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Another company controlled by LeBow, BGLS Inc., controls about half the stock 
of MAI Systems Corp., an Irvine-based company that creates business software 
that runs on a variety of computer workstations. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Brooke Group settlement, LeBow also agreed to a 25% cap on his 
salary increases over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed that his salary will not rise more than 10% a year for the next four 
years, unless Brooke Group's common shares rise more than 10%. LeBow owns 56% 
of Brooke Group's common shares and 95% of its preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, LeBow has agreed to repay a $3-million lien that Brooke Group has 
against company securities that he owns. 
</P>

 Brooke Group shareholder Frank Gyetvan sued LeBow and other Brooke officers in 
May, 1993, in the Chancery Court of Delaware -- where Brooke is incorporated -- 
claiming Brooke Group or its subsidiary, BGLS Inc., had improperly lent money 
to LeBow and other directors of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also claimed LeBow improperly benefited when Brooke Group bought 
another subsidiary, Brooke Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 A company statement said LeBow, with approval of the plaintiff's attorneys, 
has already repaid more than $16 million in principal and interest obligations 
owed to Brooke or its BGLS Inc. subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooke Group said through a spokesman that the $16 million in loan repayment 
was not a condition of settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 As of April 1, 1993, LeBow's 1993 annual base salary was set at $950,000 with 
a minimum bonus of $475,000, plus an additional bonus, if he agreed to forgo 
certain benefits, of about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The $16 million in loan repayment and the $3 million to retire the lien came 
from money that LeBow had coming in preferred dividends. After waiving his 
right to $6.25 million of dividends, LeBow will keep the remaining $3.75 
million of dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooke Group Ltd. is primarily a tobacco company, through its Liggett Group 
Inc. and Liggett-Ducat J.S.C. subsidiaries. It also has a significant real 
estate development business and holds investments in other businesses, such as 
New Valley Corp. and MAI Systems.

ASBESTOS REMOVAL FIRM FINED $15,000 BY EPA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CST Environmental Inc. has agreed to pay a $15,000 penalty to settle a federal 
complaint that it used an untrained worker to help remove asbestos from a Los 
Angeles elementary school 20 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim company did not acknowledge liability in settling the action 
brought by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.The EPA brought its action 
under a federal law requiring contractors who remove asbestos from schools to 
ensure that their workers are accredited by state or federal environmental 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 David McFadden, the EPA's assistant regional counsel in San Francisco, said 
the fraudulently certified worker did not cause any harm to the environment 
while working at Malabar Street Elementary School in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Sage Khara, owner of the privately held firm, said that the worker was 
certified in Nevada and that the institution he allegedly attended verified his 
training there. It later turned out that the training school was wrong.

CHAIRMAN CARL'S BACK -- MUCH TO DELIGHT OF EMPLOYEES; FAST FOOD: CARL'S JR. 
FOUNDER IS WARMLY GREETED ON HIS RETURN TO HIS ANAHEIM OFFICE, ALBEIT IN A NEW 
ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After six months of corporate upheaval, Carl N. Karcher on Thursday returned 
to his office at the fast-food empire he founded half a century ago -- by the 
back door. 
</P>
<P>
 While he is warmly greeted everywhere he goes, the 76-year-old Karcher -- who 
usually comes in through the rear entrance -- said he has avoided direct 
contact with the headquarters staff given the animosity that accompanied his 
ouster as chairman last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a while for people to feel they can talk to Carl," said 
Karcher, who now carries the title of chairman emeritus. "What happened to me 
-- it's not easy to swallow that bitter pill." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, for that matter, his pride. A year ago, Karcher was majority stockholder 
and television pitchman for the 649-unit Carl's Jr. hamburger chain that he had 
built from a single hot dog cart in central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He met popes and presidents, won dozens of industry awards and was firmly 
ensconced in that pantheon of local legends reserved for the likes of Gene 
Autry and Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came his involvement in a failed bid to buy back his company, the 
publicly owned Carl Karcher Enterprises. It was followed by public revelations 
that his personal finances had been racked by bad real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven to the brink of bankruptcy, Karcher was ousted as chairman last October 
after the board of directors balked at his plan to boost sales at some 
restaurants by testing Mexican-style items from the Green Burrito chain, also 
of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Restructuring and paying off about $60 million in secured debt shrank 
Karcher's stake in the company from more than 35% to about 12%. His lawyer, 
Andy Puzder, said negotiations are continuing with unsecured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are reasonable, things will be fine. If they are unreasonable, Carl 
could still face a bankruptcy," Puzder said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 An investor group friendly to Karcher now controls the company, leading to an 
apparent truce and Karcher's reinstatement as chairman emeritus under a deal 
reached March 7. The new role limits his direct control while still allowing 
the company to count on his sage advice and outstretched hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his troubles are taking their toll, Karcher on Thursday seemed much 
like his old self. He wore a bright green tie for St. Patrick's Day, noting 
that it clashed with his dark blue pin-striped suit. He was bubbly and 
enthusiastic, clicking off a busy schedule ranging from appearances on a 
Christian cable television network to a restaurant visit in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very thankful. Everything is OK. I'm going to work here, and visit units, 
and support the management team 100%," Karcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he was a little too bubbly, invoking a sort of self-censorship when 
he caught himself straying into talk that might offend the new brass. "Quiet, 
quiet, quiet, quiet," he muttered at one point before lawyer Puzder, sitting at 
his side, could intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher said he is looking forward to showing up at his office five days a 
week, getting there at his usual 7 a.m. start time after attending Mass and 
poring over the morning papers. 
</P>
<P>
 His grandly appointed office is in the same shape he left it, right down to 
the gleaming pewter finish of the model hot dog cart that sits on a walnut 
coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
 Familiar surroundings? Yes. But Karcher would be the first to admit that 
things still seem a little, well, strange after the half-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking things kind of slow," he acknowledged. "I've been gone six months 
and that's a long time after you have spent 52 years here." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Karcher has not lost is his instincts as a restaurateur. After 
walking to an adjoining Carl's Jr. restaurant in the Anaheim complex that was 
once his father-in-law's orange groves, Karcher is quick to grab an empty soda 
cup left on a windowsill and point out the smudge marks on the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell Steve to tuck his shirttail in," he tells a manager, later saying that 
cleanliness and attention to detail "are the nuts and bolts of this industry." 
</P>
<P>
 In the kitchen, Karcher walked around and inquired, "How many years?" of every 
employee he encountered, his trademark greeting to encourage them to stay on 
the job. Two, three, six, some declared, but the clear winner was Rita Rea, who 
logged in 11 years as a cook. She gave the grandfatherly man a big hug and 
declared, "That's my Pops!"  
</P>
<P>
 Back at headquarters, Karcher did not get hugs, but was greeted warmly by 
16-year receptionist Rosemary Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been lots of changes and the best is having you back," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher smiled.

ROCKWELL UNITS GET TRAIN, AVIATION CONTRACTS; ELECTRONICS: DIVISIONS WILL HELP 
DEVELOP HIGH-SPEED RAIL SYSTEMS AND FLIGHT AND NAVIGATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES. 
</P>

 Rockwell International Corp. said Thursday that two of its units have signed 
separate contracts to help other companies build high-speed trains for Amtrak 
and to develop navigation and avionics systems for the world's aviation 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell's Railroad Electronics division agreed to be a subcontractor in one 
of several bids to build high-speed trains for Amtrak.It would supply complete 
electronic systems for power units built by Siemens Transportation Systems Inc. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Siemens is one of six companies that Amtrak pre-qualified last October to bid 
as general contractor for the high-speed train project, which is designed to 
supply 26 passenger trains mainly in the Northeast. Amtrak is expected to award 
the contract, worth $450 million to $500 million, later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, based in Seal Beach, already supplies cab electronics systems for 
locomotives manufactured by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Rockwell signed a memorandum of agreement with Deutsche Aerospace 
AG in Munich, Germany, a unit of Daimler Benz AG, to form a joint venture to 
develop avionics systems and to market key aviation technologies, such as 
satellite-based navigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell's Collins Commercial Avionics unit and Deutsche Aerospace's Radar and 
Radio Systems division would form a new company to be based in Ulm, Germany. 
The company will be named later this year after the joint venture is created. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell hopes the partnership will enable it to expand its satellite 
navigation capabilities for aircraft and helicopters to growing markets in 
Europe and the former Soviet Union states like Russia.

HOME SALES JUMP 34% -- BIGGEST RISE SINCE 1988; REAL ESTATE: INCREASE IS IN 
COMPARISON TO SAME MONTH LAST YEAR, A SIGNAL THAT THE INDUSTRY MAY BE 
RECOVERING. 
</P>

<P>
 In another strong signal that the local home building industry is recovering, 
sales of new and existing homes in Orange County jumped 34.2% during February 
compared to the same month last year, TRW Redi Property Data reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase was the biggest year-to-year monthly rise since November, 1988, 
when home sales were up 42.8%, the real estate information service said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though monthly sales figures don't necessarily indicate a trend, the February 
increase came on the heels of very strong results for January, when local home 
sales increased 26.6% from the previous year. "Since this is a continuation of 
what we've seen the last couple of months, I would say it bodes well for the 
industry as a whole," said Nima Nattagh(, market analyst for TRW Redi at its 
Riverside headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month 2,286 home sales closed in Orange County, compared to 1,704 
transactions in February, 1993. For the six counties that make up the Southern 
California region, home sales increased 15.3%, with Orange County posting the 
biggest gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a validation that the Orange County market has turned the corner," 
said John Shumway, president of Market Profiles, a real estate consulting firm 
in Costa Mesa. "This is very strong evidence that we're setting a foundation 
for recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumway said the sales figures hold a message for prospective homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are interested in buying, housing inventories are at rock bottom, and 
interest rates are starting to creep up," Shumway said. "So there is the 
possibility that home prices are going to start to increase by the end of the 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Home sales were up in every Southern California county during February, with 
Ventura showing the smallest gain at 8%. TRW said that was probably a result of 
January's Northridge earthquake, which appeared to have a dampening effect on 
the number of home sales that closed. Orange County Home Sales 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of new and existing homes in Orange County increased by more than 34% in 
February over last year's level. The average price dropped 0.4% during the same 
period. Home prices throughout Southern California were up more than 15.3%, and 
Orange County posted the biggest gain. 06,26,07,07,12,07,12 *2*FEBRUARY, 1993

BRIEFCASE: LABOR; WRITING SKILLS ARE NOT THE STRENGTH OF JOB APPLICANTS IN 
O.C., SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 People who apply for a job in Orange County don't always write terribly well, 
a new survey says. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the employers who were questioned said their job applicants 
tend to be pretty good at using computers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's according to Thomas Temporaries, a temp firm that recently had 1,200 
Southern California companies surveyed. Two hundred of the companies were in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the survey found, companies all over Southern California had bad 
things to say about workers' writing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of them said job applicants' writing was below average or 
unsatisfactory. In Orange County, even more were unhappy with workers' writing 
skills -- about 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1980s," said Gene C. Wilson, Thomas Temporaries president, "there was 
a big push for employees to learn to use personal computers and basic office 
software, including word-processing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," he said, "it appears that employers are concerned with how well the 
material is written." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest bloc of Orange County employers -- 27% -- rated the computer 
skills of their job applicants as above average or exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter said telephone skills were above average or exceptional. Verbal 
skills were so rated by 18%. 
</P>
<P>
 But only 9% of the employers gave high marks to writing. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found that little more than a quarter of the Orange County 
companies train managers to deal with multiracial and multicultural work 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 That, incidentally, was well below the estimate for Southern California as a 
whole -- 38%.

 The survey did not attempt to explain why Orange County -- which has 
relatively few African Americans but many Latinos and Asians -- should lag the 
rest of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 But that may change, the survey said, because employers who train managers in 
leading diverse work forces give them a "competitive edge."

 Crime Does Not Pay but Law Does: Who gets the best pay in Orange County -- 
lawyers, engineers or accountants? 
</P>
<P>
 If you guessed lawyers, you're right.According to the federal Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, the most highly skilled and experienced engineers earn a mean 
weekly salary of $1,270 in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 For accountants, it's $1,234 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 But for lawyers, it's $1,676. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember, that's mean -- it's an average of all the law firms and lawyers 
surveyed, many of whom make much more. 
</P>
<P>
 In administrative jobs, the federal government found, budget analysts made 
$1,013 a week. The most skilled computer systems analysts earned $984. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the figures from last year, the latest available. The federal Labor 
Department surveys each metro area in the country once a year. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast to the professionals, the most experienced cops in Orange County 
make a mean paycheck of $922 a week, the federal government found, while 
firefighters receive $1,012 and prison and jail guards $722. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bottom of the rung in the survey, security guards made a mean $10.63 an 
hour, or $425.20 for a 40-hour week.

LAS VEGAS CONVERSIONS PAYING OFF IN BIG SALES AT DEL TACO RESTAURANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Del Taco Inc. said Thursday that it has converted seven former Naugles 
restaurants in Las Vegas into Del Tacos, and seen big sales increases as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversion was completed in January, said Paul Hitzelberger, executive 
vice president of the Orange-based chain of Mexican-style fast-food 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Naugles, the restaurants had sales volumes roughly equal to those in 
Del Taco's core Southern California market. He said that since the change, the 
restaurants saw sales increases ranging from 70% to 180% compared to the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a complete exterior remodel that reflects much of what the logo 
signifies, which is a fun, festive celebration, the start of a new day at Del 
Taco with the sun coming up over the mountain," Hitzelberger said.

INGRAM MICRO GETS AID FROM N.Y. TO EXPAND EAST COAST OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ingram Micro Inc. said Wednesday that it has won a $1.8-million aid package 
from New York state to help the company pay for a $9-million expansion of its 
Eastern operations center outside Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who joined corporate executives at Ingram's plant 
in Amherst, N.Y., to announce the aid package, said that Ingram's decision to 
expand its current facility rather than move to another state shows that the 
state's efforts to attract and keep businesses are working. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 600 new jobs are expected to be created over the next three years as 
Ingram adds 90,000 square feet of office space to its existing 
50,000-square-foot structure. The company expects to break ground for 
construction within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana-based company, the world's largest distributor of microcomputer 
products, needs additional space on the East Coast to accommodate its 
continuing growth. It had been looking at several states in which to erect a 
new facility.

OSCAR BROWN JR. CARRIES MANY TUNES; INFLUENCE OF SHAKESPEAREAN SONNETS, BLACK 
POETRY BLEND IN WORK OF SINGER/SONGWRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar Brown Jr.'s best known lyric, the words he put to Miles Davis' tune "All 
Blues," were written in an airplane.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was flying out of Los Angeles and the plane was blue, the seats in the 
plane were blue, the sky was blue, the whole thing was blue," Brown explained 
in a phone conversation from his home in Inglewood. "So it all came to me while 
taking off from LAX." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Brown, who sings tonight at Birdland West in Long Beach, was a 
neighbor of Davis' in New York. "His wife (Betty) and mine were good friends. 
We weren't especially close, but I did hang out at his place a couple of 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1962 when Brown put words to Davis' tune from the trend-setting "Kind 
of Blue" album. The singer had been in L.A. to play as Davis' opening act. 
</P>
<P>
 "But after two nights, they made Miles the opening act," he said. "Miles was 
being cool, kind of ignoring the audience, doing his act. So, in a way, he got 
what he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Brown has written dozens of his own tunes, often with socially 
relevant themes, as well as supplying lyrics for such standards as Nat 
Adderley's "Work Song," which became a minor hit for the singer-songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 He was visible in the early '60s as the host of the television series "Jazz 
Scene USA," where he welcomed such guests as Lou Rawls, Stan Kenton, Al Hirt 
and the Jazz Crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But surprisingly, Brown, now 67, didn't begin to pursue his career as a 
singer-songwriter until well into his 30s. Born in Chicago, his father, Oscar 
Brown Sr., wanted his son to follow in his footsteps and become a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a political activist and president of the NAACP in Chicago at one 
point," Brown said. "He gave me political direction and the exposure to such 
figures as W.E.B. DuBois and Paul Robeson. But I disappointed him to a certain 
extent. He had a monumental redemptive love; if I flunked out of school, he 
gave me another chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad grades contributed to Brown's change in career goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I flunked everything in college my first year except composition, and in that 
I got an A-plus. I was inclined to poetry, it was something of a gift. So I 
changed my major to English." 
</P>
<P>
 "I admired Shakespeare, even though originally it had been forced on me, but I 
was influenced by the sonnets. That was a form I liked. And I read Keats, 
Shelley, Robert Burns, Edgar Allan Poe. Then I discovered the black poets, like 
Langston Hughes, and got a lot of direction and inspiration from them." 
</P>
<P>
 Out of college, Brown put his elocution skills to work by acting and working 
in radio. In the late '40s, he was the anchor for one of Chicago's first black 
newscasts, "Negro Newsfront." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "I moved around the dial to different stations, always getting kicked off the 
air eventually," he said. "I was kind of radical in my editorial reviews. The 
biggest hassle came when I accused a major chemical company of being a war 
profiteer. The station began insisting to see my editorials before they were 
read. They had me censored." 
</P>
<P>
 He served in the Army in the mid-'50s and worked in real estate briefly after. 
But songwriting kept rearing its head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was constantly writing songs, lullabies, torch tunes. It was a hobby. But 
it was like what Moliere said about prostitution: First, you do it for love, 
then for a few friends and finally for money. That's the way it developed for 
me: bit by bit." 
</P>
<P>
 His first recorded song, "Brown Baby," written for his son, was sung by 
Mahalia Jackson. Over the years, he has composed a large body of work and has 
put words to such jazz standards as Bobby Timmons' "Dat Dere" and Les McCann's 
"So Help Me." 
</P>
<P>
 His career as a vocalist developed more suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect to become a singer. But I got a record contract (with 
Columbia in 1960); the company asked me to do a personal performance and that 
was it," he said. "I had entertained some in the service, and always longed to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 That first performance, after a few warm-up appearances in Chicago, was at New 
York's landmark Village Vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in 1960, Brown contributed, somewhat unwittingly, to Max Roach's project 
"We Insist! Freedom Now," an effort that melded the civil-rights struggle of 
the period with the rebelliousness of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote that material originally for a larger project, a musical chronology 
of Afro-American history, that began in Africa and moved through Freedom Day 
and all those things. Max (Roach) actually cannibalized that project. I was 
given credit on the disc, but no cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has since appeared on the same bill with Roach, and the two, who had 
been introduced by singer Abbey Lincoln, are friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The songwriter says that he has been unusually productive since the recent 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shook loose a couple of dozen songs. I've written more in the last eight 
weeks than in any other period of my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's hoping that some of these tunes will come together in a recording that 
will be "like a mural of L.A., a musical documentary of the city. With all the 
heavy hits we've taken lately, it just seems the thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a reflection of Brown's interest in the social fabric of his adopted 
hometown, one of the tunes is titled "Can We All Just Get Along?" 
</P>
