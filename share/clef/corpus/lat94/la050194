 Anyone who went to high school on the college preparatory track in the '50s or 
'60s should feel grateful to A.J. Langguth. In one fast moving, lucid and 
dramatic book, he has told the story of those Romans we found so baffling in 
our teens: Caesar, whose "Commentaries on the Gallic Wars," with their graphic 
descriptions of siege warfare and the extermination of prisoners, bored us in 
Latin 2; Cicero, whose mellifluous speeches against Verres and Catiline 
tormented us in Latin 3; Brutus, Marc Antony and all the other noble Romans 
whom we met assembled over the protagonist's body in Shakespeare's "Julius 
Caesar" (English 3). What we encountered as difficult texts, that had to be 
unscrambled, word by word and line by line, he has turned into events to think 
about and flesh-and-blood people to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Langguth's theme is one of the most dramatic ones in world history. Like many 
historians before him, he tells the story of how the Roman republic collapsed, 
to be replaced by the empire of Augustus and his successors. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in the early years of the first century B.C., with the dictatorship 
of Sulla, he brings his chief actors on stage at once. Caesar, the hard-eyed 
young aristocrat who refused to divorce his wife Cornelia at Sulla's command, 
comes first. He is flanked, here and throughout, by his two great rivals: 
Cicero, the "new man" from Arpinum whose schooling in Greek literature and 
brilliance as a public speaker made him a powerful political figure even though 
he lacked the military virtues Romans esteemed most, and Pompey, the ambitious 
young soldier who slaughtered lions and elephants, as well as men, in Libya, to 
instill fear of Rome, but wept when his men threatened to mutiny in order to 
defend him. 
</P>
<P>
 All three reached manhood in a time of crisis. The social and economic changes 
that accompanied Rome's expansion through the Mediterranean world and beyond 
had strained its political system and corrupted its public life. Appeals to 
ancient virtue and republican tradition sounded hollow to frightened 
aristocrats and embittered commoners alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Some leaders -- such as the Gracchi and Marius, Caesar's uncle Marius -- 
looked for support among the disenfranchised, promising to find them land, 
relief from debts and citizenship. Others -- such as Sulla -- sided with the 
patricians and the privileged, when they promised to defend against the mob. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides treated politics as an extension of war by other means. Enemies 
were attacked by legal and illegal means, their lands and goods confiscated, 
their heads stuck up on spears in the forum. Military command took on more and 
more political importance, as volunteer soldiers gave their prime loyalty to 
the general who led and paid them -- and promised a rich payoff at the end of a 
major campaign -- rather than to the Roman state. Fear spread that Rome might 
undergo some unheard of disaster; that the ancient republic, with of tradition, 
its virtues from the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this background Langguth lets the careers of his three protagonists 
unroll. Like a skilled weaver, he makes all three lives and fates -- along with 
those of wives and relatives, friends and supporters -- into a colorful and 
coherent tapestry. He follows the stunning rise of Caesar, showing how the 
young man whose best-known qualities were his sexual virtuosity and compliance 
became a ruthless military leader, one who shrank from no necessary measure, 
from torching the great city of Alexandria to executing or enslaving whole 
Gaulish nations who ventured to defend their own territories. 
</P>
<P>
 He traces Cicero's political and rhetorical achievements, laying out the 
political background to the speeches we read in school as examples of fine 
Latin and exposing the personal motives that often inspired Cicero's lofty, 
passionate arguments. And he describes -- this time without the aid of personal 
testimony -- Pompey's equally colorful adventures as general, master builder, 
impresario of spectacles and manipulator of the law, whose courage expressed 
itself in grand gestures like his disbanding of his own army before returning 
to Rome in 62 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way we meet other fascinating figures: Crassus, the legendary rich 
general who met his death in Parthia, where his enemies made his corpse drink 
molten gold; Cato, the most upright Roman of them all, who defied a gang of 
gladiators, unarmed, to denounce his enemy Nepos in the Forum and eventually 
committed suicide by tearing out his intestines with his own hands to avoid 
capture and humiliation; and of course Antony and Brutus. 
</P>
<P>
 The story rises to at least points of climax. A first took place in 63 and 62 
B.C., when Cicero, serving as consul, confronted Catiline, who tried to win 
political power as the leader of a coalition of young aristocrats and the poor, 
the bankrupt and the discontented of Italy. Cicero accused Catiline of plotting 
to slaughter his enemies and seize power. In the teeth of Caesar's efforts to 
bring about a compromise, he isolated his enemy and forced him into an active 
rebellion that ended with his death in battle -- only to find himself subjected 
to sharp criticism for his savagery with his enemies and outflanked by 
opponents who saw more clearly than he the need to recognize the grievances of 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 A second was reached in the '50s, when the triumvirate of Caesar, Pompey and 
Crassus held power in an uneasy balance, and Caesar's program of political 
reform and military confrontation with the Gauls carried all before it, forcing 
even Cicero to compromise with his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 The third -- and most dramatic -- one fell in the '40s, when open conflict 
broke out between Pompey and Caesar. Pompey, defeated after some striking early 
successes, fled to Egypt, where he was murdered. Caesar, after defeating all 
enemies in Gaul, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa, returned to Rome, held a 
spectacular series of triumphs, paid off his army and reformed everything from 
the calendar to the law courts -- but found himself confronted on the Ides of 
March by a ring of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius, who feared that he 
planned to make himself Rome's first king in centuries even though he had 
refused the title, and killed him brutally. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar's death did his enemies little good. His great-nephew Octavian, young, 
efficient, and often merciless, fought and defeated Caesar's killers, Brutus 
and Cassius. Then he dealt with his sometime ally Marc Antony. Stately 
suicides, long celebrated by historians, poets and painters, removed Brutus, 
Antony and Cleopatra from the stage. Cicero died too, at the hands of soldiers 
sent by Antony, whom he had denounced in fiery speeches, his Phillipics. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of searing tension and outbreaks of civil war, the republic was as 
dead as its statesmen. The political field lay open to Octavian, who would in 
time make himself Augustus, the first Roman emperor, and transform Rome itself 
into the marble maze of wonders whose ruins still inspire awe. 
</P>
<P>
 Langguth tells the story with efficiency and dispatch, scattering much 
fascinating information along the way about everything from food to religion in 
late Republican Rome. A number of small mistakes don't seriously mar his 
achievement as narrator. Yet the book does not fully live up to the demands of 
its imposing, terrible theme. Langguth's prose -- though clear and correct -- 
is flat, lacking color and studded with stale words and phrases. He fails to 
bring his main characters to life -- much less the fantastic city they fought 
for, with its toppling apartment buildings, crowded as modern Hong Kong, its 
elaborate and sometimes bizarre public rituals, and its ancient stones stained 
with the blood of executed enemies of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 More seriously still, Langguth flattens out his protagonists' minds. Ever 
attentive to the pragmatic and the momentary, he misses the real commitments to 
traditional Roman images and institutions and new Greek images and symbols that 
sometimes inspired not only Caesar and Cicero, but Octavian as well. His 
accounts of the tormented idealists Cato and Brutus are particularly leaden, 
and his Cicero comes off as vain, skittish and a terminal ditherer (true, he 
was all of those things; but he was also far more). Langguth, in other words, 
tells only one side of a complex story, emphasizing practical needs and 
immediate desires rather than the symbols for which -- as we know all too well 
-- men are even likelier to kill than they are for money and power. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a great book, this; but a quick-paced, useful overview of a great subject. 
It kept my attention in hard chairs and on bouncy buses, in the course of a 
vacation in rural Greece. And it's a godsend to those of us who have wondered 
ever since 10th grade what really made Cicero so upset with Catiline, if Caesar 
really said "Et tu, Brute?" to his killer, and how Caesar, Cicero, Pompey and 
Brutus all managed to play parts in one great, coherent drama.

RICHARD EDER: POEMS BURNED INTO MEMORY; THE AKHMATOVA JOURNALS: VOLUME I, 
1938-1941, BY LYDIA CHUKOVSKAYA TRANSLATED BY MILENA MICHALSKI AND SYLVA 
RUBASHOVA SELECTIONS FROM AKHMATOVA'S POETRY TRANSLATED BY PETER NORMAN (FARRAR 
STRAUS & GIROUX: $27.50; 310 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was 1940, in Leningrad. Through the communal kitchen, strung with wet 
laundry, and past cramped quarters housing her former husband, another of his 
former wives and assorted relatives, Anna Andreevna Akhmatova sat with two 
friends in her unswept room, cluttered with broken furniture and a few 
mementos. In a whisper she recited part of her just-finished "Requiem," the 
epic poem that charts the flood-water devastation of Stalin's terror. 
</P>
<P>
 The lives of all three women had been flooded out. Akhmatova, whose first 
husband was shot early in the Revolution, queued up every week trying to get a 
letter or a package to her son in prison. Lydia Chukovskaya's husband, a 
brilliant physicist, had been shot two years earlier, though the authorities 
allowed her to spend a year seeking frantically for word of a man who was 
already dead. Tusya Gabbe, an editor of children's books, had merely lost her 
job and her world. 
</P>
<P>
 They were not drowning, though, but swimming. Akhmatova's growled whisper bore 
them up. When it stopped Gabbe broke the silence. "There is an expression which 
goes: as necessary as bread, as air. From now on, I am going to say: as 
necessary as the word. . . . Forgive me, Anna Andreevna, but even you who 
created this, even you don't know how necessary it is. . . . If they, THERE" -- 
nobody spoke the name of the Gulag and its victims aloud -- "could only imagine 
that THIS exists. . . . But they will never know now. So many lips have fallen 
silent, so many eyes have closed forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene comes from Chukovskaya's journals of her long and extraordinary 
companionship with Akhmatova. They are a treasure thrown up by the flood, and a 
record of the flood itself. They are a portrait of the incandescent personage 
who was one of Russia's greatest poets, and of an incandescent relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Chukovskaya is a powerful writer. In one sense the journals could be the 
dialogue of Samuel Johnson -- whom Akhmatova in no small way suggests -- and a 
Boswell without clownishness but with an equivalent talent to make the mountain 
speak. In another sense they evoke Cleopatra and Charmian, who was the greatest 
of Shakespeare's tragic companions. (Akhmatova's "Cleopatra" is one of the 
poems Chukovskaya most often alludes to.) Finally, Chukovskaya has portrayed a 
time when writers were suppressed and their writing could not quite be; a time 
when, as Gabbe's words suggest, hunger created poetry as the abyss creates the 
waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Chukovskaya was the daughter of Kornei Chukovsky, Russia's greatest children's 
writer and a friend and protector to other writers more savaged than he. As a 
child she had been presented to Akhmatova and revered her as a giant. In 1938 
she came to seek her out "on business." She never dreamed she would have the 
standing to do so; nor that the standing would be on such tragic ground. A 
letter from Akhmatova to Stalin had briefly won freedom for her son before he 
was again arrested; Chukovskaya hoped to get some hint of how to intercede for 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 It was futile but the two women immediately struck a bond. Akhmatova was only 
50 and was to live another 30 years but she put on the feebleness of a dying 
octogenarian, had as many as five "heart attacks" a night, spent much of the 
time lying yellow and inert on her bed, neglected to eat and, when accompanied, 
would come to a panicky dead-stop halfway across the broad Nevksy Prospekt. 
Alone, she would manage it. She also managed to travel to Moscow from time to 
time and to vary her usual ragged attire with a stunning black or white gown. 
"All my life I've been able to look however I've wanted to -- from a beauty to 
a hag," she confided. 
</P>
<P>
 This first volume runs from the end of 1938 to 1941. The next, not yet 
translated, runs through the 1950s, beginning with Akhmatova's and 
Chukovskaya's wartime arrival in Soviet Asia along with other writers who, 
Stalin decided, were now part of the national patrimony and must be denied to 
the invading German Army. 
</P>
<P>
 At home in Leningrad, Chukovskaya would visit several times a week. "Come at 
once," was Akhmatova's invariable reply to her phone calls. She soon was the 
center of the network of friends who sustained the poet; bringing tea and 
cakes, ham, lilacs, a sense of protection, an audience, and the memory of a 
world of art and loyalty. When word came that Akhmatova's son was to be sent to 
Siberia, people arrived with scarves and gloves, and women sat on her bed late 
into the night, sewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chukovskaya records the conversations and the daily traffic. She records 
Akhmatova's comments and reminiscences of Pasternak, Mandelshtam, Mayakovsky 
and many others. She writes of the brief semi-thaw when a collection of 
Akhmatova's poems, mostly older ones, was published. Vague and unfulfilled 
promises were made to increase her pension and find her a new apartment. 
Mostly, though, the journals invoke the constraints and what managed to survive 
them in a room that was assumed to be bugged. 
</P>
<P>
 The entries are elliptic and disguised, because the author knew the journals 
might be seized. (Decades later she added footnotes that act as a kind of 
dialogue with the original and flesh it out, along with end-notes and a 
selection of poems translated by Peter Norman.) But how eloquent her muffled 
voice can be! The NKVD is referred to as "the torture chamber" or "the big 
house," but Chukovskaya scornfully comments that it "wished to remain at once 
all-powerful and non-existent; it would not let anyone's word call it out of 
its almighty non-existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Akhmatova was composing some of her most powerful poetry, which could not be 
published until decades later. Sometimes she whispered it, sometimes she wrote 
on scraps of paper, which she then burned. It was the task of Chukovskaya and 
others to memorize and later transcribe it. The scene is haunting: "It was a 
ritual: hands, match, ashtray -- a beautiful and mournful ritual." 
</P>
<P>
 Chukovskaya was many things to Akhmatova: her comrade in loss, her literary 
interlocutor and the human assurance that her poetry would live in a future 
generation. She was her companion and helper in the sheer effort to get from 
day to day. On their month-long train trip across Asia -- two carriages were 
assigned to writers -- she took care of things while Akhmatova looked out the 
window converting the passing camel caravans into imaginary ones. "My captain," 
Akhmatova calls her. 
</P>
<P>
 What the poet meant to the author provides one of the most beautiful passages 
in the book. When she came to see Akhmatova in 1938, her world, present and 
past, seemed to have vanished. She had lost not only a husband but all the 
artistic and human assumptions she had lived by. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the mental state in which I existed during those years -- stunned, 
deadened -- I seemed to myself less truly alive and my non-life unworthy of 
description," she writes. "By 1940 I had virtually ceased making notes about 
myself, whereas I wrote about Anna Andreevna more and more often." Only by 
writing an "Akhmatova" journal, that is, could she write her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before my very eyes, Akhmatova's fate -- something greater even than her own 
person -- was chiseling out of this famous and neglected, strong and helpless 
woman, a statue of grief, loneliness, pride, courage. I had known Akhmatova's 
earlier poems by heart since childhood, and the new ones, together with the 
movement of hands burning paper over an ashtray, and the aquiline profile, 
sharply defined as a blue shadow on the white wall of the transit prison, were 
now entering my life with the same inescapable naturalness as the bridges, St. 
Isaac's, the Summer Garden or the embankment had already entered it long ago."

CATCHING STARDUST; ONE SWEET QUARREL, BY DEIRDRE MCNAMER (HARPERCOLLINS: $22; 
280 PP . )  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Watson, Watson is the author of Montana 1948. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Updike has written that only the historical novelist is able to convey 
the "immensity of time a human life spans, a span itself dwarfed by the 
perspectives of history." In her second novel, Deirdre McNamer depicts both the 
beauty and the sadness in this span as she chronicles lives that extend from 
that time in our century when citizens tried to catch dust from Halley's comet 
to the era when human debris littered the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
 Daisy Lou Malone is among those believers who stand on a crowded city street 
with an unstoppered jar held in the air. Scientists have assured them dust will 
fall as the comet streaks overhead. Stardust of another kind has brought Daisy 
to New York. Possessed of some musical talent, she plans on a career as a 
concert performer and recording artist. But Daisy Lou has neither sufficient 
savvy nor talent to find success in the big city. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother shares her idealistic nature but while Daisy Lou is looking to the 
sky, Jerry Malone is directing his vision in the opposite direction. He has 
traveled not east but west, and there he studies the contours of the Montana 
plains, hoping the deposits of oil buried beneath the prairie will make him a 
wealthy man. He knows you can't "just believe in surfaces, whether of 
scrubgrass or air . . . or the way another person seem(s) to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Their brother Carlton, by contrast, is all smooth surfaces. Neither as moral 
nor as sensitive as his siblings, he seems at first a perfect candidate for 
success. He is the classic entrepreneurial opportunist, willing to take any 
risk, any advantage in the pursuit of a dollar. Yet for all his monetary 
adventurousness, Carlton is the (one) who ends up back home, in St. Paul, 
Minn., where their father was once a Presbyterian minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jerry and Daisy Malone initially travel in separate directions, they 
end up in the same Montana community. In 1923, Shelby, Mont. -- a "rakish, 
unkempt" little town with "the look of a too-skinny kid with a few teeth 
knocked out" -- arranges to host a heavyweight championship bout between Jack 
Dempsey and challenger Tommy Gibbons. The event must surely be one of the 
oddest -- and most desperate -- in the history of sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelby stakes everything on the match. The flurry of oil speculation has not 
brought the hoped-for boom, and years of drought have wilted the dreams of 
agricultural and ranching prosperity. Perhaps the fight will attract enough 
fans -- and dollars -- to lift the town from its depression. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shelby's dreams are no more to be than Jerry's and Daisy Lou's. Dempsey 
and his manager leave town with virtually every dollar the gate brings, and 
then some. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight backers and many of Shelby's citizens lose everything, yet what 
follows is a curiously jubilant scene, a "mixture of mourning and relief." Men 
walk around town "with their empty pockets flapping." Laughter and music are in 
the air. That night Daisy Lou "has a particular light of her own" as she sings 
to a "wild clapping crowd." Jerry and his wife Vivian dance together, "amazed 
at what they have come through." 
</P>
<P>
 And that of course is what the townspeople are celebrating. That they have 
come through, stayed and persevered when so many did not. (This pattern of 
migration and departure repeats itself in the 1990s. The latest U.S. Census 
reveals that the West is experiencing another surge of population. Nevada, 
Idaho, Colorado, Arizona and Utah are the fastest-growing states. As in the 
past, however, these modern pioneers do not find the region accommodating. 
According to a study by a Montana State University sociologist, most of them 
leave within five years.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although Montana does not give Jerry and Daisy Lou and others like them all 
they hoped for, the region gets something from them -- their decency, their 
durability, even their dreaminess -- on which it can build its character and 
its communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the novel is framed by a small-town ceremony in which Shelby honors 
Jerry and Daisy Lou and other "old-timers." That they do not feel quite 
deserving of the attention only adds to their worthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading "One Sweet Quarrel" often feels like paging through a family album 
with a guide who knows exactly how much background we want, who knows when to 
speed up and when to slow down, when to jump back or ahead in time. The novel 
is composed of letters, fragments of diaries and, mostly, a series of 
beautifully rendered tableaux, scenes frozen in time and space like snapshots 
in the album: Jerry and Vivian picnicking on the prairie; Daisy Lou being 
kissed by a bootlegger on a city street; Daisy, Jerry and Vivian sitting in the 
newly built bleachers and staring down at the canvas where two boxers try to 
beat each other senseless under the scorching summer sun. 
</P>
<P>
 In the narrow sense of plot, "One Sweet Quarrel" is a novel in which nothing 
much happens. But in most lives, nothing much happens. We are born, we struggle 
to live and love, we age . . . our replacements arrive. History's great wheel 
rolls, and we are positioned along its spokes. That so many manage the ride 
with dignity and good humor is a remarkable thing. To capture it in 
breathtaking, luminous prose, as Deirdre McNamer has done, is all the more 
remarkable.

COVER STORY: LOVING 'ANNIE'; 'HALLMARK' FILM STIRS SISSY SPACEK'S SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under the threat of rain, spectators stand patiently on a quiet residential 
street hoping to get a glimpse of Sissy Spacek, Joan Plowright and Mary-Louise 
Parker. The three acclaimed actresses star in "A Place for Annie," the 
"Hallmark Hall of Fame" presentation airing Sunday on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 On this cool, cloudy morning, fans watch for hours as Spacek performs a 
birthday party sequence with co-star S. Epatha Merkerson on the front lawn of a 
two-story house. The scene is filmed over and over until lunch break is called. 
As the actors and crew head for the catering truck, the fans also disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 The 181st "Hallmark Hall of Fame" presentation relates the touching story of 
how a baby who tested positive for the AIDS virus changes the lives of several 
people. Though the story and characters are fictional, it draws upon historical 
medical information. 
</P>
<P>
 The story begins in 1986, when a city hospital receives its first HIV-positive 
baby, Annie Marsten, abandoned by her heroin-addicted mother, Linda Marsten, 
played by Parker. The baby also is addicted to heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 As the weeks progress, Susan Lansing (Spacek), the supervising nurse in the 
neonatal intensive care unit, finds herself increasingly attached to little 
Annie. Against the advice of her good friend, social worker Alice Blakely 
(Merkerson), Lansing becomes Annie's foster mother. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to find a full-time baby-sitter, Lansing, a divorced mother of a 
teen-age boy (Jack Noseworthy), encounters fear, prejudice and 
misunderstanding. Finally, a headstrong Irish widow named Dorothy (Plowright) 
agrees to become Annie's nanny. A year passes, and as Lansing is about to file 
legal adoption papers, a drug-free Marsten returns and wants custody of Annie. 
The opposite of Lansing, Marsten is slovenly, unloving and mean-spirited. Much 
to Lansing's shock, the judicial system awards Marsten, who is dying of AIDS, 
custody of Annie. 
</P>
<P>
 Director John Gray ("An American Story") believes "Annie" is not just a film 
about pediatric AIDS. "It's more of a story of these two mothers and how they 
come to terms with each other," he explains. "I think it is brave for Hallmark 
to do this. I think they are moving toward these contemporary, socially 
conscious movies." 
</P>
<P>
 "Annie" marks Oscar-winning Spacek's ("Coal Miner's Daughter") first network 
TV movie in nearly 20 years. "I'm a sucker for a (good) project," Spacek says 
with a smile. The petite, down-home actress is relaxing in her trailer during 
the lunch break. Resting on a the table is a half-finished plate of spaghetti. 
Classical music wafts through the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Gray is a wonderful director," Spacek says, "but I must say television 
is harder (than features) because of the time element." 
</P>
<P>
 The production lost a lot of precious time working with unpredictable babies. 
"The irony is when they are supposed to be crying, they laugh," Spacek says. 
"It never fails. Where we had the most difficulty was working with our little 
precious 22-month-old twin girls. They are just angels. They are precious, but 
they are 22 months old. What a child is experiencing then is separation anxiety 
from their mother. That has been really hard on us. It's like, 'Oh no! A scene 
with the babies.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for the role before production began, Spacek accompanied doctors on 
rounds in pediatric intensive-care units. She recalls one baby who just had an 
AIDS test. "They hadn't gotten the tests back, but she was a heroin addict," 
Spacek says quietly. "The mother also took cocaine during her pregnancy. The 
baby didn't have a chance. It was born with so many physical problems. It was 
interesting to see the doctors' and nurses' emotions. This is just a fact of 
life for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, though, Spacek found that the medical staff became attached to 
their tiny patients. "Different nurses become more attached to certain babies," 
says Spacek, who is the mother of two daughters. "They love for the parents to 
spend a lot of time in ICU, but they did tell me something I wasn't aware of -- 
some of the babies are so premature they can't handle a lot of physical 
stimulation. But they get to a certain point, and they thrive on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Spacek was touched by Annie's situation. "She was the hospital's first HIV 
baby and everybody was afraid of her. They had all the training, but they 
didn't know what to do. They had her in isolation and nobody wanted to handle 
her. The mother abandoned her, and if they couldn't find foster care for her, 
she was going to go to this really horrible, state-run hospital where they send 
babies to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Spacek pauses. "Our society has for so long pushed away the idea of death," 
she says firmly. "It's something that is such a part of life, that we are all 
going to have to face. It's a very different thing to think Susan is going to 
take this baby, so it has a place to die. But in fact, that is what she does. 
There are a lot of people who do that very thing, who give AIDS babies a place 
to live and a place to be nurtured for as long as they live." 
</P>
<P>
 The actress says she's appalled at the state of foster care in the United 
States. "We have all heard these horror stories about foster families who 
become emotionally attached to a child, and then that child is removed from 
them because the family is not supposed to be emotionally attached. That just 
infuriates me. Somebody has to get emotionally attached. I think we really have 
to take a look at our foster-care system in our country. I feel so strongly 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Lansing becomes attached to Annie, Spacek has developed a great 
affection for Lansing. "This is a wonderful character," she says with 
enthusiasm. "She's very strong, doesn't mince words. Maybe four or five times 
in the script, she is telling people how to do their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing also is someone who is willing to change. And in the film, she learns 
she's really not very different from Marsten. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she comes around in her relationship with the birth mother whom she 
loathes," Spacek explains. "In the beginning, she hates her because of what she 
did to this child whom she loves. When she loses the baby to the birth mother, 
which also infuriates her, she decides to invite the birth mother to live at 
her house, and in doing so gets to know this young woman. I know it brings her 
closer to her baby because in knowing her daughter's birth mother, she gets 
beyond her hatred for her and loves and respects her. She grows emotionally."

 "A Place for Annie" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on ABC.

FRIENDS IN FOREIGN LANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Denise Hamilton is a Times Staff Writer who just returned 
from a Fulbright Fellowship in Macedonia. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People who spend long periods in strange lands develop unique ways to ward off 
the melancholy that descends at odd, unbidden moments, transfixing us with 
memories that leave us standing naked before the mirror and suddenly late for 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 An American diplomat I know in Macedonia soothes her homesick nerves by eating 
Cocoa Puffs straight from the box. A Midwestern journalist who covers Bosnia 
lugs around a tape deck, filling the alien air with dulcet harmonies of 
American folk music. 
</P>
<P>
 I shoo away hearth-sickness -- at least temporarily -- by losing myself inside 
bookstores and libraries, preferably those with old books. This works best in 
genteel, slightly frayed dowagers of cities like Sofia and Thessaloniki, which 
are packed with bookstores that smell of stale talc perfume and evaporated 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent four-month stint in the Balkans, I reached for this fix much 
like any addict. As Sam Cooke would say, it sent me. Books were my panacea 
against the bitter cold, the car exhaust fumes, the oppressive talk of blood 
and death that consumes the Peninsula these days. 
</P>
<P>
 At the American Center library in Skopje, I met suave newcomers such as Oscar 
Hijuelos and renewed relationships with venerable masters such as Edith 
Wharton. After making a selection, I trotted home like a dog with a meaty bone. 
On nights when the winds howled down from Vodno Mountain into the deserted 
streets, whipping the falling snow into a dry lather, I sat propped up in bed 
with my stacked tomes, amulets to protect me from unseen ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
 The more incongruous my reading was with my locale, the more it transported 
me. Maybe that's the way I filter reality. Prior to my trip, I had spent months 
engrossed in Balkan history books while Los Angeles shot and burned itself into 
a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there was something deliciously dissonant about sitting in a Macedonian 
cafe listening to the muzzein in the minaret call the faithful to prayer while 
reading "In Country" by Bobbie Ann Mason, a tale of Vietnam vets, coming of age 
in Kentucky and national disillusion. I ordered another Turkish coffee and 
turned the page. 
</P>
<P>
 But I had to put aside Louise Erdrich's "Love Medicine" during a visit to 
Tirana. Albania was too weird and fantastical, as well as a bit sinister, for 
me to concentrate on this quintessentially American book about a Native 
American family on a Dakota reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it also struck too close to home. Cut off from the world for decades, 
ground down by massive unemployment, abject poverty and hardscrabble mountains 
where little would grow, dominated by tribal law, Albania struck me as one big 
reservation. Yet it also glowed with the magic realism that Erdrich evokes so 
well in her novels. For once I didn't need fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 I found no old bookstores in Albania, which didn't surprise me, since the 
country's first university wasn't even built until 1957, as Stalinist dictator 
Enver Hoxha with bloody cruelty wrenched his nation of 3.2 million from 
feudalism. 
</P>
<P>
 But poking around musty corners of Central Europe has yielded up gems over the 
years, and they have kept my brain from seizing up. In 1989 I spent days 
haunting antiquarian shops in Budapest -- a book-lover's paradise -- reading 
old travelogues and thin volumes of poetry by a British spinster who penned 
delicate verses in 1871 about gardens and platonic friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 How did this century-old book from London wind up in Hungary, surviving world 
wars, cataclysm and Communism, I wondered, growing more interested in its 
provenance than its author. A worn copy of "A Farewell to Arms" made me muse 
how many Hungarian eyes had gazed at Papa's nuanced prose and vowed to try 
their own hand at writing. 
</P>
<P>
 On that trip, I still rue passing up a leather-bound volume chronicling the 
Russo-Japanese War of 1905 illustrated with hand-tinted historic photos of men, 
horses and artillery. It cost $20, which at the time seemed like a lot but now 
seems absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 Always a believer in chance encounters, I went to Bulgaria last fall and 
scanned the block-long, open-air book market in Sofia's Pencho Slaveykov Square 
for another copy. In the afternoon shade, dealers stomped their feet to keep 
warm in between swills of rakia -- the harsh grape brandy that lubricates life 
in the South Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 A friendly book-dealer confided that Slaveykov was a Bulgarian symbolist poet 
of the early 20th Century, on whom that small fierce country once pinned its 
hopes for a Nobel Prize in literature. In typical Balkan fashion, Slaveykov was 
undermined when jealous rivals sent an anonymous letter to the committee, 
denouncing the poet as a traitor and spy. 
</P>
<P>
 We clicked our tongues over man's tragic fate and he tried to interest me in a 
coffee-table book on Bulgarian icons. But because he still mourned for 
Slaveykov, his heart wasn't in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Book lovers the world over have a kind of radar for each other. Like members 
of a secret society, we reveal ourselves by a strategically dropped word, a 
gleam that kindles the eye when discussing a favorite author. 
</P>
<P>
 On a cold and dreary bus ride from Sofia to Skopje, a balding Albanian won my 
undivided attention by rhapsodizing about Goethe and Schiller. We also shared 
chalky Turkish chocolate and orange pop. 
</P>
<P>
 In the languid Greek port city of Thessaloniki, I visited Molho Bookstore, 
built in the 1870s on the shopping street Tsimiski and today one of the few 
remnants of the city's once vibrant Jewish culture and intellectual life. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1493, Jewish book-dealers built the first printing press in the 
Balkans here. For almost five centuries, Jews, Turks, Albanians, Bulgarians, 
Greeks, Vlachs, Kurds and Serbs lived in relative peace in the land they called 
Macedonia, yoked by common exigencies of the Ottoman empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the past molds the future while haunting the present, I asked the clerk 
at Molho's for Leon Sciaky's elegiac memoir "Farewell to Salonica," which I 
learned about from another book, Robert Kaplan's recent "Balkan Ghosts." 
</P>
<P>
 "Salonica slept, oblivious of gathering forces," Sciaky wrote, recalling his 
childhood at the century's turn. "In the afternoon it sat in the gaily lighted 
cafes along the quay sipping apertifs . . . it drank in the taverns of the back 
streets and played backgammon and smoked narghiles. It spoke a dozen tongues 
and was garbed in as many costumes. Salonica was in Macedonia, but not of it. 
It slumbered in blissful ignorance of the passions of which now and then it 
heard faint rumbles." 
</P>
<P>
 The rumbles would reach a bloody crescendo during World War II, when the Nazis 
deported more than 55,000 Salonic Jews to the gas chambers, wiping out the 
truly multicultural world that Sciaky had evoked so vividly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the black-bearded clerk appraised me silently from behind Molho's counter 
and exhaled heavily. Perhaps he was relieved I wasn't looking for the new 
Jackie Collins zipper-ripper. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will have trouble finding that book," he said gently. "It is a very old 
and rare title, which is out of print." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, searching for an elusive book can be as exhilarating as reading it. Of 
course, one has better luck in Western Europe's bookstores, but their stocks 
are picked over, their books pricey and their staffs distinctly capitalist. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984 I visited Shakespeare & Co. -- the Paris institution where Sylvia 
Beach first published James Joyce's "Ulysses." In addition to some bibliophile 
sightseeing, I wanted to sell "Quartet" by Jean Rhys and "Lithium for Medea" by 
Kate Braverman. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner, a cantankerous old man named George with a white goatee, peered at 
me through his glasses and said irritably that he couldn't give me much for the 
books because they were too avant-garde to move off his shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Inwardly thrilled by his assessment of my literary tastes, I accepted his 
meager francs and bought "The Ariel Poems" by Sylvia Plath. It didn't occur to 
me until later that night, back in the seventh-floor walk-up of my Latin 
Quarter garret, that Shakespeare & Co. was the ne plus ultra of avant-garde 
Boho Paris and that George had parlayed my puerile vanity to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 That was one of the few times books failed to allay the melancholy that 
descended with the speed of a hungry raptor. But since I was in France, I 
consoled myself with Bordeaux and foie gras.

THE GOOD NANNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Renowned British actress Joan Plowright has a lot in common with Dorothy 
Kilgore, the character she plays in the new "Hallmark Hall of Fame" drama "A 
Place for Annie." 
</P>
<P>
 They're both strong-willed widows whose children have left the nest. And both 
seem to be warm, friendly and good-hearted. 
</P>
<P>
 Plowright, who was married for nearly 30 years to legendary British actor Lord 
Laurence Olivier, has been working almost nonstop in features and TV movies 
since his death in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A Place for Annie," Plowright's Kilgore becomes the nanny for Annie, an 
HIV-positive baby who is the foster child of Susan Lansing (Sissy Spacek), a 
supervising nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dorothy really wants to be useful," says Plowright, who received a best 
supporting actress Oscar nomination for 1992's "Enchanted April." 
</P>
<P>
 "She becomes the kind of linchpin in the household because Susan has to go out 
to work. In a way, I become a kind of confident because Susan has no family of 
her own around. Dorothy becomes kind of the older female in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Plowright was drawn to the project for several reasons, especially its subject 
matter. "It's very topical," she explains. "It's also about women doing things. 
I like that. I like a project where the women are kind of in charge of things 
for once, instead of being men in charge and women being a little bit on the 
periphery." 
</P>
<P>
 And both Lansing and Kilgore are definitely take-charge women. Kilgore, 
Plowright explains, "obviously had a good and affluent life, but her children 
have grown up and her husband had died. She's now looking for some way of being 
in the world instead of just sitting back in her large house. Susan is fighting 
a cause for a baby who would, if she hadn't brought her home, would be 
abandoned into a ward where people are expected to die. I was touched by the 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she finds the film to be "illuminating" on the subject of pediatric 
AIDS. "It's good entertainment, but it's very instructive entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 Plowright's also thrilled that Kilgore is a three-dimensional character. She 
frequently gets scripts where that isn't the case. "Half the time I turn them 
down," she says, especially the ones where the male characters have last names 
and a history and the female is simply identified by her first name. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know instantly that the lady's not going to have much of a history or 
identity. Who is this woman? I don't respond because I don't know her history. 
The (producers) say thingslike, 'We thought you could make something from it' 
or, 'There are four wonderful scenes with all of these great gentlemen stars."' 
</P>
<P>
 But with the success of "Enchanted April" and 1993's "Dennis the Menace," 
Plowright is receiving a lot of meaty scripts. "It's nice to be able to choose 
the one where I have a last name," Plowright says, laughing. "It's not that I'm 
a kind of militant feminist. But (I prefer scripts) presenting women in the 
light of being active participants in life and really moving things along, 
which they are in this script. They fight battles as women do in real life -- a 
lot of them unsung and unheard." SUSAN KING

LANGUAGE DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patt Morrison's "Easier Said Than Done" (Three on the Town, April 3) clearly 
demonstrated some of the hardships and obstacles that the foreign-born 
individual lives with daily and tries to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the article left the reader with the feeling that the responsibility 
for communication lies mainly with the foreign-born. As a speech and 
communication specialist whose emphasis is in multicultural communication, I 
strongly feel that communication is an encounter in which everyone involved is 
responsible for making it both positive and effective. For the American-born 
individual, being responsible means taking more time and patience in trying to 
help the non-native English speaker make himself understood. 
</P>
<P>
 We Angelenos live in a diverse society. In my professional experience, I have 
helped a Russian-born physician communicate with a Filipino-born nurse about a 
Mexican-born patient, and helped an Armenian-born supervisor communicate with 
her Japanese-born manager. If we want to help build Los Angeles into a better 
community, we all have to try harder and show more patience, understanding and 
kindness to help break down the communication barriers. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Morrison's "Easier Said Than Done" hits a lot of nails right on the head. I'm 
beginning to wonder what became of the Age of Communication that we looked 
forward to 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, we have machines that talk to machines and we have people who talk to 
machines and we have machines that talk to people, but whatever happened to 
people talking to people? I can't even get my telephone company to talk to me 
person-to-person without a 10-minute limbo filled with advertisements, handy 
hints and assorted voice-mail fillers. 
</P>
<P>
 But most irritating of all is to finally hear a human voice that's so heavily 
accented that you're never quite sure if the listener has understood you. I am 
always amazed that this kind of thing occurs in communications enterprises and 
at large corporations. A productive business is based on good communication; 
good communication is predicated on two-way understanding. We are losing out 
somewhere along the way.

<P>
 How rare at a time when "English-only" demands are heard in many quarters, 
when language conflicts polarize work groups and when immigrants are fair game 
for politicians looking for quick votes, to find an article as sensitively done 
and fair-minded as Morrison's. 
</P>
<P>
 In our multicultural community, compassion is the most needed response to 
language differences. While it may not be popular, Morrisson helps us to walk 
in the shoes of non-native English speakers. She validates the all-too-human 
experience of frustration at not understanding or being understood, yet she 
simultaneously helps us put aside our judgments and irritation.

WHITEWATER, THE MOVIE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Do my eyes deceive me or is Hillary Clinton wearing Joan D'Arc's battle armor 
in the photo on page 23? ("Little Rock Law," by John M. Broder and James Risen, 
April 3). If the allegations under investigation indicate any wrongdoing by 
Hillary, or any member of the Administration, it will necessitate a full 
military battalion to shield them from the inevitable fallout. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the political consequences, the Clintons would do well to 
immediately contact their Hollywood acquaintances and move to secure all 
production rights to this monumental story. What we have here are the makings 
of the sequel to "A Few Good Men" or "The Firm." I can see it now: Tom Cruise 
plays the unyielding prosecuting attorney who dares to challenge the integrity 
of the highest official in the land. Forget about cattle futures. This 
blockbuster sequel could provide a handsome retirement.

IN BRIEF: NONFICTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 A DREAM IS A WISH YOUR HEART MAKES: My Story by Annette Funicello with 
Patricia Romanowski (Hyperion: $22.95; 256 pp.) Who would have guessed it? All 
along, Annette really was . . . Annette! Whether beneath "mouseket-ears" or 
atop Laguna Beach sand, here is one child of the Fifties who passed unscathed 
through the social turmoil of the past 40 years -- and is darn proud of the 
accomplishment.The little girl who caught Walt Disney's eye at a talent show 
and went on to become the chaste heartthrob of at least one generation and the 
campy queen of another seems, by her own testimony, to have suffered divorce 
and disabling disease without ever developing an edge. Nothing phases her. 
Here, for instance, is Annette on giving birth: 'It was fairly comfortable. . . 
. When I first came out from under the anesthesia and opened my eyes to see my 
baby, my heart filled with love and thanks to God for sending her to me." Good 
to her parents, a world-class car-pooler, a popular singer who never herself 
thought she could sing, a 50-year-old woman who still consistently refers to 
Paul Anka, Frankie Avalon and Fabian as "idols," Annette tells the story of a 
life full of silver-lined clouds, pluck and happy tears. She has nothing bad to 
say of anyone, especially "Mr. Disney" (she only called him "Uncle Walt," as he 
requested, in an emotional memorial service). Readers who pick up this 
pleasant, upbeat book hoping to see Cubby or Doreen dissed, have got the wrong 
celeb bio: In Annette Funicello's peanut butter, there are no unsightly chunks.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

 With Cape Fear (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), Martin Scorsese tried to show us he 
could do the big violent suspense-thriller as well as anyone else, but his 
formidable skills served only to underline the meretriciousness of the 
production, which had been done far better on a more modest scale by J. Lee 
Thompson in 1962 (in a film with the same title). Robert De Niro stars as a 
crazed ex-con sworn to get revenge on Nick Nolte, the lawyer who sent him up 
for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Campbell's notable 1991 suspense-thriller Defenseless (KCAL Sunday at 
10 p.m.) is a satisfying genre film, set in Los Angeles and enlivened by a 
splendid cast headed by Barbara Hershey as an attorney suspected of murder -- 
and stalked by a killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in East L.A. (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.) is Cheech Marin's exuberant but 
underappreciated 1987 comedy in which Marin casts himself as a third-generation 
Mexican-American mistakenly deported to Tijuana as an illegal alien. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 House Party 2 (KTTV Monday at 8 p.m.) is more ambitious than the 1990 
original but misses the mark in comparison with its predecessor, which was 
mostly an unpretentious teen-sex musical comedy that introduced rappers Kid 'N' 
Play (Christopher Reid and Christopher Martin). It seems compelled to dredge up 
and inflate old formulas, centering on another house party, or "pajama jam," 
held in the college dining hall were Kid works. 
</P>
<P>
 La Bamba (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m.), Luis Valdez's 1987 biography of '50s rock 
'n' roller Ritchie Valens, is as infectious as its music, an irresistible saga 
of how a teen-age Mexican-American (Lou Diamond Phillips) made it from a 
migrant farm worker background to three hit records by the age of 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its intrepid hero, a fearless flyboy (Bill Campbell), The Rocketeer (ABC 
Saturday at 8 p.m.) simply wears you down. This 1991 film is so dogged and so 
relentlessly earnest in its one-dimensional state that no option but partial 
surrender seems possible. Set in 1938 Los Angeles, this tale of how a youth 
with a dream turns himself into a man who can fly and fight evil at the same 
time bears a coincidental resemblance to other updated cliffhangers like 
"Raiders of the Lost Ark." But this movie plays everything far too straight. 
</P>
<P>
 So much is wrong about the 1991 Hudson Hawk (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.), the 
movie in which Bruce Willis played the role of the world's greatest cat burglar 
just released from Sing-Sing, that it is really difficult to know where to 
begin. For a start, there are too many villains, too much is over the top -- 
and there's not a smidgen of wit in the script.

 What does this mean? "Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the 
Menendez Murders" (Fox, April 18).Does that mean that all the testimony given 
under oath was lies? 
</P>
<P>
 Ruthie Maron, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the efforts of the Menendez defense team to suppress the showing of 
the Fox made-for-TV movie about their crimes: I can certainly sympathize with 
the defense's efforts to obtain an unbiased jury and agree that a 
pro-prosecution movie could indeed taint the jury pool. Perhaps the best 
solution here, as in other high-profile cases, would be to change the location 
of the trial. In fact, I would like to suggest a different venue. How about 
Singapore?

 In your April 17 cover story you refer to "World War II: When Lions Roar" 
(NBC) as the "first American drama to be produced in HDTV -- High Definition 
Television."This is not accurate. The first American television drama produced 
in HDTV was made by CBS and was broadcast on April 23, 1989. It was called "The 
Littlest Victims" and told the story of Dr. James Oleske (played by Tim 
Matheson), a pioneer in the research and treatment of pediatric AIDS.

 THE THINGS THAT MATTER MOST by Cal Thomas. (HarperCollins: $22; 256 pp.) It's 
easy to see why many people take refuge on the lovely tropical island of 
black-and-white pronouncements where every issue can be resolved by applying 
the same number sun block. I myself am often guilty of this, and understand, 
only too well, the emotional comfort and security that comes with knowing all 
the answers. Cal Thomas has written the book (no joke intended) on Draconian, 
simplistic solutions. If homosexuals would only change their behavior and have 
"normal" relations, the country might take a step toward wiping out this moral 
rot. If women would just stay where they belong, at home with the kids, our 
families would be much stronger. If television would only clean up it's 
violence, people might not kill each other. And who would have thought that all 
these problems stem from the same place. Apparently one decade has caused our 
country to be on the brink of destruction. You guessed it. The Sixties. 
</P>
<P>
 The tricky thing about Thomas' ideas is he has many valid points, it's just 
impossible to receive them through his bullying, paternalistic presentation. 
For example here is Thomas quoting psychologist Barbara Hunter: "Hunter indicts 
feminist leaders like Gloria Steinem . . . who, she says, are products of 
dysfunctional families. . . . Because of their own inadequate childhood 
experiences. . . . They have led women to make wrong choices that have 
adversely affected their lives as well as the lives of their children." Whether 
or not you think women should stay home with their children is a separate issue 
from why Gloria Steinem came by her beliefs. It shows an astonishing lack of 
respect for other people to use their childhood experiences as a way of 
dismissing them. Thomas has some good points. It's too bad that no one except 
those who already agree with him are going to listen.

 BAIT by Kenneth Abel. (Delacorte: $19.95; 345 pp.) Everyone, for various 
reasons, is desperate to get close to ex-cop, Jack Walsh.The Massachusetts DA 
wants information, his staff member wants intimacy, Mafia boss Johnny D'Angelo 
wants Walsh's blood, and his No. 1 thug, Jimmy, wants to be the person to get 
it. There's an ex-wife who wants reassurance, and a shady ex-co-worker whose 
wants are purposefully unclear. All these dramatic and conflicting agendas make 
for an effective plot, yet "Bait," a thriller by Kenneth Abel, still manages 
for fall completely flat. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, cardboard cutouts, is too generous a term for most of these 
characters. They are soggy, regurgitated cliches that were only marginally 
interesting 10 years ago. Dialogue such as, "Don't get me wrong, it's not the 
money, Johnny, I got money. . . . It's the lack of respect," is especially 
disappointing because probably anyone, including Abel himself, could do better. 
Another major problem is that none of these folks from Central Casting are 
particularly sympathetic. That would be fine if the writing were strong enough 
to carry one's interest, but most of the description in "Bait" is only 
adequate. Abel has a powerful and promising sense of story. Let's hope he 
develops a few quirks to give it resonance.

 PRIZE STORIES 1994: The O. Henry Awards edited and with an introduction by 
William Abrahams. (Doubleday: $25; 382 pp.) Similar to the film industry's 
Oscar, the O. Henry Awards for short stories are almost soothing in their 
predictability.Readers are treated to a collection of high-quality, 
main-stream, literary fiction that has plenty of sand with no grit, depth with 
no real price. That's not to say some of the work here is anything short of 
brilliant. Amy Bloom, Stuart Dybek and Elizabeth Graver in particular have 
written beautiful, gut-wrenching pieces about love and death. The first prize 
story, Alison Baker's "Better Be Ready 'Bout Half Past Eight," is a funny and 
oddly sweet look at how our gender defines us. And, if you're a Loorie Moore 
fan, her contribution, "Terrific Mother" will not disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with the possible exception of "Labor," Katherine Hester's verbal 
collage of a love relationship shown by describing various parts of the man's 
body, none of these stories will surprise or challenge the reader. They're too 
polite. One may wish writers such as Dennis Cooper or Kathy Acker would come 
along to crash the party and misbehave.

 TO MY EX-HUSBAND by Susan Dundon. (William Morrow: $20; 256 pp.) "You often 
don't know it's the last time for a lot of things.The last time you scare 
someone to death with a rubber lizard. The last time you sneak a look at your 
Christmas presents before Christmas. The last time -- am I putting too fine a 
point on this -- you make love to your husband." So says Susan Dundon in "To My 
Ex-Husband," a witty, insightful novel written in a format somewhere between 
personal letters and journal entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Emily Moore's husband walks away from their 20-year marriage, 
("We want different things. It's no one's fault.") she begins to write to him 
about her new life. There's the difficulties of holidays, dating, financial 
problems and taking in borders. This may sound like enormous potential for ax 
grinding, but somehow, Emily manages to circumvent indulgence and make us care 
deeply for her on every page. 
</P>
<P>
 Another wonderful quality of "To My Ex-Husband," is the universality of its 
appeal. Provided they've been in a relationship, anyone from an angry African 
American rapper to a WASPy math teacher can identify with Emily's often subtle 
emotional experience. And it's funny. This is writing that makes one feel 
grateful for the positive aspects of their life and full of hope that the more 
difficult parts will be resolved. "To My Ex-Husband," is a truly generous book.

 ELEVATOR MUSIC: A Surreal History of Muzak, Easy-Listening, and Other Moodsong 
by Joseph Lanza. (St. Martin's: $22; 280 pp.) Many people, if they think of 
Muzak at all, immediately imagine elevators, endless waits in the telephone, or 
worse, being in the dentist's office.Not Joseph Lanza. In "Elevator Music," a 
passionate account of Muzak's rise to prominence, Lanza contends that far from 
being just an annoyance, that gentle version of a Pearl Jam hit you hear while 
eating your Big Mac is actually beneficial to mankind. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanza tells us that, "Elevator music (besides just being good music) is 
essentially a distillation of the happiness that modern technology has 
promised. A world without elevator music would be much grimmer than detractors 
. . . could ever realize. This is because most of us, in our hearts, want a 
world tailored by Walt Disney's 'Imagineers,' an ergonomical Main Street 
U.S.A." Jeepers! When does the next shuttle leave? 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of readability, "Elevator Music" has a meandering, good-natured style 
that is its strength as well as its downfall. Much like the Muzak it praises, 
this book has no real core, no spine to give it structural integrity. Instead 
of smooth transitions from subject to subject, "Elevator Music" seems to focus 
on one thing for a few pages, stop, and then abruptly begin a new topic. This 
gives the whole book a slightly homogenized feel with no one concept or 
portrait of a Muzak personality emerging as more pertinent than any other. 
Still, it will make many readers more interested and aware of Muzak's 
ubiquitousness presence in our lives.

NO SAFE HAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the sister of a mentally retarded adult, I found the description of Forest 
Haven ("Bleak House," by Murray Waas, April 3) appalling, especially as it 
served as a "haven" for no one. 
</P>
<P>
 It amazes me how innocent members of our society are still so grossly 
mistreated. While the behavior of a wide range of people in this story -- from 
federal district Judge John Pratt to the physicians and staff of Forest Haven 
-- should be chastised, I found it equally upsetting to read in later newspaper 
accounts that the six families of the Forest Haven residents who died will 
receive a total of $1.075 million from the city of Washington D.C. Certainly 
the city was negligent for turning its back on these people, but I found it 
equally despicable that their families did so as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The mothers of Arkie Harris and Joy Evans witnessed their children being fed 
while lying down and found cuts and bruises on their children's bodies. Yet 
both left their children to live in what one described as a "snake pit." 
</P>
<P>
 I will never understand how a family member could be indifferent to the pure, 
unadulterated love these children offer. All mentally retarded adults are not 
Lenny from "Of Mice and Men." I suggest that the million dollars should instead 
go to an organization that is truly dedicated to the care and love of the 
mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 How chilling was the story of Forest Haven. The mentally retarded and the 
physically disabled seem forever banished to homes where they languish, lacking 
love and caring. Do the judges and the government agencies know this world of 
neglect, filth and loneliness? Of course not. If only Judge Pratt were made to 
live this sort of life for even a short time.

<P>
 The parents of the patients at Forest Haven should never have put their 
children into such a place, but since they did choose to institutionalize them, 
why did they continue to let them stay on after seeing such horrific treatment? 
</P>
<P>
 I understand that some did complain -- weakly, I might add -- but why don't 
more people care for their relatives at home? I have two retarded brothers who 
have lived with me since 1979. They are 53 and 51 years old. I would never 
dream of putting them in a place such as Forest Haven, and I believe that the 
parents of Joseph Hardy Jr. and Arkie Harris should have removed their children 
at the first sign of maltreatment.

 I have a sister living at a facility for the disabled that is partly run by 
the state of California. Born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy, Kathy was 
raised at home until the age of 21. When my aging parents could no longer care 
for her she was "sent away to school." When she returns to "school" after 
visits home, she cries, "No school! No school!" It's heart-wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
 My sister is 40 now, and over the past 19 years she, too, like Arkie Harris, 
has had personal belongings disappear, including a portable TV. She has always 
been tiny and thin but she lost lots of weight, too. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I know the facility is a good one. But after reading the article by 
Murray Waas, I now wonder if her tears are not only because she misses home. I 
plan to investigate. Thank you for the insights.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; LAMB CHOP, SHARI AND PALS 
'PLAY-ALONG' FOR THIRD SEASON ON PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "It's an anti-couch potato show!" declares ventriloquist/puppeteer Shari 
Lewis, explaining the popularity of her Lamb Chop's Play-Along, which enters 
its third season Monday on KCET. "We get kids not just to sit and sing along 
with us, but to physically participate." 
</P>
<P>
 Through skits and stories, Lewis and her fuzzy friends Lamb Chop, Charlie 
Horse and Hush Puppy have entertained and educated families for nearly 40 
years, and along the way they've picked up a number of awards and honors, 
including a Peabody, nine Emmys, and three Emmy nominations this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis attributes Lamp Chop's continued popularity to the show's family appeal. 
"Families can share the entertainment and create a very nice relationship 
bond," she says. "If Mother and Dad can watch with the kids, you can learn a 
lot about your child: their ability to participate, what they know or don't 
know, what they like or don't, and you can build upon this knowledge. One of 
the strongest things we offer is the fact that parents watch with their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's opener examines diversity. After being criticized by outsiders for 
being "brown (Charlie Horse), gray (Hush Puppy), white (Lamb Chop), and mottled 
pink (herself)," Lewis says, "I make us all look alike and our differences are 
still there." Other topics include cheating, teamwork, vandalism, support 
systems, anger and independence. 
</P>
<P>
 As she's done from the beginning, "none is done with a wagging finger," Lewis 
says. "I don't sell my message, I tell my story. It's always been this way. If 
kids think they are being taught or preached at, they will turn off. I try not 
to sugarcoat, but build the comedy on a substantial basis." 
</P>
<P>
 First introduced on an episode of "Captain Kangaroo" in 1957, Lamb Chop has 
evolved through the years. Lewis has "let the winds of MTV blow through this 
show. There are a lot of electronic graphics now. They can be very 
stimulating." 
</P>
<P>
 Still featuring the show's trademark musical and imaginative games, two 
segments have been added to the season's 10 new shows: "Any Kid Can Draw," 
using basic shapes, such as the numerals 0 through 9 to draw a man or nine 
ovals and two triangles to draw a pig, and "Buster's Brainbusters," featuring 
brainteasers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis constantly is amused by children who recognize her. "I love how little 
kids don't really know what's going on with television," she says, laughing. 
"I've had many kids come up to me and say, 'I watched your show this morning, 
remember?' " 
</P>
<P>
 And they watch every morning, she believes, because "they love us because we 
get them out of their seat, they hop along and turn along and count along and 
spell along and rhyme along and chime in in so many different ways." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lamb Chop's Play-Along" airs Monday-Thursday at 7:30-8 a.m. on KCET and 
Monday-Friday at 9:30-10 a.m. KPBS. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth special to air in the Emmy Award-winning series Scenic Wonders of 
the World (Tuesday 9-10 p.m. Disney), "The Spirit Within Our National Parks" 
focuses on Native American myths and stories about the formation of the land 
and the life on it. For ages 9 and up.

FOCUS; WITH SWEEPS, YOU GET STARS

 It's May sweeps, when the networks will roll out the big guns: the Menendezes, 
Miss Universe and a Stephen King miniseries. And on regular shows, it means the 
special guest star . 
</P>
<P>
 If Urkel needs an aunt on "Family Matters," have it be Donna Summer. The 
"Fresh Prince's" home is for sale, have the buyer be Donald Trump and Marla 
Maples-Trump. "seaQuest DSV" needs a breath of fresh air, so have someone who's 
parted the Red Sea: Charlton Heston (Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
 This is "stunt casting," where big names who normally don't pop up on TV -- 
and some who never even act -- show up on series. Guest-celebrity casting goes 
on all season, but even more so during a sweeps month, when ad rates are set 
for local stations. And this month the networks want to make sure that their 
regular shows go out with a bang before summer reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stunt casting tells the viewer that, 'Hey, the lights are on here,' " says 
Preston Beckman, NBC senior vice president of program planning and scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 For faltering shows, guest stars can be a godsend. Witness "Homicide," the 
critically acclaimed drama series that NBC brought back from hiatus last 
January. For its return episode, the guest was Robin Williams, just as his 
movie "Mrs. Doubtfire" was drawing huge audiences in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "That episode was clearly written with him in mind," Beckman says. "It was the 
ultimate stunt casting." 
</P>
<P>
 Top shows have proved quite adept at knowing how to use guest stars. "Murphy 
Brown" will feature movie director Louis Malle, Candice Bergen's real-life 
husband, playing himself. The season's No. 1 show, "Home Improvement" will 
feature separate episodes with Victoria Principal, real-life improvement expert 
Bob Vila and the astronauts who repaired the Hubble Space telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 New viewers may tune in to both shows, but more than likely, the guest stars 
will be a wake-up call to get regular audiences to tune in. 
</P>
<P>
 On one of the back-to-back episodes of "The Mommies" this week, "Lassie" and 
"Lost in Space" mother June Lockhart plays the divorced mother of Barb (Julia 
Duffy). Also in the same episode will be other TV moms of yesteryear: Barbara 
Billingsley ("Leave It to Beaver") and Florence Henderson ("The Brady Bunch") 
and Audra Lindley ("Bridget Loves Bernie" and "Three's Company"). An episode 
filled with today's supermodels preceeds it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average viewer watches two out of every four episodes of the top-rated 
shows," says David Poltrack, CBS executive vice president of research and 
planning. "So (with celebrity casting) you may get a higher proportion of the 
core audience. You get them to say, 'There's something special about this 
episode. I better watch it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On "Evening Shade," singer Tony Bennett, suddenly hotter than ever, plays 
against type this month: He acts. "I'm not shooting for (acting roles), but if 
I get a magnificent script, I'm not going to knock it," says Bennett, who plays 
a nightclub singer-turned-salesman. "I went to work, and I loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 For the cast of "The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.," guest stars meant a 
chance to toss a football around with National Football League stars and game 
announcer Terry Bradshaw, who plays a "Robert Duvall-esque colonel," according 
to executive producer Carlton Cuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the NFL audience will like Brisco," Cuse says. "It's synergy." 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find lots of football players on Fox series this month. It may be the 
month's ultimate stunt: Fox starts NFL broadcasts in late summer. MAY VISITORS

 It was pleasant for this 75-year-old to find that the word "scissorbill" (L.A. 
Speak, Palm Latitudes, March 27) is still in use. It was commonly used when I 
was young, but when I saw that it was defined as "origin unclear," I went to 
the unabridged version of Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the 
English Language and found: "Scissorbill/n. (trans of F. bec-en-ciseaux) 1. A 
skimmer. 2. chiefly West: an inferior or stupid person as a: a worker 
indifferent to the interests of the laboring class (as one unwilling to join a 
union) b: a worker learning to be a railway brakeman.

PUBLISHING BLUES; THE HISTORY OF THE GINGER MAN: THE RAGS TO RICHES STORY OF 
THE MAKING OF A MASTERPIECE BY THE MAN WHO WROTE IT AND FOUGHT FOR ITS LIFE, BY 
J. P. DONLEAVY (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN CO.: $30; 544 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Colm Toibin, Colm Toibin's most recent novel is Heather Blazing (Viking) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a story with a happy ending. In a publisher's note at the back we are 
told tha J.P. Donleavy's legendary first novel, "The Ginger Man," has sold 5 
million copies throughout the world and has not been out of print since it was 
first published in 1955. This new book tells how Donleavy wrote the book, 
suffered rejection, only to have the book published, to his horror, by a 
publisher of pornography in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 But it tells a great deal more besides, offering a picture of American exiles 
mixing with local bohemians and writers in Ireland after the war. Donleavy 
began his novel in County Wicklow, south of Dublin, in a small cottage. He was 
just married; his wife's family was unsure whether their daughter was safe in 
the hands of this would-be first novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 Gainor Crist, the model for "The Ginger Man," appears here, built up as a 
character of great eccentricity, but curiously un-alive in these pages, a 
ghostly presence. The writer Ernest Gebler emerges as wise and encouraging; 
toward the end of the book Gebler meets the young novelist Edna O'Brien. Her 
family, or her family's supporters, come to intervene and save her virtue, thus 
offering Donleavy material for one of the many fight scenes in this book. 
</P>
<P>
 When his novel was almost ready to be launched, Donleavy returned to the 
United States. He introduces us to many of his old schoolmates and neighbors. 
Perhaps this would work in another book, but here, at times, it is like reading 
a telephone book, or other people's postcards. Take Mrs. Kuntze, for example. 
She appears on Page 307: " . . . on the main street of Katonah Avenue, I met 
Mrs. Kuntze. And as I was about to leave Woodlawn for good, it seemed as if it 
were preordained. For this pleasant, attractive woman of outspokenness and 
character was the mother of Alan, Donald and of my first girlfriend, Carol, all 
of whom had been part of my most impressionable years growing up in America. 
And for this nice lady, I briefly broke my silence and croaked out a few 
words." 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers are not so nice; and it is made clear to Donleavy that, because of 
its supposed obscenity, his book will not be published in the United States. He 
is not short of confidence and, more importantly perhaps, he is not short of 
money -- he gets a handsome wedding present from his father-in-law, and then 
some cash from his mother, and is subsequently supported by Ernest Gebler who 
reads the manuscript of "The Ginger Man" and recognizes the real writer in 
Donleavy. 
</P>
<P>
 This book is at its best when it sticks to the subject of "The Ginger Man." 
Donleavy seems to have kept every single rejection slip sent to him in Britain 
and the United States. The reader knows the outcome, but there is great drama 
in watching the story unfold. "This manuscript of yours. Were we to publish it 
here in Boston, we would be tarred and feathered," he is told. Late one night, 
while carousing in London with Brendan Behan he hears about the Olympia Press, 
a French publisher who publishes books in English, and had published Samuel 
Beckett. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone of book becomes more concentrated as Donleavy prints the entire 
correspondence between himself and the Olympia Press. His disappointment and 
anger shine from the pages when he finally gets his printed book. He had been 
waiting for this moment for so long. And now he discovers that his title is not 
in the literary list with Beckett but in a list with titles like "The Enormous 
Bed," "School for Sin," "The Sexual Life of Robinson Crusoe" and "The Whip 
Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, it becomes clear that there will not be a battle between Donleavy and 
the Olympia Press over the list, but over rights as well. "I would," he writes, 
"if it were the last thing I ever did, redeem and avenge this work that I'd put 
my very life into writing." In an early letter from the Olympia Press, which 
Donleavy reprints here, he is told: "We would suggest shortening these opening 
100 pages; but almost all the book calls for the same revision." Forty years 
later, the same could be fairly said about this book. The tone, much of the 
time, is slack. Too many characters are introduced and never appear again. 
There are too many anecdotes and scenes that belong to notes for an 
autobiography rather than the story being told. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet the story being told is of great interest. It is instructive to know 
about the timidity of publishers on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1950s; 
how a classic novel was written, and how its author came to triumph against 
adversity.

COMMENTARY; 'TALES" II: A MONEY THING OR A COURAGE THING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK DeCARO, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the "Roots" of gay-positive TV programming, a groundbreaking miniseries 
that scored big ratings for PBS, and yet there will likely be no sequel. Is it 
any wonder that Armistead Maupin was bent out of shape when he called the other 
week? 
</P>
<P>
 The author, an icon in gay pop literature, is angry and disappointed in PBS 
for scotching the idea of a sequel to "Tales of the City," based on Maupin's 
classic series of books. Despite high ratings and heaps of critical praise for 
the show, PBS has decided not to put up a 25% share of an $8 million budget 
needed for "More Tales of the City." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the original, which aired in three installments earlier this year, it 
would have been made and financed in large part by British television. 
</P>
<P>
 PBS says it's purely a money thing. "When programming took stock of the whole 
picture, $2 million seemed too much to put into something we'd already done," 
says PBS spokesman Harry Forbes. Public broadcasting, he adds, has been forced 
to defend itself for canceling "a sequel that was never promised ... it's 
really unfair to put PBS in the role of the villain." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, public television has gone where no network has gone before, airing 
many gay-themed works before "Tales," including the late Marlon Riggs' 
controversial "Tongues Untied," a TV version of David Leavitt's "The Lost 
Language of Cranes" and the AIDS drama "Longtime Companion." Forbes says 
they've taken heat for it -- and continued to show such works. A variety of 
gay-themed shows are scheduled for June to mark gay pride month and the 25th 
anniversary of the Stonewall rioting in Greenwich Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's easy to understand why Maupin -- and many fans of the miniseries 
and the books, both gay and straight -- are miffed. "Tales of the City" was 
landmark programming that gave exposure to people we don't often see on TV or 
in Hollywood films: funny, smart, quirky gay people living side by side with 
equally funny, smart, quirky straight people. Both audiences made "Tales" the 
highest-rated dramatic series PBS has aired since it started charting Nielsen 
ratings for its programs in 1989, according to Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a terrible mistake to think that only a small urban clique of 
homosexuals enjoyed "Tales of the City," Maupin says. I will personally vouch 
for at least one 75-year-old suburban mother who loved every minute of it and 
made sure her husband and her best girlfriend watched it. And they adored it, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that the discussions about financial shortages are just 
smokescreens," Maupin says. "If they'd achieved the same success with any other 
series, they'd be all for it." He believes it is the subject matter -- the 
"non-negative portrayal of homosexuals" living happily in San Francisco -- that 
has scared PBS off. 
</P>
<P>
 The miniseries drew the ire of conservatives and the religious right. The Rev. 
Donald Wildmon, for one, led a campaign against it, although he has now turned 
his protests toward the decidedly hetero series "NYPD Blue." Quality 
broadcasting, it seems, is what Wildmon is truly against. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that damn kiss one more time," Maupin says. He's referring to a 
passionate same-sex kiss in the second part of "Tales." 
</P>
<P>
 But the sequel had the potential to be a hotter potato. 
</P>
<P>
 "It deals with Anita Bryant's crusade in the '70s. So this particular series 
would not only have contained friendly intimate scenes between same-sex 
couples, but would have addressed the very notion of homophobia," Maupin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Maupin originally wrote this material as a serialized column in the San 
Francisco Chronicle. Editors at the paper then were as squeamish about the 
topic as broadcasters seem to be today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've fought for this material for 20 years," he says. The fear is that this 
work is "dangerous, subversive and possibly immoral material," he says. "But 
'Tales of the City' is intended as a highly moral work which has as its theme, 
compassion and forgiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 As PBS spokesman Forbes says, " 'Tales of the City" in its own way defends 
family values." To conservatives, that is what's so subversive about "Tales of 
the City."

WORLDS APART?

 Futurist Alvin Toffler outlined the evolution of power in his recent book, 
"Power Shift." In the distant past, Toffler wrote, power derived from brute 
force, and in recent centuries from wealth, but now the Age of Information has 
arrived. Digby Diehl, moderator of a recent symposium, "Books to Bytes: Tension 
in the Transition," sponsored by Occidental College and Vroman's Bookstore, 
spoke of Toffler's concept in his opening remarks. An audience of 250 attended 
the event. Panelists Ward Ritchie, scholar and publisher, and John Espey, UCLA 
professor and author, are both legendary in Southern California's relatively 
short literary history. Dressed in conservative coats and ties, these two 
distinguished octogenarians represented "Books" while Paul Saffo, 39, a 
director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park represented "Bytes." On 
a low table in front of the dais, a six-volume, leather-bound set of Gibbon's 
"The Roman Empire" rested between marble bookends next to a computer keyboard 
and screen. The setting itself seemed to pose the question, "What form will 
books take after the Transition?" 
</P>
<P>
 While Espey and Ritchie are revered figures, Saffo inspired something closer 
to a nervous awe as a cybernetic seer, a "techno-guru." Most of the questions 
from the audience were for him. Ritchie, 89, was raised in South Pasadena and 
founded Ward Ritchie Press in 1936, specializing in publishing books on the 
American West, from histories to cookbooks. Ritchie said he believes books will 
be the prime repositories of ideas and expression in the future. Espey, 81, 
shared many of the reservations others voiced about the printed page being 
entirely replaced by new media, he did suggest that listening to books on tape 
in L.A. traffic jams allow many to actually reach the end of great (lengthy) 
Russian novels. 
</P>
<P>
 The average age of the audience was close to, if no over 50. Virtually every 
person to rise with a question identified themselves as a librarian and, with 
the exception of Cal Tech's librarian, they seemed a bit dubious about the 
unmixed blessing of he information superhighway. The concerns raised by those 
asking questions or making comments reflected practical concerns, a few 
aesthetic issues and, frankly, more than a little "technophobia" (the phrase 
"soulless technology" was used). 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Saffo, the panel's "tekkie" described a state-of-the-art document 
titled "Agrippa." It is a short story by sci-fi author William Gibson. Saffo 
said the deluxe edition is $14,000 but went on to explain that both available 
formats, paper and computer disc are very temporary. The paper edition is 
printed with ink containing chemicals causing the text to slowly vanish after 
exposure to light. The disc has a built-in computer virus that "eats" the text 
as the screen, on automatic scroll, allows only one chance to read and no 
chance to print it out. Ward Ritchie, who has spent his career in publishing 
creating carefully crafted books, cringed visibly when he heard this. Diehl, 
musing on the possibility of a book-less world, asked Saffo if the libraries 
and bookstores of the future would be "nothing more than electronic filling 
stations?" Saffo, too witty to play the villain, underscored the fact that 
technology can have a human face. At one point he observed, "talking about the 
future of books to this group is like talking about the future of religion in 
front of the pope." Steve Tice

THREE ON THE TOWN: WORKING IT OUT; TELECOMMUTING CENTERS MAY NOT HAVE OPRAH OR 
MTV, BUT THERE'S NO BOSS AROUND EITHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Gold 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though telecommuting -- working at home over the phone, more or less -- may 
well be the wave of the future, the guys you usually hear about are 
Mendocino-based accountants or millionaire software geeks who retreat into the 
Rockies with computers, fax machines and telephone bills as large as all 
outdoors. But recently, there's been a lot of interest in telecommuting 
centers, buildings where a lot of people get together to telecommute at once. 
The centers are just like offices except closer to your house, and your boss is 
probably 40 miles away. (How does your boss know you're working instead of 
playing Mortal Kombat? She really doesn't.) 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, the telecommuting-center thing is pretty cool: If it catches on, 
there might be somewhat less traffic and smog, and more hours devoted to lawn 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Some post-earthquake commutes to the Westside, for example, involved three 
freeways, two mountain ranges and a twisting, 10-mile canyon road, and 
sometimes by the time you got to work you were too worn out -- or possibly 
stoked from coyote sightings -- to do anything more strenuous than go out for 
cappuccino or make little zoo animals out of paper clips and white-out. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, a telecommuting center in the freeway-impaired Antelope 
Valley filled up almost at once; there are big plans for centers in Riverside 
and Orange County and Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is true that the person who would rather work at home than go to a 
telecommuting center is able to eat garlic toast for lunch and wear an Ice Cube 
T-shirt the whole day through, it is also true that this person may tend to be 
over-familiar with daytime TV, not just Oprah and Ricki and Jerry Springer, but 
cooking shows, "Yo! MTV Raps," and documentaries about the stately elk. (When 
you have a project due, a tuna casserole episode of "Laurie Cooks Light and 
Easy" can seem mysteriously compelling.) He or she may even get around to 
bathing the pugs or oiling the wainscoting -- sometimes it's time to shave and 
get out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be fun to come into some kind of office, within reason, especially if 
you are one of the great army of contract workers and temps, apt to be booted 
from any desk at any time, dressed down for making unauthorized phone calls to 
Walnut, carded for the company ID you do not have. There may be distractions, 
but usually not the fatal sort. There is probably a place to tack up a 
photograph of your cat and another to rest your Heal the Bay mug. 
</P>
<P>
 You can, presumably, make office friends, who are better than the other kind 
because they never ask to borrow money. And you can drink as much bad coffee as 
you care to pour. You just don't have to drive as far. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommuting centers are applauded by highway planners and probably by Al 
"Information Superhighway" Gore. The phone companies really like them. Who do 
you think makes money on faxes and voice mail anyway? Plus, if you feel like a 
schmo slaving over a hot keyboard on a day you could be down at the track or 
planting sugar snap peas in the garden, experts say, telecommuting centers 
might help you work more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all of the apparent virtues of the centers, for all the saved fuel and 
afternoons rescued for weekday barbecues, I can't help thinking that 
telecommuting represents yet another outflow of jobs from urban-core Los 
Angeles to the far suburbs, yet another opportunity for Southern Californians 
to isolate themselves from one another, to avoid meeting people not exactly 
like us, to reduce what scrap of community we all still share.

 THE ASSASSINATION OF THE BLACK MALE IMAGE by Earl Ofari Hutchinson (Middle 
Passage Press: $9.95; 152 pp., paperback original). Hutchinson offers an angry 
rebuttal to the media images of black men as absent fathers, gang members, 
felons and drug users. He doesn't deny that African-Americans who fit these 
descriptions exist, but he objects to the lack of balance. The mass media 
seldom -- if ever -- focus on Afro-American males who are nurturing fathers, 
honors students or ordinary, middle-class family members. Hutchinson 
occasionally gets carried away by his own rhetoric and he doesn't really tackle 
the issues involved in the controversy over Louis Farrakhan's speeches, but his 
basic argument is irrefutable.

 DURABLE GOODS by Elizabeth Berg (Avon: $9.; 192 pp.). Berg's brief novel 
describes a girl's coming of age during a sweltering summer in Texas.Poised on 
the brink of adolescence, Katie realizes she is no longer child, but not yet 
woman. She has no one to talk to about her shifting identity: Her mother 
recently died of cancer; her older sister only wants to escape their remote, 
abusive father. Katie communes with her mother's spirit and writes poetry, as 
she longs for a better, kinder adulthood.

 THE FATE OF THE ELEPHANT by Douglas H. Chadwick (Sierra Club Books: $14.; 492 
pp.). Chadwick spent years traveling in Africa and Asia, researching his 
sympathetic account of the status of these intelligent, highly social 
animals.He discovered elephants play an important ecological role that 
scientists have only begun to study: By thinning the jungle when they forage, 
they allow plants to grow that gorillas and other animals and birds depend on 
for food. But the pressure of Africa's burgeoning human population on fragile 
ecosystems and the mass slaughter of animals for their tusks have reduced the 
elephant population to a fraction of what it was just a few decades ago. 
Chadwick also visited artisans and merchants in Asia and found that the bulk of 
the world's ivory goes to Japan, where it is used to produce "signature seals, 
jewelry and tourist trinkets."

 CHILDISH THINGS by Valery Larbaud, translated from the French by Catherine 
Wald (Sun & Moon: $13.95; 201 pp., paperback original). Wald's sensitive 
translation offers English readers their first opportunity to enjoy these 
evocative stories that were first published in 1918. The narrators are upper 
middle-class boys and girls learning their first hard lessons about class 
distinctions, parental expectations and romance. In "Summer Homework," an 
impatient, slightly confused boy complains, "In the funny papers you see jokes 
about 'enfants terribles;' why were there never any jokes about terrible 
parents? Maybe it's because they're too terrible. But there's another thing: 
little by little you give up trying to make yourself understood."

 THE GREAT TEMPLE OF THE AZTECS: Treasures of Tenochtitlan by Eduardo Matos 
Moctezuma (Thames & Hudson: $19.95; 192 pp.) and TEOTIHUACAN: Art From the City 
of the Gods by Kathleen Berrin & Elizabeth Pasztory (Thames & Hudson: $24.95; 
288 pp., paperback original). The catalogue of a 1993 exhibit at the De Young 
Museum in San Francisco, "Teotihuacan" focuses on the great metropolis that 
flourished near the site of modern Mexico City between about 50 and 750 A.D. 
Its people left an extraordinary legacy of art that includes frescoes, carved 
stone masks and intricate ceramic vessels.One of the largest cities in the 
world during the Middle Ages, Teotihuacan influenced the later cultures of 
Meso-America, including the Aztecs, who built their of Tenochtitlan capitol 
south of its ruins. Moctezuma describes the latest archeological discoveries at 
the Great Temple, an enormous pyramid dedicated to Tlaloc, the rain god, and to 
Huitzilopochtli, the god of sun and war. Rebuilt at least six times over 
decades, the Great Temple has yielded a grimly dazzling trove of ceremonial 
objects.

 CENSORED: The News Stories That Didn't Make The News And Why: The 1994 Project 
Censored Yearbook by Carl Jensen & Project Censored (Four Walls Eight Windows: 
$14.95; 318 pp., illustrated, paperback original). The annual Project Censored 
report offers devastating evidence of the dumbing-down of mainstream news in 
America.The flood of details and rumors about Heidi Fleiss, the Bobbits and 
Madonna in the mass media meant that more significant reports appeared only in 
smaller, often marginal publications. Among the stories that were sacrificed to 
make room for Woody & Mia, Michael Jackson and Amy Fisher: Evidence that nearly 
10,000 people died in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster; that untapped oil reserves 
in Somalia motivated the U.S. intervention; that the much-hyped DARE program 
has had little effect in discouraging drug use among students; that the United 
Nations Children's Fund reported 9 out of 10 young people murdered in 
industrialized countries are slain in the U.S. Required reading for 
broadcasters, journalists and well-informed citizens.

 It's 5 o'clock on a Sunday morning, still dark. I pass two accidents as I head 
north on the 405 with Bill Vaughan, a consulting biologist.Our goal? To see how 
much wildlife we can spot from the L.A. freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still dark 40 minutes later as we breach the Sepulveda Pass, spot two 
moths, pass another accident, get on the 101 east. Things pick up: We sight two 
pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts to get light as we continue east on the 101 to the 134 and the 210. 
At 6:10 we spot a crow, at 6:13 another one. At 6:15 we spot a sea gull, then 
three more. It's dawn as we near the intersection of the 210 and the 10. We see 
eight starlings; four more; two more. Then Vaughan calls out: "Two red-tailed 
hawks!" 
</P>
<P>
 Having missed the red-tails, I circle back. Then . . . "A mating!" Vaughan 
yells. The pair are balanced on a power line; we watch the male dismount. It's 
too much for me and I get lost. We pass two more accidents. Heading west on the 
10, we spot another red-tail on a freeway lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan spots a road kill (possibly a cat), another road kill (possibly a 
coyote) and another accident. We're approaching the 710 when we suddenly drive 
under a "river" of sea gulls -- 140, Vaughan estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 We continue through Downtown, to the 110 south, to the 105 west (150 miles in 
all), counting as we go. 
</P>
<P>
 Our final tally: 156 gulls, 45 pigeons, eight mourning doves, six ravens, 33 
crows, 52 starlings, 42 unidentifieds, two road kills, a kestrel, five 
red-tailed hawks and seven accidents. "It's a zoo out there," says Vaughan. 
Absolutely. Michael Tennesen

PALM LATITUDES: BEING THERE; BRUSHING UP

 You've tried azalea bark shampoo and saguaro cactus fruit conditioner. You've 
had your locks trimmed by the likes of Eber and Cristophe.But the mop on top 
still looks more like Marge Simpson's than Hillary Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that your flowing tresses need a tuneup. French hair-care specialist 
J. F. Lazartigue -- whose Beverly Hills hair center complements other 
locations, including centers in New York and Paris -- is convinced he can get 
to the root of your hair troubles. Like several other hair analysts around 
town, he says the solution is cold, hard science. And cash. 
</P>
<P>
 So here I am sitting in a special room of Cristophe's Beverly Hills salon 
having my locks looked at. A woman named Lisa plucks a hair, puts it under a 
"Microviewer" and carefully examines the root, follicle and color. She consults 
charts and diagrams and a couple of minutes later gives me the diagnosis: a 
reasonably healthy follicle with good color, texture and consistency on the 
strand. However, I have oil trapped inside my scalp, she tells me, something 
that can eat away at the follicle and cause dry hair and dandruff.  
</P>
<P>
 The hair doctor goes to work. An hour and 15 minutes later -- after having my 
hair medicated, wet-steamed and washed -- I get a prescription of propolis 
jelly, shea butter, micro-pearl and liposome to give me shinier, healthier 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The treatment cost $75; the jelly, butter and the rest were $200. I left 
hoping that I'd never again have to comb the streets with a scalp full of that 
treacherous hidden oil -- and wondering how much it would have cost if my hair 
hadn't been relatively healthy. Samuel Greengard

 Several hundred fans are lined up outside Book Soup in West L.A. Inside, 
Ann-Margret, sitting behind a counter stacked high with her autobiography, 
"Ann-Margret, My Story," smiles as photographers and reporters assault her with 
strobes and mikes. Just when it seems that the line of fans may be ignored, a 
woman starts yelling at the reporters. "OK.Out! That's it! Time's up! You've 
had it!" With the help of the owner, she shoves them out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen years ago, publishing houses sent authors on the road with a map and 
some phone numbers, but now they rely on media escorts like free-lancer Karen 
Hebert to show their writers around. Hebert's been in the biz 14 years. Her 
previous job was teaching first-graders, which she says was perfect for "taking 
care of the personal needs of celebrities and authors."  
</P>
<P>
 Hebert has guided hundreds through the book-signing and talk-show circuit, 
including Clive Barker, Ken Follett, Carrie Fisher, Bob Woodward and Muhammad 
Ali. "I've seen Dom DeLuise in his underwear," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 She once drove around town with five Elvises to promote a book on Elvis 
impersonators. "I had an Elvis kid. I had Elvez (the Mexican Elvis), a couple 
female Elvises and an Elvis that was the mayor of a Midwestern city." 
</P>
<P>
 Ali was her most gracious guest, Hebert says. "He signed books, kissed babies 
and threw punches for hours." Shirley MacLaine was the least; escorts voted her 
the Golden Dart Award at the American Booksellers Assn. convention for being so 
difficult to deal with. Not that Hebert would provide any details. She doesn't 
narc on her former first-graders either. Michael Tennesen

PALM LATITUDES: URBAN ART; EVERYTHING NEW IS OLD AGAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 L.A. has a bad rep for not preserving its own history; its art and culture 
dwell in the forever-changing present. But two new works attempt to change that 
by evoking the city's past. 
</P>
<P>
 On the floors and walls of an L.A. Convention Center concourse are two 
enormous granite triptychs. One pays tribute to such Southern California 
landmarks as the original Brown Derby, the Central Library, Hollywood Bowl, 
Watts Towers, Chinese Theater and the freeway system. (The other displays such 
symbols of achievement as Stonehenge, an early printing press, a political 
convention.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I was interested in an artwork as a way of representing a history or at least 
holding on to it," says the triptychs' creator, L.A. native Matt Mullican. "A 
pictorial image holds the object even after the object disappears." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar credo inspired Venice artist Barbara McCarren in her decoration of a 
Pershing Square bench near 5th and Hill. From thousands of antique postcards in 
a UCLA collection, she chose 24 for copying onto porcelain tiles. The images 
include Olvera Street, the Griffith Observatory, the Avalon Casino and 
now-vanished alligator and ostrich farms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word concept I kept in back of my head was 'heyday,' " says McCarren, who 
also created the park's faux earthquake fault and telescopes with historical 
photos. "I wanted not only to strike a remembrance of the previous heyday of 
Pershing Square and Los Angeles, but to indicate optimistically that it could 
be that way again." Larry Gordon

 From a recent press release:  
</P>
<P>
 Why buy new furniture when you can rearrange what you have? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That's the question Elaine Sandberg, founder of Re-Design asked herself last 
year when she opened her interior rearrangement company. "Everyone is cutting 
back on interior design and retail spending for their home or office, but still 
demand good looking space, space that fulfills its functions, and is 
aesthetically tasteful," said Ms. Sandberg from her own recently re-arranged 
home in Rancho Park."The economy has re-designed most people's pocket book and 
lifestyle, so I created a way to 'face-lift' your home," continued Ms. Sandberg 
. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Sandberg charges $200 per room to re-design and re-arrange. Special rates 
are given for entire homes and suites of offices and she'll even help move the 
furniture! 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a real money-saver.

 Contractor C.C. Myers, a self-made multimillionaire whose toys include 
Rolls-Royces, a stretch limousine, a Cessna, a jet and a helicopter, had a more 
substantial gift in mind for his 56th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted the concrete deck of the quake-shattered Santa Monica Freeway poured 
and smoothed, the last major hurdle before the freeway could be reopened, the 
last thing standing between him and a multimillion-dollar bonus for finishing 
early. But first he'd have to get the cooperation of his ironworkers, who were 
exhausted from the round-the-clock, seven-day-a-week pace, some even asking 
that their shifts be cut from 12 hours to eight. Myers, who prided himself on 
bidding smart and talking tough, was going to have to persuade the ironworkers 
not only to avoid cutting back but to work even faster. 
</P>
<P>
 He paid a call on the ironworkers' supervisors. Myers, his hulking 6 feet, 4 
inches elevated by black ostrich-skin boots, seemed to fill the ramshackle 
trailer under the freeway. Ignoring the offer of a chair, he sat on a rickety 
bench that creaked and swayed beneath him. The two foremen listened to his 
pitch, praying that he wouldn't topple to the floor. If Myers wanted them to 
spur on their men, they said, they'd need personal incentives. A deal was cut. 
Myers promised $250 to the night shift foreman, $250 to his Little League team 
and $1,000 to be spread among his 20 men. Workers on both shifts would get a 
lavish Italian meal. Like Myers says, "You have to know how to stir the pot." 
</P>
<P>
 So on Myers' birthday, March 31, the concrete was poured, days ahead of 
schedule. And instead of flying in his private jet to meet his wife and two 
sons at their home near Sacramento, Clinton Myers celebrated his birthday with 
the men who call themselves "rodbusters," men who were uneasy about wearing 
dirty jeans and torn T-shirts in the fancy restaurant. His voice thick with 
emotion and red wine, he thanked the men and pulled out his wallet. Peeling off 
hundred-dollar bills, he carefully set 10 of them on the table. It was a 
communal moment of sheer triumph. "You guys worked your butts off," Myers told 
the ironworkers. "You ought to be proud of what you accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 They, along with teams of carpenters, finishers and laborers, a squad of more 
than 400 at its height, had done the undoable -- they had speeded the 
rebuilding of the Santa Monica Freeway so traffic would flow on April 12, more 
than two months earlier than state officials had predicted. Working through 
nights, weekends and rain, they had done in 66 days what would have taken 18 
months under normal circumstances. It was a feat made possible by powerful 
forces: a President, courting California voters, who opened federal coffers; a 
governor, running for reelection, who cut red tape; movers and shakers who 
demanded that the artery connecting Downtown to the politically powerful 
Westside be opened now ; a recession-weary construction force, desperate for 
overtime; and, maybe most of all, a boss like C.C. Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 IN 1965, AS A DIXIELAND BAND PLAYED, A GOODYEAR BLIMP SWUNG A TIRE from the 
end of a 150-foot rope to rip through the ribbon just west of La Cienega 
Boulevard, opening the Santa Monica Freeway. At a cost of more than $200 
million, Los Angeles at long last had its first major east-west artery. 
</P>
<P>
 It quickly became the freeway that Angelenos most loved and hated. It offered 
a speedier trip to the coast than surface streets, but its lanes were always 
crowded, suffering rush-hour jams in both directions. It was the busiest 
freeway in America and when the Northridge earthquake smashed it, Angelenos 
were desperate for its prompt return. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's chief bridge engineer, Jim Roberts of Sacramento, was shaving when 
his telephone rang at 5 a.m. on Jan. 17, the Martin Luther King holiday. 
Roberts had figured he would work without interruption until noon at Caltrans 
headquarters, but the phone call upset his plans and for an instant, the 
41-year Caltrans veteran wished he'd retired. Then he shifted into gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts had been through the 1971 Sylmar quake and the 1989 Loma Prieta, in 
which collapsed freeways killed 43. He knew what to expect this time. He 
mobilized his staff, then faced the klieg lights for a barrage of questions 
from reporters. Roberts, 63, admitted that the prognosis was not good. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials initially predicted it would take 12 to 18 months to 
rebuild the region's damaged thoroughfares. When they promised a flat-out, 
no-holds-barred campaign to deliver the restored freeways within six months, 
many were skeptical. After all, five years after the Loma Prieta earthquake 
devastated the Bay Area, not all the damaged freeways there have been 
completely rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The shattered Santa Monica had been scheduled for retrofitting one month 
later. Had the quake hit after the retrofit, the bridges at Washington and 
Fairfax might well have survived. A nearby off-ramp at Cadillac Avenue, newly 
retrofitted with steel jackets, was unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only hours after the quake, a regiment of federal and state transportation 
officials -- and Gov. Wilson -- flew to Los Angeles. Cynics say that's because 
it's an election year. But Caltrans officials say no one ever mentioned 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not to be business as usual because of the impact on the economy and 
the inability of the people in Los Angeles to move around," says Caltrans 
director James W. van Loben Sels. "Here was an opportunity to show that 
bureaucrats are not intrinsically bureaucratic." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Van Loben Sels ordered shortcuts in Caltrans' labyrinthine 
bureaucracy, allowing the agency to shave months from normal bidding 
procedures. For the small projects, Caltrans didn't bother with competitive 
bidding. It asked C.C. Myers and four other contractors to bid the Santa Monica 
project. These were outfits that had offices in Southern California, had built 
Caltrans projects before, could move quickly, and would be able to meet the 
goal of drawing 40% of their subcontractors from minority- or women-owned 
companies, Roberts says. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans dispatched employees -- loaded with a carton of plans and 
specifications -- on airplanes to reach the five contractors, so each received 
the same information at roughly the same time. Their bids were evaluated and 
the contract was awarded the same day. Instead of starting in the standard 15 
days, Myers began work within 24 hours, dispatching crews from his Gardena 
office to prepare for drilling the 50-foot shafts for the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, there would be some complaints. Jim Carter, one of Myers' former 
partners and president of MCM Construction Inc., was angry that his North 
Highlands company -- a fierce Myers competitor and one of the top firms in 
California -- had not been invited to bid on the Santa Monica, though he had 
been asked to bid on other quake reconstruction jobs. "Why weren't we asked?" 
Carter questions. "It just slays us because Myers has the easiest project and 
the most incentive. It's a slam-dunk kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the hours and days after the quake, nothing looked easy. And Caltrans 
officials were not just considering the convenience of Los Angeles motorists. 
If the reconstruction was completed within 180 days, the federal government 
would pick up the entire tab, standard for national disasters. Initially, the 
cost of repairing damaged freeways and establishing alternative transportation 
was estimated at $1 billion -- an amount that was more than halved as officials 
began reviewing their bills last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get into an emergency like this, you just do it," Roberts says. 
"We're not doing anything immoral or illegal, we're just doing everything 
faster." 
</P>
<P>
 BRUTOCO ENGINEERING & CONSTRUCTION HAD PLEDGED TO DO THE JOB in the least time 
-- 100 days -- and for $20 million. But the Fontana-based company withdrew when 
an error was discovered on its application. On Feb. 4, Caltrans selected Myers, 
the second-lowest bidder, based on a combination of time and money. Myers 
agreed to do the job in 140 days for $14.9 million. And Caltrans created an 
unusual incentive -- Myers would receive $200,000 for every day that the 
freeway was opened ahead of schedule. If he was late, he would be penalized the 
same amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal triggered a nonstop race in which Myers rode his crews, sometimes 
cajoling, sometimes goading, sometimes screaming. No one could rebuild the 
Santa Monica Freeway faster, Myers boasted. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers knew what the job would take. After the Loma Prieta earthquake, his 
company, C.C. Myers Inc. of Rancho Cordova, rebuilt two damaged bridges on 
Highway 1 near Watsonville in record time. Caltrans allotted 100 days for that 
project, the first in which cash incentives were offered. Despite winter rains, 
Myers finished the job 45 days ahead of schedule -- earning $1 million in 
incentive pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a guy who's done this and knows how," says Roberts. "He's a real 
hustler; he's got everybody organized to move fast. I visited the job after 
Loma Prieta: Myers had five different operations going simultaneously. On a 
normal job, you have a couple." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, one of 13 children raised on a hardscrabble farm in Highland, dropped 
out of the 10th grade and left his father's home carrying all his belongings in 
a small box to stay with his mother in Long Beach, sleeping under the awning of 
her trailer. He became a carpenter's apprentice, eventually working for Los 
Angeles builder Benny Benedict, and went on to become a regional supervisor in 
Benedict's company. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost two decades later, their roles were reversed. Polich & Benedict Inc. 
had folded and Myers had started his own company. He hired his onetime boss, 
and when the older man retired five years ago, Myers threw a wingding for 200 
at the Sheraton Rancho Cordova and gave Benedict the keys to a maroon 
Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
 He can afford to take care of old friends. His construction firm has branched 
out into development and now owns more than 5,000 acres in California, 300 in 
Las Vegas, 100 in Colorado and another 800 in Utah. He's invested in Oklahoma 
gas and a newly opened casino resort in the Czech Republic. He's sold $35 
million worth of homes in Las Vegas and $5 million worth of lots in Utah, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He donated 400 acres to the state of Utah, a parcel he figures would be an 
ideal site for the Winter Olympics, keeping 800 acres adjacent, where he's now 
building homes. And he's saving one prime spot for himself, a site on top of a 
mountain where he'd have a spectacular view of racing skiers. He doesn't ski; 
his sons do. 
</P>
<P>
 Though final details of the contract are still in flux, Myers will win a bonus 
of as much as $13.8 million on the Santa Monica job. Some of this, Myers says, 
will be eaten up by the cost of hiring around-the-clock crews and other 
expenses tied to accelerating the work. His payroll each week usually topped $1 
million. Myers figures about $8 million of the bonus will be profit, and some 
of that will go to the purchase of a bigger, faster jet. He also wanted to 
reward his workers, so he has already spent about $30,000 buying $100 dinner 
gift certificates for those who worked at least two weeks on the Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like a spider. I start crawling out there and getting a hold of things," 
says Myers. "You start out with nothing then you really want to see what you 
can accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilding the freeway was not just about money, he insists. It was the 
challenge. It was the chance to say, without seeming to brag, "We are the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 CALTRANS AWARDED THE CONTRACT TO MYERS EVEN BEFORE THE BRIDGE blueprints were 
finished. While all the other repairs to downed freeways were designed by 
Caltrans, the agency turned to consultant Wei Koo for the Santa Monica. Koo 
knew the bridges inside and out; the Orange-based structural engineer had 
designed the planned retrofits. 
</P>
<P>
 Koo and his team of 30 began work Jan. 21 and delivered the first set of 
drawings to Caltrans six days later. The last set was turned in on March 4, a 
little more than a month before the bridge opened to traffic. "Normally, this 
job would have taken nine months," says Koo, whose firm will receive about 
$520,000 for the design. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, a set of bridge plans is sent to Caltrans headquarters, where they 
are evaluated for a period of weeks, or even months. Then they are submitted to 
peer review. Finally, when a design clears those hurdles, it is handed over to 
the builder. But this time, C.C. Myers got the plans in installments after Koo 
finished them and Caltrans approved them. The peer review occurred after 
construction had begun, something Koo describes as "gut-wrenching." If the 
plans failed the review, both he and Myers would have had to start all over. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plans ran into no real obstacles. Among those who reviewed them was 
Nigel Priestley, professor of structural engineering at UC San Diego and a 
leader in bridge design. "We made minor comments," Priestley says. "The design 
appeared to be competent, well-conceived, and had the sort of details we hoped 
to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The original structures could withstand displacement of no more than two 
inches when the earth shook, Koo says. The new 491-foot-long Fairfax structure 
can sway as much as 17 inches without damage. At La Cienega, the 776-foot span 
will displace up to 11 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 In the original design, the steel was placed in a series of circles embedded 
in concrete supporting columns. But the ends of those circles were not joined, 
which allowed the columns to break open and crumble. The new ones are built 
with steel hoops within the columns. They are also designed to have many more 
steel bars, all woven closely together. All told, the two structures take 
almost 6 million pounds of reinforcing steel. 
</P>
<P>
 It meant more work for the ironworkers. And it meant a bridge whose design 
evolved even as Myers built it. These factors spelled constant aggravation for 
Myers, who often barreled into the Caltrans trailer on the construction site to 
see Tyrone Taylor, the agency's resident engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a f- - -ing disaster. All that steel costs us a lot of time," Myers 
railed one day. "It's abnormal -- no one anticipated this kind of bull- - - -. 
We bid to build a standard bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Such conversations were common. Taylor never lost his temper. And he was 
embarrassed when they occurred in front of a reporter. "This is off the record, 
off the record," he declared as Myers ranted about the bridge design. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we bid on is a normal, standard Caltrans bridge," Myers stormed. "Now you 
are adding all this bull- - - -. If it wasn't for all these problems, I'd be 
done 10 days sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems were many: Workers found old foundations and an abandoned 
drainage structure, not indicated on the plans, that had to be removed. 
Drillers discovered contaminated water. Patched water lines leaked, causing 
cranes and cement trucks to sink in the soggy ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to make up lost time, Myers proposed to Caltrans that he use a 
quick-drying cement on the bridge decks. While concrete typically takes up to 
10 days to cure, this stuff would dry in two days. But because it is expensive, 
the concrete -- used on airport runways -- had never been poured for Caltrans 
bridges, and therefore wouldn't be used this time. He used a cement that dried 
in five days, but this still meant that squeezing the workers was the only way 
to accelerate the rebuilding of the freeway bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 ON MOST CONSTRUCTION JOBS, HAMMERS POUND ONLY EIGHT HOURS A day, five days a 
week, and they stop for rain and holidays. It's a somewhat orderly tag-team 
event -- pile-drivers create the foundation; carpenters set up the falsework, 
the wooden frame that creates a temporary bridge; the ironworkers take over; 
carpenters return to erect wooden forms; and then the finishers pour the 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the rules have been tossed. Crews from each trade nip one another, 
pushing for the other to work faster and get out of the way. Myers eggs them 
on. Myers asks the ironworkers: "You like those carpenters butting you in the 
ass all the time?" Then he scolds the carpenters for going too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers puts one supervisor, Kojak, (who refuses to give his real name, 
preferring to go by the one he acquired when he shaved his head) in charge of 
the bridge at Fairfax Avenue and Washington Boulevard, and another supervisor, 
Dwayne Barth, in charge of the one at Venice and La Cienega boulevards. He 
plays the two men off one another. "Looks like Kojak is starting to smoke you," 
Myers tells Barth. "That little f- - - - - is going to bite your ass. You 
better get going." And when he sees Kojak later, he takes him aside, warning 
him: "The kid is going to get you." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a fiercely competitive race, in which the ironworkers grouse 
that the carpenters are delaying them. The finishers scream that the 
ironworkers are too slow. The day crew complains that the night shift isn't 
pulling its weight. The night crew claims that the day crew is lazy and leaves 
the narrow scaffolding walkways cluttered. They work 12 hours, or longer, seven 
days a week. With huge 4,000-watt light towers, the work continues 24 hours a 
day. One week is the equivalent of four on an ordinary site. 
</P>
<P>
 When a worker leaves and returns for his next shift, invisible hands have 
continued his labors. He no longer picks up where he left off, something many 
find disconcerting. "You feel no ownership here," says Cecil Jennings, 31, a 
carpenter from Paramount. "Here, we do our section and it's already poured by 
the time you come back. It's not my bridge. There are too many people out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-three days into the job, workers swarm over plywood and timber. In the 
glare of the sunlight, the bridges loom large, vast expanses of tawny yellow 
wood frame that look nothing like roads. The motion and noise are constant, men 
shouting orders, the beep-beep-beep of heavy equipment backing up, the popping 
of nail guns, the thud of lumber being moved, the clanging of metal. Frustrated 
motorists maneuver past. A driver leans on his horn as he whizzes by, yelling: 
"Work faster, work faster." Nights are more peaceful. No traffic. Fewer 
workers. At dusk, klieg lights are set up, making this stretch of construction 
seem almost like a movie set. 
</P>
<P>
 Both bridges are informally divided into sections, each at a different phase. 
In one, carpenters hammer a wooden deck. In another, they build wooden forms so 
concrete can be poured. In yet another, ironworkers lay out steel rods, weaving 
them into a complex grid. 
</P>
<P>
 The ironworkers, builders say, have the worst of a bridge job. In teams, they 
hoist long rods of joined reinforcing steel, weighing several hundred pounds, 
that can bend like uncooked strands of spaghetti. At other times, they work 
separately, lacing together shorter lengths of steel rebar, weighing up to 150 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironworkers lose fingers. A bad back comes with the trade. Their bodies ache, 
a constant dull pain that the old-timers say becomes as automatic as 
swallowing. "The bars drop on your feet and you just kind of grin and bear it. 
You keep going until the pain is gone," says Sam LoVetere, 25, an ironworker 
from Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, LoVetere carefully carries and places the rods several inches 
apart on the deck. Next, bent over double, he lifts a rod several inches above 
the deck, thrusting a small concrete block beneath it, so that when the 
concrete is poured, the bars will be surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The ironworkers have a rhythm. Step. Crouch. Place a block. Step. Crouch. 
Place a block. It is interrupted only by forages for more steel rebar, stacks 
of which are lifted to the deck by a towering crane. When the blocks are set, 
the dance changes: Step. Crouch. Tie. Step. Crouch. Tie. Seven days a week. Ten 
hours a day, for four weeks straight.  
</P>
<P>
 LoVetere's father was an ironworker, but LoVetere says he does the job for one 
reason: the money. He usually earns about $25 an hour. For work on Saturdays 
and overtime, he gets time-and-a-half. On Sundays, his pay is doubled. He knew 
he'd be working long shifts that would stretch into seemingly endless weeks. 
All told, he grossed about $8,000 for his 27 days' work here. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironworkers have their own culture, tools and attire. They take their breaks 
by themselves. They pride themselves on being the sure-footed bad boys of the 
bridge, known for their colorful language and their ability to endure 
backbreaking labor. That pride, however, made them a target for Myers. If they 
were so good, why didn't they work faster? 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the workers and foremen didn't relish encounters with Myers, who says 
he hasn't taken a vacation in 17 years. "To him, everything is cash. He steps 
on everybody. He can buy and sell you like you were nothin'," said one. "He 
looks right through people. But his checks don't bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 The job was going well. There were the minor nits and wrinkles of 
construction, a seemingly never-ending flow of small mishaps. The crane had 
dislodged itself from its tracks. One abutment appeared to be almost one foot 
too high. A Caltrans inspector questioned the mix of concrete being poured into 
a patch. 
</P>
<P>
 But no major trials. So, as he did on evenings when he was pleased, he offered 
to treat his top men to dinner. Myers and his men chewed over the events of the 
very long day at a cheap pizza joint. Prompted by the fleeting image on a 
nearby television of a scantily clad woman in a boxing ring, they launched a 
discussion of why there are so few women wrestlers, which, in turn, led to the 
pros and cons of silicone breasts. 
</P>
<P>
 It meant the day went well. Otherwise, the men wouldn't deviate from talk of 
work. On this night, there was a sense of family. The men, who'd cursed one 
another at various times in the past weeks, now ribbed each other. Everyone 
accused Kojak of trying to hoard all the heavy equipment at his end of the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 WITH THE THRONGS OF WORKERS laboring long hours, the minor-injury rate was 
slightly higher than the national average. About 30 needed stitches or walk-in 
medical attention. The most serious accident occurred two days before the 
freeway opened, when a foreman inadvertently backed a pickup truck over a 
kneeling carpenter, breaking his pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
 Even one of Myers' top men suffered a minor mishap. Gary Janco, Myers' 
right-hand man and the first employee he hired when he started his company in 
1977, cut his foot with a chain saw. Janco simply put duct tape on his boot and 
limped around. 
</P>
<P>
 Janco, along with 24 of his key lieutenants, was summoned for the Santa Monica 
because he had worked on the Watsonville bridges and knew the breakneck pace 
Myers wanted to set on this one. He normally oversees all of Myers' Northern 
California projects, and here, he orchestrated the logistics of the bridge 
reconstruction -- an event that resembles a military maneuver in its staging. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent much of his time on the phone, wheedling and extracting what he 
needed from suppliers. The heavy equipment -- including nine cranes, four 
loaders, 26 light towers, five air compressors and nine generators -- had to 
arrive in good working condition. And tons of steel and timber had to be 
delivered on time. When the railroad couldn't fetch steel beams quickly enough, 
Myers agreed to pay an extra $119,000 to have them delivered within three days 
by train.  
</P>
<P>
 Janco can't remember how many bridges he's built, there have been so many. But 
for project engineer Dermot Fallon, 26, his graduate engineering degree newly 
minted from Long Beach State, the counting was easy -- this was his first. 
"This is the project of a lifetime, right here. This is the whole reason I 
wanted to get into construction, to build a job like this," he says. "This job 
has it all. You got the pain and you got the glory. I can see myself in 30 
years driving with my kid, saying 'Son, I built this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Every now and then, in little snatches of time, it dawned on Fallon that his 
life would soon change. Fallon plans to marry in November. But on the bridge he 
could think of little besides surveying. Sometimes he awakened in a panic in 
the middle of the night, fretting that he had made a mistake.  
</P>
<P>
 "This job never leaves you. This job doesn't begin at 7 and end at 7 -- you 
are making decisions on the radio, the second you leave the house," says 
Fallon, who lives in Long Beach. "Everything has been put on hold for this job. 
No surfin', no nothing. This job, you are pushing, pushing, pushing -- there's 
no time to get ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 His day started at 6:15 a.m. and ended somewhere between nine to 20 hours 
later. On other jobs, he'd had time to sit down and study the plans, but on 
this one, the plans kept changing. He'd stand out on falsework giving orders 
based on the sketches in his hand when a Caltrans inspector would walk over to 
tell him that there were now new plans. During the first three weeks of work, 
this sometimes happened every day. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 25 Caltrans inspectors, clad in white jumpsuits and orange 
safety vests with blue hard hats, checking and double-checking the work, making 
sure it was in accordance with the plan and building codes. They earned 
anywhere from $16 to $26 per hour, with time-and-a-half for overtime. Inspector 
Lillian Yan, a petite, soft-spoken woman with her black hair pulled back in a 
ponytail, roamed the site with the tools of her trade: a spool of ribbons and a 
tape measure in her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 During her 12-hour shifts, she measured the depth of cement, spaces between 
steel bars and all the other details. If she found a mistake, the workers did 
it over, Yan says firmly. She combed the bridge, tagging errors with the 
ribbons. Red for ironworkers, blue for carpenters, yellow for laborers. Only 
Yan or another inspector was allowed to remove the ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, maybe, she felt pressure, the burden of long hours and keeping pace 
with the workers. But it settled into an almost mesmerizing routine. When Yan, 
24, began working on the freeway, she says, "I just stopped the rest of my life 
for a while."  
</P>
<P>
 At best, inspectors are regarded as obstacles to progress. One superintendent 
jokes, "Every time I see those damn ribbons, I just pull them off."  
</P>
<P>
 Once the inspector gives the OK to pour, the finishers need a steady flow of 
concrete. But the concrete will begin to harden if it's in the mix trucks too 
long. Too many trucks can mean expensive waste; too few would hinder the work. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 31, there were not enough trucks. Myers got on the phone with the 
supplier. When he hires a subcontractor on this job, he gets the company head's 
home number, and he calls at any time of the day or night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Myers. Can we get more concrete on Venice? You're killing us. We're 
stopping and starting. I got my people hollering at me. I never had nobody 
hollering at me like that." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a pause as he listened to the response. "You'll have to do better," 
he said coldly. Within the hour, a dozen trucks lined up, their drivers napping 
as they waited for their turn to service the pourer. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarissa Hinman was foreman of the concrete finishers, a rare woman in this 
predominantly male world and one of a handful of women foremen at Myers. Now 
50, she lost her job as a social worker counseling battered women 15 years ago 
and has been a finisher ever since. In the beginning, she tried to go to 
graduate school, too. But she had so little time for her daughter that she had 
to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was much more excited about learning a trade, being outdoors," says Hinman, 
who grew up on a farm. Softly, so no one will hear, she says, "I'm a feminist." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Hinman couldn't pick up a 100-pound sack of sand -- but she learned. 
"I'm tough. Straightforward and bossy," she says. "I like the physical work, I 
like working hard. It's tangible." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinman, exacting and precise, is now a connoisseur of concrete pours. "In a 
bridge, everything has to be supremely flat, pleasing to the eye," she says. 
"It's got to be classy, smooth. It's our job to finish it properly, so other 
workers can do their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Concrete finisher David Vargas and his fellow concrete finishers pulled on 
tall rubber boots, many of them using duct tape to bind the boots to their 
pants so concrete couldn't slide in. They stepped into shin-deep fresh 
concrete, following the nozzle of the pourer, then, bent nearly double, used 
shovels to distribute the concrete evenly and floats to smooth it. "Chemicals 
in the concrete make it really hot," says Vargas, who earns $20.26 an hour. 
"It's not really hot at first. When it starts setting, steam comes off. You 
yank your legs up to take a step; it's like 10 pounds on your legs. Wherever 
you step, you've got to cover it up. You step, you fix. You step, you fix." 
</P>
<P>
 When the pour began, Vargas was eager to show that he was a good worker. He 
had been employed only eight months last year, and is saving to weather the 
next dry spell. "It's very competitive in construction," says the finisher from 
Pico Rivera. "You have got to prove yourself. We go 100 miles per hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas and the others are well aware that they are easily replaced in a 
recession-plagued industry, in which union officials say that between 35% and 
50% of their members are unemployed. On the Santa Monica project, which used 
only union labor, dozens of men and women showed up day and night pleading for 
a job, any job -- even washing the company cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't do it, and do it right, someone else will," says Billy Herrera, 
41, a labor foreman who drove almost two hours to his Ventura County home when 
he finished his 12-hour shift. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs don't wait, workers say. Joe Alvarez's wife was expecting their 
fourth baby. But Alvarez, a crane oiler from Upland, was employed only seven 
months last year and didn't figure he'd accompany his wife to the hospital for 
the baby's birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've kinda got it stuck in the back of my mind," says Alvarez, 35. "But times 
have been hard -- you have to take advantage of when the work is there." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Anna Alvarez went into labor on a Saturday night after her 
husband came home from work. While he slept, she drove herself to the hospital 
because she wasn't sure if she was in labor and he was so exhausted. She called 
him and he joined her at the hospital before she delivered their baby, 
Kathleen. Alvarez took the day off. 
</P>
<P>
 BEFORE THE FREEWAY opened, even before the concrete had dried, the politicking 
reached a frenzy. The prize was a grand one, early completion of the Santa 
Monica Freeway -- an unsullied example of government working as Angelenos would 
hope. Yet there were questions: Had Caltrans miscalculated, was that why Myers 
finished early? Had the state been rooked? 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials say that all the Santa Monica bids were within range of 
Myers', and that those bids, in part, set the parameters of the project. "We 
want a quality job, and we want it done safely," Roberts says. "We don't want 
to push people too close to the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 But such explanations couldn't fully allay the sticker shock of Myers' huge 
bonus. "Caltrans still doesn't understand project management, they obviously 
thought it would take six months to do the Santa Monica," says Assemblyman 
Richard Katz. "To be able to shave almost two months off that project makes me 
wonder if this contractor is going to reap a windfall because Caltrans did such 
a poor job estimating." 
</P>
<P>
 Even amid such complaints, however, everyone wanted to claim credit for 
restoring the freeway that cost the local economy $1 million a day in delayed 
deliveries and service. On Monday, April 4, federal officials -- who footed the 
bill on the Santa Monica's reconstruction -- and Mayor Richard Riordan's staff 
were told that the freeway would not open for "weeks." The very next day, 
Wilson upstaged them by announcing that the freeway would open seven days 
hence.  
</P>
<P>
 The opening ceremony was scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday, April 12, although 
traffic would flow as soon as the barrier rails and signs were in place. It was 
meant to be a gala event, attended by Vice President Al Gore and Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena, as well as Riordan and Wilson. But on the eve of the 
planned hoopla, Caltrans officials announced that the freeway would open later 
that night at 11 o'clock, April 11 -- in time for the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, Riordan and Pena -- the latter of whom was reached 90 minutes before 
the event -- attended the impromptu press conference. The other federal 
dignitaries, however, had not yet arrived. When Myers showed up with his 
friends, a Highway Patrol officer brusquely ordered them to move their cars to 
make way for the governor's motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Taines, Myers' real estate partner and longtime friend, turned to him, and 
asked: "Have they paid for the freeway yet? If they haven't paid, they can't 
tell you where to park." 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopters hovered overhead, scores of television cameras lined the freeway 
as the politicians removed the orange cones that had blocked the cars. Myers, 
standing with his wife, Janelle, watched from the freeway shoulder. Motorists, 
honking and cheering, surged forward. The job was done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen an opening like this. Watsonville didn't have one-quarter of 
this," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The very next day, under a hot sun beside the freeway, there were 
congratulatory speeches. Myers, dressed in a black suit, was asked to sit with 
Caltrans officials and dignitaries on the podium. Myers' lieutenants turned out 
for the occasion. Janco wore a suit. Kojak wore clean jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore presented Myers and several Caltrans officials with a hammer, adorned 
with red, white and blue ribbon, set in a gold frame. The note read: "Thanks 
for rebuilding the bridge and for helping to rebuild America's trust in 
government, Al Gore." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience cheered. Dozens of cameras were thrust forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Kojak rolled his eyes. "It's just a bridge."

THE CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS -- AT A TIME WHEN IT NEVER HAD A WORRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIE ZAD, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Old folks feel free to tell the young ones about the good old days, but the 
young ones clearly don't enjoy listening to those tales over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are a couple of wonderful videos that provide an opportunity to see 
New York as it used to be: a big city where fear did not dominate; where street 
crimes and drug wars were not in the neighborhoods, which were filled with 
people who lived and played happily in ethnic clans and intermingled. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in row houses, where doors were not locked, people helped each other 
through the rough days of the Great Depression, and a Sunday trip to Coney 
Island was a super treat. 
</P>
<P>
 These one-hour videos are titled "New York the Way It Was" and the recently 
released sequel "New York the Way It Was, the Old Neighborhood." They were 
produced by New York public television stations WLIW21 and Thirteen/WNET. 
</P>
<P>
 The videos capture a lot of what's to love about the good old days: pictures 
artfully spliced with comments by renowned natives including Alan King, Lou 
Carnesecca, Pete Hamill, Gov. Mario Cuomo, ex-mayor Ed Koch, Roberta Peters, 
Carlos Ortiz and Floyd Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 One sees and hears how the neighborhoods of old New York were like giant 
communes, where immigrants filled a need to be with their own, and they 
provided a texture and protection that gave residents a strong sense of 
security. They made people creative, resilient and friendly, propelling them to 
work hard, play hard and love profoundly. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a glimpse of vendors who brought their stores to the people -- sellers 
of ice, milk, fruits and vegetables, and dealers of junk. Children played 
memorable games in the hallways of the tenements and in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a tour of Coney Island, where fathers took their families for 
special treats (a nickel for an ice cream or a hot dog), and a swing through 
Times Square, capturing the sounds and sights at the crossroads of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a simpler time when everyone had a neighborhood, a self-contained world 
that gave one an identity. Where have you gone, old New York?

FABULOUS BREAKFASTS, SPLENDID LUNCHES; TOPS OF THE MORNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila, S. Irene Virbila joined The Times as restaurant critic in 
February. Also contributing to breakfast and lunch sections are free-lance 
writers Max Jacobson, restaurant reviewer for The Times' San Fernando Valley 
and Orange County editions, and Colman Andrews, author of Everything on the 
Table: Plain Talk About Food & Wine, published by Bantam, and The Menu: Los 
Angeles and Vicinity, by David Thomas Publishing.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Italians have a wonderful saying: A tavola non si invecchia mai -- "At 
table, you never grow old." While it's not strictly true (would that it were), 
time does seem to slow down when you're fully engaged in the pleasures of 
eating. Fortunately, each of us gets at least three chances a day to set back 
the clock, spending meals lost in thought, conversing with friends or doing a 
pleasurable bit of business.  
</P>
<P>
 For this annual restaurant feature, we've concentrated on the two less 
heralded meals of the day: breakfast and lunch, a different kind of restaurant 
experience that, in some cases, is another side of a familiar restaurant's 
menu. We've searched out the city's most satisfying breakfasts and considered 
the leisurely, indulgent lunches at some of our favorite restaurants. And since 
snacking is as natural to Angelenos as daydreaming or driving the freeways, 
we've also collected an array of unusual and irresistible street foods -- a 
small sampling of the myriad traditional treats tucked away in unexpected 
corners of this diverse city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When getting out of the house on time in the morning begins to take on all the 
urgency of a 100-yard dash, the idea of a civilized breakfast can sometimes 
seem irrelevant. I'm not talking about breakfast on the run -- a jolt of 
espresso and a croissant -- but the genuine article, a real sit-down breakfast 
enjoyed with family and friends or as the start of a business day. This first 
meal, if it's a good one, is a marvelous restorative, and it's one of Los 
Angeles' great delights. Chances are, there will be sunlight. Almost certainly 
there will be freshly squeezed orange juice and an oversized cappuccino.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether you opt for huevos rancheros , a dizzying array of dim sum, 
lemon-scented pancakes or an elegant variation on eggs Benedict, breakfast just 
may turn out to be the best restaurant meal you've had in recent memory. The 
simplest things are often the best: farm-fresh eggs delicately scrambled, warm 
slabs of toast spread with sweet butter or preserves, a bowl of steel-cut 
oatmeal. A delicious first meal sets the tone for the rest of the day: 
optimistic, satisfied, at peace with the world. Whether it's a once-a-week 
affair or an occasional indulgence, a good breakfast can do wonders to soothe 
frayed spirits. CAMPANILE 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Silverton is my designated dessert chef. She's a technical wizard, 
marvelously inventive, and her sweets are never too sweet. And when she takes 
on morning pastries, she gets very serious indeed. The morning fare at 
Campanile could include tender creme fraiche coffee cake or spiraled chocolate 
espresso wheels. Or maybe fresh ginger scones or a warm pear crisp. With all 
these baked goods to tempt us, why would anyone settle for toast and jam? 
Because the toast is her substantial La Brea Bakery bread, the sophisticated 
preserves handmade. For a more formal breakfast, there are soft-boiled eggs 
with delicate blue shells served in marble egg cups with short lengths of 
toasted, buttered ficelle. And to drink: killer lattes and hot chocolate with 
homemade marshmallow. The best seats are in the sunny atrium, where a vintage 
blue-and-gold tiled fountain gurgles and the day's newspapers are draped over 
an old-fashioned wooden rack. Don't rush off, however, without picking up a 
loaf of olive bread or some of the thyme-scented dinner rolls from the 
adjoining bakery. 624 S. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 938-1447. Breakfast 
served Monday through Friday, 8-11 a.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 8 a.m.-1:30 p.m. 
Cash only. ROCKENWAGNER 
</P>
<P>
 Set at the back of Frank Gehry's eccentric Edgemar complex, Rockenwagner 
offers a unique breakfast experience on weekends. It can be as simple as one of 
the German-style pastries or strudels from the deli eaten at an umbrella-shaded 
table in front. Inside, the upholstered booths may be the most comfortable 
breakfast seat in town. First comes a basket of breads, the best a whole-grain 
roll in a shaggy jacket of oats. The fluffy, not-too-sweet German apple pancake 
is crisped at the edges, custardy within, topped with strawberries and creme 
fraiche. Steel-cut oatmeal is dressed up in a mosaic of berries, bananas and 
toasted hazelnuts glazed with sugar. If you like -- and I do like -- you can 
pour cream over it. Tender, eggy brioche is turned into French toast armored 
with sliced almonds. The sour-cherry butter is so good, I soon forget all about 
maple syrup. They do simple things well, too, like the soft-scrambled eggs with 
charred Black Forest ham or thick smoky bacon, fat and crisp. 2435 Main St., 
Santa Monica; (310) 399-6504. Brunch served Saturday and Sunday, 9 a.m.-2:30 
p.m. All major credit cards accepted. KOKOMO 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the morning at the old Farmers Market, seniors from the neighborhood, 
producers from CBS next door and all manner of other folk stop in for 
breakfast. Some of the stalls are still setting up. And it's rarely a problem 
getting a table with enough elbow room to read the paper. At the retro diner 
Kokomo, breakfasts of heroic proportions can be ordered at the requisite 
counter or at tables in the open-air. A sturdy French-roast coffee, black as 
crude oil, is poured into inch-thick mugs. You can always count on the eggs 
done just the way you want them, with good whole-wheat toast or apple-cinnamon 
coffee cake if you like. Don't stop there; order a generous side of the 
superior, thick, double-smoked bacon. Kokomo's pancakes are fluffy and stacked 
to the rafters. And some of the specials are so good, they've become regulars. 
Like the genteel eggs sardou : two perfectly poached eggs set on artichoke 
bottoms, napped with hollandaise and shored up with some fine creamed spinach. 
The pain perdu ("lost bread"), a.k.a. French toast, comes a couple of inches 
thick, freckled from the griddle and topped with apples, nuts and the diner's 
own maple-blend syrup. 6333 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles; (213) 933-0773. Breakfast 
served Monday through Friday, 8 a.m.-2:30 p.m.; Saturdays 8 a.m.-3 p.m., 
Sundays, 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Cash only. CAFE ZINC 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach is the St. Tropez of California. And at Cafe Zinc, Laguna's most 
bohemian spot, you breakfast outdoors amid fragrant tropical plants while birds 
warble melodiously in the background. Grab one of the zinc-topped tables, the 
cafe's trademark, then get in line with the artists and locals to order. (This 
place fills up by 10 a.m. with the precision of a Swiss clock.) Food is mostly 
light, uncomplicated fare in the mold of a great European cafe; wonderfully 
buttery homemade scones, Italian style frittate, grainy millet muffins. For 
breakfast purists, there are perfect poached eggs on La Brea Bakery sourdough 
toast and cappuccinos with lacy froth. When the sun is bright, few can resist a 
lush glass of peach juice or a bowlful of the cafe's rich, nutty granola, which 
comes topped with a symphony of fresh berries. -- M.J. 350 Ocean Ave., Laguna 
Beach; (714) 494-6302. Breakfast served Monday through Saturday, 7-11 a.m., 
Sunday 7-11:45 a.m. Cash only. LA SERENATA DE GARIBALDI 
</P>
<P>
 Come Sunday, I think about breakfast at Serenata de Garibaldi. It doesn't 
start until 10. By now, the mariachi bands are already serenading 1st Street. 
Tiny girls in frothy frocks clutch their mothers' hands, and the sun is high in 
the sky. Inside this venerable Mexican restaurant, it is cool and dark. When we 
order, a woman in the kitchen works the wooden handle of a tortilla press. 
Minutes later, our waitress offers a basket of steaming, freshly made corn 
tortillas. I've never had better huevos rancheros : Break into the eggs with 
your fork, and the yolk flows into the fragrant, fresh tomato sauce. A small 
bowl of juicy pinto beans accompanies each order. Fold the machaca (stewed 
beef, shredded and mixed into soft scrambled eggs) or the cruzados (eggs 
scrambled with strips of black-green pasilla pepper and golden coins of potato) 
into the tender tortillas. Chilaquiles verdes -- stiff tortilla triangles 
cooked in green sauce with melted cheese and a couple of fried eggs on top -- 
is the best version in town. 1842 E. 1st St., Los Angeles (Boyle Heights); 
(213) 265-2887. Breakfast served Sundays only, 10 a.m.-2 p.m. All major credit 
cards accepted . BEL-AIR HOTEL 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how many times I've turned off Sunset and taken sun-dappled Stone 
Canyon Road up to the Bel-Air Hotel, I'm astonished to find such a luxurious 
country retreat in the midst of the city. The hotel dining room is posh, but, 
to tell the truth, I've never eaten inside. At breakfast, the outdoor terrace 
sheltered by an extravagant pergola of bougainvillea beckons too strongly. The 
best tables are set in a semicircular alcove overlooking the hotel's romantic 
garden and a pond where giant swans preen while, sometimes, a bride spreads her 
train on the grass and smiles into the camera. The service is swell, and, 
surprise, the cappuccino is among the best in town. The kitchen does a very 
good job with haute hotel breakfast dishes like eggs Benedict or the 
house-smoked salmon with cream cheese and a confetti of red onions and capers. 
Lemon pancakes are laced with lemon zest and heaped with berries. On the 
lighter side, try the pretty mango-strawberry yogurt frappe. I'm also a big fan 
of the homemade vanilla yogurt. This is not the least expensive breakfast in 
town, by any means. But the setting is fabulous, the breakfast very fine, and 
an hour or two here is as restorative as a couple of days in the country. 701 
Stone Canyon Road, Los Angeles; (310) 472-1211. Breakfast served daily, 7-10:30 
a.m. All major credit cards accepted. A THOUSAND CRANES 
</P>
<P>
 This restaurant in the New Otani Hotel looks onto a rooftop Japanese garden of 
serene pools and walkways. When you order the traditional Japanese breakfast, a 
kimono-clad waitress will first pour you a cup of strong green tea and then 
come back minutes later with a lacquered tray covered with a series of little 
dishes. Seaweed floats in the warming miso soup. As you nibble on the broiled 
pompano garnished with a pile of sweet soybeans, she'll replenish your bowl of 
steamed rice. This protein-rich breakfast is punctuated with puckery cucumber 
pickles. The poached egg in a light broth can be eaten straight or mixed into 
the rice with your chopsticks. In place of tofu, you can choose natto 
(fermented soybeans) or yamaimo (a glutinous, grated mountain yam) topped with 
a raw quail's egg. There's also Japanese rice porridge, if you like, served 
from a sizzling iron pot and garnished with sour salted plums and thick, syrupy 
soy sauce. Outside, guests photograph each other in front of the waterfall. 120 
S. Los Angeles St., Los Angeles; (213) 629-1200. Breakfast served daily, 7-10 
a.m. All major credit cards accepted. WEST BEACH CAFE 
</P>
<P>
 At this quintessential neighborhood restaurant, grab a table on the breezy 
patio furnished with feathery tall palms, green metal garden chairs and canvas 
umbrellas. Warm miniature scones are so buttery and crumbly that I have to stop 
myself from eating the entire basket. The Mexican breakfast fits huevos 
rancheros , molten quesadilla, a chile relleno napped with thin salsa verde, 
black beans and a dab of guacamole all on one plate. The bowl of creamy polenta 
topped with a poached egg and a light tomato sauce laced with grilled red 
peppers and zucchini makes an unusual and perfectly delicious breakfast. I tend 
to favor the tall Belgian waffle with lots of fresh berries or the eggs 
scrambled with smoked salmon or shrimp and spinach risotto croquettes. After, 
you can work off this indulgent breakfast with a brisk stroll or bike ride 
along the beach. 60 N. Venice Blvd., Venice; (310) 823-5396. Breakfast served 
Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m.-2 p.m. All major credit cards accepted. 
BURRELL'S BARBECUE 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Burrell's good country cooking has spawned a minor empire here in Orange 
County; the friendly North Carolinian has been synonymous with good barbecue 
for a dozen years. This is a modest restaurant with lots of blue vinyl booths 
and a distinctly industrial look. There are terrific smothered biscuits doused 
with bittersweet red-eye gravy, excellent Hancock's country ham that Burrell 
has trucked in from Franklin, N.C., thick slab bacon, homemade sausage, grits 
and small crocks of spiced stewed apples. Hearty appetites can try the 
three-egg breakfasts with smoked pork chops, hot link sausage or fried catfish, 
served with a mountain of home fries and a choice of baked treats. The corn 
bread, made fresh daily, is worth a detour all on its own. -- M.J. 14962 Sand 
Canyon Road, Irvine; (714) 786- 0451. Breakfast served Monday through Friday, 
6-11 a.m., Saturday and Sunday , 6 a.m.-1 p.m. MasterCard and Visa accepted. 
BRENT'S DELI 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Earthquake of '94 has temporarily reduced Art's to a pile of 
rubble, Brent's has inherited the mantle of the Valley's best breakfast stop. 
Overlook the green-and-beige-vinyl, airport-lounge ambience, and dig into 
reasonably priced platters like Ron's special brunch: eggs any style, one of 
the deli's delicate smoked fish, fresh bagels, home fries, assorted pickles, 
various garnishes and coffee. It's all a modest $9.95. Omelets come stuffed 
with corned beef or chicken livers; lighter eaters can try pungent creamed 
herring or the wispy cracker-and-egg scramble called matzo brie . Brent's menu 
reads like a wish list of deli fantasies: lean corned beef, blintzes with 
farmer's cheese and strawberry preserves, even fried kippers and onions. Float 
everything down with an egg cream, a cool, foam-topped fountain drink fashioned 
out of milk, soda and chocolate syrup. -- M.J. 19565 Parthenia St., Northridge; 
(818) 886-5679. Breakfast specials served daily, 6-11 a.m.; regular breakfasts, 
6 a.m.-9 p.m. All major credit cards accepted. SADDLE PEAK LODGE 
</P>
<P>
 Take an incomparable location in Malibu Canyon, a vast log cabin dominated by 
a massive stone fireplace, and throw a little good cooking into the mix. The 
result? Romance, pure and simple. Saddle Peak Lodge began life as a one-room 
cabin almost 90 years ago; today, it is a full-blown retreat. The main dining 
room has an open beamed ceiling, and outside is a lovely back patio with a real 
waterfall. Brunch is a sumptuous affair. Everyone starts with a basket of 
croissants, sugary muffins and fluffy baking-powder biscuits, then chooses 
starter and main course. The light, quiche-like wild-mushroom-and-onion pie is 
the best appetizer. Poached eggs on sauteed crab cakes with golden caviar and 
hollandaise, a twist on eggs Benedict, makes an exemplary finish. -- M.J. 419 
Cold Canyon Road, Calabasas; (818) 222-3888. Brunch served Saturdays and 
Sundays, 11 a.m.-2 p.m. All major credit cards accepted. HARBOR VILLAGE 
</P>
<P>
 Every other weekend or so, I like to drive out to Monterey Park for dim sum at 
Harbor Village. The cooks make dozens of kinds every day, but the biggest 
selection is on Saturday and Sunday. That's when the glittering dining room is 
filled with multi-generational Chinese families. Babies sit in their mothers' 
or grandmothers' laps; groups of friends chat over tea and growing stacks of 
little dishes as waitresses pass by with cart after cart stocked with dim sum. 
Ham sui gok (oily rice-flour dumpling with minced-bean stuffing)? Or dan tat 
(flaky miniature pastry cups holding a delicate egg custard)? Everybody has 
their favorites; these are some of mine: the dainty, gelatinous spareribs; 
supple rice noodles stuffed with barbecued pork, shrimp or even scallops. The 
siu mai , transparent dumplings topped with shrimp and flying-fish roe, are 
particularly good here. So is the steamed turnip cake and the taro-root cake 
larded with bits of pork. And I can't pass up the boon tong gao ("half-soup 
dumpling"), which fills a small bowl. Break into it, and a rich stock laced 
with pork and diced mushrooms turns this "dumpling" into a soup. 111 N. 
Atlantic Blvd., Monterey Park; (818) 300-8833. Breakfast served Monday through 
Friday, 11 a.m.-2:30 p.m.; weekends 10 a.m.-2:30 p . m. All major credit cards 
accepted.

FABULOUS BREAKFASTS, SPLENDID LUNCHES; LOST IN THE AFTERNOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At dinner, unless you take the last reservation on the book, someone is 
inevitably waiting for your table and anxiously charting the course of your 
meal. Finished dessert yet? Asked for the bill? Time's up. And time, it seems, 
gets in the way of savoring the experience. The waiter is in a rush. The cooks 
are working double-time, yet the food is slow coming from the kitchen. You 
would like to linger over the wine, but it's already late, and it's a long 
drive home. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why, when I really want a wonderful meal, I'll often opt for lunch. And 
when I do, I have certain restaurants in mind, places where I can easily lose 
all sense of time, where the menus offer a plenitude of enticing possibilities. 
On these rare occasions, my goal is not a quick lunch but an entire afternoon 
lost in good conversation and the pleasures of the table. It's even more of a 
luxury to put yourself in the hands of the chef and ask him or her to 
orchestrate the menu and the wines. Indulgent? Yes. Every once in a while, we 
all need some time out. VALENTINO 
</P>
<P>
 When I find myself missing Italy, the very best antidote is lunch at 
Valentino. It's a Fridays-only event, attended by wine buffs, Italophiles and 
outright sensualists who settle in for a long, splendid lunch at this 
outstanding restaurant. Owner Piero Selvaggio greets each guest at the door; 
behind the scenes, chef Angelo Auriana, who hails from Bergamo, waits at the 
stoves. To get the very best from the experience, ask Selvaggio to make a 
special menu. He'll inquire whether you prefer just three small dishes or want 
to keep them coming. Say yes to the latter; you won't find more authentic 
Italian cooking anywhere outside Italy. And what comes from the kitchen -- 
bruschetta with sea urchin, for example, or a single scallop and a fan of 
porcini mushroom slices, garganelle and house-made sausage in a tomato sauce -- 
is the very taste of Italy, pure in its freshness and simplicity.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you'll drink Italian. You can spend a long time studying the 
superlative, fairly priced wine list, but you're better off enlisting 
Selvaggio's advice. He can suggest not only the renowned labels but also wines 
from small, hard-to-find Italian producers. One afternoon, it was 5 when we 
finally headed for the door. We were not the last by any means -- a fact that 
makes Valentino feel even more like Italy. That's why it's such a shock when 
you find not the hills of Tuscany or Umbria, but Pico Boulevard outside the 
door. 3115 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica; (310) 829-4313. Lunch served Fridays only. 
All major credit cards accepted. CITRUS 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever possible, I take a table with a view of a restaurant's kitchen. At 
Citrus, the show alone is worth the price of admission, especially for the 
interplay between Michel Richard and chef de cuisine Alain Giraud.  
</P>
<P>
 If the peripatetic Richard happens to be in town, leave the menu to him. He 
won't necessarily play it safe, but he seems to do some of his best cooking 
when he's let loose in the kitchen to experiment. Most dishes turn out 
brilliantly; occasionally, one or two will miss the mark. I'll take the chance 
because Richard's food is rarely boring or predictable. He may start one day 
with poached eggs perched on a bed of braised leeks with an aromatic red wine 
and mushroom sauce. To drink? Pinot Noir, bien sur ! Next he might ply you with 
an earthy soup of spinach and peas studded with sweet, meaty scallops and 
follow that with a gratin of potato with plump, juicy mussels tucked under a 
blanket of mashed potato. Then perhaps a saute of rognons and foie gras with 
fingerling potatoes. As for dessert, well, that's the true love of this former 
patissier. Settled in the ample green wicker armchairs, one can happily linger 
over the array of sweets. 6703 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 857-0034. Lunch 
served Monday through Friday. All major credit cards accepted . DRAI'S 
</P>
<P>
 Friday afternoon at Drai's, the famous and the mostly not-so-famous slip into 
this trendy West Hollywood restaurant for a sociable lunch. The people-watching 
is first-rate (where else would a courtly older gentleman actually kiss a 
lady's hand?). Inside the cool, softly lit dining rooms, the art of 
conversation seems to be making a definite revival. The menu features 
ponytailed French chef Claude Segal's elegant composed salads, including a 
lovely one of lobster with bright ribbons of vegetables and a perky citrus 
dressing. His variations on a tart theme adorn fragile disks of puff pastry 
with artichokes, sweet peppers and goat cheese or sweet basil and organic 
tomatoes perfumed with balsamic vinegar. The French fries are flawless. Grilled 
swordfish is moist; the filet of beef perfectly cooked, the chicken napped in a 
fragrant rosemary sauce. All in all, a very civilized lunch. The ideal ending? 
Adjourn to a super-soft sofa in the lounge for dessert and a demitasse of 
coffee. 730 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood; (310) 358-8585. Lunch served 
Fridays only. All major credit cards accepted. YUJEAN KANG 
</P>
<P>
 Like a jazz saxophonist riffing a familiar tune, owner-chef Yujean Kang 
snatches bits of flavors and techniques from China and the West and puts them 
together in an entirely fresh way. It's the exotic play of flavors and the 
chance of discovering a new dish that makes an excursion to this red-walled 
restaurant so much fun.  
</P>
<P>
 With a few friends in tow, I can spend a couple of hours over lunch. We'll 
often start with a German Spatlese from Kang's varied and interesting list. 
It's a wine that plays to the opulent flavors of old favorites -- lobster with 
caviar and fava beans, pork loin with mustard greens and chiles and Chilean sea 
bass in an updated sweet-and-sour passion-fruit sauce with shreds of kumquat -- 
and a new dish of fresh Louisiana shrimp with custardy deep-fried polenta in a 
green sauce of scallions and cilantro. You can order from either the lunch or 
the dinner menus or ask Kang to make a menu and choose the wines. No other 
Chinese restaurant in the country offers the chance to combine Chinese food 
with such serious wines. For dessert, there's no contest: the mandarin orange 
cheesecake. 67 N. Raymond Ave., Pasadena; (818) 585-0855. Lunch served daily. 
All major credit cards accepted. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment your car rolls into the regal courtyard at this luxurious 
Beverly Hills hotel, the world outside falls away. In the dining room, a 
well-turned-out fantasy of parquetry floors, demure velvet sofas and leather 
armchairs, tables are arranged on two levels. The city outside the pale 
Austrian shades could be London or Vienna as easily as Beverly Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 The watchful maitre d' is right there when you are ready, taking your order 
and pouring your wine. A fortune for lunch? Mais non -- not if you order 
prudently. The prix fixe business luncheon is $23 for three courses. (If you're 
not in a hurry, ask them to slow down the promised 45-minute pace.) It might 
begin as it did one recent afternoon, with a delicious pea-and-fava-bean soup 
garnished with chanterelles, followed by a quite respectable pepper-encrusted 
filet of beef, dessert and coffee. Or you could toss caution to the wind and 
splurge on Champagne, half a dozen oysters and the cold poached salmon with a 
graceful green mayonnaise. My choice for dessert? The Beverly Hills cheesecake, 
an individual round enriched with mascarpone and crowned with fresh berries, 
accompanied by a soupcon of whipped cream. 9500 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills; 
(310) 275-5200. Lunch served daily. All major credit cards accepted. GUSTAF 
ANDERS 
</P>
<P>
 The six-table, wrought-iron patio at Gustaf Anders is ideal for a languid, 
Nordic-style lunch. This is California's only first-rate Scandinavian 
restaurant, an austere, gallery-type space where chef Ulf Strandberg prepares 
wonderful herrings, cured-salmon dishes and open-face sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 Sit outside, sipping on the iced firewater known as aquavit, and an afternoon 
can disappear as easily as an Arctic sunset in winter. First you'll be offered 
a selection of house breads: dense Swedish limpa, chewy onion rolls, homemade 
Swedish crispbread studded with caraway. Then choose from a parade of 
delicacies like the remarkable house-pickled herring with Vasterbotten cheese, 
smoked salmon and black caviar on pumpernickel or grilled gravad lax with dill 
mustard sauce. At the finish, try the Swedish liqueur called punsch and one or 
two dromma , ethereal sugar cookies that dissolve on the palate like lightly 
packed snow. -- M.J. South Coast Plaza Village, 1651 Sunflower St., Santa Ana; 
(714) 668-1737. Lunch served Monday through Saturday. All major credit cards 
accepted. PINOT BISTRO 
</P>
<P>
 Joachim Splichal's Pinot is the Valley's best restaurant any time of the day, 
but this rustic, elegant room is especially pleasant on a spring afternoon, 
when sunlight penetrates the skylight and dances off the wood-beamed ceiling. 
The fare is upscale bistro, though chef Octavio Becerra occasionally throws a 
bit of haute into the mix. It's possible to have simple dishes like calf's 
liver with fried onions or roast farm chicken with French fries, even 
grandmotherly food like braised beef pot roast, the latter served with a 
casserole dish of the kitchen's creamy, crusty potato gratin. 
</P>
<P>
 But some like to take the high road, riding on appetizers like farinette -- a 
bread-and-cheese griddle cake with roasted shallots -- and savories such as 
crispy seafood cakes with brown butter or imaginative Pacific Rim-style main 
dishes like seared Pacific sea bass a la "Chinoise," flaky and fragrant with 
ginger essence, pickled shallots and shiitake mushrooms. -- M.J. 12969 Ventura 
Blvd., Studio City; (818) 990-0500. Lunch served Monday through Friday. All 
major credit cards accepted. THE STONEHOUSE RESTAURANT 
</P>
<P>
 If you happen to live in the Santa Barbara area and are looking for the 
perfect place for a long, lazy lunch, I can think of no better venue than the 
Stonehouse Restaurant at the San Ysidro Ranch. If you happen to live far from 
Santa Barbara, well, it's worth the drive. The ranch itself, a rustically posh 
resort in the hills of Montecito, has a positively bucolic feel to it, with 
acres of grounds framed with rustling eucalyptus trees. The handsome old 
stone-faced building that houses the dining room and exquisite terrace is part 
farmhouse, part country villa. The food is alternately homey and sophisticated, 
but always forthright, even bold. Pan-fried salmon cakes with lobster aioli are 
fish cakes apotheosized, creamy and vivid. Tortilla soup, though a bit 
overloaded with chicken, avocado and cheddar, is deep and rich in flavor. There 
are lightly fried calamari, a satisfyingly plump burger -- and pine-nut-crust 
mascarpone cheesecake or a root-beer float (among other things) for dessert. -- 
C.A. 900 San Ysidro Lane, Montecito; (805) 969-4100. Lunch served Monday 
through Saturday; Sunday brunch. All major credit cards accepted. GRANITA 
</P>
<P>
 Two good things about Granita are its location in Malibu and its decor -- 
elegantly wacky and plenty of fun. An even better thing is that the food is 
simply terrific -- one bright, delicious dish after another.  
</P>
<P>
 The Caesar salad, tasting little of anchovies but fully of excellent olive 
oil, is crisp and well coated, and accentuated perfectly by little wedges of " 
bruschetta " (really more a thin-crust pizza) topped with fresh goat cheese and 
chopped tomatoes. The signature chopped Chino vegetable salad (using top-notch 
produce from the legendary Chino Ranch in Rancho Santa Fe) -- haricots verts , 
carrots, peas, celery, tomato, radicchio, various lettuces and more -- is an 
edible jewelbox of colors and flavors. Sandwiches are superlative: for 
instance, a club transfigured with meltingly tender lobster and crunchy, smoky 
bacon on pecan toast. You can smell the savory pastas, with pesto or wild 
mushrooms, say, from across the table; the fish glistens with freshness; the 
pizza devastates cliche. This is a place you want to stay all afternoon, not 
lingering but eating. -- C.A. Malibu Colony Plaza, 23725 W. Malibu Rd., Malibu; 
(310) 456-0488. Lunch served Wednesday through Friday. MasterCard and Visa 
accepted. L'ORANGERIE 
</P>
<P>
 There can be few places in the heart of the city that feel less like L.A. than 
the garden, interior court and garden-like dining room of this unfailingly 
refined, and genuinely French, restaurant. Sit in the inside court and order a 
glass of Champagne or Loire rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignore the ambitiously blond starlet type in the red leather mini and the 
office trio discussing their pyschiatric awakenings, and pretend you are in 
France. The food will certainly help. It is food arranged, taken trouble with, 
often ornate almost to the edge of preciousness -- and it tastes wonderful. The 
Provencal-style petit farcis , little vegetables stuffed with meat and herbs, 
are perhaps a bit too polite (this is a rustic dish, after all), but they taste 
fine; and the plate, displaying wisps of herbs around the edges, is as pretty 
as a poster. Leek lovers will swoon over the gateau de poireaux : great, 
upright leeks atop a bit of pastry, with a wiry tangle of fried leeks on top. 
The John Dory poached in milk and the potato-slice-crusted chicken-and-mushroom 
pie are as right as they are unusual. And for dessert, here in this French 
garden, what else but a fresh fruit tart on a buttery firm crust? -- C.A. 903 
N. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles; (310) 652-9770. Lunch served Tuesday through 
Friday. All major credit cards accepted. REX IL RISTORANTE 
</P>
<P>
 The food at Rex is, of course, Italian -- sometimes recognizably so, as with 
fettuccine alla trapanese (with pesto trapanese , tomatoes and slivered 
almonds) or a recent special of pumpkin-filled ravioli tossed in browned 
butter. In other cases, the food is so contemporary that it's hard to say just 
where its inspirations lie -- as with a delicate, tiny salad of sliced pigeon 
breast with thin bits of pumpkin, raisins and "cornfield lettuce" (i.e., mache) 
or a sort of torta of potato slices and sea bass dressed with thyme-flavored 
olive oil. It all seems decadently luxurious -- partly because of the quality 
of the ingredients and the obvious care taken with the preparation, and partly 
because (in the European mode) prices are the same at lunchtime as they are for 
dinner -- and dinner isn't cheap. C.A. 617 S. Olive St., Los Angeles; (213) 
627-2300. Lunch served Thursday and Friday. Major credit cards accepted. SONG 
LONG 
</P>
<P>
 The lyrically named Song Long is basic and cheerful, a Vietnamese-French cafe 
and bakery. Enjoy a quick meal here, then spend the rest of the afternoon 
exploring the herb shops, markets and bookstores of Westminster's amazing 
Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Song Long's menu is the neighborhood's most eclectic. Try an Asian-inspired 
take on lobster Thermidor, a classic beef Burgundy or pate chaud , a meat pie 
filled with pork, liver and onion wrapped by a distinctly French pastry crust. 
The best Vietnamese dishes include rice cooked in a clay pot with pork ribs and 
chao tom , shrimp-wrapped sugar cane. When you order coffee, a metal 
contraption that takes forever to drip is placed directly on top of your cup. 
The coffee, though, is heavenly. -- M.J. 9361 Bolsa Ave., Westminster; (714) 
775-3724. Lunch served Tuesday through Sunday. Cash only.

'ANOTHER WORLD' TURNS 30 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is party time at "Another World." On Thursday, the show will mark its 30th 
anniversary by throwing a 1960s theme party to commemorate the 30th anniversary 
of the soap's fictional Cory Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Guarnieri, the show's new executive producer, promises many romantic 
twists and turns on this episode: Amanda Cory and Grant Harrison (Christine 
Tucci and Mark Pinter) will make an announcement at the party, Donna Hudson and 
Matt Cory (Anna Stuart and Matt Crane) will be at their zany best, and big 
doings will be in store for Rachel Cory and Carl Hutchins (Victoria Wyndham and 
Charles Keating). 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the party, Carl is missing. His archenemy, Jake McKinnon (Tom 
Eplin), has discovered Carl has invested millions in a pharmaceutical company. 
Could this have something to do with the missing "rain-forest drug"? It will 
surely give Rachel cause to worry about Carl's feelings for her. Look for 
answers at the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Wyndham, the show's longest-running regular, has been with the show 
for 22 years. She describes her stint as a "great gig," and sees Rachel as "a 
character who has kept growing and has kept her edges." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyndham would have been long gone had the character lost those edges. She 
feels Rachel has been a groundbreaking character. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rachel and Mac Cory (Douglass Watson) had the first May-December love story 
on soaps that came to fruition," she says. "Procter & Gamble was scared to 
death of what public reaction would be, and they nixed it at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later, when Rachel discovered her artistic talent, I really had soap's first 
women's liberation story line. It almost broke up Rachel and Mac's marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 She also feels the show had great courage in not finding another "core" family 
after the sudden death of Watson. Rachel became not only family matriarch but 
head of her husband's company -- and stayed that way for five years. Wyndham 
asks: "Would 'Dynasty' have been as bold?" 
</P>
<P>
 Guarnieri has been entrusted with the show's legacy since December, 1993. 
"Another World" has a loyal following but has trouble gaining new viewers. 
Guarnieri, a former vice president of daytime at ABC, was hired for her sound 
knowledge of what viewers want. 
</P>
<P>
 She wisely has made no massive changes. Instead, she wanted to "make a good 
show better -- day to day. I feel wonderful about the show. We tell good 
stories and have a fabulous cast. Proper promotion and advertising should get 
the people to come to the party. It is our job to keep them there." 
</P>
<P>
 Guarnieri gives us a sneak peek of what to expect: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rachel and Carl will build to a wedding. Will they or won't they tie the 
knot? 
</P>
<P>
 * Cass (Stephen Schnetzer) will be diagnosed as a manic-depressive, and 
something from his past will send him over the edge with his child. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maggie (Robyn Griggs) will share first love with Tomas (Diego Serrano), but 
Tomas has a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brett and Morgan (Colleen Dion and Grayson McCouch) will continue to 
interact, but Brett will develop an image problem. (The show will explore a 
woman feeling the pressures to be perfect.) Although Morgan does not pressure 
her, Brett will be thinking about cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 * John (David Forsyth) will have to see if he can love Kate as Kate, not 
Sharlene (Anna Holbrook.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Felicia Gallant (Linda Dano) will be getting a new editor, and he will 
challenge her in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loretta (Sloane Shelton), Rachel's friend from New York, will be coming to 
Bay City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another World" airs weekdays at 1 p.m. on NBC.

FABULOUS BREAKFASTS, SPLENDID LUNCHES; HAND TO MOUTH: A GOURMET GUIDE TO STREET 
FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Linda Burum, Linda Burum is the author of A Guide to Ethnic Food in Los 
Angeles, published by HarperPerennial. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foodies may gush about their favorite Beluga caviar mousse or truffle 
consomme, but when the subject turns to more down-to-earth cravings, inevitably 
people will start reminiscing about their favorite street foods -- juicy 
ballpark franks or sticks of garlicky satay lifted from a charcoal brazier in 
Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether in Singapore or Mexico City, street chefs cater to everyone from 
cabbies to Armani-suited businessmen, and their regulars cherish dishes that 
have taken lifetimes to perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, Los Angeles has inherited wonderful street-food cooks from 
just about everywhere. They've moved their woks, tandoors and comals into 
mini-malls and shopping centers; their menus are often written only in 
Mandarin, Hindi or Spanish. While their livelihoods depend on satisfying the 
longings of homesick compatriots, they are also appeasing the culinary 
wanderlust of the rest of us. So much is out there, it would be impossible to 
cover it all here. We've left out our favorite taco stands, Asian noodle joints 
and falafel places, but we did so to flaunt some of L.A.'s less-familiar street 
snacks. MEXICO 
</P>
<P>
 With Los Angeles' upsurge of authentic Mexican eating places, tortas , 
cocteles de mariscos , jugos , licuados , paletas and raspadas are everywhere. 
For the uninitiated, these terms translate to sandwiches, seafood cocktails, 
fresh fruit juices, frothy fruit-and-milk shakes, frozen fruit bars and snow 
cones. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of Mexico's street-side eating is still antojitos , or "little 
whims," that include tacos and other corn-based snack foods. Antojitos come 
filled or topped with a traditional gamut of meat cuts unavailable as yet at 
Taco Bell, from the simplest grilled beef carne asada to the more exotic 
braised lengua (tongue) and sesos (brains). Wading through L.A.'s sea of 
mediocre antojito places taxes the digestion; finding these was a revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the epicenter of the expanding Latino community, El Gallo Giro ( 7136 
Pacific Blvd., Huntington Park, (213) 585-4433, also in San Gabriel, Santa Ana 
and Los Angeles ) is antojito heaven. Everything at this huge, stylish, 
white-tiled emporium is made from scratch in an immense open kitchen, but the 
Central Mexican-style quesadillas are what draw me back. A cook pats out a thin 
round of corn dough as you choose from the various fillings (perhaps a tinga of 
braised beef that blares with the heat of chipotle chiles or the milder 
shredded beef machaca ) . Then the turnover is closed, deep-fried and topped 
with shredded lettuce and rich crema Mexicana.  
</P>
<P>
 Rigo's ( 13662 Oxnard St., Van Nuys, (818) 787-2899; also in North Hollywood, 
Los Angeles and Canoga Park ), a taqueria renowned for outstanding gorditas, 
eschews tough, pre-made gordita shells. The cooks at Rigo's fashion each shell 
to order, and the rim on each twice-fried corn patty makes it look like a mini 
pie pan. Next they layer in their own creamy homemade beans, your chosen meat 
and a little tower of salad, capping it all with another gordita shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on seafood cooked in its own light broth, true Mexican-style seafood 
cocktails are rather like gazpacho. Into this chilled soup go avocado chunks, 
fresh tomato salsa and sometimes a touch of catsup; you can crank up the heat 
with hot chile sauce. A great broth and very fresh seafood, requisites rarely 
attained at many marisquerias (seafood eateries), are what make the cocteles so 
fine at La Playita ( 3306 Lincoln Blvd., Santa Monica, (310) 452-0090 ). A 
converted burger stand in Santa Monica, La Playita always has a line in front 
of the orders window. The excellent Mariscos Sinaloa ( 1901 Sunset Blvd., Los 
Angeles, (213) 413-7840 ), a former fast-food place now painted an intense 
ocean blue, serves a more baroque cocktail, the compechana , a mix of shrimp 
and other seafood crowned with a fresh oyster.  
</P>
<P>
 If Patina served tortas , they would taste like the ones from Super Tortas 
(360 S. Alvarado 6, Los Angeles, (213) 413-7953; also in Sun Valley) . Super 
Tortas' patrician sandwiches are light years away from the usual soggy versions 
requiring a knife and fork. Grilled meats for these tortas, among them lean 
beef rib-eye and shredded breast of chicken, top a firm, toasted bun with a 
garnish of ripe avocado. 
</P>
<P>
 What sets good paletas apart from ordinary Popsicles are the luscious tropical 
fruit flavors and, in some, the fruit pulp. The range of flavors is huge, 
including guava, mango, coconut and jamaica (hibiscus flower). For paletas de 
leche , fruits or flavorings are blended with milk. In some neighborhoods, 
paleta vendors sell their wares from bicycle-driven carts. Many procure their 
paleta supply at El Paraiso (515 N. Mednik Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 263-0748) , 
a shop also open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 At the minuscule Paleteria El Oasis (2758 E. Gage Ave., Huntington Park, (213) 
585-3561) , local business people rip the cellophane wrappers from the paletas 
faster than the fifth-graders who come in after school. Raspadas , another El 
Oasis specialty, are crystalline mounds of crushed ice, drizzled with a syrup 
that contains real fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most charming raspada stands, The Original Snow Cone Factory (3557 
E. 3rd St., Los Angeles, (213) 269-0109) is inside El Taco Loco. The 
40-year-old enterprise, an East L.A. fixture, also uses fresh fruits in its 
syrups (unless you order bubble gum or horchata ), so flavors change with the 
seasons. Raspadas always come with a witty straw with a mini shovel at one end, 
allowing you to eat both syrup and ice together.  
</P>
<P>
 On a weekend afternoon, nothing beats the Alameda Swap Meet (4501 Alameda 
Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 233-2764) for local color. It comes as close to a 
true Mexican tianguis -- weekly outdoor market -- as anything this side of the 
border. Here are Los Angeles' freshest churros , those fluted, egg-rich 
crullers. Using Rube Goldberg-style contraptions, vendors squeeze strips of 
doughnut dough into hot oil to cook as you wait. VIETNAM 
</P>
<P>
 Few foods demonstrate the multiculturalism of Southeast Asia as well as banh 
mi . These hefty hoagie-style sandwiches, made on a crisp French roll, are 
piled high with cold cuts and garnished with marinated vegetables ( banh mi 
means bread in Vietnamese, and the meats are adapted from French Colonial 
charcuterie).  
</P>
<P>
 Banh mi shops serve sandwiches made of pate or cha lua , a cold cut with the 
texture of bologna and taste of Chinese meatballs. Usually, the best banh mi to 
order is the dac biet , which roughly translates as house special. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanh Nhan ( 9569 Bolsa Ave., Westminster, (714) 839-1440 ) makes its own 
pate, cold cuts, even mayonnaise. Banh Mi 99 ( 9812 Bolsa Ave., No. 100, 
Westminster, (714) 775- 8834 ) is a wonderland of Vietnamese-style snacks 
stacked inside and on top of counters. At Ba Le ( 18625 Sherman Way, Reseda, 
(818) 342-9380 ), a homey cafe, the frail lady behind the counter layers on the 
cold cuts with a generous hand.  
</P>
<P>
 Banh cuon, sheer, silky sheets of rice noodle rolled around a stuffing of meat 
or shrimp, are a fixture of every Vietnamese deli and supermarket. The pre-made 
banh cuon sold in markets is like warmed-over pizza, so discriminating 
Vietnamese prefer the steamed-to-order banh cuon at Tay Ho (1039 E. Valley 
Blvd., Golden World Mall, San Gabriel, (818) 280-5207 and 9242 Bolsa Ave., C, 
Westminster, (714) 895-4796) . At the table, you ladle sweet-spicy dipping 
sauce from large glass jars. Try banh uot , pillow-soft unrolled noodle sheets 
topped with Vietnamese cold cuts or sprinkled with crispy onions. MACAO 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Square in Rosemead crams more kinds of Asian food under one roof than 
you could taste on a two-week Asian vacation. One shop, Yee Shun Deli ( 8150 E. 
Garvey Ave., Rosemead, (818) 572-4388 ), which has outlets in Hong Kong and 
Macao, specializes in a gingery, silken-textured steamed-milk dessert from 
Macao. This custard-like marvel is sold chilled, but it's worth the short wait 
to get an order warm from the steamer. Yee Shun also addresses Los Angeles' 
multiculturalism with Indonesian-style satays and creamy coconut milkshakes. 8 
There is little else in the Indian food repertoire more habit-forming than chat 
. These savory snacks, fixtures in urban India, are sold everywhere -- crowded 
train stations, bus stops, at the beach in paper cones. The amply filled deli 
cases at Mirch Masala ( 8516 Reseda Blvd., 8, Northridge, (818) 772-7691 ), an 
Indian sweet and snack shop, provide a quick take on all kinds of chat. They 
include garbanzo bean fritters, potato-stuffed samosas and trail mix-style 
blends of marvelously spiced nuts, deep-fried chickpea-flour noodles, roasted 
beans and puffed rice. But there's more to chat than these Frito-Lay analogues. 
Bhel puri , a salad-like blend of potato chunks, garbanzo beans and onions 
splashed with sharp, fresh cilantro chutney and a sweet-hot tamarind chutney, 
is one of many freshly made in Mirch Masala's kitchen. And chat is only half of 
Mirch Masala's wares. A second deli case holds all sorts of sweets called 
mithai. At India Sweet House ( 5992 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 934-5193 
), another exceptional chat and mithai emporium in the Pico-Fairfax area, 
whole-wheat flat breads stuffed with curried potatoes (aloo paratha) or 
cauliflower (gobhi paratha) head a long list of offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 At Surati Farsan Mart (11814 E. 186th Street, Artesia, (310) 860-2310) , 
browse over the display to the beat of Indian rock music. Farsan means snacks 
in the Gujarati dialect, and this shop does its own regional take on chat. Try 
pani puri, crisp golf-ball-sized bread puffs that you fill with savory beans 
and then douse with a cooling minty water before popping into your mouth. EL 
SALVADOR 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who's ever eaten Salvadoran pupusas can't understand why they've never 
become a food craze like tacos or sushi. The best of these ground-corn patties, 
stuffed with luscious cheese or shredded meat, have thin crusts around generous 
fillings. A garnish of lip-numbing spicy pickled cabbage called curtido always 
shares the plate. Once only clustered around East Hollywood and Pico-Union, 
pupuserias are now turning up everywhere. Among the best: Papaturro, ( 4109 W. 
Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 660-4363, also on Vermont Avenue ); Mi Casita 
Salvadorena ( 14860 Van Owen St., Van Nuys (818) 988-6171 ); Pollo Campero ( 
5067 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 953-1470 , also in Van Nuys and 
Huntington Park) ; La Flor Blanca ( 12571 Harbor Blvd., Garden Grove, (714) 
539-8795 ). INDONESIA AND MALAYSIA 
</P>
<P>
 Southeast Asian street chefs fling their murtabak dough high in the air, 
stretching it to a handkerchief-like delicacy. Then they spread it on a heavy, 
black iron grill and wrap it around a meat or egg stuffing. The resulting 
savory pastry of Indian origins has to be one of the greatest gastronomic joys 
of Indonesian-Singaporean-Malaysian street eating. These pastries are the best 
reason to visit Sudi Mampir (12728 Sherman Way, North Hollywood, (818) 
764-1892) . 
</P>
<P>
 Another popular Southeast Asian grilled bread, roti canai , comes forth 
steaming from the kitchen of Little Malaysia (3944 N. Peck Road, 8, El Monte, 
(818) 401-3188) , where Fai Khaw and her family pamper expatriate Malays with 
dozens of street-style dishes added to the regular menu on weekends. Her popiah 
is a tissue-thin crepe stuffed with crisp vegetables and shrimp, her mee Siam a 
splendid mix of Thai-like curry seasonings on noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also ice kacang , an exotic snow cone in a bowl, which is drizzled 
with rose syrup and embellished with garnishes -- such as chewy, translucent 
palm seeds and corn kernels -- that are unfamiliar to the Western dessert 
vocabulary. An even more baroque ice kacang comes topped with a scoop of ice 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
 The most authentic West Javanese street food comes from Toko Rame (17155 
Bellflower Blvd., Bellflower, (310) 920-8002) where lempur , a tamale-shaped 
rice roll, is stuffed with succulent chicken. The banana-leaf-wrapped arem-arem 
longtong berisi has a little strip of marvelously spiced ground meat at its 
center. Risole, a crepe stuffed with stewed chicken, is an Indonesian 
equivalent of a blintz. My favorite sweet, talem singhong , a 
brown-sugar-sweetened cassava pudding cake, has a rich coconut milk topping. Go 
on weekends when the selection is widest. TAIWAN 
</P>
<P>
 The Taiwanese are fanatical snackers. From the droves of vendors clustered in 
every Taipei neighborhood come pastries, noodle dishes, iced and hot sweets. 99 
Ranch Market, (818) 307-8899 , in San Gabriel Square (140 W. Valley Blvd . , 
San Gabriel) has recently installed a street-food center to the right of the 
door as you enter. The servers behind the counter ladle out sweet peanut soup. 
Snacks include beautiful orange yams cooked in a light, sweet syrup, scallion 
breads (best eaten warm) and Chinese tamales, the sticky rice triangles stuffed 
with mushrooms or sweet red-bean paste and wrapped in banana leaves. ENGLAND  
</P>
<P>
 Every culture has devised foods that travel well. Cornish coal miners used to 
take football-shaped meat pies, called pasties, with them into the mines. They 
brought the pasty tradition to the American Midwest, where it survives to this 
day. At the Pasty Kitchen (3641 Katella Ave., Los Alamitos, (310) 431-9747) , 
the ovens go all day, and when you pick up your chicken or beef with vegetable 
pasties, they will still be warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Guppy's Pasties (12849 Sherman Way, enter at rear, North Hollywood, (818) 
982-5109) makes the traditional pies but they've also translated the pasty into 
an original California-style snack. Guppy's vegetarian pasties, chile-chicken 
pasties and chile-beef pasties have a crust made with canola oil as the 
shortening. ARMENIA 
</P>
<P>
 Armenians will argue the merits of lahmajun from Uncle Jack's (1108 N. Kenmore 
St., Los Angeles, (213) 664-8842) or the Sasoun Bakery (5114 Santa Monica 
Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 661-1868) , both in Hollywood's Armenian enclave. 
This ultra-thin, pizza-like snack smeared with a well-seasoned 
minced-meat-and-hot-pepper topping is as ancient as it is wonderful. And both 
bakeries sell their lahmajun warm from the oven.

 For night crawlers, the action begins at last call. While the rest of the city 
sleeps, these nocturnal creatures drift across abandoned warehouse districts, 
on their way to a "discreet" after-hours affair.They get directions by dialing 
a number that isn't given out to just anybody. Away from the gaze of the 
workaday world, they churn to sensory blasts of Moby, Aphex Twin, Thrill Kill 
Kult -- a techno/tribal assault that pulsates nonstop until morning. Proudly 
synthetic, night crawler clothes proclaim a new age, one of clingy 
micro-miniskirts, chest-baring tanks and shoes with attitude. The colors blend 
into the concrete nightscape, set off only by a raving iridescence. Like 
headlights in the dark, they flash and then they're gone. MARK EHRMAN

ON THE RECORD: POULENC: THE JOKER GETS SERIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mention the name Francis Poulenc and the image of a musical wiseacre is 
summoned up. But within even his jokiest music -- particularly that written 
after World War II, when Poulenc was further from the influence of Stravinsky 
-- there runs a rich vein of sentimentality, expressed in a chromatic 
melodiousness more akin to that found in French pop ballads than in, say, 
Ravel. 
</P>
<P>
 Those melodies in coexistence with "modernist" motor rhythms make Poulenc's 
style uniquely winsome to some ears, anathema to more sober sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the serious side -- as exemplified in two operas from the 
1950s, "Dialogues des Carmelites" and "La Voix humaine," which faded from view 
shortly after their premieres -- has been revived with some frequency on 
European and American stages recently and seems to be finding a receptive 
audience. This has everything to do with both being eminently accessible -- 
musically and dramatically. No scary modern stuff here. The flint-hearted 
critic might even accuse them of being simplistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voix humaine" is the trickier of the two to stage and perform, a setting of 
Jean Cocteau's 1930 "monodrama" of the same name and the subject of an obscure 
short film Roberto Rossellini made for Anna Magnani 20 years later. In any form 
or language, it's a one-woman show, in which a "young and elegant" person 
spends three-quarters of an hour speaking on her bedroom telephone, mainly to 
the man who is in the process of dumping her. 
</P>
<P>
 Poulenc masterfully manipulates -- it's the appropriate word, for better and 
worse -- Cocteau's text to wring from it the last drop of theatricality. 
</P>
<P>
 The single role is a star turn. The Woman, as she is simply called, is going 
elegantly to pieces to the tune of gorgeous chromatic harmonies and shrewdly 
contrived dynamics, including the particularly effective employment of pregnant 
silences. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether one appreciates the text as such or not, Poulenc didn't miss a trick 
-- or a sentiment -- in setting it, as Cocteau was the first to admit. Poulenc 
might, then, be considered a sort of higher-brow Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 If this, to paraphrase Noel Coward, is cheap music, it's very potent cheap 
music when sung and acted as it was by the role's creator in 1957, Denise 
Duval, the recently deceased French singing actress and Poulenc's operatic 
muse. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fabulous 1959 recording of the work was, unpardonably, allowed to slip 
from the catalogue after only about a year's availability on compact disc. But, 
until its return, there's much to admire in the strongest recorded effort on 
the score's behalf since Duval's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woman in the latest version (Harmonia Mundi 901474) is soprano Francoise 
Pollet, whose success is in large part attributable to her not attempting, 
unlike her predecessors, to duplicate or even suggest Duval's richly faceted, 
decidedly stagey interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollet's is more flat-out operatic work: less subtle, less complex than 
Duval's and delivered with a bigger, darker voice than her predecessor's. The 
newcomer thus seems less vulnerable and ultimately, when she acknowledges the 
end of the affair, more heroic in defeat. One can't imagine Duval's recovery, 
whereas Pollet's is a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollet's strength is matched here by the powerful orchestral framework 
provided by the Orchestre National de Lille under the direction of Jean-Claude 
Casadesus, which is less flickery, more Wagnerian (Brunnhilde, in peignoir, on 
the telephone?) than Georges Pretre's for Duval. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to Poulenc's nominally humorous Concerto for Two Pianos (1932) and his 
Piano Concerto of 1949 is less of a shock than might be expected. It doesn't 
really make that much difference which Poulenc one listens to: The serious 
relief to the concertos' comic atmosphere bears more than passing resemblance 
to much of what you hear in these tragic operas. 
</P>
<P>
 The concertos are available in handsome new recorded editions from Pascal 
Roge, who delivers both -- with Silviane Deferne his equal in the double 
concerto -- with dry, energetic wit and the requisite sentimental indulgence, 
too. Conductor Charles Dutoit and the Philharmonia Orchestra provide ideally 
alert, flashing accompaniments (London 436 546). 
</P>
<P>
 The program is rounded out by the darker, less slick, but hardly less 
accessible Organ Concerto of 1938, in which the stylish soloist is Peter 
Hurford.

 When a jazz recording credits three arrangers and prominently showcases the 
names of the mixing engineers, it can be easy to assume that musical content is 
not necessarily the No. 1 priority.It is to James' credit, however, that he 
manages to survive all the commercial impositions -- the unnecessary vocals, 
the annoying drum machine rhythms, the repetitious harmonic vamps -- and keep 
the emphasis upon sound over substance. 
</P>
<P>
 On almost every track here, James not only uncovers an appealing array of 
colors and images within the limited confines of pop jazz, but he does so while 
squeezing in a healthy sampling of crisp, articulate, purely jazz-based 
improvising. 
</P>
<P>
 On several tracks, James does more: "Kissing Cross," "Back to Bali" and the 
elegant "Serenissma" allow him to stretch out over Fareed Haque's guitar; "Into 
the Light" showcases him with Ron Carter's bass and Harvey Mason's drums (and, 
unfortunately, some superfluous synthesizer fills); and on the track that must 
be James' personal favorite, "Storm Warning," his daughter Hillary sings with a 
familial style and musical grace.

 * * 1/2 Roy Hargrove and Antonio Hart, "The Tokyo Sessions," Novus/RCA. 
Hargrove's trumpet and Hart's alto sax are supported by an all-Japanese rhythm 
section at a date recorded in Tokyo.Basically this is a 1960s-style hard bop 
session, using such material as Oscar Pettiford's "Bohemia After Dark" and Nat 
Adderley's "Work Song" with confident but seldom inspired work by both hornmen. 
Hargrove does justice to "I Remember Clifford" and both leaders are in relaxed 
form on "Love Your Spell Is Everywhere." Pianist Yutaka Shina leads the rhythm 
group well enough, with Masahiko Osaka on drums and Tomoyuki Shima on bass. 
"Lotus Blossom" is not the Billy Strayhorn composition, but a like-titled bop 
piece by Kenny Dorham.

 * * * Abbey Lincoln and Hank Jones, "When There Is Love," Verve. Two of jazz's 
most distinct voices come together in this relaxed program that shows both off 
to advantage.Lincoln's voice, somewhat huskier than in years past, still 
retains its attractive depth and color, spicy on "C'est Si Bon," warm and 
intimate on her own "A Part of Me." Her struggle to find pitch on "I Should 
Care" makes her delivery even more poignant. Pianist Jones, working alone on 
"Close Your Eyes," proves himself an astute spokesmen, juggling rhythms and 
soloing in almost conversational tones. "Angel Face," with words by Lincoln and 
music by Jones, is especially heavenly.

RECORD RACK: ANOTHER DETOUR FROM TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ** TRAFFIC, "Far From Home"; Virgin  
</P>
<P>
 This purported reunion of a classic rock band sounds more like an attempt to 
jump-start Steve Winwood's becalmed solo career under a sexier marketing 
banner. 
</P>
<P>
 Vintage Traffic music was an adventurous grab-bag that at its best combined 
pop pith with wide-ranging stretches through jazz, folk, rock and R&B 
influences."Far From Home" enlists Traffic alum Jim Capaldi on drums, but the 
album is a sleek, tailored work little different in approach from the music 
Winwood's been making since his 1986 solo high-water mark, "Back in the High 
Life." 
</P>
<P>
 Winwood's inspiration has faltered badly since then, but "Far From Home" at 
least represents a step back from the tedium of his 1990 release, "Refugee of 
the Heart." Winwood remains one of the great pure talents in rock and the major 
strands of his ability are well-represented here: the soulful urgency of the 
voice and the instrumental excellence on organ, piano and guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 The spark is still there when he taps funk, soul or blues roots or pays 
tribute to Carlos Santana's blues-salsa fusion on the instrumental 
"Mozambique." Elsewhere, songs become diffuse and overextended as the so-called 
Traffic tries to make up in profundity what it lacks in freshness and 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 *** KING MISSILE, "King Missile"; Atlantic  
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a non sequitur simile? John S. Hall's the guy to call. This 
modern-rock-age hipster -- the guy behind last year's left-field meditation on 
maleness "Detachable Penis" -- is a master at describing things in ways that 
probably would never occur to the rest of us.He's like Allen Ginsberg playing 
one of those fill-in-the-blanks word games, to use a more straightforward image 
than Hall ever would. 
</P>
<P>
 On his band's sixth album, he's also perfected a flat, deadpan delivery that 
gives his oddball observations an almost hypnotically matter-of-fact quality, 
especially when he takes a stream-of-consciousness approach and the band backs 
him with a sort of free-associating neo-bop rock. 
</P>
<P>
 It's less effective when he actually sings and the band actually tries to form 
structured songs. The result is sort of a less-histrionic Perry Farrell in 
front of a fairly average bar band. Jim Carroll, the last New York poet to make 
his mark as a rocker, had a similar problem. But even with irony replacing 
steel-eyed realism, King Missile's highs are nearly as striking as Carroll's.

 *** MESSIAH, "21st Century Jesus"; American  
</P>
<P>
 On its first full album and major-label debut, this British techno-duo 
manipulates familiar beats and samples into uncharted and explosive material. 
Mark John-Davies and Ali Ghani have released numerous singles, but finally hit 
big in U.S. clubs and on college radio with 1992's single "Temple of 
Dreams."Now Messiah roughs up its electronic songs with some heavy-duty 
production via Rick Rubin, while still making its driving sound a more 
mainstream listening experience. The result is an album that straddles the line 
between charged underground rock, edgy disco and effective, hard techno. 
</P>
<P>
 The album brims with layers of pulsing beat and a groove that seems made up of 
spare parts. The snippets blend with the lilts of the Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth 
Fraser, Donna Summer's spacey croons of "I feel love," and a guest appearance 
by the Cult's singer Ian Astbury. Messiah has made an album that's good on or 
off the dance floor. It's not too cerebral and is more substantial than just a 
quick adrenalized rush. The more you listen to it, the more you find. 
</P>

POP EYE: HOW ABOUT 'MONKS SING MONK' NEXT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Levine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When "Chant," an album of Gregorian chants recorded 20 years ago by 
Benedictine monks, began racing up the Billboard pop charts last month, it was 
easy to picture the collection tumbling down just as quickly once the novelty 
wore off. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Chant" is now in its third week in the U.S. Top 20, currently resting at 
No. 5, alongside Bonnie Raitt and Counting Crows. Estimated U.S. sales to date: 
400,000 copies -- all this after selling more than 500,000 copies last year in 
Europe, where its audience was chiefly between the ages of 15 and 30. 
</P>
<P>
 And Steve Murphy, president of EMI's Angel Records in New York, believes the 
company can keep the momentum going here. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge is maintaining that sales performance with an act that won't do 
interviews and can't tour. (The monks have taken a vow of poverty and use money 
from the royalties to support various charities.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It has forced us to be creative," Murphy says, in a rare moment of 
understatement in the pop world. "Our goal is to keep the music out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The primary tools: video and radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo de Silos are tucked away in a monastery 
in Spain, but Angel's marketing campaign hopes to soon have their music on MTV 
and KROQ. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel has released one of the album's selections, "Alleluia, beatus vir qui 
suffert," as a single -- hoping to pick up exposure on a wide variety of radio 
formats, from alternative to talk. Angel already reports some classical and 
college radio station support. 
</P>
<P>
 A video for the single has also been completed. The promotional device -- 
minus the camera-shy monks -- contrasts hectic images from everyday life with 
the serenity of the Gregorian chants. It's already been shown on a few small 
video shows, and both MTV and VH-1 are reportedly considering playing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel is also pushing the album on a retail level, placing it in major chain 
stores that usually don't carry much classical product. And the company has 
also bought advertising time in some movie theaters so that the music can be 
played between films while the album's cover is shown on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 And taking a cue from its rock-marketing counterparts, Angel has even ordered 
some promotional T-shirts -- in brown, with hoods. 
</P>
<P>
 With the publicity this album has generated, it's only a matter of time before 
another record company reaches into its back catalogue and re-releases an old 
Gregorian chant album in a sleek sleeve with new-age art work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Angel isn't worried. There are many albums of chants, but few are by 
monks. Besides, Angel could soon have a sequel on its hand. An Angel 
spokeswoman said that the monks have expressed interest in recording a Mass.

 IT'S A GAS, GAS, GAS: Everyone's familiar with symphonic versions of songs by 
such '60s bands as the Beatles, Moody Blues and Procol Harum, but who ever 
thought we'd hear classical versions of "Paint It Black" or "Under My Thumb"? 
</P>
<P>
 Get ready. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 24, RCA Victor will release "Symphonic Music of the Rolling Stones," an 
album on which the London Symphony Orchestra plays 11 Stones songs, featuring 
guest vocals by such pop-rock figures as INXS's Michael Hutchence ("Under My 
Thumb"), Marianne Faithfull ("Ruby Tuesday") and -- gulp -- Mick Jagger 
("Angie"). Most surprising of all is the version of "Gimme Shelter" by . . . 
the New London Children's Choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Kimsey, a longtime Stones ally who produced the album, acknowledges that 
it's "difficult to imagine a Rolling Stones song with an orchestra," but he 
feels it works. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection is the second in a series of RCA Victor rock 'n' classics 
works. An album saluting Yes was released last fall, while symphonic recordings 
of the music of the Who, Procol Harum and Jimi Hendrix are still to come.Rob

 RIP CITY: After 13 years as the editor of Rip, one of the leading 
hard-rock-oriented magazines, Lonn Friend is jumping over to the industry side, 
taking a job at Arista Records, effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Friend will assume the title of vice president A&R West Coast and head up 
Arista's new effort to compete in the rock world, where the company, known 
mostly for such pop and R&B acts as Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin, has 
been a largely negligible presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Friend, who also had been visible through his regular features on MTV's 
"Headbangers Ball" and as host of his own nationally syndicated radio show, 
says he had received offers in the past for similar positions, but that this 
one was too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing comes close to this opportunity," he says. "This is a chance to 
create a whole new environment at a company where that doesn't exist, to build 
a rock organization at a company that doesn't have one." 
</P>
<P>
 But the move also comes at a time when Rip's fortunes have fallen. With 
pop-metal stars that were once the magazine's staple having been replaced by 
the earthier likes of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, Rip's readership has dropped, 
and the publication's staff was recently cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Friend insists that his leaving has nothing to do with that, and that he's 
going to do all he can to help out his as-yet-unselected replacement. He's 
certainly leaving on a high note: The final Friend-edited issue, on sale July 
26, will feature a cover story on Pearl Jam written by Ministry's Al 
Jourgensen. Steve Hochman

 AND ONE MORE THING: "Buckshot LeFonque," due in July from Columbia, is the 
name of the new Branford Marsalis project -- a collaboration with DJ Premier of 
rap group Gang Starr that features appearances by poet Maya Angelou (reading "I 
Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"), Ruben Blades, the late Albert Collins and 
former Springsteen sidekick Nils Lofgren. The first single, "Breakfast at 
Denny's," is about the controversy over the restaurant chain's alleged racially 
discriminatory practices and incorporates part of a Jay Leno monologue. 
Buckshot LeFonque, by the way, was a pseudonym used by jazz great Cannonball 
Adderley on his independent projects.

 Documentary makers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofksy provide a straightforward 
narrative on their highly publicized subject, which is a trial in upstate New 
York, where a dairy farmer was charged with murdering his own brother in the 
bed they shared. Was the ailing Bill Ward's death a mercy killing, or a case of 
sex gone bad? Or, as many in Munnsville (pop. 499) believed, was his brother 
Delbert innocent altogether? The movie isn't about the luridness of the 
situation so much as it is about the community of caring that grew up around 
Delbert and his other brothers (including Lyman Ward, pictured), who heretofore 
had been regarded as filthy, uneducated and possibly simple-minded outcasts 
(KCET Monday at 9 p.m.). Peter Rainer

 Writer-director James B. Harris' superior 1993 film noir was originally -- and 
more appropriately -- called "Money Man," the title of the Gerald Petievich 
novel on which it is based. It's a stylish, deliberately B-scale movie that 
boasts an ensemble Grade A cast and emphasizes character over action.Wesley 
Snipes' U.S. Treasury agent, in pursuit of the person or persons who have 
killed his partner, and Dennis Hopper (pictured, in one of his best portrayals 
ever), an ex-con with a taste for counterfeit money, are both on seven-day 
deadlines. That's how much time Snipes has to close the case before being 
transferred to Newark. In seven days, Hopper also has to come up with the cash 
he owes a Mafioso (Tony Lo Bianco). With Lolita Davidovich, Viggo Mortensen, 
Valerie Perrine, Seymour Cassel and Jonathan Banks (HBO Tuesday at 8 p.m.).

 Matthew Irmas' engaging first feature tells of four young people sharing a 
handsome old Spanish house in the Hollywood Hills and coming to terms with 
adulthood. Thanks to Ann Wycoff's substantial script, Irmas' incisive 
direction, and especially to Rae Dawn Chong's selfless portrayal of M.J., a 
ruthlessly ambitious stockbroker, the 1993 film rises above its conventional 
plot to create genuine impact and involvement.At last Chong (pictured) has a 
role that shows off her talent and intelligence as well as her distinctive 
presence. M.J.'s housemates are a struggling artist (Sandra Bullock), a social 
worker (Elizabeth Berridge) and a gay actor (Kris Kamm) who's beginning to 
despair of making it beyond the occasional commercial. This is an encouraging 
venture for all concerned. With Brian McNamara (pictured) (Cinemax Thursday at 
8 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; AMY BRENNEMAN WALKS THE HOT BLUE LINE TOWARD 'NYPD' 
FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS RUBIN, Rubin is a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amy Brenneman was never far from the law while growing up -- her father's an 
attorney, her mother a superior court judge. But until she landed the role of 
Officer Janice Licalsi on "NYPD Blue," she had never come closer to the police 
than a few speeding tickets in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the former New York resident relocated to the City of Angels for 
this series, which is situated in the Big Apple. Brenneman shows up at her 
publicist's office on a lunch break from shooting the season finale wearing 
jeans, hiking boots and a T-shirt, with almost no makeup. Out of uniform and 
with her long hair loose, Brenneman, 29, little resembles Licalsi, except for 
those arresting blue-gray eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of the show may have noticed that Brenneman's character has kept a low 
profile for the past several episodes, following a dramatic beginning -- 
getting into bed with both the mob and Detective Kelly (David Caruso), and then 
killing the Mafioso. While she won't divulge what happens next, Brenneman 
promises that Licalsi returns to the center of the action for the end of the 
season. Brenneman will only say enigmatically, "Things get resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Brenneman identifies strongly with her character. "I can't say that it's me; 
she's more like a sister. I feel for her so much. She has a need to take care 
of things to the point of absurdity. 'I'll take care of it, I'll take care of 
it,' even when she can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Brenneman herself couldn't live with the secrets that haunt Licalsi. "I can 
imagine it eating me up. I'd probably have to come clean," says Brenneman, who 
acknowledges having nightmares about it. "It's easy for me to tap into those 
kinds of feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 One adjustment Brenneman had to make for "NYPD" was to rein in herself, and 
her emotions. "I wear my heart on my sleeve, and cops don't. Stuff is happening 
so fast, flying by, there's no time to indulge." To familiarize herself with 
the workings of police, Brenneman, who has never taken acting classes, spent 
some time with New York's finest. She learned about the teamwork that is so 
integral to police work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men and women make a great team. Much as I don't want to believe it, 
sometimes you just need brute strength, you just need that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" is, by now, a show well known for its unusually realistic use of 
profanity and nudity, and it is Brenneman's flesh that has most consistently 
been on display. Brenneman was initially nervous about the love scenes. "It's 
sort of like having sex for the first time: It could be so bad." But she says 
it was a positive experience. Regarding the series' controversial sexuality, 
Brenneman says, "It has a certain spiritual weight. I don't think the love 
scenes themselves are that risky." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Connecticut, Brenneman never thought about being on television. 
Her childhood didn't include a lot of tube watching, except for reruns of "The 
Waltons." And though she was singing in the chorus of "The Music Man" before 
her teens, Brenneman didn't look at acting seriously until after leaving 
Harvard, where she co-founded the Cornerstone Theater Group, which took classic 
plays to the backroads of America. Brenneman devoted five years to the company, 
but still wasn't certain that acting was a viable career choice, even when she 
headed off to New York to try. "I had no track record, and I didn't know if it 
was possible to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Brenneman didn't struggle too long. She was selected by series creator Steven 
Bochco after being brought in to read for the part by an ABC casting director. 
"She's very talented, a real combination of smartness and attractiveness, and 
credible as a cop," says Bochco. 
</P>
<P>
 The peripatetic actress has settled in L.A. for now, but staying put isn't in 
her nature. She'll appear in the upcoming Steven Spielberg-produced "Casper the 
Friendly Ghost," and hopes to return to the theater in the off season. "Part of 
me can't imagine leaving ("NYPD Blue"). ... I would like to be around for a 
long time on the show; I really love the people I work with." 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on ABC .

PROFILE; THE 'WIDOW' LANE; WHAT GOT THE 29-YEAR-OLD ACTRESS THROUGH THE 
TOUGHEST SHOOT IN HER LIFE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Diane Lane loves playing the role of mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does the former child actress star as the mother of six in CBS' 
two-part "Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All," Lane recently became a 
mom herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she reported to work last fall on "Confederate Widow" just one month 
after she gave birth to daughter Eleanor, now 8 months old. Lane's husband of 
six years is French actor Christopher Lambert, who starred in "Greystoke: The 
Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes." 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter, Lane says, was not named after Eleanor Roosevelt. "But she will 
be the Eleanor Roosevelt of her generation," she quips while drinking a wine 
spritzer at a swank Beverly Hills hotel. "My grandmother was actually named 
Eleanor. But we chose it because it had to sound good in French and English. 
It's a little tricky. Some of the American names don't really click." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did some of the French. "He wanted to name her Bebe for a while," Lane 
says, laughing. "It seemed like a pinup name." 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, 29, who made her film debut in 1979's "A Little Romance" when she was 
13, had no concept how difficult it would be to work so soon after giving 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't do that again for a million years," she says, lighting up a 
cigarette. "I had no idea. There is no rehearsal (for motherhood). Everybody 
tries to warn you. You don't believe them. It's all true and you should have 
listened to them. Sleep is something from my youth." 
</P>
<P>
 Baby Eleanor accompanied Lane to Georgia where "Confederate" filmed. But since 
the shooting schedule was so grueling -- Lane worked six-day weeks for six 
weeks -- Eleanor could only visit her mother on the set about once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so heartbreaking for me just to be away from her at that time," Lane 
says with regret. "I don't know how working moms do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because she wasn't able to breast-feed during production, Lane says, "I lost 
her to the breast. She went on the bottle. I got so mad I cut all of my hair 
off after we wrapped. Nursing is so rewarding emotionally. You are so 
indispensable in the most primal way." 
</P>
<P>
 Lane's contribution to "Oldest Living Confederate Widow," based on the 
best-selling novel by Alan Gurganus, could also be called indispensable. She 
plays the title character: feisty, outspoken Lucy Marsden, who, at age 14, 
marries Capt. William Marsden (Donald Sutherland), a 50-year-old Confederate 
veteran of the Civil War. The drama chronicles their turbulent life together, 
Lucy's relationship with her six children and her friendship with Castalia 
(Cicely Tyson), the captain's housekeeper and former slave. Lane plays Lucy 
from ages 14 to 58. Anne Bancroft narrates the film and is the 100-year-old 
Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive producers Frank Konigsberg and Larry Sanitsky had long wanted to 
work with Lane. "I think when you are looking at actresses, we needed someone 
who could go from 14 to about 50," Sanitsky says. "I think the biggest 
challenge is the 14-year-old part. I think Diane has wonderful range and a 
wonderful look at this point in her life. She could get down convincingly to 
close to 14. It wasn't that hard to take her up. She is really the right age 
for the middle section." 
</P>
<P>
 The producers didn't know when they cast her that she was about to become a 
first-time mom. But being a mother, Konigsberg says, enriched Lane's 
performance. "I think that experience, a lot of that experience, came to bear 
on this show. I think a lot of her performance ended up getting shaded by 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lane agrees. "I was so glad I had those emotional feelings, that love," she 
explains. "I wouldn't have had the confidence to have that stance as a mother 
-- those tigress feelings you have for your kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The actress acknowledges she never worked so hard "for her money" in her life 
as she did on "Confederate Widow." 
</P>
<P>
 In one day's shooting alone, Lane says, "I lost one of my children. Then I had 
to run around after my blinded son with his seeing-eye dog and then I had to 
put on a puppet show for the children. I would go home and I wouldn't remember 
what I shot, and I've been on my share of hard shoots, especially TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Lane has no time for those who put down television. "People say, 'It's TV.' 
They think lightweight thoughts in their mind. Hardly . It's harder work than 
features. You are, like, cranking it out there and if you don't get it, it's 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lane says, every scene was easy for her to play. "Every true emotion 
was right there in that scene. There are many different kinds of scripts. This 
one was a right-in-your-face kind of script. Every scene had its own 
believability factor, if you will. Stay true to that and you can't go wrong. 
The characters were so rich. My agent said it was a tour-de-force opportunity. 
So much happens to this woman. It fell in my lap -- straight from the gods. I 
said, 'I have to be thankful and walk through the open door here and play this 
woman.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After production was completed, Lane finally got quality time with Eleanor. "I 
just wanted to curl up in a fetal position with my baby, just smile at her and 
absorb her," Lane says, beaming. "She is pure sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
 'Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All" airs Sunday and Tuesday at 9 p.m. 
on CBS.

RETRO; ALL IN LEAR'S FAMILY; ARCHIE'S FAMOUS LIVING ROOM IS NOW ON VIDEO -- AS 
WELL AS IN '704 HAUSER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Talk about perfect timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last month, CBS premiered its new comedy series, "704 Hauser." The 
sitcom, from producer-writer-director Norman Lear, focuses on members of a 
black family who now live in Archie Bunker's old house. 
</P>
<P>
 But if "Hauser" isn't enough of a fix for fans of All in the Family, episodes 
of the groundbreaking comedy series, which aired on CBS from 1971 until 1979, 
are now on video for the first time. "All in the Family: The Collector's 
Edition" is available on Columbia House Home Video Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emmy Award-winning series, also created and produced by Lear, was the 
first sitcom to explore such controversial topics as sex, racism, poverty, the 
Vietnam War and economics. Carroll O'Connor starred as the outspoken 
blue-collar conservative Archie Bunker, Jean Stapleton as his loving wife 
Edith, Sally Struthers as his liberal daughter Gloria, and Rob Reiner as her 
hippie husband, Mike (Meathead) Stivic. 
</P>
<P>
 The first volume of "All in the Family: The Collector's Edition" costs $5; 
subsequent editions are $20. Each volume includes four half-hour episodes. The 
introductory volume features the series premiere "Meet the Bunkers," which 
aired Jan. 12, 1971. Also included are the 1971 episodes of "Archie Gives 
Blood," "Mike's Hippie Friends Come to Visit" and "Everybody Tells the Truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Also new from Columbia House Home Video Library is "The Wild Wild West: The 
Collector's Edition," comparably priced to the "All in the Family" set. Each 
volume features two episodes of the '60s Western romp starring Robert Conrad 
and Ross Martin. The first features the pilot episode, "The Night of the 
Inferno," which aired Sept. 17, 1965, on CBS, as well as the 1965 installment, 
"The Night of the Double Edged Knife." Leslie Nielsen guest stars in the latter 
as villain General Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Western TV classics, "Rawhide" and "Gunsmoke," are moseying into the 
video corral May 4 on CBS Video. Unlike "Wild West" and "All in the Family," 
these will be available in stores for $15 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rawhide," aired 1959-1966 on CBS and starred Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood 
as cattle drivers Gil Favor and Rowdy Yates. CBS Video is releasing three 
videos, each containing an hour episode. Included in the collection are the 
1962 comedic entry, "The Pitchwagon," featuring Eastwood singing, and 1963's 
"Incident of Iron Bull," which explores Native American prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS Video mined the archives for its four volumes of "Gunsmoke." Each video 
contains two half-hour episodes from the long-running show's early years -- 
1955 to '57. Considered the first "adult" Western, "Gunsmoke" starred James 
Arness as Dodge City's stalwart Marshal Dillon, Amanda Blake as Miss Kitty, 
Dennis Weaver as Chester and Milburn Stone as Doc. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the episodes featured are "The Killer," with guest star Charles Bronson; 
"The Guitar," which features TV producer Aaron Spelling as as a simple-minded 
minstrel; and "Sins of the Father," with Angie Dickinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "All in the Family: The Collector's Edition" is available only by calling 
1-800-638-2922. "Wild West" is available via the same number .

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: UGLY DUCKLING TURNS TO A SWAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA, S. Irene Virbila is The Times' restaurant critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the name of a restaurant, Ti Amo (I Love You) is sure to send Italians into 
fits of giggles. However, it's no more silly than Ti Baccio (I Kiss You), 
Linguini Grill or Viva la Pasta -- all names of real restaurants, I swear it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ti Amo, which opened at the beginning of April, is a romantic Italian place in 
South Laguna. Designer and co-owner Martine Hermansen spent months transforming 
an ugly duckling (the old La Monique space) into a Renaissance swan with swaths 
of rich fabrics, fragments of frescoes and a large trompe l'oeuil mural. Each 
of the unusual stone-like menus bears her rendition of a Michelangelo or Da 
Vinci drawing on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 According to co-owner Robert Castoro, the food is based on that of the Italian 
Renaissance, roughly the period from the 13th to the 18th centuries. Well, that 
may be stretching the Renaissance out by a century or two, but that's the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Peter Higginson, who opened the original Zeppa in Newport Beach, rummaged 
through his collection of historical cookbooks for ideas and recipes. The small 
menu includes smoked goose carpaccio garnished with red onion rings, plump 
raisins, Parmesan shavings and a drizzle of citrus; a soup of spinach gnocchi 
in chicken broth; and delicious Sardinian ravioli with a stuffing of ricotta, 
eggplant, walnut and mint. There's grilled chicken breast with walnuts, raisins 
and sage and medallions of lamb encrusted with pistachios. But I seriously 
doubt Michelangelo longed for seared rare ahi tuna back then. Most interesting 
are the house-smoked meats and game birds, and occasionally smoked venison or 
rack of lamb in a cherry-Barbaresco sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 An added bonus: a sweet little wine list fairly priced, which includes an '89 
Barolo from Michele Chiarlo and an '89 Vietti Barbaresco. 
</P>
<P>

RESTAURANT NEWS: SONORA OWNER SPICES UP DINING DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not surprising anymore to be handed a frequent-diner card when you eat 
out. Just about every restaurant has its own version, say, in the shape of a 
pizza pie (fill in eight slices and then you get a free large pizza) or a 
computer program that keeps track of your eating habits (run up $2,000 in coq 
au vin and, voila , a VCR). Much like the free car washes and free plane 
tickets you earn for loyalty, restaurants use food to lure customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Ron Salisbury, owner of El Cholo, the Original Sonora Cafe and two other 
area restaurants, has come up with a new dining gimmick. He's mailed out 
letters to his customers offering $1,500 worth of dining certificates for 
$1,000. There is no limit on their use and if the certificates are redeemed 
within six months, Salisbury promises to kick in a $100 bonus certificate. 
Plus, he'll pick up the tab on a bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne if the 
certificates are used strictly at the new Sonora, which is moving from downtown 
to the La Brea Avenue space that was until last week City Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get the cash up front," says Salisbury, "and the record keeping is 
practically negligible. I don't have to keep everyone updated or send out 
rewards." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Salisbury has received about a dozen calls in response to the letter, 
and four of his customers have purchased the certificates. "They are asking 
questions like, 'Can they be used for catering?' and the answer is no, 'Can 
they be shared with a friend?' and the answer is yes." says Salisbury. "This 
may be the dumbest thing I've ever done or it may be the brightest thing. Who 
knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 LEVELING FORCE: For 15 years, the French Laundry was known for its unique wine 
cellar and prix-fixe dinners that lasted all evening. The Yountville restaurant 
wasn't listed in the Yellow Pages, and if you drove by the ancient, 
vine-covered building you'd miss it if you didn't know where to look. Smoking 
was not allowed. No credit cards were accepted. And you'd have to eat whatever 
chef/owner Sally Schmitt had cooked. Yet customers waited up to two months for 
a reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 New owner Thomas Keller plans to keep the basic format when he reopens the 
62-seat space in June. But he's creating what he calls a "psychological edge 
with people coming in" by reducing the $55 dinner to $53, and offering several 
choices in each of the five courses. "I want them to leave with the impression 
that dinner here is good value," he says, "that it's a notch above what was 
here before, a notch below the next step." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, one of the pioneers of food as architecture at Checkers in downtown 
Los Angeles and before that at New York's Rakel restaurant, won't be using his 
plates as pedestals in the Napa Valley, though. "I don't intend to pile food on 
the plate as high as I can get it. I'm going back to a more traditional, 
contemporary elegance. Everybody is doing architectural food now. When Wendy's 
starts to do it, you know it's passe." 
</P>
<P>
 PIT STOPS: Sources say the owners of Olive may soon be pulling up the entry 
tiles that spell out the name of their Fairfax Avenue restaurant-cum-bar. 
Manager Jeffrey Best denies the rumors. "At the present time, Olive isn't 
moving," says Best. "Maybe somewhere in the future it might." Meanwhile, Dale 
Payne, who closed his La Cienega restaurant last year, has taken over kitchen 
duties with the departure of Robert Gadsby. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Olive grove is expanding: Jones, a joint venture between Olive owners 
and Johnny's Pizza (in various locations), will open in two weeks at the old 
Ports in Hollywood. It's a rock 'n' roll pizza bar. 
</P>
<P>
 MORE OPENINGS: Louise's Trattoria will take over the former the Rite Spot in 
Pasadena. But fans of the former restaurant's Egyptian-themed bar can rest 
easy. The Mecca room and its painted ceiling will be preserved. . . . Pauline 
Parry who owns Good Gracious! catering on West Pico, has taken over the 
adjoining storefront and opened Parry's on Pico, a coffee bar featuring 
espresso, fresh pastries, sandwiches and "pizzettes." 
</P>
<P>
 ANNIVERSARIES: Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant, the Buena Park 
institution that has fed 20 million pounds of chicken to everyone from John 
Wayne and Elizabeth Taylor to Donny and Marie Osmond -- is planning 60th 
anniversary promotions including mugs, T-shirts and 1934 prices. . . . Bagel 
Nosh in Encino celebrates silver anniversary by deducting $2 from cost of all 
entree salads at lunch time. . . . For its 20th, Ye Olde King's Head Pub and 
Restaurant in Santa Monica is holding a drawing on Tuesday. The prize: tickets 
for two to London. . . . And the year-old Nature Club on Melrose now has an 
herbal happy hour. From 4 to 6 p.m., all freshly cooked herbal elixirs and 
tinctures are half price. *

LET'S MAKE DO WITHOUT SANS  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am dismayed by the increasing use in The Times, and especially Calendar, of 
the French word sans to mean without . 
</P>
<P>
 This is ohne any justification.Sometimes a foreign word or phrase cannot be 
replaced b'li losing the writer's intended meaning. But sans simply means 
without , bez any additional nuance. Its use is pretentious, intended to lend 
an air of "culture" to writing otherwise nashi de distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The overuse of sans in print has now stimulated its use in conversation, 
pronounced as if it were the English word sands , bahar even the slightest 
attempt at imitating the sound of the word in French. 
</P>
<P>
 Phandle kwa any doubt, this is one trend we can do t'aadoo .

in, respectively, German, Hebrew, Czech, Japanese, Hindi, Zulu and Navajo.

JOHN, PAUL AND JURGEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I desperately fought the urge to write this letter after David Gritten's story 
on "BackBeat" and Stuart Sutcliffe ("John, Paul, George, Ringo . . . and Stu," 
April 10). I was doing fairly well until the onslaught of reviews and related 
stories -- including a fashion blurb in View (April 15) -- but enough is 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Once and for all, Astrid Kirchherr did not create the Beatles' hairstyle or 
look. The man more truly responsible was Jurgen Vollmer, a fellow art student. 
Countless interviews with Paul McCartney and John Lennon attest to the fact 
that Jurgen cut their hair in his hotel room in Paris in late 1961 and shared 
his style of dress with them. 
</P>
<P>
 One only has to view the pages of Jurgen's book "Rock 'n' Roll Times" 
(Overlook Press, 1983) or his cover photo of Lennon's "Rock 'n' Roll" to see 
his involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the opportunity to work with Jurgen when I was the boom operator on 
"Universal Soldier," as he was that movie's still photographer. We talked for 
many weeks about the events depicted in "BackBeat." Lennon's introduction from 
Jurgen's book sums things up reasonably well: 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurgen Vollmer was the first photographer to capture the beauty and the 
spirit of the Beatles. We tried very hard to find someone with his touch after 
we returned from Hamburg, Germany . . . nobody could." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear God, will the revisions of history never stop? Pretty soon we will be 
informed that Stuart Sutcliffe provided the inspiration for the Kinks. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Stu was given the eye by a transvestite in Hamburg, and they wrote 
"Lola." Coincidence? I think not! And what about Billy Preston, the other 
"fifth Beatle"? 
</P>
<P>
 What a minute -- my first name is Stuart too. Maybe I influenced the Beatles! 
Oh, man, I feel a really bad headache coming on.

SHADES OF GRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed reading your article on Spalding Gray so very much ("Meet Our Newest 
Interviewer," April 17). 
</P>
<P>
 I had never heard of Gray before I returned to school as a graduate student at 
Cal State Northridge in the speech communication department. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Prof. Emeritus Donald Salper, I soon discovered the wonderful world 
of Spalding Gray. In fact, as an assignment, our seminar group did a takeoff on 
Gray, complete with a lone table, chair, no script and a glass of water. When I 
first viewed "Swimming to Cambodia," I was bowled over by Gray's honesty. It 
was just like sitting down with someone in my living room, except I never got 
to talk back -- only listen. Quite a change for a speech major! 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for the opportunity to read Gray interviewing Gray. What an exciting 
and creative way to really "hear" Gray and, since my thesis was based on oral 
history, how terrific to hear that he turned in an audiotape that you then 
transcribed. Hang onto that tape -- it is Gray's voice with all the nuances, 
inflections and emphasis that tell the complete story. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 It's a classic. 
</P>
<P>
 A feat of ego only someone as self-absorbed as Spalding Gray could accomplish 
-- the self-interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone should warn him -- if he continues the practice, he'll go blind. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, perhaps he already has.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: IF SHE CRIED 'WOLF,' ROSEANNE ABUSED US ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN, Robin Abcarian's column is published Wednesdays and Sundays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lydia Bodin has followed the recent travails of Roseanne Arnold with great 
interest. On April 18, Roseanne filed for divorce from her husband, Tom Arnold, 
accusing him, in her request for a restraining order, of violent behaviors and 
concluding that she has become "a classic battered wife." 
</P>
<P>
 On April 21, Roseanne dropped divorce proceedings, recanted her charges and 
asked for forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodin, as it happens, is a deputy L.A. County district attorney. Technically, 
the division she heads is called the Domestic Violence Unit. But she calls it 
Desperation Central. She prosecutes people -- men, mostly -- who rape and 
batter their loved ones, who tie them up and force them to watch as the 
children are molested, who lock them in closets and force-feed them drugs, who 
stalk them, terrorize them, kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's ugly work, and it has taken years for people such as Bodin, people who 
toil in the depressing fields of domestic violence, to reap the respect and 
support they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bodin was none too happy to hear the news that Roseanne Arnold had recanted 
her claims of being a battered wife. Not because she wants Roseanne to be 
battered -- no decent person would -- but because she knew in her gut that no 
matter what happened between Tom and Roseanne, this was bad news for women who 
are victimized by the men they love. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Now we are going to hear this argument -- the one people believe 
because they don't want to believe women are getting beat up in their homes -- 
that women just lie to leverage themselves in divorce situations. That they 
don't tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 An overreaction? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after I said that," said Bodin, "it happened in one of our trials. 
Basically, (a defense attorney) brought up Tom and Roseanne and said, 'This 
happens all the time. This is just family stuff. They make these things up. 
They say one thing one day and say another thing the next day.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant in the case, said Bodin, a man with a history of violence, was 
accused of stalking his wife, breaking into her house with a crowbar and a 
knife and terrorizing her. When we spoke, the jury was still out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where I work, we are talking felony domestic violence: serious assault, 
homicide, permanent maiming, women forcibly losing babies, really ugly crimes, 
morally repugnant. And we are almost always looking at a long line of 
misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence, and these women aren't lying 
about it. Many of these women have gone to the courts and gotten restraining 
orders and they rely on that system to protect them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ah yes, the system. The system Roseanne turned to when she wanted help and 
protection from the man she claimed abused her. 
</P>
<P>
 But the system can be abused, too. And what, if anything, should happen to 
someone who abuses it, who swears on penalty of perjury that her statements are 
true, then recants? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, in the case of domestic violence, nothing should be done. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, as Bodin points out, in 80% of the cases that come her way, the 
victim is reluctant to press charges, or recants, or minimizes the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is what is happening to Roseanne. Perhaps not. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Giggans, executive director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults 
Against Women, says punishing people who are already emotionally confused is 
probably not the best course. This is why police in Los Angeles -- and many 
other jurisdictions -- are instructed to make arrests in domestic violence 
calls if they see evidence of abuse or believe it to have taken place. The 
burden of having to decide whether to press charges is no longer on the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea that Roseanne should somehow be held up as a symbol to victims of 
domestic violence is unappealing to Giggans and other advocates for battered 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 Who -- besides the Arnolds after all -- knows what really happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "And frankly," said Giggans, "I have outgrown my need for celebrities to 
validate what is happening in people's lives. I hope they get some help." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who can know what demons and angels inhabit the imaginations of people such as 
Roseanne and Tom Arnold?  
</P>
<P>
 In order to work the Arnolds into a coherent world view, you have to decide if 
you want to take them as real folks -- an image upon which they have built an 
extraordinary entertainment dynasty -- or cartoon figures who blow themselves 
up, drop anvils on each other's heads and bounce right back for next week's 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, they have made a grotesque public spectacle of their marriage and, 
it appears, a mockery of a problem that plagues millions of American women. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad for them. Too bad for us.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; THE DALY AGENDA; SURE SHE LIKES THE PERKS OF DATING THE 
MAYOR, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE LIVES FOR. NANCY DALY SAVES HER REAL PASSION FOR 
KIDS IN DIRE STRAITS. 
</P>

<P>
 What a curious license plate, the mayor was thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's beshert ?" Richard Riordan asked press aide David Novak as they headed 
into a radio station recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and Nancy are beshert ," Novak said, defining the Hebrew word. "When two 
souls are brought into the world, you're fated eventually to be together. And 
when you come together, it's meant to be -- strong people and similar 
interests, from biking to children to taking care of people. It's beshert ." 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Nancy Daly, the mayor's beshert , arrives at the Children's 
Museum. Her presence is as muted as the kid-packed building is raucous. She 
slips in wearing a taupe pantsuit and pearls, her dark blond hair curling 
slightly beneath her chin. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, Daly seems rather like the incarnation of two Southern 
Californias -- the fresh, pert looks of Gidget polished by the tasteful 
imperatives of Rodeo Drive. She's petite -- and remarkably trim, thanks in part 
to thrice-weekly visits from a personal trainer she met while helping at 
MacLaren Children's Center, the county's emergency foster home in El Monte for 
abused and neglected kids. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLaren might seem an odd place to find a fitness guru, but it's one of the 
capitals on Daly's map. The facility has been one of the most notable stops on 
her journey since her first visit 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The ripples from that visit have been profound. Daly, 52, went on to become 
one of L.A.'s most prominent children's activists, partly by harnessing 
substantial Hollywood contacts stemming from her 30-year marriage to Warner 
Bros. CEO Robert A. Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Daly helped start the United Friends of the Children, a charitable 
foundation that channels volunteers' time and money to MacLaren; she helped 
establish the county Department of Children's Services, and she served on the 
nonpartisan National Commission on Children, which recommended government 
policy reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Donald Cohen, director of the Yale Child Studies Center, served with Daly 
on the commission from 1989 to 1992. "She was the central, most important 
person on the commission for adolescence and foster care and the transition 
from foster care to adulthood," he says. "She brought this real personal 
engagement to thinking about these children because she didn't relate to them 
in a professional capacity, but as a mentor and advocate and friend of children 
in foster care." 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of helping children find some semblance of family life, and a 
little peace, Daly found more than a personal trainer -- she found Riordan. He 
had lost two of his five children a decade ago -- his only son drowned and a 
daughter died of bulimia -- and Riordan was known for funneling his money and 
his drive into children's charities. (They receive most of the $3 million he 
donates yearly.) 
</P>
<P>
 Daly and Riordan met about five years ago, when she asked him to fund a 
$20,000 computer reading lab at MacLaren. (He did.) Riordan was impressed: "I 
thought she was somebody who obviously cared. I was very struck with her 
practical ability, that she knew how to implement things, which is rare among 
people, whether in government or charity." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple years later, Daly and friends hit up Riordan for another donation, 
this time to help bankroll an immunization program for underprivileged 
children. He gave $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got on the speaker phone and rounded up other people immediately who then 
gave us money," Daly says. "It just happened when we sat there. It was very 
obvious that he does things immediately. He's a doer and doesn't put things 
off. I had never seen anybody operate that way before." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly filed for divorce in November, 1991, and her first date with Riordan was 
a Christmas holiday party at Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found out she was separated," Riordan says, "I thought, 'This 
brilliant, beautiful caring human being, I ought to do something about that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Says Daly: "I think both of us have lived full lives. We've had a lot of 
experiences, and sometimes I think we've been in training for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 He had been footloose since his separation five years ago from his second 
wife, Jill. But Daly has been the official First Significant Other from the 
start of his Administration, appearing by his side at the July, 1993, 
inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 They live apart -- Daly in an airy, 15-room home in Bel-Air, and Riordan, 64 
today, in a $6-million French Colonial house in Brentwood -- and see each 
other, she says, "as often as possible." That often translates to five days a 
week, for city and charity functions or that scarce resource, leisure: biking, 
reading, or spending time with family or friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the date is no easy feat. "It's a complicated procedure," Daly says. 
"It takes his office and my secretary a lot of planning. They talk to each 
other a couple of times a day to coordinate." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Daly and Riordan are Catholics, and the mayor's personal life has caused 
ripples in the Catholic community. The Los Angeles archdiocesan newspaper, the 
Tidings, recently published this query from an "ordinary divorced Catholic": 
"Given that the mayor has been married twice, is separated from his wife, has 
been keeping company with a married woman, and is 'pro-choice' regarding 
abortion, how can he receive Communion?" 
</P>
<P>
 Father Gregory Coiro responded that separated and divorced Catholics may still 
receive the sacraments. The couple declines to discuss Catholic reaction to 
their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if theirs is not a marriage, it's a union of sentiment and city life. 
Riordan has charged Daly with heading a committee to propose changes in the way 
Los Angeles serves children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't need another responsibility," Daly says, legs crossed on a floral 
sofa in her home. "But I knew it was an opportunity to create some change and 
bring in these fabulously talented people that I knew. There's never really 
been a place in the city to go (on behalf of) children. You could go to an 
individual city councilperson on an issue, but there was never the place to go. 
More than anything, we'd like to see that happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly is also taking on the major renovation of Getty House, the mayor's 
official but vacant Windsor Square residence, near Hancock Park. She has 
recruited friends to raise funds, and the committee has persuaded professionals 
(architect Grant Taylor and attorney Jeff Glassman, among them) to donate 
services. David Hockney is honorary chairman of the art committee. Their 
mission is to restore the 1921 English Tudor home for an April, 1995, opening. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor has no plans to live there. "But there is no really official place 
(here) to properly entertain foreign dignitaries and conduct the business of 
the city in a way that would entice people to do business (in Los Angeles)," 
Daly says. 
</P>
<P>
 She is mindful of the importance of meshing work and pleasure, bringing to the 
city years of experience as a CEO's wife in Hollywood, where business is often 
done outside studio walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to sit in an office and it's another to sit at dinner and 
interact in a more informal way," she says. "I think there's tremendous benefit 
to that. New York City has Gracie Mansion, and it's a privilege and an honor to 
go there, and I think we need a similar setting in this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly knows the art of entertaining. In court papers stemming from her divorce, 
she argued that her skills as a hostess enhanced Bob Daly's professional 
reputation, creating "executive goodwill" that helped him reach the top of his 
field. She said the warm family atmosphere she cultivated despite his long work 
hours and her charity deeds also contributed to his image and earning power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob always supported my work in charities and I believe that this work 
enhanced his reputation and standing in the entertainment industry," Nancy Daly 
said in court papers. "Shortly after Bob became CEO of Warner's, at my 
instigation he dispensed with the customary Christmas practice of sending 
expensive gifts to industry notables and instead made a contribution to 
MacLaren Hall on their behalf. . . . We were one of the first studio executive 
families to do this. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly maintained that she was entitled not only to her share of the couple's 
tangible assets -- estimated by Bob Daly in court papers at $45 million -- but 
also to millions in future earnings because of the so-called executive 
goodwill. The case resulted in a mountain of documents as Nancy Daly sought to 
wrest closely held financial information from parent company Time Warner Inc. 
and court depositions from its top officials. 
</P>
<P>
 She attempted to learn the contents of Bob Daly's new five-year contract and, 
failing that, of Warner Bros. President Terry Semel's recently negotiated deal. 
</P>
<P>
 As the battle intensified, Bob Daly's attorneys threatened in court papers to 
seek a deposition from Riordan. Her side countered that it in turn might seek a 
statement from singer-songwriter Carole Bayer Sager, described in court 
documents as Bob Daly's "current co-habitant."  
</P>
<P>
 The Dalys recently settled the case and agreed to keep secret its details, 
thus avoiding a monthlong trial and the prospect of their divorce becoming 
enshrined in California law. 
</P>
<P>
 The heady issues of the case demonstrate how American Dream-like Daly's life 
has been. She was born in northern New Jersey to middle-class parents; her 
father was an accountant, and her mother, a homemaker. Her older brother, 
Gregory MacNeil, is a New Jersey businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 She capped a reasonably happy childhood with secretarial school. During her 
first permanent job as a secretary at CBS, she met Bob Daly, who started his 
career in the mail room there. They married in 1961, when she was 20 and he was 
24, and embarked on traditional married life in a Brooklyn, N.Y., apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 She quit work a couple of years later, and in 1966 they started a family. 
Daughter Linda, 28, teaches learning-disabled children at the HELP Group in 
Sherman Oaks; Bobby, 26, works as a producer and interactive-computer 
entrepreneur in New York, and Brian, 23, recently graduated from New York 
University Tisch School of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly says she enjoyed being a mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved being home with my kids," she says. "I organized play groups for my 
children when they were very little. I was always finding ways to network and 
bring mothers together. And I don't get crazy over things. I loved having them 
around. So I was a Cub Scout leader, a Girl Scout leader, a soccer coach. I 
just loved the world of children." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly children who might have annoyed less patient adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids always have a couple of friends (who) are off the wall and you are 
going, 'Oh my God, what kind of trouble are they going to get into?' As much as 
I may have worried occasionally, those were the friends I was most interested 
in. I like kids who are maybe supercharged, who have a lot of dimensions. I 
find them challenging and exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 After living in New Jersey for 10 years, the Dalys came to California in 1978 
for Bob's new position as president of CBS' entertainment division. Shortly 
after the move, Nancy discovered MacLaren. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to MacLaren changed my life," she says simply. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened one Christmas. She had heard through industry friends of plans to 
hold a holiday party for MacLaren kids. The partyers included Bob Newhart's 
wife, Ginnie; Barbara Rickles, and Henry and Stacey Winkler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never seen a place like this," Daly says. "It had been a probation 
facility, and it was turned into a protection facility several years earlier. . 
. . They changed the population, but they didn't change the environment for the 
children. The kids looked sad, and I found it almost unbearable." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly expected the children to be afraid of outsiders but was encouraged by 
their response to the volunteers' visits. She returned with Henry Winkler after 
the Christmas party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw anybody with such an ability to relate to these children," Daly 
says. "He went into one of the toddler cottages, and there was a little boy on 
his bed, and he was hitting himself, and Henry said, 'Why are you doing that?' 
</P>
<P>
 "And he said, 'I'm bad. I'm bad.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And Henry sat down on the bed with him and cuddled him and told him he wasn't 
bad. And I guess probably more than anything, his sensitivity and this child's 
feeling that he was somehow to blame for his being there -- he was maybe 3 or 4 
-- that was the most poignant time." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the beginning of United Friends of the Children. The handful of 
friends has quadrupled over the years to 80 hands-on volunteers. They make 
monthly treks to MacLaren for barbecues and grooming days, on which Vidal 
Sassoon hairdressers bolster the kids' self-esteem with new dos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of my members did manicures, so we could do massaging and touching and 
caring and demonstrating to the children that they are cared about by people 
who aren't getting paid and who aren't trying to abuse them in some way," Daly 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 United Friends also sponsors a tutoring program for learning disabled 
residents, a theater program and a store where the kids can exchange 
good-behavior points for new jeans, stuffed toys and Cross Colours T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say it was something (Nancy) had a vision for, and it's grown now," 
says longtime friend Joanne Agoglia, who has worked with United Friends and on 
other projects. "Nancy always has new ideas, and she's able to make it all come 
together. She has good instincts for the people that can work together and 
enjoy being together and because of that, we accomplish a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly's organizational talent also involves tapping her industry contacts on 
MacLaren's behalf: Jon Peters and Barbra Streisand paid for MacLaren's swimming 
pool. Warner Bros. donated a bus emblazoned with Bugs Bunny. Movie studios lend 
first-run prints for special MacLaren showings at the El Monte Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we've touched every part of the community as a whole to pull them in in 
some way or other and help us, and we've never been turned down for anything," 
Daly says. 
</P>
<P>
 The beginning was rough, however. County officials resisted United Friends' 
efforts until the county Department of Children's Services was established a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to try to fight us from coming to MacLaren and doing what we could 
do," Daly recalls. "Because it brought attention to what was really a negative, 
the open wound of the county. Because it was sort of hidden out in El Monte, 
nobody quite knew until we came along what was going on and we brought 
attention to that and made it known." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, Stacey Winkler and United Friends lobbied heavily for the creation of 
the children's department. At the time, money targeted for children "was buried 
in the welfare system, and we felt the money wasn't going to the children," 
Daly says. "It was going elsewhere. Nobody could find it." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with county Supervisor Ed Edelman, the group enlisted celebrities 
Daniel J. Travanti, Carol Burnett, Sally Struthers, Henry Winkler and Lyle 
Alzado to testify for the new department. And it helped TV reporters expose 
problems in the foster-care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who appointed Daly to the advisory Children's Services Commission, 
says her efforts were critical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think without her help, it may not have been established," he says. "She 
was very, very helpful (because of) her enthusiasm, her dedication and 
obviously her ability to organize and get people to follow her lead." 
</P>
<P>
 And as Daly talked to kids in foster care, she heard the constant refrain: "I 
want to go home." Her campaign for family preservation began five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ideal is to work with families and return children," she says. "Here 
you've created a population of children that can't go home. There's no one 
who's saved their pictures that they drew all the way through school. There's 
not a continuity, someone who remembers their first steps. We have kids who 
don't have anybody with those cherished memories. They're sort of isolated in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly worked with the Department of Children's Services to change the way the 
county deals with troubled homes. Rather than put kids in foster care, the idea 
is to work with families to create healthier environments for children, 
enabling them to stay at home. And she helped lobby for state legislation a 
couple of years ago that permits counties to shift some foster-care money to 
family preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one organized woman. A month after the Northridge earthquake, her 
skills are evident in a nearly pristine collection of Rookwood pottery, made in 
turn-of-the-century Cincinnati, surrounding her first-floor fireplace.  
</P>
<P>
 Only one piece had not been waxed into place, a museum technique for 
preserving fragile objects.  
</P>
<P>
 Only one piece broke in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly's three dogs -- sibling labs Bud and Goldie and Yorkshire terrier Molly 
-- prowl about. Family members dot the living room in spirit and in photos. 
Daly is particularly fond of one photograph of her Republican boyfriend jogging 
with the Democratic President. She's a liberal Democrat, and the picture could 
be a metaphor for the couple's political alliance. Daly calls their respective 
party lines insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider them at this point labels, and I think many people do. So many of 
my friends who are strong liberal Democrats, some of whom voted for the mayor 
and some didn't. One thing I've learned in these months is, the people who 
voted for him are thrilled with him, and those who didn't think he's doing a 
great job."  
</P>
<P>
 She likes some of the perks of dating the mayor -- the dinner with Rosa Parks, 
the evening at her home with Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. But the 
sudden transformation into public figure is something else for Daly, who values 
her privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I have to say it surprises me, but yesterday I went to a restaurant 
Downtown, a hotel, and I was parking my car and the man who took my car 
recognized me," she says. "That's still very surprising to me. I'm used to 
being an anonymous person. But it isn't something I'm uncomfortable with." 
</P>
<P>
 The consummate organizer recognizes the value of the public eye in getting 
things done. So although she's hesitant to do interviews, mindful that requests 
have come since she and the mayor went public, she consents. 
</P>
<P>
 And on this clear morning of spring, with the brash sounds of kids ricocheting 
off the Children's Museum walls, Daly tours a photo exhibit, trailed by cameras 
herself. The exhibit features pictures shot by kids from MacLaren and from Ann 
Theisen's home -- the former nun has taken in 10 adoptive and foster children, 
some of them drug babies -- under a United Friends program. 
</P>
<P>
 The young photographers are there. They're proud and they're pulling Daly this 
way and that to see their work. Maggie, an 8-year-old with long brown braids, 
takes Daly to see her photo of a baby in bed pondering the onlooker, a hand 
tugging at her right ear. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a quote with the picture: "I like to sleep in my bed but then I go 
into my mother's bed when she's sleeping." Beneath those words the quote is 
translated into sign language, because Maggie cannot speak. 
</P>
<P>
 As Maggie looks at Daly in triumph and expectation, Daly responds in the 
language all children understand. She bends down and plants a kiss on Maggie's 
head. Nancy MacNeil Daly

 The extremely low-profile Young Presidents' Organization -- an association of 
corporate presidents and chief executive officers who run multimillion-dollar 
companies and who reached their positions before 40 -- will be convening in Los 
Angeles this week. 
</P>
<P>
 (The millions required for membership vary according to the type of businesses 
they run.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although these high achievers will participate in educational events by day, 
we thought you'd like to know some of the things they'll be doing for the fun 
part of their stay: 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the usual shopping trips and black-tie galas, they'll eat dinner with 
Jay Leno on the set of "The Tonight Show," schmooze at the Playboy Mansion and 
take cooking lessons at Spago. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's hear it for the 30 or so members who signed up for an all-day 
Harley-Davidson ride, with interludes at such renowned Harley pit stops as the 
Calamigos Ranch, Sagebrush Cantina and Mulholland Drive. 
</P>

<P>
 Down to Capistrano: Say what you will about the city, but there really is 
something for everyone here. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those people whose heads are sometimes quaintly occupied with another 
era -- and we admit it, we're right there with you -- will be heading south 
(no, not on Harleys) to the fourth annual Capistrano Antiques and Garden Show, 
May 13-15.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the events that will make many hearts sing will be a lecture on the 
history of topiary design, a discourse on Victorian America ("From Classical 
Romanticism to Gilded Opulence") and, sure to be a crowd pleaser, Gep 
Durenberger's tell-all talk, "Confessions of a Dealer" -- that's antique 
dealer, of course.

 Celebrity Ties: Venice ARTWALK, the annual art happening that supports Venice 
Family Clinic, will add cash to its coffers May 15 by selling and auctioning 
ties hand-painted by a diverse list of artists, including Billy Al Bengston, 
Peter Shire, Joe Goode, Peter Alexander, Betye Saar, Erica Rothenberg and, for 
fans of actor-artists or artist-actors, Tony Curtis.

UP ALL NIGHT: IN THE GROOVE AT INDIGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When you think of cool, do you think of the Ramada Inn? Underground parking, 
loud floral carpets, bellhops and chandeliers? A lady in a wig singing "My 
Funny Valentine" at the piano bar? 
</P>
<P>
 Think again. Both cool and hot, the Indigo Jazz Lounge thrives in the Compton 
Ramada Inn and Convention Center. The decor is basic lounge -- low lights, 
candles on the tables, a mirror ball or two. The long bar has a good view of 
the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday through Friday this is where everyone from the nearby Compton City Hall 
waits for the traffic to die down. The entertainment is recorded music and TV 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the week, we get people from the district attorney's office, the 
mayor's office," says bartender Mia Gordon, a psychology major at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills who plans to go to law school. 
</P>
<P>
 But on weekends, the club turns into an upscale hot spot with a line to get in 
and a $5 cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Seville plays every Friday night -- three synchronized sharpies in neon-blue 
suits who sing and move in perfect harmony, doing songs from Etta James, 
Michael Jackson and Bobby Brown with equal verve and aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturdays, rhythm-and-blues singer Elaine Gibbs performs. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday night, Lonnie Howard, campaign manager for Compton Mayor 
Walter R. Tucker, is hanging out at the bar in a neon track suit. "People 
should know that Compton is a place where they can come and enjoy themselves," 
he says, adding, "This place has a good atmosphere for black people and all 
minority people. 
</P>
<P>
 LaVerne Jackson and Odelle Smith sit at the bar together watching the dancers. 
"I grew up here," says Jackson, who works in health care, "and this is the 
place I like to come to. 
</P>
<P>
 Seville changes into red ties and red suits. "If you live it, put your heart 
into it," says lead singer Philemon Young Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel and lounge are run by Lawrence Woods, former chief engineer for the 
hotel, who isn't above taking a turn on the dance floor with the customers. The 
club is close to his heart, he says. "This is a place where the real people of 
Compton can come and relax." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Indigo Jazz Lounge, Ramada Hotel and Convention Center, 111 E. 
Artesia Blvd., Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 When: 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $5 cover. Well drinks $4, beer $2.50.

GALLERY: A PORT OF VELKOMMEN

<P>
 Some houses of worship are known for the pealing of their bells. But in its 
Beacon Street neighborhood, the Norwegian Seaman's Church of San Pedro is known 
for playing appropriate national anthems through loudspeakers for Scandinavian 
ships passing through the harbor -- a touch of velkommen (welcome) for sailors 
and tourists."We don't play the music before 9 a.m. though," says Norwegian 
church hostess Liv Nilson. "Otherwise we'll wake the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 The church doors, in fact, don't open until 10 a.m. But when they do, out 
floats the aroma of freshly baked pastries, waffles and coffee to entice 
visitors. Regulars gather to watch ships and read hometown papers from Oslo, 
Bergen or Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Norwegian pastor Annette Billing and Swedish pastor Leif Eliasson, 
Nilson and Swede Ingre Pearson keep the church's doors open seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more than a seaman's church," Pearson says. "This is the church 
abroad for Norwegians and Swedes. It is very important for Scandinavian 
tourists, and it is a tremendous source of support for au pair girls from the 
Nordic nations."

SCREEN STYLE: (KIND OF) WESTERN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Bad Girls." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: A shoot-'em-up adventure featuring four reformed "harlots" in the 
roles of tough guys of the Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Susie DeSanto, whose credits include "A Dangerous 
Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Breck girls on the range. Sticklers for period authenticity won't 
like it, but it's hard to imagine any of the summer's numerous upcoming 
Westerns pleasing the fashion crowd as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Part camp, part suburban mall, the highlights include Eileen Spenser (Andie 
MacDowell, pictured) in a jacket cut from a fringed piano shawl, with the 
cut-out shoulders Donna Karan favors. And Lilly Laronette (Drew Barrymore), the 
Annie Oakley-style pigtailed cutie, in a man's derby, peasant blouse and 
cowhide chaps. Even after the adventurers shed their petticoats for canvas 
trousers, vests and gun belts, the emphasis remains on body-conscious paper-bag 
waists. 
</P>
<P>
 Trend Watch: All the actresses fell in love with the calico-print and 
gingham-check dresses, skirts and blouses, DeSanto reports. She believes the 
Americana prints could make a fashion comeback.  
</P>
<P>
 Good Hair Day: Long, glossy, unfussy hair, even if some of it was achieved 
with hair extensions (MacDowell) and a partial wig (Barrymore). 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: Big-screen Westerns, including "The Professionals," "Rancho 
Notorious" and "Once Upon a Time in the West"; the Gene Autry Western Heritage 
Museum in Los Angeles, and, for more feminine looks, paintings by Sargent, 
Tissot, Monet and Renoir. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I found during my research that contemporary fashions always had a 
mark on the costumes. Marlene Dietrich in 'Rancho Notorious' wore boots and 
pants with a nipped-in waist and had her girdle on and everything. She looked 
fabulous," DeSanto says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Principals' clothes were custom-made on location in California and 
Texas. Calico fabrics were from Hopkins in London. The piano shawl for 
MacDowell's jacket was from Golyester. Cowboy boots were manufactured by 
Freelance. BETTY GOODWIN

GOOD TO KNOW LOVE CAN SURVIVE THE BIG FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Making up is Hard to Do" by Elizabeth Mehren in Life & Style (April 25) was 
interestingly written and probably comforting for many couples who now know 
they are not alone in their major conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 But I want to assure young couples just beginning what they hope will be a 
lifelong relationship that "the five-alarm fight" is not a nasty fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
 My first marriage of about 15 years, although ending in divorce, was free from 
such conflicts, and my present 19-year marriage is most satisfying and 
conflict-free. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for those of you looking forward to a long, satisfying relationship free 
of dramatic ups and downs, take heart -- it can and does happen.

WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS; CONSUMERS: AN EXHIBITION OF USER 
MANUALS -- INCLUDING 600 VOLUMES ON BUILDING A PLANE -- HAS MANY YEARNING FOR 
SIMPLER TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the technically challenged, solace can be found here. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a 12-step program to overcome the anxiety of wading through 
perplexing VCR instructions. Rather, it is the American debut of a Dutch 
user-manual exhibition that showcases more than 800 confusing or downright 
strange examples of instructions for everything from condoms to German tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety, as the exhibition demonstrates, is feeling the ground shake and 
watching a mushroom cloud develop in the distance while thumbing through a Cold 
War-era, Soviet nuclear-blast manual for using low-level radiation-resistant 
gas masks. 
</P>
<P>
 No less confusing, but certainly of less consequence, are the 600 volumes in 
48 feet of shelf space that attempt to explain how to build from scratch a 
Fokker 100 series airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our modern life is getting more complicated every day," said the show's Dutch 
designer, Peter de Rooden. "The need for clear and simple instruction is 
therefore more urgent than ever. This is the point of the exhibit." 
</P>
<P>
 De Rooden, founder of the Art Project Foundation, a nonprofit organization in 
the Netherlands, said it took more than 10 years to gather the items that 
appear in 11 languages in the exhibition, housed through the end of May at the 
Fashion Institute of Technology's galleries in the Manhattan neighborhood of 
Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Twining Globus, museum curator at FIT, conceded that user manuals are 
a twist for a gallery that usually showcases fabric and clothing. One recent 
exhibition displayed ancient cloth used in mummifying a cat.  
</P>
<P>
 "FIT is best known for its fashion design," she said. "We hope to have more 
exhibits like this one that reflect the entire curriculum of the school." FIT 
offers a bachelor's degree in advertising design, with some course work devoted 
to user-manual writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the exhibition is chock-full of convoluted instructions that might 
drive users mad, De Rooden insists that manual writers are usually unfairly 
branded as feeble-minded or evil. 
</P>
<P>
 The real problem, De Rooden said, are the technical complexities introduced by 
computers, which have rendered obsolete the old "slip Part A into Part B" 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is all too often mounds of technical hieroglyphics. The 300-page 
manual for a 1990s Canon computer laser printer, replete with industry jargon 
and confusing tables, dwarfs a more simple 40-page manual for the 1985 model 
and a 20-page version for a 1980 printer that even a child could understand. 
</P>
<P>
 A manual for a Philips VCR remote includes a diagram that more closely 
resembles an electrical engineer's schematic -- a centipede-like drawing with 
88 straight and squiggly lines and circles identifying various functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouilda Benitez, who took in the show during her lunch break, hovered over 51 
airplane emergency-evacuation procedure cards, about half of which have 
diagrams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only understand the ones with pictures," she said, pointing to diagrams. 
"Put the mask on your face, and when the plane hits the water slide down the 
slide." 
</P>
<P>
 Globus said the exhibition demonstrates the need for communication to 
transcend language and cultural barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason why instructions and manuals, particularly in the area of 
safety, aren't entirely universal in terms of the methods of communication," 
she said. Globus pointed to a display unit that had four symbols from four 
countries warning against transporting butane gas in the trunk of a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Most entertaining is the display labeled "Failures." "Lighting will commence 
in the course of the evening dawn," one manual said about installing a light 
fixture. And what's the "antecedent extinction of programme"? Another manual's 
dire warning against touching two wires together.

DON'T GIVE DETAILS ON THE TOAD CRAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to you regarding the April 19 article "A New Craze Hops Into Drug 
Culture" (toad smoking). 
</P>
<P>
 I find it incredibly irresponsible of you to publish this article purporting 
to illustrate, on the one hand, the dangers and cruelty of this "bizarre 
phenomenon," yet on the other hand, supplying each and every reader with an 
exacting description of which species to look for, where to look, how to 
excrete the substance from toads' glands, how to smoke it and the fair market 
street value for the illegal entrepreneur.

NEARBY WHIDBEY ISLAND, A GEM ON PUGET SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Miller is a reporter in The Times' 
Washington, D.C., bureau. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The surrounding country, for several miles in most points of view, presented 
a delightful prospect, consisting chiefly of spacious meadows, elegantly 
adorned with clumps of trees," wrote Capt. George Vancouver, extolling the 
virtues of central Whidbey Island in 1792. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these beautiful pastures, bordering on an expansive sheet of water, the 
deer were seen playing about in great numbers. Nature had here provided a 
well-stocked park." 
</P>
<P>
 Two centuries later, we discovered that this fertile island refuge that snakes 
northward from the mouth of Puget Sound, 26 miles north of Seattle, remains an 
idyllic destination, particularly for the city-weary. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich in wildlife, sparsely developed and surrounded by scenic vistas, Whidbey 
and the San Juan Islands to the north are considered the gems of these waters 
-- with good reason. For us, Whidbey was a welcome way station as we traveled 
from Seattle to Vancouver during a late summer vacation last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Our host was another captain, John Colby Stone, the convivial innkeeper at the 
Captain Whidbey Inn, a rustic 86-year-old log cabin outside the town of 
Coupeville on the protected waters of Penn Cove, which is home to the 
sweet-tasting mussels that bear the same name. The inn itself, made of madrona 
logs, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. We had learned of 
its renown from a guidebook on country inns. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stone commands more than landlocked accommodations. His teak "Cutty Sark" 
is a handsome 52-foot gaff ketch that was built in Hong Kong and is capable of 
transoceanic passage. Viewing its seven bark-tan sails and six round portals, 
my wife Katherine called it "a perfect Peter Pan ship." 
</P>
<P>
 We had arrived in Penn Cove to unwind at the Captain Whidbey Inn and to join 
Stone for an invigorating jaunt on his craft. With us in tow on a crisp, sunny 
day, the Captain navigated around Penn Cove's peaceful haven, celebrating the 
good fortune that he now makes part of his living chartering his beloved 
vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 As a long-necked cormorant raced past, he recalled that his mother, who 
schooled him in the art of inn-keeping, used to say, "The work is never done. 
How can you go sailing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now 42 with a decidedly gray beard and mustache, Stone would respond: "If the 
work is never done, what difference does it make?" Today he tells her: "Mom, it 
is my work." 
</P>
<P>
 For the visitor, Whidbey Island's narrow, winding 45-mile length feels like 
anything but work. Expansive parks, bordered by water and views of the Olympic 
Peninsula to the west and inhabited by great blue herons, bald eagles, 
red-tailed foxes, rhododendrons and rare wild iris, beckon hikers and bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cove-side town of Coupeville offers marine vistas, pubs, artsy stores, 
19th-Century Victorian homes and a small museum that charts the region's 
history, dating back 10,000 years to the time Native Americans first inhabited 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Captain Whidbey Inn itself -- from which Stone and his exquisite boat 
are available for day sails, moonlight cruises and longer trips to the San 
Juans -- is an invitation to slow down and pick up a book, sip wine by a 
roaring fire or let time slip past doing nothing more than admiring the 
scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply awakening to the call of gulls and the smell of bacon, donning a fluffy 
terry-cloth robe and peering out at the eye-opening blueness of the cove were 
among the many small pleasures that our stay afforded us. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can reach Whidbey, the longest island within inland waters of the 
continental United States, by air, ferry or car. We drove our rental car north 
from Seattle on Interstate 5, then swung west and south on Washington 20, over 
Deception Pass, and onto the island. At the pass, we crossed a two-lane bridge 
with spectacular views of the bluffs and pounding waves below. It was here that 
Joseph Whidbey, master of Vancouver's flagship, discovered in 1792 that what 
had appeared to be a narrow inlet was actually a passage to the water beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Deception Pass State Park, on Whidbey just south of the connecting 
bridge, encompasses old growth timber, dense vegetation, freshwater lakes and 
miles of shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 As we made our way south on the island toward Coupeville, we passed wheat 
fields and fruit stands abundant with ripe produce ("U-pick raspberries"). 
Overhead roared a plane destined for Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. The 
island, which has a population of about 55,000, boasts the world's highest 
yield of wheat per acre as well as its largest loganberry farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first stop was the inn, located at the head of Penn Cove in the central 
part of the island. We were immediately struck by the scent of pine. "It takes 
me back to my childhood," sighed Katherine. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, which is surrounded by stately evergreens, is a vestige of the 
days when log cabins were prevalent in the Northwest. The polished madrona wood 
is a dark honey color with a warm, glowing sheen. Madrona is an extremely hard 
wood that does not grow as straight as pine; therefore the logs are cut in 
lengths no longer than eight feet and are butted rather than notched. 
</P>
<P>
 They are now chinked with mortar as well, a concession to both the weather -- 
the inn was originally a summer resort -- and discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 The inn's downstairs living and dining rooms create a distinctly informal, 
homey first impression. Both have fireplaces made with large beach stones and 
comfortable antique furnishings. The upstairs rooms are generally small. Ours 
had a feather bed with overstuffed down comforters, a chair and wooden dresser 
and a shaving-bowl sink in the corner. The top-hinged windows were propped open 
with wooden pegs and looked onto the cove and peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Other rooms face the herb and vegetable-filled garden -- the source of many 
ingredients for the kitchen. Books and magazines abound. Bathrooms are shared. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawn chairs and a multilevel deck overlook the cove. Guests can take 
sandwiches outside for lunch or a drink to toast the day turning to dusk. The 
inn also makes picnic boxes on request (you might try the cured and 
alder-smoked turkey with apple chipotle relish, anise-scented sweet cicely and 
other garden greens on a house-baked baguette). 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast, which is served in a flower-filled dining room that fronts the bay, 
includes granola and fresh baked breads such as banana-hazelnut and 
cranberry-orange-walnut. The daily entrees are such creations as baked oatmeal 
with fresh berries and nuts topped with vanilla cream and toasted almonds. 
Orange juice and coffee are available to wash it all down. 
</P>
<P>
 One day we decided to venture three miles down the road to Coupeville for 
lunch. Our destination was the Knead & Feed, nestled on the banks of the 
waterfront. Coupeville (pop. 1,200) is the island's oldest town; many of its 
19th-Century homes can be seen on a walking tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knead & Feed building, with its white-stone walls and wood beams, was 
built as a store in 1871. Since 1974, it has been owned by the Kroon family, 
who pride themselves on their fresh-baked breads, pastries and pies and soups 
made from scratch daily. We enjoyed rich, tasty soups of corn chowder and 
lentil with tomatoes, and salads. Dessert was marionberry pie, filled with 
locally grown fruit that looks and tastes much like large sweet blackberries. 
</P>
<P>
 Shops along Northwest Front Street sell carvings, woodworking and antiques. 
Many were decorated with baskets of impatiens. A restaurant reflected the 
Northwest's love affair with coffee, touting a daily special of espresso with 
steamed milk: "Tall raspberry coconut latte. $1.65. Iced or hot." We stopped at 
Jan McGregor's studio, where she has been minding the shop for 17 years. 
McGregor is a potter who studied with a Japanese master in Kyoto for two years. 
Her distinctive pieces, inlaid with cobalt, have been exhibited in museums. 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor said that she had obtained 10 pounds of natural cobalt from China, 
but that the source is now depleted. Fortunately, McGregor said her stock "will 
last me a lifetime -- or more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next time we saw Coupeville was from innkeeper John Stone's ship. A 
merchant marine officer and longtime sailor, Stone schedules regular weekend 
sails from May to September but is available for chartering other times as 
well. We engaged him for a two-hour outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone's family has owned the Captain Whidbey Inn for 32 years. His parents 
bought it from relatives; he moved into the cabin when he was 14. When his 
parents considered selling it in 1980, he acted as their financial adviser and 
ended up agreeing to buy it himself. So much for graduate school, recalled the 
ex-sociology major. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youth, he said, he had to move out of his room whenever a guest requested 
it. So, to discourage interlopers, he built model airplanes and hung them from 
the ceiling in mock dogfights. Of course, the model airplane room quickly 
became the inn's most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 We sailed past the floating mussel farms that have won Penn Cove its culinary 
acclaim. They are not farms in the conventional sense. Rather, they consist of 
anchored wooden rafts with hundreds of orange and yellow ropes suspended from 
them into the cool, pristine waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The larvae settle on the collecting ropes, resembling salt and pepper. A 
single line produces 45 to 60 pounds of mussels in a year. Workers from Penn 
Cove Mussels, Inc., were harvesting the mollusk crop as we sailed past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's farming and you're not taking anything away," Rawle Jefferds, Penn 
Cove's sales representative, explained the next day. "That's the glory of it. 
All you're doing is providing a home for the mussels and they're going to be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 A veritable mussel cove of dreams: If you hang it, they will come. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone is an unabashed admirer of the tasty bivalves. Each March he holds a 
four-day mussel festival at the inn. Subscribers to his newsletter send in 
recipes that he and his chef test before selecting an annual winner. The prize: 
a $100 gift certificate to the inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival dinners feature Penn Cove mussels in every course. This might include 
mussels on the half shell, mussels Rockefeller or mussels in a puff pastry with 
a cream sauce. Dessert, a challenge, might be mussel mincemeat pie or, 
incongruously, mussels in a sweet citron sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone's favorite way to prepare the home-grown legend is on the inn's dinner 
menu every night. Captain Whidbey ginger steamed mussels -- courtesy of the 
inn's first winning recipe -- are prepared with sesame oil, ginger, garlic, soy 
sauce and chili peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, Katherine, our mussel maven, pronounced them among the best 
she's ever tasted: sweet, succulent, terrific. They highlighted a dinner heavy 
on fresh seafood and greens. We also sampled Stone's extensive list of wines 
and Northwest beers. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, at the Island County Historical Society and Museum in 
Coupeville, we learned that 19th-Century settlers considered Whidbey Island a 
paradise. They were impressed by its abundant shellfish, rich alluvial soil, 
mild climate and diversity of flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Thomas Coupe, a man of serious visage and long sideburns, filed one of 
the first land claims on Whidbey Island. When he first visited Penn Cove in 
1852, he wrote to his wife: "I have found the Garden of Eden."

TRAVEL INSIDER: REACTIONS DIFFER TO RISING TIDE OF CARIBBEAN CRIME; SAFETY: THE 
NAVY CANCELED ST. THOMAS SHORE LEAVE; MOST CRUISE LINES ISSUE ONLY INFORMAL 
ADVICE.

 It was the April 10 death of tourist Murray Callan, a vacationing San Diegan 
shot by a mugger on one of the busiest streets on St. Thomas, that started 
recent talk of trouble in the U.S. Virgin Islands. But it's now clear that 
crimes against visitors and residents had been escalating in the area for many 
months before the shooting, prompting requests from island officials for law 
enforcement aid and leading the U.S. Navy last fall to cancel all its port 
calls to the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those developments, several cruise lines serving St. Thomas, one of 
the most popular ports in the Caribbean, say they have made no substantial 
changes in the informal, unwritten safety advice they offer to passengers going 
ashore by day, and don't expect any changes in the foreseeable future. Cruise 
ship advice to passengers now often amounts to spoken suggestions that they use 
common sense. Of the seven major lines contacted last week, none offer 
passengers printed matter on the subject of shore safety. A spokesman for the 
Cruise Line International Assn., the leading cruise ship trade organization, 
said that the group has made no recommendations to its members regarding safety 
advice to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kind of things tend to be swept under the rug," said Larry Fishkin, 
president of The Cruise Line, a Miami-based agency that specializes in matching 
customers with cruise lines. "If there is a problem, I think their 
responsibility is to notify passengers to take precautions." 
</P>
<P>
 One possible response, Fishkin said, would be to follow the lead of rental car 
agencies in southern Florida where, after the recent spate of crimes against 
tourists, agencies started handing out detailed brochures advising "what to do 
and not to do."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Virgin Islands, which lie just east of Puerto Rico, include St. 
Thomas, St. John and St. Croix, and have for years enjoyed a reputation as 
sleepy, sun-soaked destinations. But authorities say recent years have brought 
broad increases in crime and drug problems throughout the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise passengers are shielded from many of these problems because they are 
almost always on shore by day and back on board ship by nightfall. But 
authorities agree the best precautions for cruise travelers do fall within most 
travelers' definition of "common sense." In areas where street crime is a 
concern, tourists should travel in groups, perhaps with a shore excursion 
organized by the cruise ship. Tourists shouldn't carry large amounts of cash, 
or wear flashy jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Navy's decision to cancel all port calls to St. Thomas came last 
October, following a 10-month string of 19 port calls to Charlotte Amalie, St. 
Thomas's capital, marred by 12 violent crimes against sailors: robbery, assault 
and one murder. Over the same period, records of Atlantic Fleet headquarters in 
Norfolk, Va., show that Navy personnel paid 40 port calls to Italy's 
long-notorious port of Naples, suffering just one violent crime. A Navy 
spokesman said St. Thomas is the only Caribbean port where the Navy has 
canceled calls. On March 27, a Virgin Islands police officer died in a hail of 
14 shots in an apparent ambush in front of his home. His death prompted the 
Virgin Islands' delegate to Congress, Ron de Lugo, to call for FBI aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later came Murray Callan's slaying . . . followed on April 13 by a 
letter from de Lugo to U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, asking Justice Department 
help in fighting an "escalation of violent crime." Noting that the islands have 
seen 11 homicides in the first four months of the year, de Lugo asserted that 
"the resources of our local law enforcement community cannot cope with this 
situation and the community is increasingly apprehensive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to cruise lines, however, travelers are unlikely to hear of these 
details. Cruise officials point out that their passengers have been unaffected 
by these crimes, that most cruise passengers are ashore only by day, and that, 
on the whole, the islands face less crime than is found in most big cities. 
(Local authorities have reported that fewer than 200 of the islands' 2 million 
tourists last year were victims of reported crimes.) Two cruise officials noted 
that their companies have recently abandoned plans for shore calls in the 
Middle East because of safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 At Carnival Cruise Lines, whose ships Celebration, Sensation and Festivale 
call weekly at St. Thomas year-round, spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said ship 
representatives "occasionally advise the passengers to simply use common sense, 
just as they would in a major city, or vacationing at a major resort on land." 
She said she expected no policy changes, that Carnival is satisfied St. Thomas 
officials are responding to concerns about crime. 
</P>
<P>
 At Norwegian Cruise Line, whose ships Norway and Starward call weekly at St. 
Thomas in spring and summer, spokeswoman Fran Sevcik said ship personnel offer 
"a lot of (spoken) common sense tips -- for people not to go off the beaten 
path, and not to go off with people they don't know." Sevcik said she knew of 
no plans for changes and noted that "our security officers are in constant 
touch with authorities down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, Tall Ship Adventures, Cunard Crown, 
Holland America and Crystal Cruises offered similar responses.

JUST THE FACTS; NINE DEFENSIVE MOVES TO PROTECT YOUR PACKAGE TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Booking a package tour can pose risks for travelers. Some tour operators are 
fly-by-night operations; others once ran fine operations but have lost ground 
in tough economic times.Here, from Travel Smart newsletter, are nine steps you 
can take to protect your travel investment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1) PAY BY CREDIT CARD. That way, if a problem arises, you may be able to 
cancel and/or you'll have documented proof of payment. And, very often, the 
credit card company will go to bat for you. Needless to say, keep all charge 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 2) CONFIRM NATIONAL ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIP. Make sure that the company is a 
member of the National Tour Assn. or the U.S. Tour Operators Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 3) CONFIRM ROOM RESERVATIONS. Before booking, call one of the hotels offered 
in the tour brochure and ask whether rooms for the group have, indeed, been 
reserved. 
</P>
<P>
 4) ASK FOR REFERENCES. Get names of people who have taken one of a tour 
operator's trips and then call and get other travelers' opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 5) CHECK OUT THE TOUR COMPANY's REPUTATION. Ask your travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
 6) STEER CLEAR OF ONE-TIME-ONLY TOURS. Those offering a series of trips, or 
several during the year, are likely to be better financed. 
</P>
<P>
 7) INSIST ON A BROCHURE. Does the company appear to be substantial? 
</P>
<P>
 8) NEVER BUY BY PHONE. Don't sign up with someone who has called you and has 
not followed up in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 9) CHECK THE AIRLINE FOR THE ACTUAL FARE. If the fare alone is more than your 
entire package, you may have a good deal. But proceed with caution.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; A LITTLE LESS DRESSY AT AHWAHNEE MEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER M. WARREN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Folks who plan to have dinner in the dining room of the Ahwahnee Hotel while 
visiting Yosemite can pack a little lighter than they used to in years past -- 
the famed restaurant has relaxed its dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 For years the requirement was "coats and ties for gentlemen, and appropriate 
attire for women." Nowadays, however, when you phone the restaurant for a 
reservation the staff lets you know that gentlemen are also welcomed in a "nice 
sweater or collared shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 While attire is casual at breakfast and lunch, dinner guests are asked not to 
wear jeans, tennis shoes, athletic wear or hiking gear. The relaxed rule has 
been in effect for a little more than a year, but the hotel has not publicized 
it, said Jennifer Wagner, assistant manager at the Ahwahnee. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition-bound need not worry that the new code has hurt the atmosphere 
of the wood-paneled restaurant with its 34-foot-high ceiling and candle-lit 
ambience. A recent dinner visitor found almost everyone still dressed to the 
nines, except for those few men and boys who wore blue blazers and khaki 
slacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The chef, the food and the prices remain the same, with roast prime rib, roast 
rack of lamb and the nightly chef's selections the most popular items. PETER M.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: DESERT HOT SPRINGS; TWO BUNCH BALM; THE FAMOUS MOGUL HIDEAWAY 
LIVES UP TO ITS SCRIPT: PRICEY, PRIVATE AND PROFOUNDLY RELAXING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Hubler is a reporter for The Times' Metro 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We were exhausted. We were up to here with the deadlines, the obligations, the 
pressure. If we had to read one more sensitive-male-bonding script . . . no, 
wait, that was that whiny girlfriend on "The Player," the movie we were 
half-watching on our VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanna have a massage," she was moaning into a movie exec's ear. "I wanna 
have a long soak in a hot mineral tub. And I wanna have margaritas administered 
intravenously." 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I exchanged meaningful glances. Our sentiments exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus did we find ourselves on the phone the following week to the folks at Two 
Bunch Palms, the pricey desert spa that has made its name as the local hot 
springs to the stars. If it was good enough for the Hollywood barracudas we had 
seen in that movie, we figured, imagine what it could do for us. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we won't kid you. It was a fantastic experience, and profoundly 
rejuvenating. But we also dropped a bundle, in part because it was our first 
visit and we were hellbent on experiencing every stress-antidote the place had 
to offer. Now that we know what works -- and what's not worth the price -- we 
are already planning our return, which we believe will relax us just about as 
much for substantially less money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Located about two hours east of Los Angeles in the desert beyond Palm Springs, 
Two Bunch Palms has been a restorative oasis for more than a century. In the 
'20s, the gangster Al Capone reportedly drafted the place into service as his 
hide-out. But Capone, of course, went to prison and, as nearby Palm Springs 
became the desert's in-spot, Two Bunch Palms languished until a 
multimillion-dollar renovation in 1978 put it back on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, locals say, when Two Bunch Palms was almost a bargain, with 
its cozy, funky overstuffed rooms furnished in lurid period antiques and cooled 
with ceiling fans. But in recent years -- and especially since the release of 
Robert Altman's Hollywood satire, "The Player" -- the resort has been in record 
demand. Altman features Two Bunch Palms as a hide-out for studio execs and 
movie stars, and one of the movie's most memorable scenes features Tim Robbins, 
the movie-exec-run-amok, peering out of a mud bath as the authorities try in 
vain to keep him from getting away with murder. Articles about the resort 
report that Goldie Hawn, Mel Gibson, Meryl Streep, Bruce Springsteen and others 
are frequent visitors. It's not hard to see why Two Bunch Palms draws a 
celebrity crowd -- the place is so private that you can go for hours, even days 
at a time without crossing paths with another human being. But first, of 
course, you have to get in, which isn't easy. The resort has only 44 units, and 
-- except during the scorching summers -- they are booked weeks in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 We called on a weekday afternoon in late March, for instance, and were told we 
wouldn't be able to get a room until April 15. The cheapest units are tiny 
studios with queen-sized beds at $105 per night; the most expensive are a 
$412-a-night suite with a private Jacuzzi and patio and the $395-a-night Capone 
suite, which features an antique bar and a bullet hole in one mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 On our weekend, we had two options -- a $194-a-night poolside room in one of 
the older buildings, or a $298-a-night villa in the resort's new Casa Blanca 
building, a gated four-plex surrounding a shared hot tub. The reservations 
clerk diplomatically recommended the newer unit, which we opted for. The clerk 
also advised us to book massages at least two weeks in advance, noting that 
weekends tend to fill up quickly, especially for their more popular 
"treatments." Moreover, the clerk noted that "most visitors" book three 
treatments a day. We also had to reserve our table for dinner on Saturday night 
at the resort dining room, which, as it turned out, offered not only a very 
good spa cuisine, but also a broader selection of more fattening food, and a 
decent wine list. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We pulled in late on a Friday night, just in time to collect our keys from a 
guard at the stone security gate and stagger in to bed. Our room, which had 
Oriental carpets and a Spanish-tiled floor, had an airy sitting area with 
wicker furniture, a kitchenette, a modern four-poster bed, a TV and two private 
patios. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday morning dawned to a complimentary -- and excellent -- continental 
breakfast of fresh strawberries and cantaloupe, granola, muffins, coffee and 
juice served buffet-style in the gracious, Deco-style dining room. Our first 
spa appointment wasn't until 10 a.m., so we took a desert hike, but it soon 
became clear that this place was not really built for exploratory treks. 
Although the grounds of the resort are venerable and plush, the neighborhood 
that in recent years has grown up around it is of the pitbull-and-double-wide 
variety -- a community, we later learned, of young low-income families and 
fixed-income retirees who come to the area because its hot springs soothe 
arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 After a half-hour walk, we donned bathing suits and bathrobes and headed for 
the resort's centerpiece, a collection of private redwood decks equipped with 
outdoor showers and rectangular, blue-tiled mud baths. As we sunk into our 
secluded tubs of what appeared to be steaming, sulfurous potting soil, we could 
hear birds twittering in the palm fronds, and gaze at the sun as it streamed 
through pine boughs and bougainvillea. The mineral-rich warmth gently tugged 
all tension from our limbs; periodically, a pleasant attendant would press icy 
washcloths to our hot brows. Afterward, we showered in cold water with that 
peppermint soap hippies used to use. Then there was a steam bath and hour-long 
massages -- mine, a Shiatsu that focused on pressure points, my husband's a 
deep-tissue massage that is one of the hallmarks of the place. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole treatment lasted about two hours and cost $127 for me and $140 for 
my husband, plus tip. We didn't regret a penny; in a single morning, we were as 
relaxed as if we had been on vacation all week. We later decided that, were we 
to do it again, we would limit our spa time to one treatment a day. We also 
felt that one of the resort's most popular treatments -- a sort of glorified 
bath they call the "salt glo and herbal steam" -- was not as rewarding at $98 
as the price would imply, and the facials were pretty standard fare. The $42 
scalp massage, however, was a real bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 We also decided upon closer inspection that we had been too hasty in ruling 
out the less-expensive rooms. Even the smallest and funkiest of the older units 
seemed quiet and very comfortable. We also found that some of the best things 
about the place were free -- the gorgeous blue pools of steaming mineral water, 
for example, which are surrounded by a free-form stone patio, shaded with a 
jungle of palms and flowering vines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best potential bargain revealed itself at the end of our stay, when 
the clerk informed us that, if we returned within two years for a midweek stay, 
we would get a 30% discount on the price of our room and a 20% discount at the 
spa. Or, he said, we could wait a couple of months and pay half-price -- if we 
could stand to come to Desert Hot Springs in July. (The place shuts down 
altogether in August.)

TAKING THE KIDS: UNFAMILIAR FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget peanut butter. There wasn't even any pizza. For a week in China, 
seventh-grader Michael Sandner filled up on sauteed sea slugs, pig snout, 
jellyfish, chicken feet and web of Peking Duck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chinese food wasn't anything like at home," reported the 14-year-old, who was 
greatly relieved to see plenty of rice on every menu. "Sea slugs are kind of 
slimy, like cranberry sauce," he explained. The chicken foot "looked kind of 
gross. You could really tell it was a chicken foot. But it didn't really have 
any taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a kid who lives on bean burritos and oatmeal at home in suburban 
Chicago. "Of our seven kids, he's the pickiest eater," said his mother, Carole, 
who said she was astonished by her son's eating habits on a trip through Hong 
Kong, Beijing, Shanghai and other parts of China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty amazed myself," said Michael, who accompanied his father Jack, 
chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, on a business trip to Asia last 
fall. "But I got interested. The Chinese eat those things all of the time and I 
wanted to try them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's the idea, of course. Food is a natural way to help kids bridge the 
cultural gap wherever they're traveling. The dinner table can spark a child's 
interest in a new place and the people who live there with more immediacy than 
many dusty historical sites. So instead of always sticking to the familiar, 
head for a barbecue pit in Texas, a lobster shack in Maine, a Mexican cantina 
in Albuquerque or a tea house serving dim sum dumplings in San Francisco's 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Often such places are cheaper than fast food. They're also a lot more fun -- 
especially for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a foreign country, let the kids shop in local markets for picnic fixings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd pick things that looked interesting," said Susan Weintraub, a school 
librarian from Maryland who has spent time in England and France with her 
husband and three children. As much as the food, the Weintraub kids were 
intrigued by the way things were packaged and displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Food is really symbolic of how you encourage kids to take life in and open 
yourself to new experiences," said educator Lucinda Lee Katz, director of the 
University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, who has traveled widely with her two 
teen-agers. "It gives them the message that taking a risk isn't a bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say you can force kids to eat a particular dish, or should. 
"Just ask them to try it," said Katz, who has eaten plenty of meals with her 
teen-age son in which he filled up on rice. 
</P>
<P>
 'You'll stress yourself out if you're constantly trying to get them to eat new 
things," Weintraub said. "Everything is so different when you're traveling; the 
kids want familiar things to eat, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Sutherland, co-author or "Innocents Abroad: Traveling With Kids in 
Europe" (Penguin, $15.95) suggests ordering familiar fare that the kids are 
certain to eat, in addition to unusual dishes for everyone to try: french fries 
or an omelet in France, pasta in Italy, plain tortillas with cheese in a 
Mexican restaurant or fried rice in a Chinese meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Of utmost importance, never turn food into a battleground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember that kids don't think of food the same way adults do," said Chicago 
child psychologist Sharon Berry, who practices at Northwestern 
University-affiliated Children's Memorial Hospital. "Food isn't a focus on 
vacation the way it might be for parents. They're only interested when they're 
hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 "You might think a big plate of weird food is exciting but it might scare 
little kids," agreed Altadena mom Sally Geisse, who travels to Barcelona with 
her children every year to visit her husband's family. She recommends looking 
for foods that are similar to at-home favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially if a preschooler or picky eater is along, Berry advises making sure 
there's access to some "regular" food the child likes, even if it's necessary 
to bring it along from home. Then put forth the idea of trying some new dishes 
as an adventure. "The idea is that this is fun," said Berry. "Make it a game. 
Give points for whomever tries the most new foods." 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about the "food adventure" ahead of time helps, too. Get some books 
from the library about the places you'll be visiting. Try some of the dishes at 
home, if possible. Laura Sutherland said she knows families who stage special 
theme dinners at home as a way of introducing the kids to a new place. 
</P>
<P>
 A little preparation clearly pays off. San Francisco Chinatown guide Shirley 
Fong-Torres has shepherded many school groups and visiting families on her Wok 
Wiz tours, which end with a dim sum lunch. The kids who have the best time, 
she's convinced, are those who have been prepped for the new experience by 
their teachers or parents. "Make sure they're comfortable with what they're 
eating," Fong-Torres advised. "And make it exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the best efforts don't always work. There we were, seated around a 
big circular table in a bustling San Francisco Chinese restaurant. My children 
Matt and Reggie love Chinese food and couldn't wait for lunch to be served. 
Neither could the other two kids at the table. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the odd-shaped dim sum dumplings arrived, the four kids barely picked 
at them. They simply didn't like them -- the taste, the consistency or even the 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next time we come to Chinatown for lunch, bring some peanut butter 
sandwiches," 8-year-old Reggie suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears weekly.

SHOPPING: SAN FRANCISCO; BOOK SOUP; SAVORING THE INDIVIDUALISTIC FLAVORS AND 
STYLES OF BAY AREA BOOKSTORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE COLBY, Colby is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson declared, "I cannot live without books," and San Franciscans 
seem to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the cool, damp weather, which often keeps people indoors and 
prompted Mark Twain's famous quip that the coldest winter he ever spent was a 
summer in San Francisco. Or perhaps it's the Bay Area's emphasis on public 
transportation, which leaves commuters free to crack open a book while somebody 
else sits at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps it's the general culture of tolerance, which over the years has 
helped attract a large population of resident writers including Twain, Jack 
London, Dashiell Hammett, Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Irving Stone, Oscar 
Wilde, William Saroyan, Sam Shepard, Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, Ken Kesey, 
Wallace Stegner, Eugene O'Neill, Anne Rice, Alice Adams and Hunter S. Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, this is a region that reads. The San Francisco 
metropolitan area (what's broadly considered the Bay Area, including Oakland, 
Marin, San Francisco and several other counties) boasts more bookstores per 
household (one for every 4,115 homes) than any other metropolitan area in the 
United States, according to 1987 U.S. Census figures, the most recent 
available. (Los Angeles County has one bookstore for every 7,518 households.) 
The average Bay Area resident spends $132.09 on books each year, compared with 
$85.76 for residents of Los Angeles-Long Beach. Total book sales in 1987 for 
the Bay Area were $338.9 million; for Los Angeles-Long Beach, $265.6 million, 
according to the Census. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many parts of the country where the big chains have taken over, the San 
Francisco area is one place where independent, locally owned bookstores still 
thrive. Some of the stores are historical icons, others are community gathering 
places. All offer a selection of books you just won't find in a chain store. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no better way to get a feel for the true character of the Bay Area 
than by visiting its bookstores. The stores listed here include some of the 
most popular, the most renowned and most unusual, starting in San Francisco, 
heading south to Menlo Park, crossing over the bay to Berkeley and then west to 
Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
 And those visiting between May 7 and 14 can take part in more than 40 events 
that are part of the area's fifth annual Mystery Week, which this year 
commemorates the 100th birthday of Hammett, who lived and wrote here in the 
1920s and set about half of his books, including "The Maltese Falcon," here. 
Mystery Week events include an interactive murder mystery dinner, book signings 
by local mystery writers, a crime-fighters-and-writers forum and a panel in 
which mystery writers compose a modern-day "Maltese Falcon" on stage with help 
from an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
<P>
 A good place to start the tour is at A Clean, Well-Lighted Place for Books at 
Opera Plaza on busy Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 A Clean, Well-Lighted Place (two other branches are in Cupertino, in the 
Silicon Valley, and Larkspur Landing, in Marin County) has an interior as 
polished as that of the most upscale chain bookstore, with warm lighting, blond 
bookshelves, benches and forest-green carpet throughout. But the store's appeal 
is more than surface deep -- it's stocked with 70,000 titles on everything from 
parenting to politics to holistic health. Strengths are new fiction and 
nonfiction, travel and cooking, and an entire room devoted to mystery, suspense 
and sci-fi. 
</P>
<P>
 Local writers are displayed in several areas: One table offers works by Isabel 
Allende, Alice Walker, Nguyen Qui Duc, Anne Lamott, Theodore Roszak, Paul 
Theroux. Another highlights books by local mystery writers, including 
Jacqueline Girdner's novel "Adjusted to Death," which follows the story of 
Marin County's "only vegetarian divorcee detective" as she investigates a 
murder on a chiropractor's table. 
</P>
<P>
 As in a good wine shop, reviews are taped up next to books on shelves around 
the store, and staff picks are posted at the front door.  
</P>
<P>
 The store is known for its frequent author events; most recently for 
appearances by novelist Carlos Fuentes ("The Orange Tree"), performance artist 
Laurie Anderson ("Stories From the Nerve Bible"), British author Will Self ("My 
Idea of Fun"), thrill-meister James W. Hall ("Mean High Tide") and San 
Francisco poet Kim Addonizio ("The Philosopher's Club"). 
</P>
<P>
 If a Clean, Well-Lighted Place manages to gracefully combine good business 
with a love of books, City Lights Booksellers & Publishers in North Beach 
appears to shun commercialism entirely. The store is as much a cultural 
landmark as it is a place of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Ferlinghetti and a partner, Peter D. Martin, founded City Lights in 
1953 as the first bookstore in the nation to specialize in quality paperbacks. 
Pocket books, as they were then called, had previously been limited to pulp 
fiction. Now people were able to purchase a work of serious fiction, nonfiction 
or poetry for as little as 35 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Ferlinghetti used the bookstore to finance his publishing 
business, which featured his own poetry and work by writers such as Pauline 
Kael, Jack Spicer and Robert Duncan. Other Beat writers orbiting the 
establishment soon included Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, Michael McClure, Bob 
Kaufman and Philip Lamantia. In 1956, City Lights Books published Allen 
Ginsberg's "Howl and Other Poems," and gained worldwide attention when U.S. 
Customs seized the book, calling it obscene. 
</P>
<P>
 Although City Lights no longer vibrates with the same intensity as it did 
during the Beat era, the store remains both true to that time and a home for 
new authors and ideas. One window displays a memorial to late Los Angeles poet 
and novelist Charles Bukowski, who gave his first poetry reading for the City 
Lights Poets Theatre in 1973. Another highlights new works from City Lights 
Books: "Light From a Nearby Window: Contemporary Mexican Poetry," edited by 
Juvenol Acosta; "Critical Condition: Women on the Edge of Violence," an 
anthology of works; and "The Secret Meaning of Things," new poetry from 
Ferlinghetti. 
</P>
<P>
 The street-level floor is filled with fiction from authors along the lines of 
D. H. Lawrence, Anne Rice and Jean Genet. The Beat room upstairs pulls together 
all the important works that made history in the store's early days, along with 
general poetry. The musty basement holds nonfiction books, including music 
(especially blues, R&B and jazz), religion, philosophy, politics and healing. 
Decor throughout the store is minimal (eight-foot-high paintings of the Statue 
of Liberty and a James Joyce "Ulysses" quote are the exceptions). A lone 
saxophone blows over the sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 Open until midnight, City Lights is a neighborhood haunt where people don't 
just buy books, they attend readings, meet friends before dinner in North Beach 
and hang out in the stacks on sleepless nights or windy Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Mystery Books -- a shoe box of a store at 24th Street and 
Diamond -- fits well in a neighborhood where mom-and-pop stores still thrive 
and errands can be done on foot. Owner Bruce Taylor offers collections of 
vintage mysteries, new releases ("Torch" by John Lutz), travel books ("Mystery 
Reader's Walking Guide to London"), magazines ("Murder & Mayhem," "The Gay & 
Lesbian Detective") as well as first editions and special printings. Upstairs, 
book serials are organized by category (anthropologist detective, female 
sleuth, Bay Area setting) and author (Sara Paretsky, Marcia Muller, James Lee 
Burke, Raymond Chandler). 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away at Small Press Traffic on Guerrero Street, manager John 
McNally describes the nonprofit store's offerings as "things McWalden's 
wouldn't touch" -- books from small presses and self-published works, 
particularly poetry, journals and literary anthologies. Founded in 1974, the 
store has survived for two decades with foundation grants and fund-raisers. 
Writing classes and readings are numerous and sometimes offbeat: Dodie 
Bellamy's prose workshop is advertised as being "for writers whose work is 
weird/fringy in form or content and who want to make it more so." 
</P>
<P>
 Old Wives' Tales is situated amid a cluster of women's businesses and social 
services in the heavily Latino Mission District. The bookstore focuses on 
women's literature and feminist texts, but there's enough room in the 
definition to allow Roseanne Arnold's "My Lives" (Ballantine Books) to sit on a 
table of new releases with "Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch 
Hunts" by Anne Llewellyn Barstow (Pandora) and "The Sweeter the Juice: A Family 
Memoir in Black and White" by Shirlee Taylor Haizlip (Simon & Schuster).  
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing glamorous about Green Apple Books on Clement Street in the 
Richmond District, but the store is a favorite among browsers looking for a 
large selection of inexpensive used books and new books at used prices. (At 
press time, Green Apple employees were passing out leaflets asking customers to 
boycott the store in support of contract negotiations, but they were still 
reporting to work.) 
</P>
<P>
 MENLO PARK 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty miles south of San Francisco in suburban Menlo Park is Kepler's Books & 
Magazines. Roy and Patricia Kepler founded the store in 1955, and like 
Ferlinghetti at City Lights, specialized in quality paperbacks. The store 
reflected Roy Kepler's political views; he was a pacifist and social activist 
who paid a price for his activism in the 1960s when his store became the target 
of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Today son Clark Kepler operates an expanded version of the store, which stocks 
more than 100,000 titles in an airy concrete-and-glass building on El Camino 
Real, just a stone's throw from the Stanford University campus. The 1990s store 
has less of a political agenda than the original store, but politics and 
culture, nonetheless, are still represented. 
</P>
<P>
 Works of new fiction and nonfiction include all the best-sellers, but also 
esoteric and small press offerings, such as Ian Hamilton's "International 
Oxford Companion to Thirteenth Century Poetry," and "Cigarettes Are Sublime: A 
Literary, Philosophical, Cultural History of Smoking" by Richard Klein (Duke 
University Press). Befitting its location near Silicon Valley, there are ample 
displays of books on computers, electronics and science.  
</P>
<P>
 Aside from all the serious reading, Kepler's is also just a pleasant place in 
which to spend time. The store is spacious and filled with light. A large 
children's section is colorfully decorated. Jazz (Billie Holiday on the morning 
last month when I was there) plays softly in the background. Cafe Borone next 
door serves good coffee and cafe fare, and customers can comfortably sit and 
browse through their new purchases without being rushed along. 
</P>
<P>
 EAST BAY 
</P>
<P>
 Those tempted to romanticize 1960s Berkeley should pick up a copy of "Cody's 
Books: The Life and Times of a Berkeley Bookstore, 1956-1977" by Pat and Fred 
Cody (Chronicle Books). Cody's was in the middle of it all -- the Free Speech 
Movement, civil rights protests, anti-war demonstrations, People's Park. 
Although the Codys were liberals and active supporters of the young, they 
nevertheless describe those years as tremendously burdensome, and they have 
observed that it is hard to keep a business afloat when riots and tear-gassing 
are common occurrences on the street in front of your store. 
</P>
<P>
 The Codys sold the store in 1977, but the intellectual spirit of their 
establishment remains. Crown Books it ain't: A table near the front door 
displays "Scattered Hegemonies," edited by Indertal Grewal (University of 
Minnesota Press) and "Up Against Foucault" by Caroline Ramazanoglu (Routledge). 
</P>
<P>
 The store has more than 100,000 titles in both popular and academic areas, and 
most people will be able to find what they're looking for here or can order 
what they don't. The store also carries about 700 periodicals -- everything 
from the Yale Review to Unsolved UFO Sightings. 
</P>
<P>
 A few doors down from Cody's is Moe's, which stocks primarily used books -- 
four floors of them -- as well as rare books and signed first editions of such 
volumes as Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell Tolls" ($125) and "The Collected 
Plays of Eugene O'Neill" from 1924 ($350). The store seems very tuned into its 
Generation X student clientele with its suggestion that customers send in their 
wish lists or pick up book catalogues by electronic mail through the store's 
Internet computer address.  
</P>
<P>
 Gaia, which opened in 1987 to offer "spiritual, feminist, ecological and 
cross-cultural religious perspectives," reflects a different face of Berkeley 
culture. It has a New Age feel -- self-help books, drums, fetishes, Tarot cards 
and music -- and skeptics might be tempted to dismiss the enterprise as just so 
much pseudo-spiritual nonsense. But that would be missing what the store has to 
offer. After all, what chain bookstore would showcase a large display of books 
on menopause, midlife and aging near its front door? Though the store has a 
strong feminist orientation, men and women seem to frequent it in nearly equal 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner on Shattuck is a neighborhood bookstore whose sophisticated 
contents appeal to its clientele of university professors and intellectuals. 
Writers visiting Black Oak Books in April included University of Pennsylvania 
professor and former Justice Department nominee C. Lani Guinier, discussing her 
book, "The Tyranny of the Majority: Fundamental Fairness and Representative 
Democracy," and novelist Whitney Otto ("How to Make an American Quilt," "Now 
You See Her"). With its hearty assortment of regional cuisine cookbooks, the 
otherwise general-interest bookstore also reflects its location just one block 
from the restaurant Chez Panisse in the heart of Berkeley's so-called "gourmet 
ghetto." 
</P>
<P>
 MARIN COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
 Travel enthusiasts make the trip across the bay to Marin County to visit Book 
Passage in Corte Madera. Although strong in general-interest books and 
mysteries, the Marin County store also claims to have the largest selection of 
travel books on the West Coast. (There are 18 shelves devoted to Great Britain 
alone.) Staff members are trained to help shoppers find just the travel books 
they need. The store offers a relaxed setting, with a coffee bar and sitting 
areas throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 The store sponsors a number of workshops for aspiring travel writers, as well 
as an annual weekend conference scheduled this year in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Chain stores may be able to recreate the ambience of an independent bookstore, 
but not the passion and personality behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a bookseller -- the owner and operator of a personal bookstore," wrote 
Fred Cody before his death in 1983. "We are, I'm afraid, members of a 
fast-vanishing tribe. I agree with those who say that the small personal 
bookstore is a somewhat picturesque carry-over from the beginning of the 19th 
Century. Yet there are still people who are so badly adjusted to reality that 
they insist on either writing books or selling them." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us are glad they do. GUIDEBOOK

SAILING THE SAN JUANS; HAUL AWAY!; FOR $500 APIECE, 20 NOVICES CHARTERED A

<P>
 Before daybreak the last damp hawser is heaved aboard and coiled on deck. The 
sailing schooner Zodiac eases out of the sleeping harbor and ghosts through a 
chilly drizzle toward the Strait of Juan de Fuca where the wind blows. 
</P>
<P>
 We crinkle in stiff nylon foul-weather gear as we move across plank and tar 
deck. Zodiac is the largest sailing vessel of its kind on the West Coast, 127 
feet long. It is celebrating its 70th birthday afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 And for this blustery spring week the Zodiac is ours as we roam the blue-black 
waters, the narrow channels, the open straits, rain-forested shores and 
sheltered harbors of Washington's San Juan Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Here with bald eagles, dolphins, harlequin ducks, seals, sculpted cliffs, tide 
pools, spicy fresh air and towering cedars, 20 friends, acquaintances and 
distant friends-of-friends have taken a flyer on each other and a small-time, 
big-boat operation. 
</P>
<P>
 We took a chance with the weather too. Springtime in these waters between 
Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and the Washington mainland is windy. But 
wind hereabouts spells weather -- so we're swaddled in gloves and long johns. 
Those who follow us on Zodiac later in summer will lounge along in their shorts 
and tank tops. But they are unlikely to receive our reward: flying on the wing 
of a gale in a tall ship sailed well. 
</P>
<P>
 How well? 
</P>
<P>
 Doggone well, if you please. And to our astonishment, we're doing it pretty 
much on our own. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us are small boat sailors; many had never hoisted a line until four 
days ago when we gathered aboard at Bellingham, two hours north of Seattle. 
Never mind. A 200-ton schooner is a life apart from a small boat. We're all 
novices at this. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spirit has seized us. In the name of hard play, we practice and learn. 
And nature favors us, delivering light winds for the first days. So while we 
work, we can absorb the scenery of this lovely nest of islands, venturing as 
the wind blows us from secluded anchorages to busy port towns. 
</P>
<P>
 In ages ranging from our mid-30s to early-60s, we stand daylight watches by 
the bells, set the sails and work the tacks -- and whoop it up like college 
kids at the end of the day. Zodiac's crew of nine, including three men with 
captain's licenses, supervises us with self-assurance. But sometimes with 
urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 Using our backs and tired hands and newly sharpened eyes, we now fathom the 
ancient working and lilt of schooner sailing -- turning the huge spindled helm 
and hauling, coiling, flaking, adjusting and making fast the ship's 
quarter-mile spider web of heavy lines, matching Zodiac's cloud of canvas to 
the twisting channels and shifting winds of island navigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of us now feels a swell of confidence, a hardness in our muscles, an 
uplift of exuberance as we slip away on this work-a-day Wednesday morning into 
exposed waters south of the islands where the north Pacific reaches its finger 
into the American continent. 
</P>
<P>
 A diesel engine has taken us clear of the picturesque harbor at nearby 
Victoria, British Columbia, where we made an overnight side trip. Usually, 
we're not underway until mid-morning. But today, as we gulp steaming mugs of 
coffee, and, I confess, wrestle here and there with a touch of that old 
sailor's curse, the hangover, we are happy to rise before the sun. Today, we 
are hunting for wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailing stations! . . . On the peak halyard, haul away! . . . Avast! . . . 
That is well, make it fast . . . Come up from behind . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The patois of the ancient mariner is no longer so strange. 
</P>
<P>
 First we hoist the 4,000-square-foot mainsail, almost the size of a basketball 
court. Everyone lines up tug-of-war style and pulls on twin, two-inch-thick 
rope halyards to the old sailing chantey, "Two-Six Ho." The sail creeps up the 
towering fir mast with unbearable slowness, and sweaty wisps of steam rise from 
inside our waterproof pants and jackets. There are no winches on Zodiac. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the smaller foresail is raised on the shorter mast forward, not an easy 
task either. By now, our wind off the southern tip of Vancouver Island is brisk 
and the dawn sky breaks wet and lumpy gray. One of us is stationed on the 
five-foot spoked helm to hold Zodiac pointed into the breeze and keep pressure 
off the huge spread of canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the staysail, and finally, the jib are set. Arms ache. Hearts pound. 
There is now 7,000 square feet of sail aloft, loose and cracking nervously in 
the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Tim Mehrer, a sanguine native of these waters who has commanded Zodiac 
for 20 years, orders the helm spun over. The ship bears off, her sails filling 
with a deep whuh-thunk . Sheet lines squeak taut. Wooden pulley blocks rattle 
and tense. The 13-inch-thick, wood-plank hull heaves into five-foot chop with a 
melodic groaning and creaking. This is the song known to seafarers as the 
working of a wooden ship. The disappearing music of our heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no real ocean swells reaching this far into the Strait of Juan de 
Fuca, and Zodiac does not bob or roll in the chop like a smaller sailboat -- 
the sensation that induces seasickness. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she powers through the open water at 13 knots, her massive deck 
lifting and falling dramatically, or so it seems to us, but so slowly, so 
heavily that only one or two aboard feel any queasiness. At first I can see a 
couple of faces fixed with that pale, uncomfortable, oh-ho look. But this 
passes quickly with the immense excitement and laborious maneuvers necessary to 
execute long, rounding tacks from one broad reach to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Kerns, the 290-pound, pigtailed itinerant tall-ship sailor who is our 
bosun and mate, covers the deck in big strides, his wet, bristly face aglow 
with a fierce smile. In a hoarse growl, he offers us praise and encouragement. 
"That was a tack! Well done. That was how it's done!" 
</P>
<P>
 It is warm and dry below, but no one leaves the deck. There will be time for 
that later. Good wind over a good ship is rhapsody. Except for a single passing 
freighter, we are alone at sea in what mariners call a fresh gale. To the 
starboard, the snowy Olympic mountains peek through steely layers of clouds. 
Off the port, the silhouette of the San Juans fills the horizon and dead ahead 
a black squall line of a storm gathers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are many reasons to come to this popular vacation region. Sailing is one 
of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 We find ourselves making a circle through the San Juans, counterclockwise, 
starting in the remote north. Up here, the San Juans are a necklace of small, 
unoccupied islands -- Patos, Sucia, Matia, Clark -- designated as state marine 
parks, reachable only by watercraft.  
</P>
<P>
 A day's sail away is lovely, finger-narrow Reid Harbor at Stuart Island, part 
state park and part sleepy rural homestead. Not far away is the resort village 
and marina of Roche Harbor on heavily developed San Juan Island. Here is a 
150-year-old inn with nostalgic hospitality and the kind of guests who can 
appreciate the silhouette of a big schooner looming through the front window of 
the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The port of Victoria has every bit the feel of the islands, although it is not 
part of them. There are few feelings to match arriving here in a sailing ship. 
</P>
<P>
 But today we traverse the southern reach of the islands, ducking out of the 
winds to clear U.S. Customs at Friday Harbor, the largest community and chief 
tourist destination in the San Juans. Even in the off-season, the port is a 
bustle of fishermen and yachts and seaplanes and day visitors who have come by 
ferry. By acclamation, we on the Zodiac decide to limit our shore leave to only 
one hour, preserving the afternoon for more sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Our departure proves to be a false start. A late head-count shows us one 
person short. Dave Early, a Zodiac crewman, has slipped ashore to make a phone 
call. We double back through the crowded harbor. And as he races down the long 
dock to meet us, a crowd gathers. We break out kazoos and pipe him aboard, 
red-faced, to the tune of "Anchor's Away." The crowd cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the harbor, our gale has diminished to a gentle breeze, which we 
leisurely ride toward the very southernmost tip of the San Juans to a bay on 
Lopez Island where British Capt. George Vancouver anchored 202 years ago during 
his exploration of these islands. Off in the distance, the lights of Seattle 
glow orange against the clouds. A gentle rain begins, and we scamper to the 
warmth below. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I feel particular satisfaction. Five months ago, I was stirred by the sight of 
a big schooner as it pulled away from the dock at Bellingham, Wash. On its 
stern was the name Zodiac. Inquiring on the waterfront in Seattle, where I 
live, I learned it is the largest of fewer than a half-dozen charter schooners 
on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, I tracked down Mehrer and his father, Karl -- both schoonermen who make 
their living in the industrial boiler business and devote the rest of their 
time to preserving historic sailing ships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zodiac, they explained over lunch, is maintained by 60 or so volunteers. 
Almost nobody could afford to pay workers to keep up such a ship. The 
volunteers take their turns as crew during the spring-to-fall sailing season, 
then help with refurbishment during winter. When at sea, only the cook is paid. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that for all their seafaring skills, the Mehrers were not much 
in the way of high-powered marketers, and happily so. Their clientele came from 
people like me who happen along, the curious, and then by word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a catch to the charter. Since they were a small operation, they 
accepted only groups, no singles or couples. For a six-night, five-day, cruise, 
I would have to assemble a full compliment of 20 guests -- we would need that 
many to lift the sails and handle the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Impossible, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 But I scratched down the costs on a cocktail napkin: 20 people at $500 apiece, 
plus tax, would cover the charter, including all food. Hmm. Maybe not so 
impossible after all -- a hotel room and food for six days could easily run 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 I set myself a deadline of 30 days. I called and wrote about 30 friends and 
acquaintances, some of whom I'd known a lifetime and others who I just met. I 
told them to pass the word to their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 If I had 20 checks within a month, I'd confirm the charter. Otherwise, I would 
drop the idea. Two weeks later, I was turning people away. From New York, Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Canada and Seattle, my friends and their friends took 
the dare. Our group was born. And we spent the next months in exquisite 
anticipation, sharing books and seafaring movies, planning and daydreaming. We 
wrote and called and talked ourselves into a froth. 
</P>
<P>
 But I worried: Had I oversold the venture? How would 10 men and 10 women, some 
married and some single but all set in their ways, adapt to the loss of privacy 
of dormitory sleeping? Or to sharing three heads and two showers? What if the 
wind failed us? What if it rained every day? What if the food was lousy? 
</P>
<P>
 I send a warning letter: Prepare for everything. This is the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 With bulging sea bags, we boarded on Friday afternoon at Bellingham's ferry 
terminal and motored to a nearby cove. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Clark of Manhattan Beach, Calif., brought his songbook and lyric voice. 
Ross Anderson of Seattle brought a guitar. We sang. Chef JoAnn Perna of 
Creswell, Ore., produced the first of a steady offering of galley feasts -- 
dinners that included salmon, pasta primavera with calamari, Mexican fajitas 
and breakfasts such as blueberry beer pancakes. We gorged ourselves. Up from 
the stowage locker came fresh-from-the-keg bitter ale from Seattle's Red Hook 
brewery and cases of assorted Washington wine. We drank. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, we sailed off the anchor without starting the engine -- a 
showy accomplishment for us novices. Likewise, we sailed the next afternoon 
into the San Juans to Sucia Island Marine State Park and anchored without need 
of engine power, a feat that even small-boat sailors rarely attempt in these 
tight, shoal waters. We launched one of our two tenders to take a dozen hikers 
ashore to explore the island park. Others of us traded turns exploring coves 
with the two kayaks we brought aboard. Who could count all the eagles and seals 
and sea birds and dolphins? 
</P>
<P>
 We gathered in the soft light of the great wood salon below deck and staffers 
Tim and Karl told us about this ship, registered as a national historic vessel 
-- built as a trans-oceanic pleasure yacht for the founders of the Johnson & 
Johnson Co. and later turned into a bar pilot schooner off of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 And every night, again and again, I'm pleased to report, I listened to the 
same thundering toast: to my own dumb luck or gifted foresight, whichever, for 
taking a chance on a schooner and a gang of disparate pals. Here, here. We had 
sailed in glorious waters, unhurried and with friendship snugged down by a new 
dependence on one another and by unexpected sentimentalism for an old wooden 
ship. And we vowed, we would sail the Zodiac again. GUIDEBOOK

 A Schooner in the San Juans 
</P>
<P>
 Schooner Zodiac: Tim, Karl and June Mehrer, P.O. Box 322, Snohomish, Wash. 
98291-0322; telephone (206) 483-4088 or (206) 325-6122. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Standard cruises are five days, six nights. Special scuba diving or 
kayaking trips can be arranged; the company is flexible.  
</P>
<P>
 Where: Zodiac sails from the Alaska State Ferry dock in Bellingham, 90 miles 
north of Seattle. Shuttle bus service is available from Sea-Tac airport in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Zodiac ranges the San Juan Islands, north of Puget Sound. Port 
calls are possible at Friday Harbor and Roche Harbor on San Juan Island. 
Depending on weather, voyages to Victoria, British Columbia, can be arranged, 
but this requires a half-day to clear Canadian and U.S. customs. 
</P>
<P>
 How much: Overnight charter cruises are $2,000 a day for 20 people, or $500 
per person for a five-day cruise. Add to that Washington's 7.8% sales tax. 
There is no seasonal adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Sailing experience is not necessary, and many cruises are chartered by 
active retirees. Helpful are an interest in boating, wooden vessels, the San 
Juan Islands and teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Food: Standard fare is old-fashioned American. More contemporary cuisine is 
available on request. Dining is in the galley and aft salon. 
</P>
<P>
 Accommodations: Pullman-style berths, 42 inches wide, with privacy curtains. 
Berths are situated in salons forward and aft. No private cabins. 
</P>
<P>
 Gear: Sleeping bag, layered clothing, rain jacket and pants, sun protection 
and (depending on season) rubber boots. Work gloves strongly advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather: At this latitude, there are no sure bets. Generally, summer in the 
San Juans is sunny and mild, but winds are light to dead calm. This is the 
season for sightseeing and relaxing. Spring and late fall bring more weather 
and wind for sailing. The best winds can be wet and cold. Zodiac normally sails 
from March through October.

A SAN JUAN ISLANDS PRIMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So you don't want to charter a schooner? An even larger and more imposing 
vessel awaits to take you to the popular San Juan Islands of Washington: The 
ferry, the state's No. 1 tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The easy way, yes. But these days, when getting places is not always part of 
the fun, the comfortable, scenic ferry ride is reason enough to journey through 
these green, sheltered islands. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, for some first-time visitors, the ferry is the very best part of a 
trip to the islands, whose huge tourist appeal has in some cases outstripped 
local visitor facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 In the four years I've lived in Seattle and the 20 years I've been coming to 
the San Juans, I've learned that a simple way to make a lasting impression on 
visitors is with nothing more complex or expensive than the one- to two-hour 
ferry from Anacortes, Wash., to Friday Harbor on San Juan Island, and a lively 
jaunt ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 In summer, that can mean anything from renting a kayak and paddling out with 
the seals, or taking a drive to the site of one of the strangest military 
battles in U.S. history -- the little-known "Pig War" with Britain. Easy park 
and shoreline hikes in ocean-scrubbed fresh air, whale-watching cruises and 
family bicycling on two-lane roads also draw enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Juans are composed of more than 400 islands lying in sheltered ocean 
waters north of Seattle, between Washington state and Vancouver Island, British 
Columbia. About 60 islands are inhabited and four primary islands are served by 
state ferries. Three of them -- San Juan, Orcas and Lopez -- have visitor 
services and accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 The busiest island is San Juan, with its village of Friday Harbor. Shaw has 
very limited facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Locals will tell you the San Juans are the closest you can get to a banana 
belt in the high latitudes. In the rain shadow of Vancouver Island, the islands 
receive only half the rainfall of Seattle, and the high-season months of July, 
August and early September offer more sun than just about anywhere this far 
north near ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
 Locals also will tell you that peak-season tourism has ballooned to the point 
that unwary, happy-go-lucky travelers often go away feeling neither happy nor 
lucky. Parking, water shortages and crowded approaches to ferries and tourist 
attractions can be frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A day trip promises the fewest pitfalls for newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferries depart for the San Juans from Anacortes, about a 1 1/2- to two-hour 
drive north from Seattle. A pleasant stop en route is the community of La 
Conner, an old fishing village and trading post that has given itself over to 
waterfront tourism -- small shops and plenty of cafes and a good, old-fashioned 
ambience. And, of course, summer crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferry sailings from Anacortes begin before dawn and run until just past 
midnight in summers -- a total of 18 sailings per day. Food and beverages are 
available aboard, and sightseeing is splendid from either the open sun-deck or 
the enclosed passenger lounges. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes ferries leave just a few minutes apart and sometimes there is more 
than an hour between sailings. That's because some boats go directly to Friday 
Harbor, a one-hour sail, and others stop en route at the other islands, which 
can extend the one-way trip to two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The ferry approaches can be congested and intimidating at first. But press 
ahead, this is not like trying to ride the subway in a strange city -- the 
ticket sellers are accustomed to wide-eyed tourists and the staging process 
actually goes quite smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are sold only for westbound sailings; returns are free. The exceptions 
are two daily sailings that continue past Friday Harbor to Sidney, B.C., north 
of Victoria. On those trips, fares are collected in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone contemplating a summertime ferry trip faces a crucial choice before 
getting in line: take the car or walk on the ferry without it? 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Myhr of the San Juan Islands Visitors Information Service cautions you 
to consider carefully: "You have to ask yourself, how do you want to spend your 
time? In the car ferry line? Or worrying how you are going to get around once 
you're there?" According to Myhr, for a day trip in the middle of the season, 
it makes little sense to drive your car. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal islands are big enough, and the parks and sights spread out for 
miles, that many sightseers choose to drive anyway, at least for their first 
visit. But they must pay the price: Weekend ferry lines for motorists can 
stretch for three hours, or sometimes more. 
</P>
<P>
 (Ferry toll for car and driver from Anacortes to Friday Harbor, $20.30. No 
reservations. Schedule information: (206) 464-6400. Tip: If you want to see 
more than one island, start on San Juan, at the far west, and work your way 
back free of charge.) 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly crowded are holiday weekends and July 29-31, the dates of the 
Dixieland Jazz Festival in Friday Harbor (three-day pass, $40; daily, $10 to 
$25; tel. 206- 378-5509). During the festival, even parking can be a chore. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk-on ferry passengers, by contrast, never wait for the next boat. But 
parking at the Anacortes terminal is limited. (The toll from Anacortes to 
Friday Harbor is $4.95.) And upon your arrival in Friday Harbor, public 
transportation is limited to a half-dozen cabs island-wide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of things to occupy active walk-ons, however. Friday Harbor 
in summer is alive with bicycle and scooter rentals. (Island Bicycles has been 
established for some time. Rates $25 per day for a mountain bike, with weekly 
prices available; tel. 206-378-4941.) Bicycles also are available for rental at 
the Orcas Island ferry landing. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the tempo of the islands is easygoing. Bicyclists enjoy 
respect on the two-lane roads, if for no other reason than there are so many of 
them. There are no bike paths or shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical cycling itinerary for vacationers would begin in Friday Harbor, with 
two days spent on San Juan Island, traversing mixed landscapes of rolling 
pastures, moist forests, wind-blown prairie and driftwood beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The town of Friday Harbor is a mix of come-on tourism and rural seashore 
trading post, pleasant enough for meals and quick browsing but light on night 
life. For some visitors, the community is too "touristy," while others, perhaps 
remembering East Coast island resorts, find themselves wishing for more and 
better shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The small downtown Whale Museum, which provides public access to long-standing 
research efforts in the region, offers static displays and explanations of 
whale lore. (Admission $3; tel. 206-378-4710.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The harbor is colorful and active; a bustle of boats, big and small, as well 
as seaplanes and, of course, the ferry. Dock-walking can be pleasant. At least 
three local companies in Friday Harbor and two on Orcas Island offer whale 
watching cruises (Western Prince Cruises, Friday Harbor, has been in business 
nine years. A four-hour afternoon trip in search of orca or Minke whales, $43, 
or $31 for children; tel. 800-757-6722.) Cyclists can walk their bikes onto the 
ferry from one island and visit the other islands -- Lopez being the flattest 
and Orcas the hilliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle camping is particularly inviting on Lopez after a 30-mile loop ride 
around this drowsy, friendly island. On Orcas, it is a steep climb but worth it 
to reach the top of 2,400-foot Mt. Constitution, where on a clear day one can 
see from British Columbia to the volcanoes of the Cascades. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle outfitters can direct you to private campgrounds on the islands, which 
usually have room. State campgrounds, on the other hand, fill up faster. Shaw 
Island is the smallest, most private of those served by the ferries -- and has 
only a few camping spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnighters who come to Lopez, Orcas and San Juan islands by car or foot will 
find 50 different resorts, inns, motels and B & B's, some of them secluded and 
worth the hunt. But together, they offer only about 800 rooms. On busy 
weekends, thousands of tourists flock to the islands, making advance 
reservations mandatory. (Recommended guidebook: Northwest Best Places, $18.95, 
Sasquatch Books, which also covers Portland to British Columbia. A list of 
island accommodations and a trip planning guide is available from the county 
Visitor Information Service, P.O. Box 65, Lopez Island, Wash. 98261; tel. 
206-468-3663. But the two-person staff is sometimes overwhelmed.) 
</P>
<P>
 A timely note on accommodations: A Hollywood production company has now taken 
most of the rooms on Lopez Island and some on San Juan, and is expected to be 
in the islands well into June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Venturing from Friday Harbor on San Juan Island, cyclists and motorists both 
are attracted to Lime Kiln Point State Park, which overlooks Haro Strait on the 
far western shore of the island and offers your best chance of seeing a passing 
pod of orca, or killer whales. Roche Harbor, a favorite with yachters, is a 
pleasant way-stop resort at the northern end. 
</P>
<P>
 National historic parks are maintained at the separate American and British 
camps, remnants of the disputed 19th-Century occupation of the island. Tension 
between the two sides led to the "Pig War" of 1860, so-named because its single 
casualty was a pig. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the islands, bald eagles, seals, ducks and sea birds are abundant. 
Tide pools are plentiful, and there are cliffs and hilltops with smashing views 
into the ink-blue waters below and to the neighboring islands in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to get closer to the water, here is your chance to find out why 
everyone is so crazy about ocean kayaking. In these lightweight boats, even an 
easy pull of the paddle sends you shooting across the water. 
</P>
<P>
 (Kayak rentals at Emerald Seas International, Friday Harbor; tel. 
206-378-2772. Rates $15 per person for two hours, $25 for four hours. 
Proprietor Tom Hemphill drives you to Griffin Bay, where you launch in 
ultra-calm water. The shop also offers twice-a-day dive charters for $55 and 
diving instruction. Other island outfitters lead longer, guided kayak trips for 
the more adventuresome.) 
</P>
<P>
 Boaters know the San Juans as a cruisers paradise, and there is little doubt 
that the most pleasant way to experience the San Juans is afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Bareboat charters are abundant. (In Anacortes, Anacortes Yacht Charters has 
long boasted the biggest fleet of charter yachts in the United States -- more 
than 100 sail and power boats; tel. 800-233-3004. Penmar Marine Co. in 
Anacortes has a fleet of 60 craft; tel. 800-828-7337. Both companies can 
arrange skippers for your cruise.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tidal currents require boaters, particularly sailers, to plan their itinerary 
carefully. Summer winds are fickle, and the usual rule in the area is that the 
better the weather, the lighter the wind. Also, popular anchorages can be very 
crowded and will test your skill. 
</P>
<P>
 On the upside, there is no bothersome ocean swell, so seasickness is uncommon. 
And navigation by line-of-sight is quite easy, except in fog, when it's foolish 
to venture forth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Season by season, week by week, local sail and powerboat owners on San Juan 
and Lopez islands offer skippered day cruises. Tourist officials say you can 
inquire at the bulletin boards at the docks. During fishing season, some boat 
owners also offer charters. 
</P>
<P>
 Boaters have much broader choices for island hopping than visitors who rely on 
ferries. Reid Harbor on Stuart Island is a picture-perfect anchorage, usually 
filled and some times overfilled with boaters. This is "social" boating, not 
meant for those who want to get away from it all. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the islands are designated as state parks for boaters only, including 
a cluster of islands at the far north of the chain -- Sucia, Matia, Clark and 
Patos islands. These offer pleasant day hiking through forest and around 
sculpted sea cliffs. Anchorages are scattered through several bays.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: DON'T FORGET THE GRANDCHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HANK KOVELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two tour programs for grandparents and grandchildren lead off an assorted 
collection of travel opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandtravel, whose generational programs have been developed with advice from 
teachers, psychologists and leisure counselors, is offering an activity-filled 
14-day motor-coach package called "A New England Sampler." The tour includes 
horseback riding, dune buggies, Go-Karts, steam trains and kite-flying. 
Participants will cruise the harbors of Boston and Hyannis, Mass.; ride a 
carriage in Acadia National Park, Me., and visit a wide variety of historical, 
cultural, and just-plain-fun attractions -- from Plymouth Rock and Salem's 
Witch Museum to the Christa McAuliffe Planetarium in Concord, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 The price for the complete package includes hotels with private bath, all 
entry fees and service charges, breakfast, dinner and snacks each day, plus 12 
lunches. The tour departs Boston on July 6. Air fare between the West Coast and 
Boston is not included in the prices. Per-person cost is $3,910, double 
occupancy; $3,750 for three, or $3,625 for four. For an itinerary, brochures 
and other information, call Grandtravel at (800) 247-7651. * 
</P>
<P>
 Another grandparent program closer to home is Boomtown, a mountain resort 
about 100 miles north of Los Angeles near Tehachapi. Boomtown resembles a 
small, rustic Western town but has a sports complex with tennis, volleyball and 
basketball courts, a swimming pool, miniature golf course, baseball diamond and 
bowling alley. Nearby is an equestrian center, a fishing lake and an 18-hole 
championship golf course. Shared educational experiences include arts and 
crafts, nature studies, music and science. Field trips include a visit to the 
NASA installation at Edwards Air Force Base, Willow Springs Racetrack, 
Tehachapi's Gliderport, ostrich and wind farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Two intergenerational camps of one week each are offered June 26-July 1 and 
July 31-Aug. 5 for children ages 6-12. Grandkids and grandparents share 
comfortable two-bedroom, two-bath condominiums. The cost for each is $455 for 
adults and $355 for children. Prices include all meals and transportation for 
field trips. For information and reservations, call weekdays (805) 823-8115 or 
write to College of the Tehachapis, P.O. Box 1911-61, Tehachapi, Calif. 93581. 
</P>

BACKPACK & BUDGET; RUSSIAN HOSTELS AT FRIENDLY PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that Russia has opened its doors more widely to the West, tourists can 
find a variety of ways to explore this vast country. And although the economic 
situation changes day by day and prices are rising, the price for a 
"backpacker's bed" in St. Petersburg this summer has actually dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Petersburg's Western-style "Russian Youth Hostel" was opened in 1992 by 
Steven Caron, an American who, while studying at Oxford, England, traveled to 
Moscow and developed the idea with some Russian friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a suitable building was a challenge. The group eventually obtained a 
five-story 18th-Century building that had been used by a trade school as a 
dormitory for visiting professors. After completely renovating it, they could 
accommodate up to 60 travelers in rooms with three, four or five beds. 
</P>
<P>
 This year they have opened up a fourth floor with dormitory beds; now 80 
travelers can be housed. Because a second independent hostel has opened and 
created a little competition, the nightly rate has been dropped from $16 to $15 
(breakfast included.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Youth Hostel (RYH) is centrally located at 3rd Sovetskaya Ulitsa, 
28 (also known as 3rd Rozhedstvenskaya Ulitsa, 28); from the U.S., telephone 
011- 7-812-277-0569. It's wise to make reservations several weeks before you go 
by contacting Russian Youth Hostels & Tourism, 409 N. Pacific Coast Highway, 
Building 106, Suite 390, Redondo Beach 90277; tel. (310) 379-4316, and fax 
(310) 379-8420. This office can also help with visa arrangements and booking 
the Trans-Siberian train (the fares for the 6 1/2-day journey are $275 for 
second class and $400 for first class.) 
</P>
<P>
 The average traveler at RYH is 22 to 30 years old. Most take a day train to 
St. Petersburg from Helsinki, Finland. Those who have Eurail passes will find 
them good as far as the Russian border; to complete the journey will cost an 
additional $40. 
</P>
<P>
 If you travel via Finland you can make a reservation for RYH at Eurohostel, 
Linnankatu 9, SF-00160 Helsinki; tel. 011-358-0- 66-44-52. If you wait until 
you are in Europe to get your Russian visa, Finland is the best place to do so. 
Keep in mind the faster you need it, the more it will cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Many backpackers also arrive in St. Petersburg from Tallinn, Estonia, via 
night train for about $20. Reservations for RYH can be made at Estonian YHA 
Liivalaia 2, EE0001, Tallinn; tel. 011-3-72- 2-44-1096. If you don't already 
have a Russian visa, ask their advice. The lineups at the Russian embassies in 
Baltic countries can be incredibly long and special arrangements sometimes need 
to be made by visitors from Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The RYH staff has found that the average backpacker stays in St. Petersburg 
for four or five days and then moves on to Moscow. This year the overnight 
second-class train fare for foreigners between St. Petersburg and Moscow has 
jumped from $10 to $30. First-class fares are now $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Western-style budget accommodations are available in Moscow for $12 per night 
in four-bedded rooms at the Moscow International Guest House, a 10-minute walk 
from the Prospect Mira metro station at Bolshaya Pereyaslavskaya Ulitsa 50, 
Floor 10, tel. 011-7- 095-971-4059, fax 011-7-095- 280-7686. This guest house 
has an English-speaking staff, a television lounge, kitchen and laundry 
facilities. Reservations can be made through RYH. 
</P>
<P>
 The most current guidebook available, and the one most highly recommended by 
the RYH staff, is "Russia Through the Back Door" by Ian Watson. A new, expanded 
126-page edition will be available Wednesday. The information for this edition 
was researched early this year. It includes information on the Baltic countries 
and travel on the Trans-Siberian trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies are available for $5.95 from Europe Through the Back Door, Box C-2009, 
109 Fourth St. North, Edmonds, Wash. 98020; tel. (206) 771-8303.

DESTINATION: ARIZONA; THE RARE ELEGANT TROGON IS THE PRIZE THAT DRAWS THOUSANDS 
TO THESE WILDLIFE-RICH CANYONLANDS JUST NORTH OF THE BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM NEGRI, Negri is a Tucson-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone had news about the trogons. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 200 yards up the trail there are five or six of them, practically at 
eye level," a hiker coming down the south fork of Cave Creek Canyon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by the news, Rick Taylor and the dozen bird-watchers on his tour, 
including me, accelerated our pace up the shady canyon in the Chiricahua 
Mountains of southeast Arizona. Burnt orange cliffs of rhyolite towered above 
us; tiny rainbow trout skittered in the clear creek adjacent to their trail. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hundred feet up the canyon, Taylor stopped, cupped his hands to his 
mouth and let out a singularly unappealing call that sounded like someone 
tearing a thick piece of cardboard. Somewhere above, in the dense stands of 
velvet ash, sycamore, oak, pine and spruce trees, the bird known as the elegant 
trogon returned the call. 
</P>
<P>
 For the birders on our tour, the call was enough to get the juices rolling. We 
had hiked about a mile up the narrow canyon on an undulating trail and several 
times had to cross the creek with puddle-jumping leaps. It seemed to me that 
some of the participants had done most of their hiking vicariously in the pages 
of an L. L. Bean catalogue, but age and a lack of flexibility were not going to 
stand between a birder and the sought-after bird, especially when it was 
calling so close by. 
</P>
<P>
 So we stumbled -- I a bit more than the others because it was just after dawn, 
a time of day I hadn't seen in years. So be forewarned: If you take an 
eight-day, trogon trip with Richard "Rick" Taylor, you will rise when the birds 
rise. You will sleep in an area where luxury hotels are nonexistent. (Most of 
our group stayed in Spartan but comfortable dormitory-style rooms at the 
southwest Research Station at Portal, a facility owned by the American Museum 
of Natural History.) And you will spend a few hours of each day walking, a few 
more waiting and looking and a bit of time in a van being carried from one site 
to another. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most birders -- who don't seem to mind spending money on expensive 
binoculars and practical shoes and khaki vests with a million zippered pockets 
-- rising at the crack of dawn and eating over-cooked spaghetti and limp 
vegetables is perfectly acceptable, if it means getting to see a few birds they 
can't see at home. 
</P>
<P>
 One participant who travels a lot in his business said he always gets a field 
guide for the part of the country he's visiting before he leaves the East 
Coast. He then integrates some bird-watching into his business trip the same 
way swimmers and joggers incorporate exercise into theirs. You see the point: 
Most people on birding tours are mainliners. If you sneeze and scare off a 
bird, you might get hit. 
</P>
<P>
 So there we were, one groggy journalist and a bunch of Elderhostel types who 
were bright and chipper and not the least bit concerned with the hour of day or 
the threat of bark scorpions that might be lurking under the rocks we used as 
paving stones to cross the creek, when suddenly Taylor came to a tense halt, 
his eyes scanned the tree-tops. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're out there," Taylor said, "above the canopy." 
</P>
<P>
 Another couple came down the canyon with more information: 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two or three of them just above the next creek crossing. They're 
high up, but you can hear them calling." 
</P>
<P>
 No one asked whether Taylor and his birding group -- easily identified by the 
binoculars and cloth hats decorated with campaign pins from bird counts in 
other parts of the country -- were looking for trogons. The trogons of the 
South Fork area are so well known to birders of the world that they serve as 
the area's economic base. 
</P>
<P>
 A rare and beautiful bird that's sometimes called the coppery-tailed trogon, 
the elegant trogon is nearly a foot long and vaguely resembles a parrot. Before 
1886, there were no first-hand reports of trogons north of Mexico. The first 
positive identification of a trogon in the United States was made that year by 
Lt. H.C. Benson, an off-duty Army officer stationed west of the Chiricahuas at 
Ft. Huachuca, a military base on the fringe of what is now the town of Sierra 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Today there are fewer than 50 pairs of these birds in the United States, all 
concentrated in four mountain ranges in southern Arizona. By far the easiest 
place to see them is in the Cave Creek drainage of the Chiricahua Mountains -- 
about 160 miles southeast of Tucson -- where their nests are scattered at half 
mile intervals along Cave Creek stream. Around South Fork, at least one nest 
can usually be found within a quarter-mile of the parking lot at the road's 
end, about five minutes' drive from the tiny community of Portal near the 
Arizona-New Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the easiest way to see them in this remote area is to get on one of 
Taylor's tours. Taylor, who started doing research on the trogons in 1976, 
estimates that a minimum of 50,000 visitors per year go to Portal primarily to 
see the elegant trogons that come up from Mexico each April to summer along the 
south fork of Cave Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the three most sought-after non-game birds in the United States," 
he said. That list until recently included the whooping crane and the 
California condor. But since Taylor made that statement, all California condors 
have been taken out of the wild for a captive breeding program. "The trogons 
are as rare as the whooping cranes in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Trogon experts may be rarer than both. Taylor, author of a book, "Trogons of 
the Arizona Borderlands," (Treasure Chest Publications, Tucson; $10.95) began 
studying the birds long before the term eco-tourism entered the travelers' 
lexicon, and years before he ever envisioned supporting himself by leading 
visitors on natural history and birding tours throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he was living about 14 miles north of South Fork in Whitetail 
Canyon (now his part-time home). He had just finished writing a guidebook, 
"Hiking Trails and Wilderness Routes of the Chiricahua Mountains," and 
employment opportunities being few in that remote corner of Arizona, he 
launched what he thought would be "a fast and easy project," a short 
fact-filled book on the elegant trogon. The book would be based on research 
funded by several Arizona chapters of the Audubon Society. The commercial value 
of a work so narrowly focused was minimal, but Taylor didn't care. It was the 
mission that was most important to him. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, trogons are extraordinarily attractive birds. The male has a 
scarlet breast, smoke-gray wings, an emerald green body, a yellow bill and an 
orange eye ring circling a large dark pupil. Females are dove-gray with coppery 
tails and a white eye ring with an inner pencil line of orange. In short, 
Taylor says, "This bird happens to be glamorous." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, trogons are fussy about where they live. "So limited are they in 
their choice of habitat that the knowledgeable can predict, almost to the acre, 
where trogons are likely to summer," he says. The majority of trogons that come 
across the Mexican border end up in four major canyons in the Chiricahua, Santa 
Rita, Huachuca and Atascosa Mountains, spanning about 125 miles of the 
Arizona-Sonora border. 
</P>
<P>
 Within these mountains, the trogons occupy approximately 1,000 acres where 
they live on insects and the fruit of the canyon grape vine and southwestern 
chokecherry tree, among other plants. Taylor knows these things because for 
nearly a decade he hiked more than 500 miles a year in search of trogon nests. 
(Ironically, in 1993, after spending 16 years on bad roads and finicky trails 
looking for these birds, a pair of trogons built a nest a few feet from his 
home in the Chiricahuas.) 
</P>
<P>
 "South Fork" Taylor says, "represents the best, and perhaps the only, 
undisturbed example of a canyon system spanning all the life zones, from 
ocotillo to spruce highland, in the Coronado National Forest . . . more rare 
and unusual plants and animals are found in South Fork than any other canyon in 
the Southwest." Because of that accident of nature, more trogons nest in South 
Fork than any other canyon in the United States, a fact that has not escaped 
the attention of avid bird-watchers throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, a year after Audubon Magazine crowned him "Arizona's resident trogon 
expert," Taylor started Borderland Tours to merge his interest in birds and 
natural history with his need to make a living. He didn't realize at the time 
that he had entered the ground floor of a new industry called eco-tourism. It 
simply happened, and it snowballed to the point that Taylor now leads 
ecologically oriented trips throughout the world. His reputation as a 
knowledgeable and affable guide usually precedes him, which is why, about this 
time last year, I joined a dozen bird-watchers from Southern California, 
Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, in swooping into southern Arizona for one 
of his weeklong Owls and Trogons tours. Our group was one of several he takes 
out each spring, when the trogons show up for nesting. Almost everyone on the 
trip was, as Connecticut resident Betty Kleiner put it, "a hard-core birder." 
And most, like Tony Buonocore, were there for the trogons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main appeal of this trip is definitely the trogons, and especially the 
possibility of seeing an eared trogon," said Buonocore, a management consultant 
from Mendham, N.J. (In 1977 Taylor reported the first sighting of the eared 
trogon in the United States.) 
</P>
<P>
 Before the week was out, we would see at least a dozen trogons and nine 
species of owls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was right behind Gil Kleiner when he saw the male trogon," said Julia 
Marsden of Burnet, Tex., "and I'll tell you, I was three feet off the ground 
because I've never seen one before." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there was no shortage of other birds. There were so many, in 
fact, that as Taylor scanned the treetops along the trail, he sounded like a 
sports announcer at a fast-paced game: 
</P>
<P>
 "Black-throated gray warbler in the sycamore dead ahead, two thirds up the 
main trunk. Painted redstart just off the trail on the left, maybe 30 feet 
ahead. Listen, there's a musical hermit thrush. Studies say its call is the 
closest to the harmonics of a clarinet of any bird song. Acorn woodpecker in 
the silver leaf oak just this side of the creek, about eye level. Brown-crested 
flycatcher in the Apache pine. Hey, listen, that's Scott's oriole singing so 
beautifully out there!" 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 350 species of birds in the Chiricahua Mountains, and many 
of them can be seen at South Fork, where the diversity of plants also sustains 
some of the 74 species of mammals, at least 31 kinds of snakes, 24 lizards, 
four turtles and 13 frogs and toads that call the Chiricahuas home. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the main lure of the area remains the trogons, a bird Taylor speaks 
of with hyperbolic intensity. He is their advocate, protector, a sort of 
bragging grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently launched a campaign to get the elegant trogon added to the federal 
list of threatened and endangered species. He swivels away from his computer 
and tugs on the strands of a mustache that refuses to grow in evenly, and he is 
off and running: 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, the elegant trogon should be on that list. I hate to say it, but most 
birds on the endangered list are small, ugly or secretive and don't have a big 
impact on things like motels, restaurants, car rentals and airline ticket 
sales. This bird happens to be charismatic. A hundred trogons are probably 
bringing 50,000 tourists a year to southern Arizona. These birds -- with no 
exaggeration -- are worth a million dollars each to the economy of southern 
Arizona." GUIDEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Birding in Southern Arizona 
</P>
<P>
 Getting There: The Chiricahua Mountains are in the southeastern corner of 
Arizona. You can fly either to Phoenix or Tucson and rent a car. It's a shorter 
drive from Tucson. Delta, America West and Southwest provide regular service 
between Los Angeles and Phoenix with round-trip fare starting at about $90. 
Delta and America West also provide regular flights between LAX and Tucson with 
round-trip fares beginning at about $100. Flying time is approximately one 
hour. Portal, Ariz., is a 150-mile one-way drive from Tucson; if you're driving 
from Phoenix tack on another 125 miles each way. From either city, take 
Interstate 10 east to the Portal Road exit at San Simon and follow the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: Accommodations are limited in Portal. The best rooms are at the 
Portal Peak Lodge (P.O. Box 364, Portal, Ariz. 85632; tel. 602-558-2223). There 
are 16 rooms at $65 per night. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Museum of Natural History has a research station at Portal. When 
the place isn't filled with visiting scientists, dormitory-style rooms are 
available at $50 per person per night; tel. (602) 558-2396. The station's rooms 
are closed to the general public between May 15 and Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the birds: Borderland Tours, $995 for eight days, food, lodging, 
airport pickup and local transportation provided; (602) 882-7650. 
</P>
<P>
 For those wanting to go it alone, rent a car in Tucson or Phoenix and allow 
three hours to drive to Portal and Cave Creek. Look for trogons in the canopy 
over Cave Creek, about a quarter-mile from the parking area.

 Experienced travelers try to keep luggage to a minimum. The ideal is a single, 
wheeled carry-on bag, but that minimalist goal can be elusive when you need a 
range of clothing. In addition, when everything is stashed into one bag, ties, 
suits or dresses can be vulnerable to serious wrinkling amid weighty shoes or 
toilet kits. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you manage to squeeze it all into a single regulation-size carry-on 
bag, airline personnel sometimes decide tight cabin space mandates checking 
hand luggage. Add the Angst of envisioning all your gear vacationing in Cancun 
while you touch down in Cleveland with nothing but the clothes on your back.

 Travelpro, maker of the best-selling -- and in my tests, best-performing -- 
roll-aboard bag, recently came out with a case that addresses wheel-aboard 
luggage's principal flaw: the lack of a system for packing suits and dresses in 
a wrinkle-free fashion. The company's new Rollaboard Suit Carrier starts with a 
basic, but one-inch fatter, medium-size Rollaboard bag (22 by 14 by 8 inches), 
then adds an inside fold-out compartment for securing a suit or a few dresses 
via elastic straps and a padded cross bar. The fold-out compartment then is 
"folded" back into the lid and held fast by elastic X straps. I found the 
Rollaboard suit carrier kept jackets and dresses in much better shape than when 
they were simply folded and placed in a regular bag. A full-scale garment bag 
will accommodate more hanging items and keep them more wrinkle-free, but for 
short trips -- when you need a minimum of dress-up clothes and want to keep 
your luggage down to one sturdy carry-on -- this combo wheel-aboard is well 
worth a look. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelpro Rollaboard Suit Carrier (No. 7480) in black or navy is $199.95 from 
ASU, a mail-order distributor; tel. (800) 756-1444, or at luggage stores. For 
men who plan to take a dress shirt along, Lands' End, makers of upscale 
sportswear, has come up with a handy alternative to toting around expensive 
cuff links and tie bars. Fitted inside a foldable blue felt carrying case are 
eight gold-plated brass essentials: a collar bar, a tie bar, a set of cuff 
links, two 2 1/2-inch collar stays, and two 2-inch collar stays. The jewelry 
looks like real gold and Lands' End provides free engraving on the cuff links 
and tie bar for a classy touch. If these items are lost or stolen during your 
trip, you're only out a pittance. 
</P>
<P>
 Men's Engravable Jewelry Set (No. 2432-9G12) is $29.50 from Lands' End; tel. 
(800) 356-4444.  
</P>
<P>
 Cool mornings and hot afternoons go with the turf on many trips, and where 
shorts might be fine for wandering the countryside, the dress codes in urban 
quarters and at certain religious sites may require long pants. Several 
manufacturers have tried their machines at designing convertible pants/shorts, 
but Sportif leads with the best engineered product. The folks at TravelSmith, a 
mail-order distributor of travel-oriented clothing and gear, say Sportif's 
two-in-one pants are their all-time hottest seller. The khaki-colored safari 
pants convert to shorts via concealed nylon zippers in the legs. The pants have 
deep cargo pockets topped with button-down compartments in front, as well as 
button-down pockets at the rear. They are available in two fabrics: cotton 
twill or Supplex, a very lightweight, fast-drying artificial blend that feels 
like cotton and is my choice for trips when the going could get wet. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the pants are available only in men's sizes, but an order-taker 
helped me estimate a comparable woman's size that fit me fine, though in a 
shapeless kind of way. Next year, Sportif plans to introduce women's 
convertible pants as well. While trying out the product, I was slightly 
conscious of the zipper area against my thighs, though it wasn't particularly 
uncomfortable. In addition, some people might not like the look of the pants 
when worn long, since the overlap where the shorts and legs are zipped creates 
a visible line. Still, I liked the versatility of the two-in-ones, and 
recommend them for compact convertibility on the go. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-in-one pants in khaki-colored cotton (No. 2001) or Supplex (No. 2013) in 
men's sizes 32-40 are $47 from TravelSmith; tel. (800) 950-1600. Pity the poor 
little tie, vulnerable to a crushing variety of heavier gear but expected to 
look smooth and classy around the neck at the end of the line. T. Anthony, a 
distributor of upscale leather accessories, offers a swank leather tie case 
that shields neckwear from the rigors of travel. Ties are draped from brass 
bars on each side of the case (up to four ties per side), which are then 
secured by leather straps that snap against the inside of the case. The case 
folds shut and fastens with more snaps. A brass hanger at the top of the case 
allows for hanging in closets or from hooks or door tops. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel Tie Case (No. O1635) in black or orangy-brown is $95 from T. Anthony; 
tel. (800) 722-2406.CQ A more compact model (No. 9009BK) zippers shut but does 
not hang. It holds up to four ties, comes in black leather, and also costs $95. 
Traditional luggage tags are fine for those who want any lost bags sent home -- 
or to the single address on the tag. But what if your trip involves a 
substantial number of extended stopovers -- and you'd really like your bags as 
soon as possible? These large (6-by-3 1/2-inch) vinyl tags invite baggage 
agents (in eight languages) to remove the itinerary you've placed folded up 
inside the pouch and to forward your bag to you while you're en route. The 
pouch has room for a folded piece of letter- or business-size stationery with 
detailed travel plans. The tags have leather straps with metal buckles and come 
in pairs. A sample itinerary is enclosed in the pouch as a guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Retriever Luggage Tags (No. LA311) are $4.85 a pair from Magellan's; tel. 
(800) 962-4943. Gear & Gadgets appears the first week of every month.

CRUISE VIEWS: WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A SEASICK SAILOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "If there's any one thing in the world that will make a man peculiarly and 
insufferably self-conceited, it is to have his stomach behave itself, the first 
day at sea, when nearly all his comrades are seasick," Mark Twain wrote in 
"Innocents Abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of seasickness is one of the major excuses cited for not taking a cruise. 
Although fewer than 5% of the passengers on any cruise complain of 
motion-sickness symptoms, it's still annoying when it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone worrying about mal de mer can plan ahead for smoother seas by carefully 
selecting a ship, itinerary, travel season and even cabin location. 
</P>
<P>
 If your previous seagoing experience is limited to sailboats, fishing boats or 
a hitch in the U.S. Navy, the stability of modern cruise ships may surprise 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all cruise ships today are equipped with retractable fin stabilizers 
that project underwater from each side of the ship to counteract any 
side-to-side rolling motion. It's generally estimated that they cut out 90% of 
the roll. 
</P>
<P>
 But even most modern stabilizers are not able to control pitching (the 
up-and-down motion of the ship's bow), so the captain must do his utmost to 
avoid going into bad weather and heavy seas. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one ship -- the futuristic 354-passenger Radisson Diamond, with its 
unique twin hulls -- promises considerably less pitching and rolling than a 
conventional single-hull ship. It claims to have only 20% of the roll of a 
mono-hull cruise ship and 10% of the noise and vibration levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Cruise Line says in its brochure that its innovative SWATH (Small 
Waterplane Area Twin Hull) design can "virtually negate the effects of the sea" 
because of its computer-controlled inboard fin stabilizers and the relatively 
narrow hull area it has in contact with the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 When stabilizers are inboard rather than outboard, they aid in counteracting 
pitch as well as roll. Pitch and heave are also reduced because water is 
funneled between the two pontoons. 
</P>
<P>
 When we took the Radisson Diamond's inaugural May, 1992, sailing in the 
English Channel, that body of water was so uncharacteristically smooth that we 
could hardly tell when the ship was moving and when it was alongside the dock. 
Still, all the of the line's claims seemed to hold true. 
</P>
<P>
 Another revolutionary design feature in the sail-cruise vessels of Windstar 
Cruises and Club Med Cruises are computer-trimmed and operated sails that keep 
the ships at an even keel under sail, with heeling well under 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ships with a deeper draft (the measurement from the vessel's waterline to the 
lowest point of its keel) usually perform better in rough seas than ships with 
shallow drafts. Norwegian Cruise Line's Norway, for example, has a 35-foot 
draft, whereas the Carnival Line's megaliners Fantasy, Ecstasy and Sensation, 
which carry nearly the same number of passengers and gross registered tonnage, 
like most recently built vessels have 25-foot drafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabin location can also make a difference in how much ship motion you feel. 
Accommodations that are located on a lower deck amidships (about halfway 
between bow and stern) offer a more stable ride than the higher-priced sun deck 
and promenade deck locations. Book a cabin too close to the ship's bow or stern 
and you may feel every swell. 
</P>
<P>
 Destination and itineraries can make a big difference for passengers concerned 
about seasickness. Land is always in sight and waters are calm is such 
sheltered waters as Alaska's Inside Passage or the great rivers of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, in areas where two seas meet -- Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, for 
instance, where the Sea of Cortez meets the Pacific Ocean; South Africa's Cape 
of Good Hope, or South America's Cape Horne -- the water can really be stirred 
up. The same is true in regions where currents are powerful (with a speed 
greater than 0.8 knots an hour). Examples are the Bering Strait, the Java and 
Solomon seas, the South Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, the French-Spanish Bay 
of Biscay, around the Spitsbergen and Falkland island groups, and along the 
southern tip of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, some seas and seasons are worse than others for passengers who fear 
seasickness. Capt. Konstantinos Skordos, master of Classical Cruises' Aurora II 
and a longtime cargo captain, says summertime generally offers the best 
cruising weather, especially in the Mediterranean; "but the Aegean can be rough 
sometimes in summer." 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite smooth winter waters are between Costa Rica and Panama, where 
"there's always good weather in winter," and he gives high marks to Mexico's 
sheltered Sea of Cortez. However, he noted, Scotland's west coast and Shetland 
Islands can have rough seas even in summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In our experience -- about 175 cruises in 15 years -- we've had a handful of 
memorably rough voyages. They have included an April crossing on the North 
Atlantic; Cape Horn and the Drake Passage, south of South America, on an 
Antarctic sailing in January; a November sailing along the coast of West 
Africa, especially around the border of Namibia and South Africa; the South 
China Sea, and the seas around Nome, Alaska, anytime. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a short three- or four-day cruise out of Los Angeles south to Ensenada, 
Mexico, especially in winter, can involve several hours of rough seas on the 
northbound return. 
</P>
<P>
 We recall with pleasure the smooth seas aboard most Caribbean cruises and all 
Alaska cruises -- except for the Nome area, where only a few expedition vessels 
sail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After all the advance planning, if mal de mer strikes anway, there are several 
possible remedies: 
</P>
<P>
 Some travelers swear by knit, bracelet-like bands, worn around both wrists, 
which exert pressure on acupressure points to relieve symptoms of nausea. 
Travel stores, variety stores and large drugstores usually carry them under 
such brand names as Sea Band or Travel Garde. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-prescription antihistamine remedies, such as Dramamine, can be taken one 
or two hours before sailing but do cause drowsiness. Some ship doctors 
recommend a Dramamine injection, which usually acts faster than an ingested 
tablet, for a sudden or severe onset of seasickness. 
</P>
<P>
 The most commonly used device is the Transderm Scop, a Band-Aid-like patch -- 
applied behind the ear -- which appears more innocuous than it really is. 
Available only by prescription, the patch contains scopolamine; according to 
printed inserts, it is not recommended for pregnant women or people with 
glaucoma, kidney or liver ailments, obstructions of the stomach or intestines, 
urinary or bladder obstructions, skin allergies or skin reactions to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Common side effects of the Transderm Scop include a dry mouth and, less 
frequently, drowsiness or a temporary blurring of vision. Very infrequently, 
disorientation, memory disturbances and hallucinations may occur, particularly 
among older people, according to a spokesman for its manufacturer, CIBA-GEIGY. 
He also warned that people using the drug should not drink alcohol but quench 
their thirst instead with water or soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying on deck in the fresh air will generally alleviate symptoms more 
quickly than lying down indoors, and many passengers say looking at the horizon 
seems to help. 
</P>
<P>
 If all else fails, one sure way to get rid of the seasickness problem is to 
grow older. Young people are much more sensitive to motion sickness than older 
people. 
</P>
<P>

 Classical Cruises' Aurora II, the subject of the April 17 Cruise Views column, 
was unexpectedly sold by its German owners to shipping interests in the Far 
East, according to Classical's president, Jamie Rosen. The Aurora II will 
continue its chartered sailings for Classical as scheduled through August, 
after which autumn sailings will be transferred to the 64-passenger French 
motor-sailing yacht, Le Ponant.

DOING JULIAN JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If I had never been to Julian, I certainly would not be inspired to go on the 
basis of your article ("Off-Season Apple Pie," April 10).It not only failed to 
mention the fascinating gold mine tour, but even failed to do justice to the 
historic Julian Hotel. I think the town is a perfect low-key weekend 
destination and certainly deserves better coverage. And whereas the restaurants 
may not be exactly gourmet, I think a writer might choose an establishment (or 
item on the menu) which would capture more of the local scene.

THE BIRTH OF A DEMOCRATIC NATION; SOUTH AFRICANS GO TO THE POLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Walter Russell Mead, Walter Russell Mead, a contributing editor to Opinion, 
is the author of Mortal Splendor: The American Empire in Transition (Houghton 
Mifflin). He is now working on a book about U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anything worth doing is worth doing badly, wrote G.K. Chesterton, and South 
Africa's first democratic election has proven him right. 
</P>
<P>
 By every normal standard, the South African election was a disaster. The 
run-up to the voting was chaotic and violent. Hundreds died in clashes between 
supporters of the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party. 
Hard-line racist whites, unreconciled to the idea of majority rule, launched a 
national campaign of terrorist bombing. One major party boycotted the poll 
until almost the eve of voting; stickers were hastily slapped on millions of 
pre-printed ballots so the Inkatha Party could appear. 
</P>
<P>
 It only got worse when the polls opened. Ballot papers were lost, were shipped 
to the wrong destinations. Voters waited on line for hours before being told 
that they would have to go home because voting supplies had run short. The 
process was so chaotic that the voting period had to be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a mess, a disaster -- and one of the greatest triumphs for democracy 
and the human spirit that this weary old world has seen. Administrative chaos 
meant millions of South Africans had to stand on lines that stretched in some 
cases for miles; what is remarkable, and what the world should remember as we 
wonder about South Africa's future, is that millions of people patiently waited 
on those lines -- and peacefully voted. 
</P>
<P>
 They had been waiting a long time -- since young Mohandas K. Gandhi led 
protests against racial segregation and the African National Congress called 
for a non-racial South Africa at its founding in 1912. Nelson Mandela waited 27 
years in prison before emerging to lead South Africa's largest political party 
in elections from which he was expected to emerge as the first genuinely 
democratic elected leader in the country's long, troubled history. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the eyes of the world are on South Africa as never before. If the new 
democratic South Africa can rebuild its economy, and combine the often 
conflicting demands of economic justice and economic efficiency, it will point 
the way to a new political and economic era for all of black Africa. South 
African business and expertise can become the locomotive of change for its 
neighbors and bring an end to Africa's poverty and impotence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the importance of South Africa's election goes farther. At a time when 
democracy seems on the retreat -- when communists and nationalists are rising 
to power in much of Eastern Europe, when supporters of Benito Mussolini are 
joining the government in Italy and when corruption and incompetence have 
dimmed the allure of democratic principles and parties from Washington to Tokyo 
-- South Africa reminds us what democracy is. 
</P>
<P>
 It is more than a method of government: It is a statement about human dignity. 
Those South African voters who stood patiently for hours waiting to cast their 
ballots weren't just participating in a political process; they were also 
participating in a moral and spiritual process. After years of oppression, they 
were standing up to say, as Jesse Jackson would put it, "I am somebody." And no 
bombs, no threats, no long lines or administrative chaos could keep South 
Africans from making that statement. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa is used to the limelight. This beloved country has always played 
an important role in the world's imagination since Vasco da Gama rounded the 
Cape of Good Hope. South Africa's natural beauty, its geographic isolation, the 
vast wealth of its resources, the stark contrasts and conflicts among the many 
brave peoples who have loved it and called it their home have given it an 
importance far beyond the numbers of people who live there. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a land of heroes. Winston Churchill rose to fame as a dashing British 
cavalry officer in the Boer War. The Zulu King Shaka mounted one of history's 
great military campaigns against the whites who sought to take Zulu land. The 
Afrikaners who fought the British in the Boer Wars won the world's admiration 
for their brave struggle against impossible odds. The last Napoleonic heir to 
the French imperial throne died in South Africa, serving in a British force 
that was massacred by Zulu warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, South Africa's long liberation struggle has created thousands 
of heroes, black and white, female and male. The ANC was sustained for decades 
by the patient and heroic efforts of tens of thousands who risked prison, exile 
and death to fight racism. The Black Sash, an organization of mostly white 
South African women, bore witness at great risk and cost to the dignity and 
worth of all of South Africa's people. Names like Steven Biko, Desmond Tutu, 
Alan Boesak, Cyril Ramaphosa and Chris Hani are known and honored wherever 
freedom is loved. 
</P>
<P>
 The election is not just a victory for South Africa's oppressed blacks. It is 
a victory also for the Afrikaners, the descendants of white settlers who came 
to South Africa at the time whites first settled the American colonies and who 
built a society much like the early United States. 
</P>
<P>
 As fiercely democratic and egalitarian among themselves as the U.S. colonists, 
they even share the same national myths as Americans. Like Americans, 
Afrikaners are a people who look back to revolutionary struggles with Britain 
and to epic pioneer journeys in covered wagons. Like Americans, the Afrikaners 
have a proud heritage that is disfigured by racism. The Afrikaner nationalists 
who framed the laws of apartheid were, in part, inspired by the Jim Crow 
segregation laws of the American South. But, like white America, white 
Afrikanerdom was finally driven to struggle against the racism of its own 
heritage; that struggle is only beginning, but already men like Frederik W. de 
Klerk have come farther and faster than anyone could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as votes are counted and parties maneuver for power in the new South 
African order, South Africa's troubles are far from over. But in a time when 
too often the news is of defeats for peace and democracy, of breakdowns in 
order and decency, and of conflicts among the world's great religions and its 
feuding nations, we should all stand back for a moment and join the people of 
South Africa in celebrating the immense if untidy victory that this election 
represents. "Nkosi Sikelel' i-Afrika!" God Bless Africa! This is a sentiment, 
and a prayer, that all share at this great and shining moment.*

 What is this strange bond that links Bill Clinton and Richard M. Nixon? It was 
there for all to see when Clinton went out into the Rose Garden after Nixon 
died and spoke, with deep feeling, of the late President's "resilience." Nixon, 
after all, was the original "Comeback Kid." The bond of sympathy was apparent 
again at the funeral Wednesday, when Clinton said in his eulogy, "May the day 
of judging President Nixon on anything less than his entire life and career 
come to a close." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon also acknowledged the bond. He told a confidante after his first meeting 
with Clinton, "You know, he came from dirt and I came from dirt. He lost a 
gubernatorial race and came back to win the presidency, and I lost a 
gubernatorial race and came back to win the presidency. He overcame a scandal 
in his first campaign for national office and I overcame a scandal in my first 
national campaign. We both just gutted it out. He was an outsider from the 
South and I was an outsider from the West." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon could have gone on. Both men were elected President with 43% of the vote 
in a three-way race. Nixon, a brilliant political tactician, used the "Southern 
strategy" to go after the George C. Wallace vote. He got reelected in 1972 by 
neatly folding the Wallace vote into the Republican vote and creating a GOP 
presidential majority that lasted almost a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is also a brilliant political tactician who knows how to get out of 
tight spots. During the 1992 campaign, he appeared with his wife on "60 
Minutes" to explain their marital difficulties. It was reminiscent of Nixon's 
"Checkers speech" that kept him on the ticket in 1952. Both men made shrewd use 
of their wives for political advantage. Nixon did Clinton one better, however. 
He threw in his dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton hasn't won over the Ross Perot vote yet. But he has targeted it. 
That's one reason why he turned into a deficit hawk. Clinton wants to do what 
Nixon did: build a presidential majority that will last for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men have a record that defies ideological expectations. Nixon was a 
red-baiting conservative who went to China and initiated detente with the 
Soviet Union. And look at Nixon's domestic legacy: environmental protection, 
affirmative action, wage and price controls, abolition of the draft. Clinton is 
the liberal who defies political correctness. He supported the Gulf War, 
enforced the death penalty and confronted Jesse Jackson. As President, he's 
stealing the GOP's issues -- crime, welfare reform, the deficit and traditional 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 Their ideological slipperiness explains something else the two men share. 
Nixon was widely distrusted. So is Clinton. They both have the image of devious 
politicians. Slick Willie, meet Tricky Dick. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives never really liked or trusted Nixon the way they did, say, 
Ronald Reagan. And many liberals already feel disappointed, if not betrayed, by 
Clinton. But there is more to the distrust than ideology. A lot of it is purely 
personal. With Nixon, the joke was, "Would you buy a used car from this man?" 
With Clinton, it's endless variations on, "I didn't inhale." 
</P>
<P>
 What's odd is that the two represent such different character types. Nixon was 
cold, distant, calculating, formal and synthetic. Clinton is warm, open, 
approachable, laid-back and touchy-feely. Can you imagine Nixon answering 
questions about his underwear? 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was hated by large numbers. He invited their hatred, even thrived on it. 
When his wife expressed amazement at his ability to persevere in the face of 
criticism, he told her, "I just get up every morning to confound my enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 Through dogged determination, Nixon finally got people to respect him, even 
admire him. But something surprising came to light last week, after his death. 
A lot of people said they loved Nixon, that most unloving and unlovable man. 
That's the Nixon mystery: Why did so many Americans love him? 
</P>
<P>
 With Clinton, the opposite is true. He is an extremely loving and lovable man. 
Clinton's ability to connect with people is legendary. It paid off for him in 
the 1992 campaign. Remember the Richmond debate in front of a live audience? 
Clinton looked every questioner straight in the eye and spoke personally to 
their concerns. George Bush looked at his watch.  
</P>
<P>
 But there is a mystery about Clinton, too: Why do large numbers of Americans 
hate him? There's a constituency that simply despises Clinton. They think he is 
a lying, deceiving, draft-dodging adulterer. A Clinton-bashing industry has 
sprung up, complete with newsletters. In fact, only one person surpasses 
Clinton as an object of hatred. And that's Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was a resentment politician. He assumed, with good reason, that others 
were out to get him. So he made it his business to get them first. He was 
usually smart enough, and ruthless enough, to do it. Resentment drove Nixon 
from railing at the press ("You won't have Dick Nixon to kick around any more") 
to keeping enemies lists to the Watergate cover-up -- when he finally went too 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 A supporter once said about Grover Cleveland, "We love him for the enemies he 
has made." That may be the key to the Nixon mystery. Press-haters, 
Kennedy-haters, liberal-haters and counter-culture-haters all loved Nixon 
because he was the enemy of everything they hated. Nixon's resentment was their 
resentment. Nixon hated the liberal Establishment, and he hated their radical 
children. And so did the Silent Majority. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, even after Watergate, Nixon got his revenge on the Establishment. 
By becoming a statesman, he forced them to respect him. But he always hated 
them. Even in death, he let them know it. Nixon refused to allow his body to 
lie in state at the U.S. Capitol. That was his final message to the Washington 
Establishment: To hell with you all. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is an empathy politician. You get the sense that if he could meet 
every voter in America, he would charm them all. And get 100% of the vote. 
Sometimes it seems he aims to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 But empathy, too, has a cost. The cost takes the form of a widely noticed 
characteristic of Clinton's leadership style: He wants everyone to love him. 
That's why he has so much trouble making tough choices -- including 
appointments. Remember Zoe Baird? 
</P>
<P>
 Many conservatives hate Clinton because they think he's a liberal pretending 
to be something else. They want to expose him as a phony -- and Hillary as a 
hypocrite. How dare she talk about "the politics of meaning" after making a 
killing on the commodities market! Can a man who marries Hillary and appoints 
C. Lani Guinier and lets Ira Magaziner design his health-care plan and tries to 
end the ban on gays in the military be anything but a liberal? Clinton-haters 
hate Clinton for the friends he has made. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Nixon, Clinton seems driven by insecurity. Where does it come from? Nixon 
was probably correct, if a bit harsh, when he said, "He came from dirt and I 
came from dirt . . . . He was an outsider from the South and I was an outsider 
from the West." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's insecurity took the form of resentment, Clinton's an exaggerated 
empathy. The result in Nixon's case was a tragic character flaw. He assumed 
people were out to get him and he acted accordingly. In Clinton's case, the 
result is different but still potentially serious. He wants everyone to love 
him -- liberals, moderates, Perot voters, the Establishment, everyone -- and 
that can make it difficult to be an effective President. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone once said of Nixon that he could have been a truly great President if 
only he had been loved. Clinton has the opposite problem. He needs some of 
Nixon's toughness, even his ruthlessness. Clinton's enemies need to feel that 
they will pay a price for crossing him. That's what made Democrats like Harry 
S. Truman and John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson so effective. 
</P>
<P>
 It's bad enough that Clinton's enemies at home don't fear him. It's worse that 
his enemies abroad -- the Serbs in Bosnia, the communists in North Korea, the 
military junta in Haiti -- don't fear him. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is paying a big price for his politics of empathy. It's limiting his 
effectiveness as President. "Clinton talks too much," a Republican said 
recently. "He's always telling people what he thinks and how he feels. He's the 
President. People want to know what he's going to do." Nixon was accused of 
trying to create "the imperial presidency." Clinton is doing just the opposite. 
He's de-imperializing it. And that's reducing his stature in the country.*

THE NATION; HAS IMMIGRATION COLLIDED WITH THE WELFARE STATE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Peter Skerry, Peter Skerry, who teaches political science at UCLA, is author 
of Mexican Americans: The Ambivalent Minority (The Free Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration seeks to pay for welfare reform by, among other 
things, cutting off Medicaid and Supplemental Social Security Income to legal 
immigrants who are not yet citizens. Gov. Pete Wilson wants to free California 
taxpayers of the financial burden of providing public services, especially 
education and emergency health care, to people who are in the state illegally. 
Last week, Wilson took an uncontroversial step toward his goal: He sued the 
federal government to force it to pay for maintaining illegal immigrants in 
California's prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 That an activist Democrat and a moderate Republican would take, or plan to 
take, such drastic actions should give pause to those who trace all anxieties 
about immigrants to nativism or racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals to limit, or deny public services or benefits to immigrants -- legal 
or illegal -- also remind us that the problem with immigration is not 
exclusively economic. Indeed, in purely economic terms, the current influx of 
immigrants has been, on balance, a net plus. 
</P>
<P>
 But America is not just an economy. It is also a political community, whose 
attention is now turned inward toward pressing domestic problems. The Clinton 
Administration obviously feels that domestic needs require renewed commitment 
to various social investments, and its investment approach highlights the 
fundamental contradiction between mass immigration and the modern welfare 
state. For, as we focus on investing more in our people, we are compelled to 
scrutinize exactly who "our people" are. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if a modern nation fails to draw meaningful geographic 
boundaries around itself, it will feel increasing pressure to draw internal 
demographic and political lines. 
</P>
<P>
 During the decade ending in 1992, approximately 8.9 million immigrants were 
granted permanent residence. If the 3.2 million illegal immigrants believed to 
be living in the United States are added, the total number of newcomers 
arriving between 1983 to 1992 exceeds the previous record of 10.1 million 
between 1905 and 1914. Without a doubt, this peak will be surpassed in the 
1990s. And while immigrants today represent a much smaller proportion of the 
nation's population than they did during the first decades of the 20th Century, 
this is still an enormous number of new residents. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing new about defining and defending our national boundaries and 
deciding who is and who isn't a member of the national community. Apart from 
being the sovereign right of nation-states, such efforts are a virtual 
necessity. So how has the United States come to neglect -- or, perhaps, avoid 
-- the task of defining its political community? 
</P>
<P>
 During the booming 1980s, the demand for immigrant labor, on the one hand, and 
steadily increasing tax revenues, on the other, obviated any such 
technicalities. More generally, since the 1960s an obsessive tolerance has come 
to permeate all discussions in which distinctions among groups must be drawn. 
Certainly among the enlightened, there is a strong tendency to view any mention 
of border enforcement with some suspicion, on the ground that it is probably 
motivated by racial fears or bigotry. More recently, the momentum to create 
trading blocs here and in Europe has fostered the idea that the free (or at 
least freer) movement of goods across national boundaries implies the free 
movement of people. 
</P>
<P>
 But people are not the same as goods. This distinction is important in today's 
liberal democracies, because, unlike goods, people have gained many social and 
political rights -- even when they are non-citizens. Asked to describe his 
country's unanticipated problems managing so-called guest workers, one Swiss 
official said: "We asked for workers, and we got people instead." 
</P>
<P>
 One point is clear: People still do not flow as easily across borders as 
goods. Even in the European Community, where both people and goods flow more 
freely than ever, attention is focused on the periphery, where the advanced 
economies of Western Europe confront immigration pressures from their less 
economically advanced neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration also poses an internal challenge to the modern welfare state, even 
its modest American variant. Obviously, the distribution of welfare-state 
benefits is based not just on equity. Political clout is also involved. And 
political clout is one thing that immigrants lack. Likely to be more concerned 
with economic than political advancement, they tend to be handicapped in the 
interest-group competition that dominates this welfare state. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the preferred solution to this political challenge is to kick the 
problem upstairs to Washington, as Wilson is seeking to do. Yet, this solution 
is not going to work as neatly as hoped. To be sure, the fiscal constraints on 
local and state governments complaining about the impact of legal -- and 
especially illegal -- immigration are greater than those on the federal 
government. But not only are there fiscal limits in Washington; there are also 
political constraints. Despite the growing presence and visibility of immigrant 
advocates and their allies in the national arena, the real political clout of 
immigrant interests is still easily diluted and isolated in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Another troublesome dynamic hard to ignore in Washington is the competition 
between immigrants and disadvantaged citizens, especially black Americans. How 
can we justify denying benefits to citizens suffering the accumulated ravages 
of generations of economic privation and discrimination in favor of the claims 
of recently arrived, albeit legal, immigrants? There are no easy answers to 
such questions. Certainly, the frequently heard response is that disadvantaged 
Americans and immigrants are not in a zero-sum competition, though this is 
unconvincing. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts are hardly an arena in which to resolve these political 
contradictions. Indeed, it is because of, not in spite of, the courts' largess 
to illegal as well as legal immigrants that we are facing a public reaction to 
the burdens posed by these newcomers. The courts (need it still be said?) 
cannot go on indefinitely ignoring political realities. And even if tensions 
over, for example, the costs of educating illegal immigrant children imposed by 
the Supreme Court's 1982 Plyler vs. Doe decision are moderated, a basic 
question remains: How shall we achieve fairness in apportioning scarce 
resources between immigrants and disadvantaged citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 Some conservatives have long understood that there is a contradiction between 
mass immigration and the welfare state. Indeed, an important reason why 
conservatives support mass immigration is the expectation that it will speed 
the collapse of the welfare state. For their part, liberals have long told 
themselves that these challenges are illusory. They are deceiving themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the American welfare state will not collapse. Immigration will 
weaken it, but not fatally. Immigrants will continue to arrive in America, not 
only with bundles of belongings but also with bundles of rights. The tough 
questions will persist -- and fester. 
</P>
<P>
 We already know how hard and unpleasant it is to draw a line between illegal 
immigrants and the rest of the population. Adopting the Clinton proposal would 
force us to draw another line, between individuals residing here legally and 
American citizens. That, too, looks to be a nasty and divisive business. 
Perhaps, as we encounter the political and practical difficulties of carrying 
out such policies, we will conclude that it would be easier, not to mention 
wiser and more humane, to address these questions before millions of newcomers 
-- legal as well as illegal -- put down roots and gain a stake in our social 
and political system.*

BEHIND THE KIDNAPING OF CHILDREN FOR THEIR ORGANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Victor Perera, Victor Perera is author of Unfinished Conquest: The 
Guatemalan Tragedy (California) and Rites: A Guatemalan Boyhood, due out in 
paperback this winter (Mercury House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent mob attacks in Guatemala on two American women suspected of 
kidnaping children for organ transplants may be part of a right- wing strategy 
to create a climate of instability hostile to human-rights monitors. In the 
more serious of the two incidents, June D. Weinstock, an environmental writer 
from Fairbanks, Alaska, was engulfed by an enraged mob in San Cristobal 
Verapaz, in the Mayan Highlands, after she was seen caressing a child whose 
mother reported him missing immediately afterward. Weinstock was stripped, 
stoned, stabbed repeatedly and beaten unconscious by her assailants, who were 
egged on by state road workers and unidentified outsiders. Although her 
condition has been upgraded from comatose to "in stupor," she probably will not 
recover fully. 
</P>
<P>
 The assaults on the women and other foreigners tap into indigenous fears that 
are at least 500 years old. When the Spanish conquistadors invaded the 
Guatemalan Highlands in the 16th Century, Mayan mothers believed the men with 
pale complexions and blond beards were anemic, and required the blood of 
brown-skinned infants to become well. 
</P>
<P>
 These ancient fears have resurfaced with the rise of a baby-trafficking 
contraband that accounts for the disappearance of six children a day, according 
to Guatemala's Public Ministry. Most of these abducted children, who range from 
newborns to primary schoolers, will be hidden away in "fattening houses" before 
they are flown to illicit adoption agencies in the United States and Europe. 
Atty. Gen. Telesforo Guerra Cahn reports 20 kidnaping rings and at least 65 
fattening houses operating in Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby trade is so lucrative -- illegal adoptions bring as much as $10,000 a 
head -- that high government officials are known to take part in it. One of the 
largest rings is allegedly headed by a top government official. Attempts to 
prosecute him have failed because of his parliamentary immunity, not to mention 
his influence over the court system and its judges. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, this multimillion- dollar traffic has taken a macabre twist, 
as rumors have resurfaced that some kidnaped babies are being flown abroad for 
their organs. Like the medieval blood libels in Europe that accused Jews of 
stealing Christian babies for satanic rituals, the organ-transplant hysteria 
has taken on a life of its own. Unlike the medieval blood libels, which were 
fanned by zealous anti-Semite clerics, there is growing evidence that the 
organ-transplant rumors may have a basis in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 In its March 21 issue, Mexico's Proceso, which has tracked the 
baby-trafficking story for months, interviewed Eric Sottas, president of the 
Geneva-based World Organization Against Torture, who confirmed the existence of 
international rings that kidnap children, "not only for illegal adoptions, 
pornographic activities and child prostitution, but for the purpose of 
trafficking in organs." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Sottas Report," elaborated over a three-year period with the 
collaboration of 200 human-rights agencies, was presented March 8 at a 
conference of transplant experts in Basil, Switzerland. Among many other 
horrors, the report lists 17 clinics in Tijuana and Juarez, on Mexico's U.S. 
border, that perform sophisticated transplants of kidneys and corneal tissues 
from kidnaped children to wealthy Europeans and North Americans who pay top 
prices for the operations, no questions asked. The Latin American countries 
listed as confirmed traffickers in child organs are Brazil, Argentina, Peru, 
Honduras, Colombia and Mexico. The chief beneficiaries, apart from North 
Americans, are reported to be Swiss, German and, above all, Italian buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier report to the United Nations, Sottas named Guatemala, Haiti and 
Brazil as three countries in which street children are kidnaped for their 
organs. Most of these children are not heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not the reports of organ transplants in Guatemala are proved true, 
their usefulness as a political tool against foreigners is undeniable. In the 
attack on Melissa C. Larson in Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, on Guatemala's 
southern lowlands, diplomatic sources reported two military intelligence 
officers inciting the crowds. A mob of several hundred set fire to the prison 
where Larson was being held in protective custody after townspeople accused her 
of complicity in the abduction of two children. Larson was freed 19 days later 
for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor in the attacks on foreigners could be the breakthrough in the 
latest round of peace talks in Mexico between the government and leftist 
guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union. For the first time, 
human-rights violations were placed on the agenda for continuing negotiations 
in Norway in mid-May. On March 29, the Guatemalan government agreed to permit a 
10-member United Nations verification team to inspect military bases and 
guerrilla camps and work with other human-rights agencies in Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 The military's displeasure with this agreement is hardly surprising, as 
foreign observers accuse them of responsibility for as much as 95% of 
human-rights violations committed by all sides during Guatemala's 33-year war 
of counter- insurgency. In past months, the army moved to tighten its reins on 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio's presidency, pressuring him to dismiss his highly 
respected interior minister and human-rights specialist, Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso, 
and his chief of police, Mario Rene Cifuentes, who headed the presidential 
human-rights commission. Ortiz and Cifuentes were replaced by hard-liners who 
support the army's call for immunity from prosecution for all its past abuses 
of power. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the heaviest blow to Guatemala's democratic apertura was the 
assassination, on April 1, of Epaminondas Gonzales Dubon, who had been 
president of Guatemala's constitutional court for nearly a year. It was 
Gonzales who prevented former President Jorge Serrano Elias from abolishing the 
courts and the congress last May, and ruling the country by dictatorial decree. 
As a result of Gonzales' murder and the continuing attacks on foreigners, the 
U.S. State Department has issued an advisory against travel to Guatemala, and 
200 Peace Corps volunteers have been recalled from the countryside. President 
De Leon Carpio backed down, temporarily at least, from declaring a state of 
emergency that would include the suspension of constitutional guarantees -- a 
move that would play further into the military's apparent attempts to seal off 
the country against foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the stories of abduction of children for illicit purposes continue 
to proliferate throughout Latin America. In Guatemala, the organ-trafficking 
rumors refuse to go away. Even if these claims continue to elude confirmation, 
the verifiable story of a Guatemalan supreme- court president who heads a child 
trafficking ring is sinister enough to cause stupor in Washington and European 
capitals, and to keep the pot boiling within Guatemala. As long as army 
generals and high-level officials continue to get away with systematic 
assassinations and infant abductions, the chances are slim that a 
U.N.-sponsored truth commission could get the job done, and pin down those 
responsible for the murder and disappearance of more than 100,000 Guatemalans 
in one of the hemisphere's bloodiest and longest-lasting armed conflicts.*

THE WORLD; BEYOND RENO'S CHARISMA: MISMANAGEMENT AT JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David M. O'Brien, David M. O'Brien is a professor of government at the 
University of Virginia and author, among other books, of Storm Center: The 
Supreme Court in American Politics and an annual Supreme Court Watch (Norton). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget about Whitewater. The current lack of leadership at the Department of 
Justice is far more scandalous. Plagued by persistent problems of staffing and 
coordinating policy, the department has been drifting for more than a year. 
Were it not for the actions of career attorneys and civil servants, the 
department might as well have closed shop. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many key positions going unfilled for so long and the high turnover in 
top personnel, it's almost a wonder that work continues at Justice. The 
department employs about 95,000 people and has an annual budget of almost $10 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Often billed as the nation's largest law firm, the department includes 
divisions on antitrust, crime, civil rights and the environment. The federal 
government's principal litigators, U.S. attorneys, are spread out in 94 
judicial districts around the country, as are U.S. marshals. The attorney 
general's responsibility also extends to oversight of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, the Bureau of Prisons and the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 
among many others. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, most of the day-to-day work is done by career attorneys and civil 
servants. In spite of the absence of leadership at the top, the department has 
pressed ahead in combatting hazardous-waste disposals and discrimination in 
housing and lending. But that is due to the work of career attorneys. Quite 
simply, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno needs to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains remarkable is how slow President Bill Clinton has been to fill 
crucial positions in the department. Those of deputy attorney general, 
solicitor general and assistant attorney general for the criminal division went 
vacant for far too long. And the Administration continues to drag its feet in 
filling a mounting number of federal judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has also demonstrated an almost unbelievable penchant for 
misjudgment in selecting nominees for key positions. More than a year passed 
before Clinton filled, for example, the key position of assistant attorney 
general for civil rights. Notably, Reno stood by while Clinton ran away from 
his first nominee for that slot, University of Pennsylvania Law Professor C. 
Lani Guinier. Clinton's second nominee, Washington attorney John Payton, 
withdrew under criticism from the Congressional Black Caucus. Finally, in late 
March, the President's third nominee, Boston lawyer Deval L. Patrick, won 
Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department's problems have been further compounded by turnovers in 
crucial personnel and difficulties in coordinating policy with the White House. 
In mid-March, Webster L. Hubbell, the associate attorney general and a close 
friend of the President, resigned under fire from his former law-firm partners 
in Little Rock, Ark., over his alleged overbilling of clients. Earlier, the 
President's own counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, was forced to resign to try to 
stem the tide of questions over whether he had improperly contacted officials 
investigating Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 years of GOP rule, Clinton's supporters expected more. Instead, due 
to vacancies in high-level positions, there have been lost opportunities to 
forge new legal policy, to set priorities and to chart a different course. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno, to be sure, has won high marks for her public outspokenness. Few of her 
predecessors have used the attorney generalship as a bully pulpit or done so 
quite as effectively. Reno has questioned mandatory-minimum sentences for 
criminals and spoken out about the need for crime prevention and other tough 
new measures. She has stressed the need for community outreach programs and 
taken a hard line against violence on television. In this regard, Reno rivals 
Edwin M. Meese III, who championed a return to a "jurisprudence of original 
intention" in the second Reagan Administration through the appointment of 
federal judges. Indeed, one has to go back to Robert F. Kennedy's crusade for 
civil rights to find as publicly visible and popular an attorney general. 
</P>

 Reno's homespun style and seemingly ramrod independence have endeared the 
first female attorney general to the public. Yet, after more than a year at the 
helm, Reno appears more showboat captain than a hands-on commander. Within and 
without the department, doubts are growing about Reno's managerial competence. 
Will she take time off from the speech-making circuit to get the department in 
order? Even if she does spare the time, it remains unclear that she possesses 
the managerial skills to delegate, coordinate and manage. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that attorney general and the President appear out of 
sync. That was the case with Guinier's nomination, the controversy over the 
crime bill and other matters of legal policy. Moreover, Reno, no less than 
Clinton, appears slow to react at times. The dismissal of the former head of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, William S. Sessions, for example, came 
months after the initial charges of his improprieties and a steadily declining 
morale in the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Reno may occasionally take strong public stands, her indecisiveness 
over administrative matters is evident. Whether due to her inclination to 
micro-manage, her compulsion for details, her inability to delegate or her 
willingness to respond to virtually every inquiry raised in news conferences or 
on her speaking engagements, her lack of administrative leadership remains a 
flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 That Reno appears an overwhelmed and disorganized administrator was most 
evident when her deputy attorney general, Philip B. Heymann, resigned after 
just seven months in office. Heymann, a Harvard Law School professor who served 
under four previous attorneys general, cited differences in "style and 
chemistry" between them as the reason for his departure. Reno agreed. Yet, 
Heymann was neither the first nor the last to leave her service. A week before 
he left, Reno's aide in charge of scheduling and correspondence departed. Other 
aides have also moved on. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of staffing the Justice Department remains one Reno repeatedly 
laments. But it is partly one of her own making. Reno keeps a skeletal staff 
and refuses to appoint a chief of staff on the ground that, as she says, "I 
don't think attorneys general should have gate keepers." This, however, may 
have only contributed to her problems of getting control of and setting 
priorities for the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems with the department's operation may run deeper than recruiting and 
retaining key personnel. Before becoming head of the Justice Department, Reno 
served as top prosecutor of Dade County, Fla. There, she oversaw 900 attorneys 
and other personnel. By contrast, Reno now runs a bureaucracy more than 100 
times as large. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, Reno came into office under hardly the best of circumstances. 
Clinton's first two nominees, Zoe Baird and Kimba M. Wood, were forced to 
withdraw after a public uproar over their having hired undocumented household 
workers and failing to properly pay taxes for their employees. Reno's 
appointment was thus welcomed inside and outside the department. And her public 
persona won almost immediate adoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the nagging question remains whether Reno jumped too far out of 
her league. Is she capable of developing the administrative competence to set 
priorities, to recruit and retain team players and to provide the kind of 
leadership needed at the Justice Department?*

THE WORLD; CREATING A NEW ARCHITECTURAL VOCABULARY FOR A DEMOCRATIC BERLIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Z. Wise, Michael Z. Wise covered Central Europe for Reuters news 
agency. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Modern German cities, lamented the author of "Mein Kampf," lack monumental 
architecture and potent symbols of national identity. Adolf Hitler sought to 
remedy this by transforming Berlin into "Ger mania," a capital worthy of his 
Thousand Year Reich. Ever since he embraced Albert Speer's overblown 
classicism, massive Doric columns have evoked fears of blood-spattered tyrants. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, both Germanies spent four decades studiously downplaying 
architectural grandeur. In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl occupies squat offices 
humbly dubbed the Chancellor's Bungalow. The Parliament building in the 
provisional Rhineland capital was designed with equal restraint. The work of 
German architect Guenter Behnisch, this low-rise modernist pavilion contains 
much transparent glass to express government openness and accessibility. A 
circular plenary chamber was devised to avoid any trace of hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vote to move the Bundestag and 10 of the Federal Republic's 18 
ministries to Berlin by the year 2000 has rendered the building obsolete. The 
decision also sent Germans back to the drawing board in a public debate about 
"democratic architecture" and what is appropriate for a unified country of 80 
million still hesitant about displaying its might on the world stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Redesign of Germany's once-and-future capital is an undertaking on the order 
of Pierre-Charles L'Enfant's conception for Washington, or Baron Georges-Eugene 
Haussmann's transformation of Paris. Other new capitals have been erected in 
this century -- Brasilia, New Delhi, Ankara and Canberra are some examples -- 
but never has an endeavor of this kind been carried out with such anxiety about 
architectural symbolism. Because the official architecture of unified Berlin 
will represent the German state, authorities are grappling to find a design 
vocabulary that turns its back on the monumentality typical of their country's 
most worrisome periods. 
</P>
<P>
 The perversion of the classical ideal by both Hitler and Josef Stalin calls 
into question facile connections between architectural style and political 
beliefs. Still, architecture offers important clues about how state power is 
exercised. Government buildings amount to billboard images of national 
self-understanding. Since before the Acropolis in Athens, architecture has 
given voice to a society's deepest values, methods of governance and the manner 
in which its members relate to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin will not be rebuilt from scratch but gaps in its war-torn terrain 
contain plenty of minefields for a country acutely aware of the ideological 
implications of architecture and urban planning. The triumph of capitalism will 
take form when the no-man's land formerly occupied by the Berlin Wall is 
replaced by a vast Potsdamer Platz -- with office towers for Daimler-Benz and 
Sony. Along Unter den Linden Boulevard in the city center, there have been 
serious calls -- and strong objections -- to resurrect the palace of the 
Hohenzollern emperors, which was razed by the communists. A plan to demolish 
the defunct German Democratic Republic's ugly glass-box Parliament has outraged 
many East Germans -- some nostalgic for old times and others concerned that, 
once again, the past is being erased. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians vow there will be no revival of the grandiose spirit of old 
Prussian ministries, Bismarckian pomposity or Speer's megalomania. But at the 
same time, there is a desire for structures deemed worthy of a cosmopolitan 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 While the splendid centers of most European capitals were ordered up by 
powerful leaders, Germany today is reinventing Berlin by holding scores of 
architectural competitions, open to architects from around the world.  
</P>
<P>
 Practically every architect of international stature has vied for the bonanza 
of public and private projects -- including Renzo Piano, Peter Eisenman, Philip 
Johnson, Rafael Moneo, Helmut Jahn and Richard Rogers. German architects are 
also playing a role, but enlisting stars from abroad is one way of 
demonstrating openness to outside ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the architectural equivalent of a G-7 summit, the government invited 
proposals from the United States, Europe and Japan to turn Germany's most 
famous building, the century-old Reichstag -- torched in a 1933 fire that 
Hitler used as a pretext to impose emergency rule -- into the new seat of the 
Bundestag. Sir Norman Foster of Britain won with a plan to retrofit the scarred 
hulk with a forward-looking legislative chamber in his high-tech machine 
aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is all the inherent symbolism of what that building stands for and the 
need to make manifest from the outside that something new and different has 
happened inside," Foster says of the neo-Renaissance building. Glass elevators, 
glass roofing and translucent floors will flood the setting of Germany's 
darkest hours with light. Construction is to begin next year -- after the 
artist Christo wraps the Reichstag in 1 million square feet of silver fabric to 
herald the capital's epochal transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shunted off to the side of the capital under both kaiser and Fuehrer, the 
Reichstag has been accorded pride of place in the master plan for the future 
nexus of German power -- a 150-acre site known as the Spreebogen. In addition 
to Foster's refurbished Parliament and nearby offices for the 650 deputies, 
this area will house the new headquarters of the first chancellor since Hitler 
to govern from Berlin. More than 830 entries from 48 countries were submitted 
in the Spreebogen competition, judged by German politicians and foreign 
architects including Richard Meier and Karen Van Lengen -- both responsible for 
major construction projects in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The past weighed heavily on the selection process, particularly since the 
Spreebogen was where Speer envisioned a vast north-south axis with a soaring 
Volkshalle to accommodate 180,000 people. In another effort to banish the past, 
only schemes with an east-west axis were seriously considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Most politicians gravitated toward a low-key, decentralized design recalling 
Bonn's muted arrangement because they were "nervous about taking a stand" on a 
clear embodiment of state power, lest the wrong signals be sent, according to 
Van Lengen. "They wanted to say, 'We're just this little country in Europe,' " 
she says. "They're very sensitive about it because they know the world is 
watching them." The foreign architects preferred a more cohesive solution and 
swayed deliberations by the jury, whose official members included Bundestag 
President Rita Suessmuth, Kohl's chief of staff Friedrich Bohl and Berlin Mayor 
Eberhard Diepgen. 
</P>
<P>
 After two weeks of intense debate, the jury settled on a design by Berliner 
Axel Schultes, pronouncing it "a bold representation of the democratic state." 
Schultes knits together the long-divided city with a mall-like scheme, 
punctuated by open courts and gardens. His master plan involves no designs of 
individual buildings, leaving these to be determined by subsequent 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin will not be rebuilt in a day. With the transfer from Bonn estimated to 
cost $11 billion, construction of the new government seat could drag on for 
decades. Official German architecture will surely mutate in that time, to 
reflect fluctuations in the national self-image. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of modernism -- Berlin was one of its flash points before the 
Nazis sent the Bauhaus design school into exile -- has shown the delusion of 
putting too much stock in design as an influence of political behavior. 
Nonetheless, state buildings are key symbols of the national consciousness. How 
Germany meets the challenge of architectural representation merits attention 
from all democratic societies that aspire to give concrete form to their 
highest ideals.*

ANOTHER HARD KNOCK FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES; CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA M. LAUFER, Claudia M. Laufer is a journalism student at Santa Monica 
College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Declining budgets and rising enrollments may soon force California's community 
colleges to shortchange their students' education. The Commission on 
Innovation, established by the colleges' Board of Governors to deal with the 
flood of students, has proposed that the colleges seriously consider offering 
more "distance-learning" courses to keep pace with enrollment. And the board 
has helped clear the way for such courses by, in effect, relaxing the academic 
standards governing them. Unless this momentum toward distance-learning is 
snapped, community-college students may be denied the opportunity to interact 
with a teacher in any meaningful way. 
</P>
<P>
 The "ancient" form of distance-learning was known as correspondence courses. 
Then in the late '60s, the general manager of KABC-TV and 18 colleges developed 
an education program that was broadcast via television. It mainly targeted 
students who lived in rural communities separated from the nearest school by an 
hour or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 42 community colleges in California offer some form of 
distance-learning for selected courses. Credit for these courses must be 
transferable to the university or state university systems, an important 
requirement to ensure their academic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why the Board of Governors' decision to add non-transferable courses 
to the distance-learning curriculum is so worrisome: A check against cheating 
has been removed. But this approach to learning has other drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common form of distance-learning is a videotaped series of lectures. 
Students take the tapes home and follow the study guides that accompany them. 
Once a week, they either meet with an instructor to ask questions or call one 
to get more information. 
</P>
<P>
 This system works well for older, employed and self-motivated students. But 
what about younger students who just graduated from high school and lacks the 
discipline to complete course work without a teacher's constant supervision? 
</P>
<P>
 Another form of distance-learning broadcasts a professor's classroom lecture 
to non-campus settings, which allows a teacher to reach a larger number of 
students. Questions from these students are either answered directly by the 
teacher via telephone or by a tutor present at the locations. But how is a 
single teacher going to field questions from potentially 500 students in one 
hour? Students lucky enough to have tutors within talking distance risk missing 
out on portions of the lecture (no interruptions permitted) because they want 
to ask a question. This is hardly an atmosphere conducive to learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, community-college students can still choose between a traditional 
teacher-student class or its high-tech version. But should distance-learning 
become the system's main response to budget reductions, they may soon be forced 
to watch a videotape. For the majority of students, the community-college 
mission -- preparation for a four-year university -- would be imperiled.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; STUART SPENCER; FROM NIXON THROUGH REAGAN -- THE 
CALIFORNIA POLITICAL CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt is a producer for Fox 11 News and a 
contributor to National Public Radio's All Things Considered and Morning 
Edition. He spoke with Stuart K. Spencer at Spencer's home in Palm Desert, 
Calif. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Politics is never a science," Stu Spencer likes to say. "It's always an art." 
</P>
<P>
 While Richard M. Nixon -- the first Californian elected President -- is 
credited with bringing the state into the political mainstream, it was Stuart 
K. Spencer who developed the modern California political campaign style, made 
it into an art form and exported it nationwide. As the dean of Western 
political consultants, Spencer helped make Ronald Reagan look engaged and 
informed, Gerald R. Ford appear deft and agile, and Nelson A. Rockefeller seem 
like just one of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Alhambra, Spencer, 67, worked his first campaign as a volunteer for 
Gov. Earl Warren's reelection in 1950. By 1960, he decided to go professional 
and, with partner Bill Roberts, formed a full-service political-consulting firm 
-- the model for dozens of campaign-management-for-hire companies. 
Spencer-Roberts, working for Rockefeller, came within a few thousand votes of 
defeating Barry M. Goldwater in the 1964 California GOP presidential primary. 
Goldwater was so impressed he recommended the team to Reagan when the actor 
decided to run for governor. Spencer-Roberts helped Reagan win in 1966 and 
again in 1970 -- using a sophisticated and expensive media-driven campaign for 
the sometimes less-than-precise stump style of their candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 1976 found Reagan facing President Ford in the primary, and found Spencer 
working for Ford. Ford emerged as the GOP nominee, but was trailing his 
opponent, Jimmy Carter, by more than 30 points. With Spencer managing the 
general-election campaign, Ford closed the gap -- Carter won by just two 
points. Four years later, Spencer-for-hire was back in the Reagan camp, and 
served as a trusted adviser to President Reagan through both his terms. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Spencer had the unenviable task of being vice-presidential candidate 
Dan Quayle's handler -- he's credited with quashing attempts to drop Quayle 
from the ticket and with devising strategies that helped minimize Quayle's 
proclivity toward gaffes. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer is now semi-retired, living with his wife, Barbara, in Palm Desert, 
"handling a few commercial clients and playing a lot of golf." His daughter, 
Karen, works as a political consultant. On the day Nixon was buried in Yorba 
Linda, Spencer talked about the man who inspired his interest in politics, and 
the role of Californians in the national GOP and the political life of the 
nation.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You once talked about Ronald Reagan as being a one-of-a-kind 
President -- how there was Reagan, and then there was everybody else. What 
about Richard Nixon?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: He was a good politician. I've always maintained that he would have 
been a better manager than a candidate. He thought a lot about the campaign -- 
what you had to do to get from here to there, all the tactics. He was very good 
at those things, and many candidates don't even think about them, or concern 
themselves with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between Reagan and Nixon is that Nixon had to work for 
everything he got, and he really had to work hard. He was a 24-hour-a-day 
politician, from day one. Ronald Reagan was more of a natural. He had another 
career as an actor. He was by far the superior candidate in terms of his 
ability to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nixon had this tremendous work ethic. There was no quit in him. And, of 
course, he had a brilliance in the area of foreign affairs. That was his pet, 
that was what he liked, that was what he spent most of his time thinking about, 
and he did quite well in that area. And when it came to campaigning, he was 
fully involved, and he worked hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you remember about his early career as a young California 
Republican?  
</P>
<P>
 A: After World War II, there were all these veterans who got involved in the 
political process -- many of them Republicans -- and Nixon was definitely the 
leader of that group. His work in the Senate -- his being chosen as vice 
president -- meant we had a whole decade, or two decades, of young California 
Republicans who learned everything they knew in the Nixon school of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You tell a story about listening to the Nixon-Kennedy debates while driving 
in your VW bug, and thinking Nixon had won. How did that open your eyes to the 
power of television in political campaigns?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Going into the debate, Nixon was considered -- and was -- an excellent 
debater: good on his feet, quick, knew how to make his point. And Kennedy 
didn't have near the experience in this arena that Nixon had. But when you saw 
them on the tube, it wasn't what they were saying, it was what they looked 
like. So listening on the radio, I thought Nixon won. But everybody who saw it 
figured Kennedy was the winner. It was basically two things -- body language 
and looks. 
</P>
<P>
 That was my first lesson about how powerful the medium was and how it has to 
be handled very carefully. Makeup, posture, all those cosmetic things are 
really important when you are on TV. So we started finding people who were on 
the cutting edge of television. We kept those people around, talking about new 
techniques, new ways to use the tube. Then with Ronald Reagan -- he knew how to 
massage television -- nobody had to tell him anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What, if anything, is unique about California Republicans? And how have 
they contributed to the GOP as a whole?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The second question is easy. Just think of California as a nation. We are 
the sixth or seventh biggest economic power in the world. We have diversity, 
ethnically and politically. What other state would have elected Ronald Reagan 
governor for eight years, and then elect Jerry Brown? That's diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Every governor since Earl Warren has been somehow considered as a presidential 
or vice-presidential candidate. California is a big ingredient in the political 
recipe when you are running for President of the United States. So our 
politicians are players on the national scene -- they're consulted and 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement of the (presidential) primary -- up to March from June -- will 
affect the nominating process in both parties. We haven't played a big role in 
that process in the past. You're going to see more candidates here, more often. 
So that makes the state more important than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But what about the idea of the uniqueness of California Republicans?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, that's vastly overplayed. California is a good reflection of the entire 
country. We have agriculture here, ethnic minorities, big cities -- we have 
everything here. If you continue to think of it as a nation, it's many states 
-- you've got the Central Valley, the Southern Periphery -- that's everything 
outside of Los Angeles County -- and the Bay Area. Each one of those can 
require a different campaign. And California is a media state. Just like 
everywhere else, you've got to be on television to make your case. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Speaking of television, you've said Reagan was the perfect candidate for 
the "media state." Tell me how you created his image -- the citizen-politician. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A: After eight years of Pat Brown, there was a sense that people wanted 
change. Reagan had no political experience and we needed to make him 
believable, so people could see him making the transition from citizen to 
governor. That was the theme we stuck to in that campaign, because the big 
question was, "Does he know anything about governing?" He had to get past that 
point before he could even be considered as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You're credited with developing a lot of scientific techniques and applying 
them to campaigning -- use of data bases and computers, new polling techniques. 
Yet, you always stress that campaigning is art, not science.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. You have to master the modern techniques, but those are not the things 
that always help you make the decision to go left, right, north or south in a 
campaign. The art comes in making decisions about what your issues will be, and 
what your basic strategies will be. You can't just sit back, read polling data 
and say, "We gotta be for this, we gotta be for that." People change overnight. 
The best candidates I've ever seen are people who have a firm belief in 
something. That's what you have to work off, and it's an instinctive business. 
You've got to have those political instincts, and that's what makes it an art 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Jim Baker claims you mapped out the entire 1976 Ford campaign on a 
matchbook. Is that true?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They rib me all the time -- I'm not a paper person. In essence, he's right, 
but it wasn't a matchbook, it was a few scraps of paper. The point is, it's not 
all that complicated, plus you don't need all that paper floating around out 
there when you're involved in a presidential campaign in a city like 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've always avoided Washington. You've turned down jobs in government, 
you go to the city, do your job and get out. What is it about that town?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I enjoy Washington; it's a fascinating town. But I do not want to be 
involved in the day-to-day machinations of the city, which, to a great degree, 
are phony. They worry about things there that the rest of the country doesn't 
even think about. Whatever the Washington Post says that morning is the topic 
of the day, and I don't see what's in the Washington Post that morning in any 
other paper in America. So you can quickly lose touch with what's going on in 
the country. I tell all my younger peers, "When you get your job done, get out 
of town, go back to where you came from and keep your roots." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: OK, let's talk about California then. In 1989, you made a now-famous 
comment to Pete Wilson -- advising him to stay in the Senate, because 
California's problems were so overwhelming no one could govern it. Just last 
year, Gov. Wilson seemed to have little chance of reelection, but these days 
his boat's floating a little higher in the water. Are you willing to amend your 
assessment?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's still a tough state to govern, and I think Pete Wilson has done a hell 
of a job under tough circumstances. He's a man of tremendous tenacity -- he's a 
fighter. Luckily, the economy is getting better. Plus, he's isolated a few 
themes -- crime and immigration -- which are very front-burner issues with the 
people of California. He's taking strong stands on those issues, and that helps 
him in terms of his perception as a leader. I think last year was more crucial 
for him than 1994. He could have lost the governorship in 1993 -- couldn't have 
won it, but could have lost it. But he stayed alive, he fought and he stayed in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in itself, is a victory. If he's reelected, he will become a very big 
player on the national scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Dan Quayle is beginning a new offensive -- writing a book and now giving 
interviews and showing up on TV. What's his political future?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think it's good at all. I think his future is in Indiana. I think 
he could run for anything in Indiana, and win. But I don't like his chances for 
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the state of the GOP?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think both parties are weaker than they have been in years because of the 
ability of candidates to go around them, by using the media. But I think in 
terms of basic, physical conservatism, and what people expect from the 
Republican Party, I think it's pretty stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As former President Nixon is laid to rest, what personal thoughts do you 
have?  
</P>
<P>
 A: He got me interested in politics. He encouraged me to get involved in the 
process. He and his people introduced me to a profession that is probably one 
of the only things I was ever good at in my life. So speaking from a personal 
level, I have him to thank for that -- for giving me a career.*

MAYOR RIORDAN'S BUDGET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is naive to think that Mayor Richard Riordan's plan to add 450 police (or 
any number of police for that matter) will help reduce crime in Los Angeles 
("Riordan's Budget Expands Services, Adds 450 Police," April 21). These police 
are much more likely to stop "safe-looking" guys like me for a minor traffic 
infraction than actually seek out criminals or get gang members off the 
streets. If I were a police officer, I'd probably do the same.  
</P>
<P>
 Until our society re-establishes a sense of right and wrong in our citizens, 
and punishment is severe enough to deter crime, no amount of police on the 
streets will help. Of course one thing Mayor Riordan does realize is that more 
cops giving out more traffic citations to guys in suits and ties will generate 
more revenues for the city! 
</P>

 * I voted for Riordan in the belief that we needed a businessman, not a 
politician, to "turn L.A. around." So far, I have been impressed with his 
performance, and believe that his election is the best thing that has happened 
in Los Angeles for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
 But, I'm getting nervous. When the almighty Times, the self-ordained advocate 
of every new tax-and-spend proposal ever imagined, deigned to issue the mayor 
even a backhanded compliment ("A Promising Budget of Measured Steps," 
editorial, April 22), I reached for my wallet to make sure it was still there. 
</P>
<P>
 How could a good Republican mayor merit even a few words of praise from The 
Times? It is definitely cause for concern. I hope the mayor is not becoming a 
politician, or even worse, a Democrat.

 * So the mayor wants more parking tickets (April 23)! Let him start with 
Washington Boulevard. During the time the Santa Monica Freeway was down I drove 
the section of Washington between Western and Fairfax. The street is clearly 
marked "no parking" between the hours of 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on the north side, 
i.e., the westbound side. 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly didn't stop anyone from parking who wanted to get something 
from the liquor store, or just park for whatever reason. I saw a number of 
parking control people standing in groups conversing. Never did I see any 
tickets on any of the illegally parked cars.

<P>
 * Anyone who has driven in Los Angeles for any number of years knows that 
flagrant violation of traffic laws has become the norm: mid-intersection 
U-turns, running red lights, turning from the wrong lane, blocking 
intersections -- you name it. There are simply not enough police available (or 
willing) to write traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 This takes a terrible toll on society: increased stress, sometimes inducing 
violent reaction; increased insurance rates due to accidents; increased 
incentive toward general lawlessness, and lost revenue from unassessed traffic 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not hire contract traffic officers and increase the amounts of traffic 
fines to a hefty level? Based on my observations, the $9-million forecast from 
increased parking tickets would be a drop in the bucket compared to the revenue 
such a program would generate. 
</P>

<P>
 * The financial mismanagement of this city never ceases to amaze me. Will a 
real accountant please stand up. Riordan and the rest of his clan preach 
ridership, car-pooling, clean air, etc. Yet now they want to increase bus fares 
and decrease bus lines (April 24). The MTA says don't blame us, we have not 
raised fares in six years. It has nothing to do with financial management. I 
guess the $126-million debt occurred overnight, because none of us saw it 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparatively, our transportation system leaves a lot to be desired. There are 
over a million people in this city who rely on bus service every day who cannot 
afford a higher fare and have no other means of transportation. As usual, our 
local government wants to take from the poor to correct its mistakes. The 
problem is that most people don't have more to give.

 * I used to think that I was terribly deprived because I was not in that 
tavern having an ale when Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Monroe would stop 
in and discuss our business.

 * As a child growing up in South Africa of the 1960s I used to dream of living 
in a "magical" place far from the senseless violence and madness, and far less 
dusty. Ironically, I now live on a smog-infested, dusty piece of reclaimed 
desert surrounded by mounting violence and madness -- right down the road from 
the Magic Kingdom -- and I watch "magic" events unfolding on TV in the land of 
my birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost unbelievably, a handful of extremely courageous people have achieved 
the impossible in negotiating a peaceful revolution, and with minimum 
bloodshed, against all odds. Obviously even one life lost to violence is one 
too many; nevertheless given the potential powder keg that more than 40 million 
South Africans have been sitting atop for the last 40 years, it is amazing that 
a democratic election took place, rather than a bloody civil war, and it is 
even more amazing that leadership was able to prevent a military or police 
force coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly Nelson Mandela and Frederik W. de Klerk have earned their Nobel prizes 
-- and a unique place in world history. More power to the nation as it now 
rebuilds and prepares for its destiny as the engine that will propel the 
sub-Saharan African region into the 21st Century.

EDDIE MORIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I want to add several comments about Eddie Morin, featured in George Ramos' 
column ("In War, They Don't Ask What Race You Are," April 18): I am a 
schoolteacher who has known Eddie for the last 13 years. I met him when I asked 
him to paint a slogan on a wall, so that my sixth-grade students could read it 
whenever they wished.Although it was a small job, his enthusiasm was readily 
felt: He was more than happy to do what he could because he believed in 
children and supported their education. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Eddie has applied his skilled hands and thoughtful creativity 
to a variety of school surfaces in East Los Angeles and Sunland/Tujunga. His 
murals vibrate on the walls of schools: Their names are Evergreen, Harrison, 
Lorena, Fourth Street, Sunland and Brainard. And because his work has always 
been accomplished with the same joy of contribution he first demonstrated, his 
images are rich and inspiring.  
</P>
<P>
 I have also had the privilege of hearing him say, "It is for the children that 
I am doing this." So it comes as no surprise when he speaks similar words about 
the Bakersfield soldier. This is the Eddie I know and admire. And this is the 
Eddie that children will gasp over and talk about, when they see his work in 
classrooms and libraries and outside walls, although few will ever know his 
name.

NIXON'S RETURN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Living across from Yorba Linda in the hills above Anaheim Hills, I 
experienced quite a phenomenon last Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching the arrival of Richard Nixon's casket, along with his family on 
television at El Toro, I followed its route to Yorba Linda and along with it 
was quite a downpour. While it wasn't even raining here, all afternoon the eye 
of the storm, with hail, lightning and thunder, seemed to be right over Yorba 
Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't help but feel that President Nixon was letting his presence be 
known and giving us his one last speech. 
</P>
<P>
 We will miss him. May he rest in peace.

HELP WITH CHILD SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Elizabeth Shogren's article about Parents' Fair Share (April 17) is a good 
piece of reporting about a very worthwhile project aimed at tackling one part 
of the enormous problem of child support enforcement. Unfortunately, the 
account lacked one critical piece of information of value to your local 
readers: Nowhere in the article is it mentioned that the program is operating 
in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 11, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, together with County Board of 
Supervisors Chair Yvonne Burke and representatives of participating state and 
local agencies, announced the inauguration of the 10th Parents' Fair Share 
demonstration site in Los Angeles. This is important in that it is the first 
such effort to be undertaken in the heart of a major urban area. More than 
that, Parents' Fair Share offers hope not only to the non-custodial parents it 
is designed to serve directly but also to their families on welfare, who will 
benefit economically from the program's success. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney worked hard to bring Parents' Fair Share to Los Angeles 
for one simple reason: Child support enforcement is one of his highest 
priorities. The number of cases handled by the Bureau of Family Support will 
soon number 600,000 and continues to grow. The direct and immediate effects of 
this crisis for the children who are left impoverished by it is cause enough 
for concern; the long-term social and economic implications for society in 
general are staggering. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Garcetti is committed to tackling the problem through a 
combination of efforts designed not just to collect support more efficiently 
and effectively but to tackle the root causes of the problem. Parents' Fair 
Share is a modern example of the old aphorism, "Give a man a fish and you feed 
him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for life." In this case, by 
giving non-custodial parents a chance at job training and placement, we're 
helping them to feed their families as well.

 A normal practice for many executives while speaking on the phone is to ask 
the secretary to take notes to be able to verify just his or her end of the 
conversation, in case of a challenge concerning what was said. In no way should 
conversations be recorded without the other party knowing it.Even on 
speakerphones, people I've worked for have always told the other party who was 
in the office with them. 
</P>
<P>
 I have on occasion taken notes of my employer's side of the conversation 
because the employer was dealing with someone who might come back and say, "You 
never said that," for instance in a grievance issue. Even this has only 
happened a few times, and I've been a secretary for 25 years in schools, law 
firms and now the union.

PERSPECTIVES ON TELEPHONE MONITORING; PRIVACY IS VERY DIFFERENT IN THE 
ELECTRONIC AGE 
</P>

<P>
 In the post-Watergate era of omnipresent speakerphones, tape recorders and 
other electronic doodads, it is difficult to imagine anyone being surprised to 
learn that a big-city mayor takes precautions to assure that he is quoted 
accurately and that he has a record of what others have said to him.  
</P>
<P>
 It is almost certain that many politicians, executives and other public 
figures monitor their calls in one way or another.Now that the word is out, 
anyone who calls such people should be on notice that they do not have the 
usual deniability that has long been assumed to exist for informal telephone 
discussions. The current rules of the game are: Don't say it if you don't mean 
it, don't promise it if you can't deliver it and figure out some way of 
monitoring your side of the conversation.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor is the phone the only means of communication that has lost its status as 
confidential. Electronic mail, faxes, computer modems and face-to-face 
conversation all are subject to easy surveillance. And the courts have been of 
little help. The only means of communication that seem to have retained their 
sanctity are the religious confessional (certainly not the psychological 
consultation, witness the Menendez case) and the handwritten, sealed letter.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the time has come for all of us to dig our fountain pens and our old 
stationery out of storage and start writing more letters to each other. The 
most confidential means of communication may be the most old-fashioned.

 There are three words to describe engaging in either a business or private 
conversation with another who is not informed that the conversation is being 
listened to by a third party: wrong, sad and dumb. It was wrong when President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt conducted some office visits with officials and guests 
while a secretary sat below in the basement taking notes, just as it was when 
President Richard Nixon had Oval Office conversations secretly taped. 
</P>
<P>
 It is wrong because such activities have contributed to the general and 
widespread distrust of government, politicians and business that has so damaged 
this nation and its capacity to deal with our numerous problems. Just this 
consequence alone renders an explanation of "efficiency" irrelevant.  
</P>
<P>
 It is sad because the revelation could adversely affect -- at least 
temporarily -- the mayor's ability to lead effectively. It diverts attention 
from the severe problems of Los Angeles and results in debates and political 
exchanges on matters other than those more directly affecting the people of Los 
Angeles. It also has cast a cloud on future frank conversations.  
</P>
<P>
 It is dumb because if Riordan felt such a practice was necessary, all he had 
to do was consistently inform the caller -- a far better choice than having 
callers read about it in the Los Angeles Times.

PERSPECTIVES ON TELEPHONE MONITORING; THE MAYOR (AND STAFF ) CALLING . . . ; 
HAVING A SECRETARY LISTEN IN ISN'T THE PROBLEM; IT'S NOT TELLING THE OTHER

 What is really so objectionable about Mayor Richard Riordan having a secretary 
surreptitiously monitor his telephone conversations and take notes of them? The 
mayor makes and receives dozens of calls a day. If he promises to look into 
something or to take action, notes of the conversation are essential as a 
reminder.Especially when using a car phone, the mayor may not be in a position 
to take his own notes. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, however, is objecting to the mayor having a secretary listen in on the 
calls. Rather, the outrage is over his failure to disclose that someone else is 
listening. 
</P>
<P>
 A telephone conversation, unlike say a memo, has an expectation of privacy. 
This is why California law, like that in every state, prohibits the undisclosed 
electronic recording of a conversation. People might speak differently if they 
know that someone else is on the line or that a tape is being made. This may be 
a large part of why the mayor has not routinely disclosed to the other party 
that a secretary was listening. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's desire for written notes of conversations is understandable and 
laudable. But if he is going to do this by having someone else on the line, he 
should tell the other party to the conversation in advance.

COLUMN LEFT/ HARRY BERNSTEIN: TRUCKERS FEEL THE BURN OF DEREGULATION; 
UNFETTERED COMPETITION HELPS SOME FIRMS, BUT WORKERS PAY THE PRICE IN LOST 
WAGES, BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN, Harry Bernstein was for many years The Times' labor writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conservatives and even some liberals are increasingly trying to peddle the 
muddled theory that cutthroat competition in a market economy is great for 
everyone, everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't true even in America, where most often it is the average worker who 
gets bashed by unlimited competition while corporations increase their profits. 
</P>
<P>
 A particularly grievous example is the trucking industry, just ending a bitter 
Teamsters union strike. Despite the destructive battle with the trucking firms, 
the union won some gains in a strike that stemmed largely from the impact of 
President Jimmy Carter's misguided push for deregulation of the industry in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1935, when regulation began, until it was killed 44 years later, shipping 
rates, routes and entry into the trucking industry were controlled by the 
Interstate Commerce Commission and the Department of Transportation.  
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of deregulation argued that it was true free enterprise, ignoring 
the fact that the highways used by the truckers are paid for by taxpayers, 
unlike the "highways" used by trains, since tracks are financed by railroad 
companies.  
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of trucking firms went bankrupt after 1979, and thousands of others 
that entered the industry were forced to cut costs wherever possible, mostly by 
taking income away from their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Truckers began competing for business by hiring non-union workers willing to 
accept low wages, few benefits and few on-the-job work rules to protect them 
from abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Deregulation was the battle cry of the Reagan Administration; many other 
industries, including airlines, were affected. But it was Carter, a Democrat, 
representing a party traditionally viewed as a friend of workers, who started 
trucking deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been a mess, especially for drivers. A 1990 study published by 
the Economic Policy Institute showed that truckers' wages plummeted by 27%, or 
$6,700, from 1978 to 1990, and they are still dropping. The Teamsters' 
membership dropped drastically, but the union protected remaining drivers from 
the worst hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, by Michael Belzer of Cornell University, found that union drivers 
in 1990 were averaging about $41,000 a year, compared with $26,912 for the 
non-union workers. That differential in wages -- and even more in benefits -- 
was the fundamental cause of the latest strike. Unionized carriers said they 
could not compete with the non-union wages and work rules permitted under 
deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 When the industry was regulated, wages weren't bad, profits were pretty good 
and shipping rates were not inordinately high. With deregulation, thousands of 
profitable trucking firms went bankrupt while thousands more replaced them, 
often small firms whose trucks were owned and operated by drivers willing to 
put in long hours for little pay and heavy debt on their rigs. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 900,000 trucking-industry workers before deregulation; about 50% 
were union members. Now there are an estimated 1.4 million, with only 20% union 
members. Non-union workers are struggling for jobs by offering their services 
for lower wages and benefits and longer hours -- often supported by drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 When Congress gave most workers protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act 
in the 1935, it decided that trucking workers didn't need minimum-wage and 
-hour laws because most of truckers had better protections under their union 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the growth of the non-union sector, truckers need to be included 
under the labor-standards law that requires employers to limit hours of work 
and pay extra for overtime and offers other forms of protection from abusive 
employers.  
</P>
<P>
 The cutthroat competition that has impoverished workers helps explain why the 
rich keep gaining and the poor keep losing. One pertinent point: While the 
average worker's real wage adjusted for inflation declined 12.6% from 1979 
through 1993, the rich didn't suffer. While the CEOs at America's 200 largest 
companies made 40 times the pay of the average worker in l975, now the top 
execs' pay is 157 times that of the average worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Free-marketeers argue that unencumbered competition results in substantial 
savings for shippers and thus for consumers. But most of the money saved was 
pocketed by shippers and manufacturers. And the savings, some due to increased 
efficiency because of ruthless competition, apparently came mostly from the 
pockets of hundreds of thousands of workers who once held jobs with decent 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The unfettered free market may work in some industries, but it has surely 
failed badly in others, such as trucking.

THE STATE; UFW MUST MARCH TO THE BEAT OF A NEW GENERATION 
</P>

 Last weekend, under a cloudy Sacramento sky, thousands of supporters of the 
United Farm Workers union completed a 24-day pilgrimage through the San Joaquin 
Valley with a rally at the Capitol. The march, ripe with historical symbolism, 
aspired as much to pay homage to the past as to secure a new future for a union 
that has seen better days. In an old grainy videotape of the original UFW march 
in the spring, 1966 -- the one led by the late Cesar Chavez -- the sound of 
Spanish corridos is haunting. " Hasta Saa . . . craa . . . menn . . . too . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican Americans will never be completely free from the memory of a harsher 
summer. My Mexican grandfather would marvel at my soft hands, hands that have 
thankfully never picked grapes or cotton or any of the crops that my ancestors 
picked for generations under hideous conditions. Although spared by my parents' 
decree that their children would look forward, not backward, I grew up hearing 
the stories. No collective bargaining or minimum wage. " Six cents a tray for 
grapes; I'd make five or six bucks a day. " No health insurance or workers' 
compensation. No toilets in the fields. No sanitary drinking water. In essence, 
no dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was a thirst for dignity that gave birth to the UFW some 30 years ago. 
Their demands were simple, and pure. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy used to say that 
Chavez and his union wanted only for America to be "better" in its protection 
of farm workers, that it was a simple request -- and a frightening one. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it was in that same spirit -- a desire to make an ailing UFW "better" -- 
that critics had, for years, questioned Chavez's leadership. Some had argued 
that Chavez and the union, through their obsession with the table-grape 
boycott, were making enemies, not progress. Others had suggested that UFW 
officials had abandoned the farm worker in whose name they collected hefty 
checks from white liberals in the Northeast. And others, while acknowledging 
the UFW's accomplishments, had challenged the modern-day relevance of the union 
and its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, life has a wicked sense of humor. Arturo Rodriguez, who succeeded 
Chavez as UFW president, had always been a loyal soldier. As union vice 
president, he followed Chavez's battle plan to the letter. Now, liberated by 
his commander's death, the soldier is doing things differently. Earlier this 
month, with a mouthful of crow, Rodriguez called a press conference to announce 
that the new march represented a shift in strategy away from the grape boycott, 
an effort to increase membership and a symbolic return to the union's 
grass-roots work of organizing farm workers -- all in an attempt to make the 
UFW relevant again. 
</P>
<P>
 Half-way through the march, destiny came full circle as the marchers passed 
through my hometown. Middle-aged Mexican American professionals left their 
homes to join the procession, to wave red flags emblazoned with black eagles 
and do penance for abandoning the UFW in the years when they were needed most. 
Outside the same old church where my parents were married, a group of young 
people stared curiously at the marchers who were attending mass. Mexican 
Americans, they were dressed in familiar cholo garb. I asked them if they were 
there to support the UFW. They made a face and shook their heads. They were 
just waiting, they said, for a ride. Oblivious to the march and the reasons for 
it, they explained that they were taking a field trip to an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 If UFW supporters are serious about restoring the union's luster, they must 
pitch la causa to a new generation of Mexican Americans who have grown up far 
removed from the indignity of our grandfather's memory and the sweat-filled 
fields of summers past. They must admit past mistakes and learn from criticism. 
They must concede the limits of the union's contemporary appeal and work to 
broaden it. And, they must finally put to rest the spirit of their dead leader 
and learn to think for themselves again. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the church, morning was fading. "Where are they?" one of the 
teen-agers asked, still waiting for their ride. Across the street, the marchers 
gathered to continue on to Sacramento. "Yeah," another one chimed in. "We'll 
never make the park by noon."*

MOVIES; IT'S BEEN SO ENTERTAINING; THESE DAYS, WHEN THERE ARE MORE MGM STARS IN 
HEAVEN THAN ON EARTH, THERE IS STILL GENE KELLY, WHO IS QUITE HAPPY TO DEBUNK 
SOME OF THE MYTHS OF THE STUDIO'S GOLDEN AGE, MUCH AS 'THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! 
III' DOES

 If Gene Kelly had any weakness for sentiment, you might expect to find it 
here, in the massive Craftsman-style home on Rodeo Drive he has owned, well, as 
long as he can remember. Ten years ago it burned to the ground while Kelly and 
his three college-age children stood on the lawn and watched the flames reduce 
a career's worth of artifacts and memorabilia, including his one and only 
Oscar, to ash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I lost it all," says Kelly, cheerfully gesturing around the spacious, 
oak-paneled living room that is, with the exception of a new marble fireplace, 
an exact replica. "I wanted to move to a smaller house," he adds, nodding at 
his wife, Pat Ward, a slender woman in her 30s whom Kelly married in 1990. 
"(Pat) would have helped me fix up a new house. But the kids cried and moaned, 
so I built it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Say this for Kelly, as a dancer, choreographer and director whose career spans 
more than half-a-century reaching back to Broadway's and Hollywood's Golden 
Age: He has managed to blend a respect for tradition and an audience's wishes 
with an iconoclast's eye for opportunity. He wasn't a rich dancer of the top 
hat and tails variety -- that was the province of the classicists, like his 
friend Fred Astaire -- but what he did was rich. In his working-man clothes and 
trademark white socks, Kelly remade dance on film from a European art form into 
an American one with his snappy paper-tearing, roller-skating, puddle-stomping 
footwork.  
</P>
<P>
 A masculine, athletic dance style he called it, offering it to his employer. 
And Hollywood returned the favor. Between 1942 and 1960, he made 34 films, 
almost all of them for MGM during the studio's heyday, and many of them -- 
"Singin' in the Rain," "On the Town," "An American in Paris" -- are among the 
best musicals ever. 
</P>
<P>
 At 81, Kelly is the oldest surviving alumnus of the studio's fabled roster of 
"more stars than there are in heaven." He doesn't dance anymore, a concession 
to a bad leg and his years, but then again, Kelly will confess that his body, 
"the dancer's instrument," wasn't what it was even in 1954 when he made 
"Brigadoon," his last great musical for MGM, when he was 43. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, it all starts to go soon enough," he says, his voice raspy, but his 
bright eyes a ticket back to the '40s. Now, in his own elegant twilight, Kelly 
is dapperly dressed in a white turtleneck, a heavy, expensive-looking navy 
cardigan and, reassuringly, pale socks. He looks as if he had just come in from 
rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his long reign as one of Hollywood's true royalty, Kelly seems 
genuinely pleased to be the subject of an interview. He is polite, even 
gallant, inquiring about his visitor's hometown and accompanying his guest to 
and from the front door. Although the phone seems to ring almost constantly, 
Kelly says most days are spent quietly at home alone with his wife, with whom 
he is working on his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't go out much," he says, "although there is a dinner tonight and in a 
couple of weeks the premiere for the film" -- "That's Entertainment! III." The 
second sequel to "That's Entertainment!," the popular 1974 anthology of MGM 
musicals, "That's Entertainment! III" will open in New York and Los Angeles 
Friday. Directed and produced by Bud Friedgen and Michael J. Sheridan, who 
edited the first two versions, the film features onscreen appearances by Kelly 
and several other MGM legends including Esther Williams, Lena Horne, Cyd 
Charisse, Debbie Reynolds, Ann Miller and Mickey Rooney recalling their years 
at the storied studio. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the oral history, the film is distinguished by a surprisingly 
puckish tone with the inclusion of several, frequently hilarious outtakes from 
such films as "Annie Get Your Gun," "Easter Parade" and "The Band Wagon." The 
film makes instructive use of split-screen images and jump-cut editing as the 
never-before-seen numbers careen from the sublime (Judy Garland in her 
signature tuxedo jacket and impossibly long legs singing "Mr. Monotony" in a 
scene cut from "Easter Parade") to the ridiculous (a family of singing 
contortionists, the Ross sisters, and an absurdly overproduced underwater 
sequence in which Esther Williams brings some Greek statues to life). 
Occasionally, the scenes border on the surreal: a split-screen comparison 
between Cyd Charisse's sinuous rendition of "Two Faced Woman" and Joan 
Crawford's disquietingly campy version -- in tropical makeup -- that was used 
in "Torch Song." 
</P>
<P>
 As "That's Entertainment! III" ably demonstrates, MGM frequently misused its 
massive talent pool -- a fact that seems to delight Kelly, whose offscreen 
response to this latest anthology is rather more roguish than his stately 
onscreen narration bookending the film. He quarrels with the film's premise -- 
"I think the best scenes have already been taken in the first one and Part 2," 
says Kelly, who directed "That's Entertainment! Part 2" in 1976. He also 
insists that only "movie buffs" will be fascinated by this fourth trip to the 
MGM well ("That's Dancing!" in 1985 also culled clips from MGM musicals), but 
he clearly relishes the film's funniest-home-video approach, which he considers 
much-needed comeuppance for the once-mighty studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "MGM never wanted to admit that any force in the world could hold them back," 
says Kelly, who spends much of the conversation debunking some of the myths, 
"canards," he calls them, about the studio's so-called Golden Age. Indeed, 
beyond his memories, a rich repository in an industry fascinated by its own 
gilt-edged beginnings, Kelly retains a certain cantankerous pride -- not for 
MGM, its fabled contract system or Louis B. Mayer, the studio's legendary, 
voluble founder -- but for the sheer doing of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no model for what I tried to do with dance," he says, slipping into 
an armchair and launching into one of several, sharply observed stories he will 
tell during the course of an hour. "And the thing Fred and I used to bitch 
about was that critics didn't know how to categorize us. They called us tap 
dancers because that was considered the American style. But neither of us were 
basically tap dancers. And people would compare us, but we didn't dance alike 
at all! Fred danced in tails -- everybody wore them before I came out here -- 
but I took off my coat, rolled up my sleeves and danced in sweatshirts and 
jeans and khakis." 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of the studio's A-list players during the second half of MGM's 
glory days, the years from 1928 to 1959 when Mayer's studio was the largest and 
most powerful in town. He arrived already a star -- from the 1941 Broadway show 
"Pal Joey" -- initially under contract with David O. Selznick and then, 
quickly, with MGM, the largest employer of musical talent in Hollywood, where 
he made his first film in 1942, "For Me and My Gal," with Judy Garland. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came out here, I thought stars were Gary Cooper or John Wayne," Kelly 
recalls. "I didn't see myself as one of them. And I had it in my contract to do 
one picture and then go back to Broadway, go back to the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 As a stage-trained song and dance man, Kelly preferred New York; Hollywood at 
the time "was just a bunch of orange groves," as he remembers it. "I didn't 
like the whole ambience of the town." It wasn't until Kelly was loaned to 
Columbia Pictures, where he starred opposite Rita Hayworth in 1944's hit "Cover 
Girl," that Kelly's film career hit what he calls "the turning point, when MGM 
said, 'Wait a minute, this guy dances with girls.' They called me back and put 
me to work with leading ladies -- Esther Williams, Kathryn Grayson -- and other 
non-dancers." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he would become one of the greatest dance partners Hollywood ever 
produced, it was the kind of studio decision-making that rankled Kelly. "One of 
the things I loved (about "That's Entertainment! III") was seeing the ladies, 
if I may use that term -- Judy, Esther, Cyd -- looking so young and talented," 
he says, "because MGM always had a thing that the studio made the pictures and 
not the creative people, that the films just sort of appeared from the Thalberg 
Building." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the era of the studio mogul, an autocracy he remembers with mixed 
feelings. "We felt Hollywood was a smaller community, although I don't know 
that it actually was the case since we made more pictures than are made today," 
he says. "But the studios were more self-contained with their own A-list and 
B-list actors, and then underneath them, the people they would keep around on 
scale. Some of those people were old silent movie stars like May McAvoy, whom I 
worshiped as a boy. MGM kept her on as an extra and I choked back a little sob 
to see what Hollywood could do to its people. No studio would even give D.W. 
Griffith a consulting job toward the end of his career and he died in poverty 
while they paid guys to just walk the halls and say, 'I've got an idea.' 
</P>
<P>
 "All the executives -- Mayer, Sam Goldwyn, Darryl Zanuck -- thought they could 
create stars, so they all pretended that everybody sang and did their own taps 
when most of the actors just faked it," says Kelly, who was routinely asked to 
dub tap-dancing sound effects. "MGM would never publicly admit that in my 
generation, but for the first time, that's acknowledged in this film." 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of MGM's relentless search to find the next Greta Garbo or 
Rita Hayworth, "but of course only the public can do that," says Kelly, 
recalling that he was forced to write a pool scene for Esther Williams in "Take 
Me Out to the Ball Game" when studio executives insisted she be in the film, 
"because they told us all baseball pictures flop and all Esther Williams' films 
are hits."  
</P>
<P>
 In another instance of MGM's heavy hand, Kelly recalls when "Mayer teamed me 
with the actress he considered the next Jean Harlow" -- Marie McDonald -- "and 
she turned out to be a triple threat who couldn't sing, dance or act. Of 
course, the picture (1947's 'Living in a Big Way') was a terrible bomb. You 
couldn't give it away with china." 
</P>
<P>
 Anecdotes notwithstanding, Kelly retains no lost love for MGM executives, 
especially Mayer. "I hated the man," he says simply. "I thought he was bizarre 
and he never liked me. Fortunately, I never dealt directly with him, and, of 
course, I made the studio money." 
</P>
<P>
 What Kelly found more to his liking were the kindred creative spirits he found 
among MGM's fleet of contract performers -- not just his famous co-stars, but 
the dozens of behind-the-scenes artists, professional arrangers, orchestrators 
and composers, many of them European artists who took refuge from World War II 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "MGM had a great studio orchestra and we worked with a lot of the same 
arrangers although they weren't exclusive to MGM, because there were other 
studios, like Warners, that were also doing musicals," Kelly recalls. "But 
fellows like (Arnold) Schoenberg and (Artur) Rubinstein came to the studio 
often, and a lot of the arrangers had studied in France with Michel Legrand's 
teachers. They were geniuses with strings, guys like Conrad Salinger. We were 
very lucky to have that kind of talent around." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, like his role at MGM, Kelly was something of a catalyst offscreen. He 
was married first to actress Betsy Blair (whom he divorced) and then to Jeanne 
Coyne, a dance instructor at MGM (who died more than 20 years ago); his Rodeo 
Drive home was the scene for many a gathering of what he calls "MGM's elite." 
</P>
<P>
 "Old age and death have weaned away a lot of my generation," he says a bit 
wistfully but also matter-of-factly. "We had a whole gang, Oscar Levant and 
Lennie Bernstein when he was in town, Comden and Green, Hume Cronyn and Jessica 
Tandy would come and Judy (Garland), who was a great girl and a dear friend, 
and Lena (Horne) and Judy would always sing." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that concentration of talent, plus the studios' demand for product in a 
pre-television era, that Kelly says fostered MGM's reputation for film 
musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came out here just before World War II, musicals were considered 
a sub-genre, unlike the early days of talkies with (Rouben) Mamoulian and 
(Ernst) Lubitsch, when musicals were very artistic things aesthetically. But 
they had become something where directors and writers would say, 'Let's do a 
little musical,' which meant the actors turned and yelled at each other in 
song. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we corrected a lot of that, because we had a great group of people 
who were all very serious about making musicals an indigenous American art 
form. And we succeeded, of course, not without some yelling at studio heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Kelly remains ambivalent not only about Mayer but also the studio's 
infamous contract system. "It was a very efficient system in that because we 
were at the studio all the time we could rehearse a lot. But it also really 
repressed people. There were no union regulations yet and we were all 
indentured servants -- you can call us slaves if you want -- like ball players 
before free agency. We had seven-year contracts but every six months the studio 
could decide to fire you if your picture wasn't a hit. And if you turned down a 
role, they cut off your salary and simply added the time to your contract." 
</P>
<P>
 The A-list actors, Kelly says, fared a little better -- "If you made them 
money you could say, 'I don't like this picture,' and they were slower about 
cutting you off" -- and, ironically, those artists who worked on musicals. "We 
got the best of it, because the executives didn't know how to read a musical 
script -- they still don't! There would be a line like, 'I love you,' which was 
followed by 'Three minutes of song and dance' and they never quite understood 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time, somebody upstairs insisted that we write out the dances, so I got 
together with the other choreographers and wrote out, 'Four bars then into a 
glissade, arabesque, boy takes girl in arms, lifts her down into a fish . . . ' 
It's classic dance language, but of course it was Latin to them, and we soon 
went back to the old way." 
</P>
<P>
 It was left to individual producers and directors like Arthur Freed, Vincente 
Minnelli and most notably Stanley Donen, with whom Kelly collaborated on four 
films including "Singin' in the Rain" and "On the Town," to exert greater 
control over musicals than did Mayer and other MGM executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came out here Mayer was more interested in running his racehorses and 
so different producers and directors were given great latitude," Kelly recalls. 
"Freed never curtailed any of us. He believed in talent to the point if we 
said, 'Bring a dancer or a designer from New York,' Arthur would see they were 
hired because he knew we were trying to move musicals to a different plane 
while keeping them still palatable to the public -- which is not what studios 
like Warners or Fox or Paramount were doing with musicals. Paramount at the 
time was largely doing Hope and Crosby 'Road' pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 And Kelly was an innovator -- not just as a dancer, but as a director and 
choreographer -- who took Broadway dance techniques and reworked them for film. 
Believing that simply filming a stage production flattened the dance numbers, 
Kelly experimented with camera angles and props, trying to create a sense of 
movement on film. It was out of that larger perspective that Kelly pioneered 
his more memorable dance sequences -- on roller skates, in a rain-soaked 
gutter, on a flatbed truck, swinging from a drape, leaping over a cartoon 
mouse, and in one particularly daring sequence in "Living in a Big Way," 
literally hopping across rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would have died if (the executives) had known I was walking along the 
rafters," he says. "They usually had stuntmen standing by, because if I fell 
the picture was over and that's what really concerned them." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Kelly says that his favorite film remains "On the Town" 
"because it was my first directing job and I loved it for the ground it broke 
-- shooting on location in New York without a chorus." He had seen the Broadway 
show and instantly "phoned MGM to buy it, little realizing that they already 
owned it, but Mayer didn't want to do it because of its inter-racial aspect -- 
a Japanese American had played the leading lady on Broadway and we were at war 
with Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 When Mayer eventually permitted Kelly to film in New York, "I was 
exhilarated," he recalls. "It's still my favorite, even though it's probably 
not the best musical or even the most popular." 
</P>
<P>
 His one real regret, Kelly says, was not being able to make more films apart 
from MGM. Billy Wilder had contacted Kelly for several films, Columbia wanted 
him to reprise his Broadway role in the film version of "Pal Joey," and Joseph 
Mankiewicz wanted him to play Nathan Detroit in "Guys and Dolls." "But MGM had 
seen me make 'Cover Girl' a hit for Columbia and they didn't want to loan me -- 
I even flew to New York with Lew Wasserman (who was then an agent) to go over 
Mayer's head -- but in the end Sinatra got both roles. The paradox was when 
'Guys and Dolls' was done, MGM distributed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the conversation, Kelly maintains a garrulous, chatty mien. He 
seems delighted at the opportunity to set the record straight. When he is told 
that an hour has passed he seems genuinely surprised. There are a few remaining 
points to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to do anything but please the youth audience today," he says. "And 
the men who run it now are pretty much lawyers and agents, fellows interested 
in it for the dough. I do think under the old studio system we made more 
mid-level pictures. But then I'm an optimist and I believe those kind of 
pictures are coming back. A steady trickle of them have made money and since 
money is the rule in Hollywood, I have a feeling we'll be seeing more little 
pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 He is less optimistic about the future of the musical, despite the recent 
success of such animated fare as "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin." "To 
transfer that to real people you need (more than) talented people who can sing 
and dance. Kids today are sorry they can't do musicals like we did, and the 
reason is there is no romantic music. It's hard to do a musical without singing 
'I love you,' and it's hard to do a romantic pas de deux to hip-hop music using 
quick-cut shots from the feet to the eyes to the legs or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 But even here, Kelly is hopeful, that like Tony Bennett's renewed popularity, 
musicals too "will return to a softer romanticism." Videotape, he adds, is one 
reason for his optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids talk to me and say they want to do musicals again because they've 
studied the tapes of the old films. We didn't have that. We thought once we had 
made it, even on film, it was gone except for the archives." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses and for the first time, sounds sentimental. "Now, when I look at TV, 
I see a lot of my old steps being used and I'm delighted." Starrin' in 
Hollywood

MOVIES; BUILDING THE MODEL ACTRESS; IT HASN'T BEEN EASY, DESPITE HER 
HIGH-PROFILE PARENTS AND A TENDENCY TO SURROUND HERSELF WITH TALENTED MEN. BUT 
WITH HER FIRST LEADING ROLE BEHIND HER, ISABELLA ROSELLINI FINALLY FEELS SOME 
CONFIDENCE AS AN ACTRESS

 "I've been reluctant to take myself seriously as an actress," admits Isabella 
Rossellini, "and that's probably because of who my parents were, and because of 
the wonderfully talented people like Martin Scorsese and David Lynch who've 
surrounded my life. I felt I was expected to have a career as big as theirs, 
and that was difficult for me to get past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until recently that I began to feel I know something of the craft 
of acting, and though I still have a lot to learn, I think I've made progress," 
adds the 41-year-old actress, who has her first leading role in "The Innocent," 
John Schlesinger's political thriller set against the backdrop of World War II, 
which opens next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working with John Schlesinger was a breakthrough for me because he told me I 
was a good actress and somehow made me believe him," adds Rossellini, who 
co-stars with Anthony Hopkins and Campbell Scott in the film. "He was able to 
convince me because John is very fatherly, and if daddy tells you something 
then it must be true," she laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of such critically acclaimed films as "Midnight Cowboy" and "Far 
From the Madding Crowd," Schlesinger admits to being "a little concerned about 
whether Isabella would be able to handle the role during early rehearsals for 
the film, because she seemed curiously withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 "But an indefinable alchemy happened between her and me, and one day we had an 
extraordinary breakthrough session -- from then on my confidence in her was 
total. I don't often say this about my own films, but I think she's remarkable 
in the part." 
</P>
<P>
 If Rossellini's pedigreed bloodlines made her reluctant to jump into acting 
feet first -- she is the daughter of actress Ingrid Bergman and Italian 
filmmaker Roberto Rossellini -- her extraordinary beauty posed a bit of a 
problem too. Best known as the signature face of the Lancome cosmetics line, 
Rossellini worked as a model before breaking into film, and everybody knows 
models can't do anything but be beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start out as a model and then become an actress, it's always held 
against you," points out Joel Schumacher, who directed Rossellini in the 1989 
film "Cousins." "People assume great beauties aren't as intelligent or as deep, 
and there seems to be a desperate need to find the fatal flaw in every 
beautiful woman.  
</P>
<P>
 "But women like Isabella are rare -- she's a very accessible beauty and is 
human and down to earth. She's already turned in some tremendous performances 
-- she was amazing in 'Blue Velvet,' for instance -- and I think she has yet to 
do her best work." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossellini herself scoffs at the idea that her beauty has been a problem in 
her pursuit of an acting career. "I'm losing my beauty," laughs Rossellini, who 
can also be seen this summer in Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp," "so it doesn't 
get in the way at all. I'm 41 and although I may have the beauty of a 
41-year-old woman, that's not the kind of beauty that's celebrated in this 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Of her role in Wyatt Earp, Rossellini explains: "I play Doc Holiday's 
girlfriend Big Nose Kate, who was one of the ugliest creatures I've ever seen 
-- she's lucky they just picked on her nose," she laughs. "She was a Hungarian 
woman, stocky and strong, and she looked like a man. When I saw a photo of her 
I asked Larry Kasdan if he wanted me to wear a mask with a fake nose and he 
said, 'It's not important that you look like her -- what's important is that 
you convey the violence of her relationship with Doc Holiday.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rossellini's being a bit disingenuous in saying she's losing her looks -- 
she's still a stunningly attractive woman; moreover, women of a certain age are 
currently making unprecedented inroads in the beauty industry. Briefly in L.A. 
to tend to some odds and ends of business, she meets a reporter in a hotel 
room, and upon entering the suite exclaims, "Everywhere I go this cart of hors 
d'oeuvres seems to follow me." An unpretentious woman with a bawdy sense of 
humor, a hearty, barnyard laugh and the physical elegance of an aristocrat, 
she's a wonderful juxtaposition of opposites. And she is recognizably the 
daughter of Ingrid Bergman -- like her mother, she exudes a luminous grace one 
rarely sees in movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up surrounded by famous movie people, however, left Rossellini 
decidedly ambivalent about the profession. "There's always been a part of me 
that's very angry with film," she confesses, "because film took away my 
parents, my lovers, my husbands. It took them away on trips, to other lovers, 
to other families, so my relationship to movies is very personal and 
complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Rome in 1952 a few seconds before her twin sister, Pia, arrived, 
Rossellini moved to Paris with her family at age 3, and spent her childhood and 
adolescence shuttling between her parents, who divorced when she was quite 
young, in Paris, Rome and later, London. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of myself as a child, the image that comes to mind is dirt -- I 
was a very busy child and I was always dirty, spotted and stained," she 
recalls. "We lived mostly in hotels because my parents were always on the road, 
and I didn't know that was strange, or that I led a privileged life. I wasn't 
aware my parents were special, and never knew how famous they were. I remember 
being at school and asking my friend, 'Is my mother as famous as Joan Crawford? 
How about Greta Garbo?' I had little understanding of any of this. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father worried about the prospect of me becoming an actress because 
there's very little work in Europe and the film industry there is in bad 
shape," she says. "And, I grew up well aware that my mother was persecuted by 
the U.S. film industry -- she suffered and I knew it. (Ingrid Bergman was 
blackballed from Hollywood after giving birth to Rossellini's older brother, 
Roberto, out of wedlock, in 1949.) "I was too little to read the papers at the 
time, but she'd tell me what they wrote, and I remember her being very sad and 
frightened about it. Famous people get away with more, but more is expected of 
them too, and though people say to me, 'What happened to your mother could 
never happen in America now,' I see it happening all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up I didn't see a lot of movies," she adds. "I probably saw more 
movies than factories, but I wasn't dazzled by movies and never felt, 'This is 
a world I must enter.' It's different in Europe, of course. Hollywood is 
glamorous and revolves around the notion of stardom. In Europe, film is a more 
intellectual art form, and that was very much the way my father, who was an 
extremely cultured man, related to it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 18 Rossellini enrolled at Finch College in New York, where she 
found work translating and teaching Italian. That led to a job as a production 
assistant for Italian television, where she worked her way up to a job as 
correspondent for an entertainment program for RAI, the Italian state 
television. From there she went on to become the straight man for Italian 
comedian Roberto Begnini on a comedy show called "L'altra Domenica." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to television journalism after the taste of fame she'd experienced 
with Begnini left Rossellini despondent and bored, and her fathers' death in 
1977 was a hugely traumatic event for her. "I've always felt that the dividing 
line in the history of my life is the day my father died," says Rossellini, who 
later lost her mother to breast cancer in 1982. "That was the day I had to 
become an adult and had to accept that if I was upset or frightened, I just had 
to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Life was to take a dramatic upward turn for Rossellini two years later; in 
1979 she married director Martin Scorsese, and the following year Bruce Weber 
photographed her for British Vogue and her modeling career took off. Rossellini 
had already done a bit of acting at that point -- in 1977 she appeared in "The 
Meadow," a movie directed by Italian filmmakers the Taviani brothers -- but 
acting was the last thing on her mind in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working with the Tavianis didn't make me feel like an actress because they 
use people who aren't professional actors in their films. This is done quite a 
lot in Europe, where people are often cast for what they emanate as people -- 
for their 'aura,' or whatever you want to call it. I was hired for that -- I 
wasn't hired to act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moreover, I didn't want to work as an actress during the years I was married 
to Marty," she adds. "People offered me parts at the time, but no husband would 
encourage his wife to be an actress because that means you're gone all the 
time. People have said that Marty wouldn't let me work as an actress, but I 
never felt that -- his attitude was an act of love. He told me, 'You don't need 
to do it -- I'll take care of you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Rossellini and Scorsese divorced in 1983, she'd already been 
signed as the spokesperson for Lancome, so she was well equipped to take care 
of herself. The year of her divorce she married model Jonathan Wiedemann, with 
whom she had a daughter the following year. That marriage too was to end in 
divorce after barely a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why it's so hard to keep a relationship together," says 
Rossellini. "It's sad, but passion does fade, temptation comes in and at a 
certain point you decide to follow the new thing. And let's face it, men are 
more subject to this than women are, and are by nature more polygamous than 
women. If it was up to me, I would never divorce -- I was always left." 
</P>
<P>
 Following her second divorce, Rossellini decided to try her hand at acting 
again, and was cast opposite Mikhail Baryshnikov in the 1985 film "White 
Nights." The following year she landed the part of battered femme fatale 
Dorothy Vallens in David Lynch's dark masterpiece, "Blue Velvet," and turned in 
her most critically acclaimed performance to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an intuitive understanding of this woman -- the minute I read the 
script I knew who she was and wanted to play her," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the film was first released, however, I felt tremendous guilt," she 
continues. "Today 'Blue Velvet' is considered a classic, but when it first came 
out, it was quite controversial. It was released in Italy by a bad distributor 
who promoted it as semi-porn, and the publicity generated by the film centered 
on the idea that Ingrid Bergman's daughter couldn't make it as a legitimate 
actress so she became a porno star. The Venice Film Festival refused to screen 
it on the grounds of defending my parents reputation, and I felt like a total 
failure. If the film was praised, David Lynch and Dennis Hopper were praised, 
but if people didn't like it, I was attacked. They said it was a misogynist 
film that trashed my Lancome image." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the release of "Blue Velvet" was a rough ride for Rossellini, her being 
cast in the film led to a four-year relationship with Lynch, and parts in 
several more films. In 1987 she had small roles in Mary Lambert's "Siesta," and 
Norman Mailer's "Tough Guys Don't Dance," in 1988 she starred opposite David 
Lynch in Tina Rathborne's "Zelly and Me," in 1989 she did "Cousins," and in 
1990 had a small part in Lynch's "Wild at Heart." In 1992 she tried her hand at 
comedy in "Death Becomes Her," and last year she turned in a well-received 
performance in the Peter Weir film, "Fearless." 
</P>
<P>
 Though her ambivalence about film is less marked than it once was, Rossellini 
takes issue with many aspects of her work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a problem with film and I'll tell you what it is," she declares. "I 
recently had dinner with the Greek writer Oriana Fallaci, a nasty lady who's 
one of my best friends. Nobody sees her but me, and we have long dinners and 
talk about life. She told me a writer recently completed a biography about her 
that revolved around a love affair she'd had, and that annoyed her. Love wasn't 
the engine of her life, she told me, nor was war or justice -- a sense of 
adventure is what drove her. When she said that, I realized it was true for me 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the attitude of a mature woman and it's not something you often see 
in film, which focuses on romantic love as the most important thing in a 
woman's life," she continues. "Menopause is a great blessing because it 
releases women from the question: should I get married and have a baby? At that 
point you start asking, what else is there? I don't yearn to be married, and 
though I can't say being single is my favorite state, I'm not lonely and would 
rather be single than be in many of the relationships I see." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossellini currently lives in New York, where she is raising her 10-year-old 
daughter Elettra, and her 9-month-old son Roberto, a mixed race child she 
adopted last fall. When one comments that adopting Roberto was a wonderful 
thing for her to do, she says, "I guess so. Everyone reacts like that, which 
surprises me. It's a lot of work in the beginning, but then it's really fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossellini will have a bit more time for her children next year, when her 
contract with Lancome expires. "I'm sorry to see the relationship end, because 
I've grown attached to the company and we work well together," she says. "It's 
more their choice than mine to end our work together -- I've represented 
Lancome for 14 years, and I guess I did my job so well that they now feel the 
need to separate their identity from me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working for Lancome has been great fun for me, although it involves 
discipline," she points out. "A week before a shoot you feel a certain pressure 
-- obviously I can't gain ten pounds, get a tan, or get drunk the night before 
the shoot. But these pictures are designed to be about an emotion rather than a 
blueprint for physical beauty. The Lancome woman is me when I feel fulfilled, 
calm and relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Rossellini regrets the termination of her relationship with Lancome, 
she accepts it -- as she seems to accept most things -- with good-natured 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fatalistic and believe you can't get what you want in life -- I know 
there are many things I want that I'll never be able to have," she concludes. 
"You just have to resign yourself to that fact, and once you stop focusing on 
some imagined goal you begin to see what's around you. And at that point, life 
begins to seem very rich."

THEATER; MR. COOL TRIES PASSION; STEPHEN SONDHEIM'S NEW MUSICAL OF OBSESSIVE 
LOVE MAY BE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE YET FOR BROADWAY'S RESTLESS 'CONSCIENCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Passion," the new Stephen Sondheim musical, features a character who is 
probably the most repulsive, obsessive and uningratiating woman ever to grace 
the Broadway musical stage. Yet she is arguably the most daring and personally 
felt character of any of Sondheim's shows -- and one of the most troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephen and I understand this woman," says James Lapine, the librettist and 
director of the musical in which Fosca, a sickly recluse, becomes obsessed with 
Giorgio, a handsome 19th-Century Italian army captain. "We can relate to her." 
</P>
<P>
 But the question during this preview period is: Can the Broadway audience 
relate to this woman? 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Passion" began performances early last month, the response has been 
vociferous. Word spread quickly on the street and in the press that the 
$4.5-million musical was in trouble, plagued with occasional walkouts and 
derisive laughter during serious moments. Major revisions in the show began, 
and the producers postponed the opening for 11 days to May 9 to give the 
creators a chance to clarify a character and to bolster the strange story. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ought to be ashamed of himself," muttered one man as he trundled up the 
aisle in the middle of a performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it," confessed another theatergoer, visibly awed. 
</P>
<P>
 The wildly divergent views shouldn't surprise anyone who has followed troubled 
preview periods of other Sondheim musicals, including "Sweeney Todd" and 
"Sunday in the Park With George" -- both of which became hits -- and "Merrily 
We Roll Along," his last musical with director Harold Prince, which flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a composer, after all, who has given musical voice to some of the most 
unexpected characters in musical theater, including a serial murderer ("Sweeney 
Todd"), a pointillist painter ("Sunday in the Park With George") and killers of 
Presidents ("Assassins"). 
</P>
<P>
 Though he began by writing lyrics in a more traditional mode for such musicals 
as "West Side Story" and "Gypsy" in the '50s, Sondheim served notice early on 
that he was willing to push the envelope. In 1970, he and director Harold 
Prince began a collaboration with the groundbreaking "Company" and went on to 
create such memorable shows as "A Little Night Music," "Follies" and "Pacific 
Overtures." When the pair broke up in 1980 after the failure of "Merrily We 
Roll Along," Sondheim continued the experiments with Lapine. Together they came 
up with the non-linear "Sunday in the Park With George" and "Into the Woods," a 
Freudian immersion into fairy tale, and now "Passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Few of his shows have made buckets of money -- his first as both composer and 
lyricist, 1962's "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," remains his 
most lucrative. But Sondheim has been honored with six Tony Awards and numerous 
tributes, including last year's Kennedy Center Honor. His fans are so devoted 
that each new Sondheim show becomes a kind of artistic flashpoint, if not a 
religious experience, for some theatergoers. Martin Gottfried, in his new book, 
"Sondheim," goes so far as to call him "the conscience of all Broadway 
musicals." 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim is 63, and his febrile creativity shows no signs of burnout. But this 
time out, the show's detractors maintain that Sondheim and Lapine have simply 
outreached themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will always be people in the audience who resist this story because 
it's bizarre, it's very close to the bone," says Sondheim, sitting in the 
downstairs lobby of the Plymouth Theater between performances, looking calm and 
confident amid a hectic schedule of revisions. "Fosca is a wild character but 
it would be a mistake to water her down. It might make an audience more 
comfortable but it wouldn't be the story we had in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 "Passion" is inspired by Ettore Scola's 1981 Italian film "Passione d'Amore" 
("Passion of Love"). Sondheim and Lapine, like Scola, based the musical 
directly on an 1869 Italian novel, "Fosca," by Iginio Tarchetti. In it, the 
soldier Giorgio (Jere Shea) is having an affair with Clara (Marin Mazzie), a 
lovely married woman, when he is suddenly transferred to a remote and barren 
post. The commanding officer there has taken responsibility for his cousin 
Fosca (Donna Murphy), an ugly, mysteriously ill creature who sets her sights on 
Giorgio -- with tragic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim says he had an immediate emotional response to the movie when he saw 
it in 1983 and seized on its possibilities as a musical. At first, he and 
Lapine had intended to do "Passion" as a one-acter, paired with a musical about 
a body builder that explored complementary notions about desire and obsession. 
But once the musical showcased at Lincoln Center last fall, the creators 
believed it could sustain a full evening by itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly there was some personal connection," said Sondheim. "All of us are 
Fosca, all of us are Giorgio, all of us are Clara. Fosca's feeling of being 
ugly yet the feeling of passion at the same time. Clara's feeling of the 
prettiness and comfortableness of love. And Giorgio's caught in between." 
</P>
<P>
 The ferocity of Fosca's passion, according to Sondheim, "is the most profound 
and immediate life force. It does not follow any logic, knows no bounds, and is 
a force in and of itself that can crack you open. And that's what it does to 
Giorgio. It cracks him open." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Sondheim says he identifies with Giorgio, particularly in the desire to 
be "cracked open," he seems to be just as connected to the unsympathetic Fosca. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Fosca is very close to Stephen," said Donna Murphy, who plays the 
driven woman. "Like her, he's a man who's dealt with a lot of pain in his life 
and has not been afraid to examine it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's readily apparent upon meeting Sondheim. His face is a ruin, a grizzled 
road map of lines and crevices that gives the impression he has been through 
the wringer. To many, he is the ultimate New York sophisticate -- witty, bright 
and sardonic. But when led grimacing into the lobby by the show's press agent, 
he looks far more like a nerdy egghead being marched into gym class. Dressed in 
baggy corduroys and a cable-knit sweater -- "a slob" is what his friend Mary 
Rodgers calls him -- he fidgets, plays with his hair, rubs his eyes, crosses 
and uncrosses his arms. When he does occasionally look directly at his 
interviewer, it is through slit eyes, an expression at once wary and available. 
But, as the conversation progresses, a boyishness creeps through the astringent 
and bristling intellect. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a steel-trap mind that appears to be always racing ahead. Begin a 
question based on the not unreasonable assumption that much of his work has 
struggled with various definitions of love, and he'll interrupt -- as he does 
often. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really? Really?!" he says. "Wait a minute. I have to question that." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what about the soaring ballads in "West Side Story"? The bittersweet 
romantic musings in "A Little Night Music"? The sharply satiric "Loveland" 
sequence in "Follies" where he contrasts the gooey sentiments of young 
lovebirds with the jaded weariness of their older selves? The unabashed anthem 
"Being Alive" in "Company"? 
</P>
<P>
 After more verbal sparring, in which he doesn't give an inch, he says, 
brusquely, "Well, every show in a sense, every show, deals with love in one way 
or another. The reason I'm questioning that is that I'm not aware of having 
written about the qualities of love before as any central intention." 
</P>
<P>
 "Passion," at least, is inarguably about love, untinged with the parody, 
satire and irony that have suffused almost every other Sondheim take on the 
subject of connection. After decades of writing about the impossibility of 
union, he has written a musical about the union of the impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim has dismissed it as "coincidence," but one of the reasons for his 
visceral response to the subject matter in "Passion" is personal: He is in 
love, reportedly for the first time in his life. Though he is notoriously 
private, a childhood friend maintains that "Steve is happier and calmer than 
he's ever been," and that is presumably due in part to his involvement with a 
young musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this has influenced, directly or indirectly, his approach to "Passion" 
can only be armchair psychology. Sondheim says that, though "hidden metaphors" 
have spurred his other shows, there are none here. "I think this is all exactly 
what it says it is on the surface," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
 If Sondheim is tackling love head-on for the first time, he's also playing 
with his fascination for order and harmony, and turning it on its head. In most 
of his previous shows, thickets of conflict are resolved through, as he wrote 
in "Sunday in the Park," bringing "order to the whole." But here, Giorgio's 
disciplined and well-ordered military life is crushed under the press of a 
woman's willful obsession. Emotion defies reason. Intuition, not logic, wins. 
The scorned woman gets her man. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes the story so extraordinary," says Sondheim, "is that not only does 
the guy give her no encouragement but actively tells her to go away all the 
time. It's easy to love when you're loved back, not easy when you're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, judging from the snickers at previews, some theatergoers see pathology, 
not love, and self-debasement, not selflessness in Fosca's obsession with 
Giorgio. "Fosca doesn't thrive on rejection like in 'Fatal Attraction,' " 
counters Sondheim. "It's not a choice, it defines her life. Behavior be damned. 
What's important is to make a very bizarre story seem as inevitable and 
convincing to an audience as it does to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim realizes it's a tall order. "It's easier for an audience to believe 
that you can chop people up into meat pies than it is to believe that a 
handsome young man who is having a perfectly lovely affair with a beautiful 
woman should become attracted to a relentless, unattractive, completely 
self-concerned woman. When you deal with this kind of intensity and love and 
what it does to you, that's not so different from what is outside the theater 
and that's much harder to take." 
</P>
<P>
 If, as Lapine claims, ours is "a passionless society," it may be a thankless 
task to raise such disturbing questions, especially in musical theater. Yet 
some have suggested that the main problem with "Passion" is that Sondheim and 
Lapine are just too cold and cerebral to be writing about hot emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephen and James are ascetic and there is something very spare and 
unforgiving about their work," said Hollywood film producer Scott Rudin, one of 
the show's producers. "But they're two of the most emotional guys I've ever 
met. They're just very unsentimental. This show is very passionate and 
romantic; it takes an audience by the scruff of the neck and shakes them. But 
then Stephen's always done that. 'Passion' is kind of an apotheosis of a lot of 
themes he's been working on since nearly the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 For such a private man, Sondheim has been unusually frank about his 
dysfunctional family and its lasting marks on him. Sondheim is the only child 
of a Park Avenue fashion executive father and designer mother, and his parents 
were divorced when he was 10. Janet Fox, "Foxy" to her friends, was a rejecting 
and controlling mother -- according to Sondheim, "a genuinely monstrous woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, he found a way to escape when Dorothy Hammerstein, wife of lyricist 
Oscar Hammerstein II, visited her friend "Foxy" with her son Jimmy. The two 
young men became fast friends and Dorothy invited Stephen to the Hammerstein 
summer home in Pennsylvania. Sondheim had found his surrogate family. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1945, a teen-age Sondheim took a musical he had written at Williams College 
to Hammerstein for criticism. His future mentor responded with brutal 
frankness. But Hammerstein then spent hours teaching his eager pupil the 
rudiments of musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked which of those rules he's since broken, Sondheim answers quickly, "The 
curious answer is none. What Oscar taught me to do was to be true to subject 
and true to characters. And how song should carry out the story. I really think 
Oscar would recognize his work in everything I've done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The composer is also quick to dismiss any notion that his musicals have 
upended some of the conventions and pat resolutions of the Rodgers & 
Hammerstein tradition. He describes his work as simply in sync with the 
post-World War II revolution against "the so-called well-made play." 
</P>
<P>
 "Messy behavior was not dealt with on the stage, or the screen for that 
matter, because it didn't make for a very neat script," Sondheim says. 
"Suddenly you got movies coming along like 'Breathless' and 'Jules and Jim' and 
people don't behave in neat, logical ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim, a movie buff, peppers his conversations with numerous film 
references. A devotee of the film music of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Sondheim 
has also written songs for a number of movies, including two -- "Reds" and 
"Dick Tracy" -- for director Warren Beatty. While he says his experiences in 
Hollywood have all been "terrific" and that he'd like to do more work both as a 
film composer and screenwriter, the musical theater claims most of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, his reputation looms so large on Broadway that much has been written 
about the "Sondheim mystique." His fans are so avid that RCA Red Seal Records 
has created something of a cottage industry in Sondheim, not only recording, 
but also in releasing albums of every unrecorded, re-recorded, newly discovered 
and newly rediscovered Sondheim song ever written. "I told Steve that the next 
album will be an anthology of songs which Sondheim has listened to," quipped 
Rudin. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Sondheim note that the composer believes that the extraordinary 
acclaim -- and criticism -- has begun to interfere with the perceptions of his 
work and that it may be at play in the troubled responses to "Passion." "There 
is something about the cloud of expectations surrounding any of his shows that 
can get in the way of the work," says a theater producer. "People get pretty 
rabid about him. It's not as simple as elites-versus-Philistines, but he does 
push a lot of buttons outside, as well as inside, the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim himself assiduously avoids the topic. "I won't comment on it," he 
says. "It would be self-serving." 
</P>
<P>
 It's tempting to see Sondheim as the iconoclastic artist George in "Sunday in 
the Park," misunderstood by his public. But he's probably just as much like the 
ambitious lyricist Charley in "Merrily We Roll Along," enjoying the trappings 
of success. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a part of Sondheim who'd like to be Andrew Lloyd Webber and vice 
versa," said someone who has worked with both of them closely. "He'd never 
admit it and he'd hate to hear it, but it's true." 
</P>
<P>
 Cancel out the "Sondheim mystique," friends say, and what you've got is a 
tunesmith, banging away on a piano, trying to get a show to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing about Stephen Sondheim is that he gets up every morning and 
goes to the piano," says Rudin. "In a perverse way, it's valiant and heroic. 
Steve's like Fosca. He doesn't stop. He's not safe. Who else goes out on a 
limb, gets knocked down, and climbs out farther?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim as the relentless and merciless Fosca? The Broadway audience as the 
rejecting but susceptible Giorgio? It's an intriguing simile. Only time will 
tell if Sondheim, like Fosca, ultimately prevails. But there's no question that 
the composer admires his anti-heroine's embrace of her destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life, in general, without this kind of passion is not fully realized, I 
think," he says. "And I don't care whether it's passion for a person or a 
passion for art or a passion for whatever. If everything is in control, if 
everything is safe, comfortable and pretty, life is pleasant but nowhere near 
as full as when there's something going on that drives you instead of you 
driving it. It makes life more difficult but much, much richer."

STARDUST, GOLDEN AND MARKETABLE; AS A TOWN BRACES FOR A 25TH-ANNIVERSARY 
FESTIVAL, THE TASK OF ORGANIZING -- AND SELLING -- A WOODSTOCK FOR THE '90S 
BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MILWARD, John Milward is a New York writer who specializes in pop 
music. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Located in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains, this town of 18,000 is not 
far from where, once upon a time, Rip Van Winkle took a very long nap. Now 
Saugerties and the rest of the Hudson River Valley are braced for the 
reawakening of an equally colorful visitor -- the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair 
-- and on one recent night, locals filled the town's Senior Citizens Center to 
debate whether Woodstock Ventures should be permitted to reprise the watershed 
festival at a nearby farm. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Pledge of Allegiance, people stepped up to a microphone to address 
the town board, concert promoter Michael Lang and a standing-room-only crowd of 
more than 300. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hall, leader of the rock group Orleans, was the first to speak. Hall, who 
has lived in Saugerties for more than 20 years, recently served as a county 
legislator, a political activity prompted by his opposition to a proposal to 
locate Ulster County's megadump at Winston Farm, the proposed site of Woodstock 
'94. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the trepidation of anyone who fears the arrival of so many 
people," said Hall, referring to the 250,000 rock fans guaranteed to flock to 
the silver anniversary event on Aug. 13 and 14. "In my opinion, however, it is 
vastly preferable to having a megadump with 200,000 tons of garbage a year 
arriving on that site for the next 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Thaddeus Dragula, a local Baptist preacher, begged to differ. "What's worse," 
he said, "a megadump that pollutes the water or a concert that pollutes our 
youth?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dragula was cheered by a contingent of retirees, conservative Christians and 
other foes of the festival who sat together at long tables toward the back of 
the room. While most speakers supported the fest, with many citing the 
financial boost it would give the beleaguered local economy, opponents called 
on the board to reject what they see as a Faustian bargain that would open 
their town to the social equivalent of a plague of locusts. 
</P>
<P>
 Keri Sorrin, a 17-year-old high school student whose hair was streaked pink 
and green, wasn't particularly worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as our morals are concerned, they're already screwed up," she said. 
"Maybe the festival can get us back on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
 Romantics remember the 1969 Woodstock Festival -- which took place in Bethel, 
N.Y., 60 miles southwest of Saugerties -- as an impromptu city in which peace 
and love were the laws of the land. Realists remember Woodstock and consider it 
a miracle that the worst thing to result from half a million stoned hippies 
spending the weekend on a muddy field was a world-class traffic jam. But 
perhaps the seminal lesson of the Woodstock Festival was that the so-called 
counterculture was a whale of a consumer market. Now, 25 years later, the 
ramifications of that realization are evident in almost every aspect of 
Woodstock '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lang, an architect of the original event, said little at the town 
meeting in Saugerties, already confident that the required permits would be 
secured within weeks. Woodstock Ventures had been negotiating with the town for 
10 months, and Lang knew that their hand was strengthened not just by 
opposition to the dump, but by the fact that IBM, the area's biggest blue-chip 
employer, had laid off 5,000 local employees in the last five years. (And 
indeed, after much last-minute financial wrangling, final approvals were 
granted on April 8.) 
</P>
<P>
 Initial bookings for Woodstock '94 are rumored to include Peter Gabriel, 
Aerosmith, Metallica, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Guns 
N' Roses, Neil Young and, returning from the original festival, Santana and 
Crosby, Stills and Nash. (The final lineup is expected in about three weeks; 
one-third of the acts are reportedly already booked.) Lang neither confirms nor 
denies any of these. Pearl Jam, another band also high on the rumor list, has 
said it has no plans to play the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 That the Woodstock revival was helped by the downsizing of a corporate giant 
and fear of a dump are just two of many Aquarian ironies. Woodstock '94 is also 
being bankrolled by PolyGram, which plans to market a film (Oscar-winning 
documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple shot the meeting in Saugerties), a 
recording and a weekend-long pay-per-view broadcast of the event. Meanwhile, 
Pepsi is already exploiting Woodstock nostalgia with a commercial featuring a 
pot joke delivered by two veterans of Yasgur's Farm: John Sebastian and Country 
Joe McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of Woodstock '94 and another festival slated for the original site in 
Bethel has heated local conversations throughout a particularly hard winter. 
Some of the dialogues have even occurred in cyberspace, courtesy of Woodstock 
Online, which can be reached via modem at 914-679-3040. 
</P>
<P>
 The common wisdom in Saugerties is that while the festival won't revitalize 
the economy, it will generate a couple million dollars and publicity that could 
help attract both business investments and tourist dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the megadump, it could still end up at Winston Farm, and fest foes are 
quick to quip that the debris from the concert might as well be left on the 
site. Lang has held out the carrot that if the festival is successful, the farm 
would be developed as an outdoor venue for summertime concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody expects Woodstock '94 to cause a weekend of commotion. Though 
Winston Farm is right next to an exit on the New York State Thruway, nearly all 
of the surrounding roads are two-lane affairs. But promoters have emphasized 
that the event would not re-create the logistic nightmare of the original. One 
reason is that they've had to submit extensive environmental, security, medical 
and traffic plans to obtain a variance to the mass-gathering laws enacted after 
the 1969 festival. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the Saugerties town meeting, Lang was at his home in the town 
of Woodstock, poring over proposed designs for the three stages he plans to 
erect on the 740-acre farm. "In some cases," said Lang, who still has the suede 
vest he wore at the original festival, "I was hearing people say the same 
things that their parents said in '69. But these days, the opposition is more 
of a minority, and what it boils down to is here is a conservative country town 
embracing Woodstock. How bizarre can you get?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of '69, Duke Devlin hitchhiked to the Woodstock Festival from a 
commune near Amarillo, Tex. He stayed in Bethel, and commemorated his move with 
a large tattoo that includes the Woodstock logo of a dove sitting on the neck 
of a guitar. (The logo for this year's festival depicts a Fender-style guitar 
neck and two birds.) Hippie pilgrims have long journeyed to Yasgur's Farm, and 
during the week of the 20th anniversary, a quarter-million people are said to 
have driven by the counterculture's field of dreams. Impromptu festivals have 
marked the anniversary for years, although last summer the party had to be 
moved when a promoter who'd leased the original site in anticipation of the 
25th anniversary covered the field with fresh green chicken droppings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I go past the original site," says Devlin, who owns a local farm 
stand, "I'm amazed to see kids who weren't even born when the festival 
happened. They seem to have a longing for the peace and love that was there, 
and are looking for something to kick it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters have long tried to satisfy that need, but over the years, Bethel has 
had a love-hate (mostly hate) relationship with the festival that put it on the 
map. However, town officials have entertained various 25th-anniversary plans 
and are currently talking with Sid Bernstein, a music business veteran whose 
dusty old claim to fame is that he promoted concerts by the Beatles at Carnegie 
Hall and Shea Stadium. (See accompanying story, Page 80.) 
</P>
<P>
 Observes Devlin: "Bethel has a 300-watt light bulb, but they've covered it 
with a bushel basket." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Saugerties has all but put on a light show welcoming Woodstock 
'94. The festival is once more being produced by Lang and two men from wealthy 
families who've been business partners since before the first festival, John 
Roberts and Joel Rosenman. New on the bus to Woodstock is John Scher, a major 
East Coast concert promoter who also runs the diversified entertainment 
division of PolyGram. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget for the original Woodstock was $500,000, although the festival 
ended up costing closer to $3.3 million. Woodstock '94 is a co-production 
between Woodstock Ventures and PolyGram, which is supplying the $19.5-million 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first festival, a "favored nations" booking policy ensured that none of 
the top acts would receive more than $15,000. Tickets were priced from $7 for 
one day to $18 for all three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the two-day Saugerties festival, which will be sold beginning 
around June 1 through a lottery, are expected to cost about $120. Shortly after 
Woodstock, Bob Dylan earned $150,000 to play the Isle of Wight Festival, and 
rock concerts became a much more lucrative, arena-oriented business. Industry 
rumors have top acts at Woodstock '94 getting $350,000 plus points in the 
offshoot products. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Jimi Hendrix closed the first festival by playing the "Star-Spangled 
Banner" on his Stratocaster, the promoters discovered that they were about $1.7 
million in debt. Roberts and Rosenman bought out Lang, and then sold a bigger 
share of the film and recording rights to Warner Bros., which had already put 
up $100,000 to film the festival and another $500,000 to edit the footage that 
became "Woodstock." Roberts says that the debt was essentially paid off by 
1980, except that over the years more money was spent to protect a trademark 
that had come to define a generation -- "Woodstock." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," warned Roberts' father, appalled by his son's business venture, 
"this thing will be haunting you 25 years from now." He was right; Woodstock 
proved as tough to shake as the scent of patchouli. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically," adds Rosenman, "it's always bothered me that Woodstock 
worked in all respects but as a business venture." Promoting the world's most 
famous rock concert also carries a lot more cachet than the mergers and 
acquisitions that occupied the partners throughout the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't say we're the Richardson Mint guys," admits Rosenman, citing one of 
their other business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodstock guys came to a rude realization, however, when they considered 
staging a 20th anniversary festival in Berlin that was to bridge both sides of 
the then-divided city. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we looked at our contracts seven or eight years ago," says Roberts, "we 
found that we were pretty much married to Warner Bros. They basically had all 
the ancillary rights short of live-event profits and merchandising." 
</P>
<P>
 The company that's now called Time Warner does not have a live concert 
division and wasn't particularly interested in staging another Woodstock. The 
result was a protracted negotiation between Woodstock Ventures and Warners. The 
deal that emerged, says Roberts, "was that Warners would retain rights to the 
original movie and recording, and we bought back the rest. The price was 
substantial, but our deal with PolyGram was that we had to provide all these 
rights free and untrammeled." Warners remains a profit participant in Woodstock 
'94. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think such corporate maneuvers belie the Woodstock vibe, hold onto your 
roach clip. "In 1969," says Lang, "we were not basing the viability of the show 
on the ancillaries. Who knew from ancillaries? We didn't even have T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Woodstock '94 will be well stocked with ancillaries. Considering that 250,000 
tickets at $120 each would roughly cover producing the festival, the potential 
profit centers are clearly the pay-per-view television broadcast, the feature 
film, the soundtrack album and souvenir merchandise. Roberts also hopes that a 
revitalized "Woodstock" trademark will facilitate such future plans as a chain 
of hard-rocking Woodstock cafes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woodstock '94 reflects the typical pop music mix of idealism and giant doses 
of greed," reflects writer and musician Ed Sanders, a 20-year Woodstock 
resident best known for his work with the Fugs. "It's an event fueled by the 
credit-card power of 14-year-old kids." 
</P>
<P>
 But this Woodstock Nation won't have to worry about running out of cash: there 
will be automatic teller machines on the grounds of Winston Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Woodstock's reputation as a "colony of the arts" was born early in the 
century, when two artists' communities -- Byrdcliffe and Maverick -- sought to 
develop lifestyles that integrated arts and crafts with advanced social ideals. 
Before long, Woodstock became known as the Greenwich Village of the Catskills. 
Beat-era artists came in the 1950s. In the '60s, the late Albert Grossman, one 
of the most powerful music managers of the decade, moved to town and brought 
along such clients as Bob Dylan and the Band. By the time Dylan had his 
motorcycle accident on Zena Road, Woodstock was known to a whole generation of 
hippies. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the years, however, there has been consistent friction between the 
town's bohemian elements and its more typically rural citizens. Back in the 
late '60s, Michael Lang was laughed out of town when he proposed staging the 
Woodstock Festival in, of all places, Woodstock. It was bad enough, some 
complained, that longhairs arrived on the Village Green looking for Dylan or 
Big Pink. (The Band's famous house, immortalized by the group's classic album 
"Music From Big Pink," actually is in West Saugerties.) 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Woodstock has long benefited from the festival that borrowed its name. 
Twenty-five years worth of tourists have passed through town looking for 
Yasgur's Farm. The pizza shop bears a variation on the Woodstock logo, while 
local radio station WDST relishes the resonance of calling itself Radio 
Woodstock. One guy even carved up an acre of land into square-inch plots to 
sell as souvenirs. Still, with Woodstock '94 now literally down the road, 
everybody's expecting a crazy summer, including Family of Woodstock, a social 
service organization originally formed to handle transient hippies who hung 
around after the '69 festival. They've been contracted to help with its sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 A striking element of the debate over Woodstock '94 is how opponents fear that 
crime and violence will replace peace and love. It's not like 1969, this logic 
goes, when sex was safe, drugs were recreational, and rock 'n' roll was, well, 
rock 'n' roll. "These days," said an unidentified police officer in the local 
paper, "it's not just 'take a little LSD and go to sleep;' now it's guns and 
drugs, stealing and killing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was searched for weapons on the way to Woodstock; that won't be the 
case at Woodstock '94. At Woodstock, the promoters were so busy putting up the 
stage that there was no time to construct a proper entrance where people could 
buy tickets. At Woodstock '94, no tickets will be available at the gate, and 
Winston Farm will be surrounded by an eight-foot fence patrolled by security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 A controversy over the presumed appearance of Guns N' Roses also suggests that 
the promoters of Woodstock '94 will be held to a different standard than if 
they were staging just another rock show. Because the very name Woodstock 
suggests all sorts of hippie ideals, citizens of the Woodstock Nation will be 
watching to see if the music at the festival is politically correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to Guns N' Roses has brought together some strange bedfellows. 
Dragula, the preacher, sees the band as embodying all that is evil about rock 
'n' roll. Sanders, who wrote a book about the Charles Manson murders, "The 
Family," objects to the band recording one of Manson's songs, and Axl Rose 
wearing his image on a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a liberal/conservative schism in terms of who supports the 
festival," explains Sanders, "but there are also plenty of liberals who aren't 
too happy about a quarter-million 18- to 24-year-old people watching Guns N' 
Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Levon Helm of the Band, who has lived in Woodstock for most of the past 25 
years, hopes that Woodstock '94 will prove to be a peaceful tonic. "When the 
first festival came around," he says, "things were a lot softer, and people 
were more tolerant of each other. I'd like to see this festival work out a 
little of our meanness." 
</P>
<P>
 Helm would also like to see a "survivors slot" at Woodstock '94 for the Band. 
He's not the only one looking for a payday. The town of Saugerties has 
bargained the richest deal, with a cut of $4 per ticket fairly guaranteeing a 
$1-million windfall, an additional $150,000 to finance the permit process and 
$350,000 set aside for additional expenses. Ulster County will get $1.40 per 
ticket. The promoters will also take out a $50-million insurance policy to 
cover unexpected expenses incurred by both the town and Ulster County. 
Surrounding towns, including Woodstock, are also negotiating with the promoters 
to assume their costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "August is on Michael Lang," jokes Sanders, "and I'm encouraging everybody in 
Woodstock to send him their therapy bills." Sanders has his own piece of the 
action: Fantasy Records will release a live album called "The Fugs Celebrate 
the Woodstock Festival." 
</P>
<P>
 The Howard Johnson Lodge directly across from Winston Farm has already sold 
out its rooms for the August weekend at a rate of $350 a night, up from a 
normal high of $80. Other motels are charging up to $1,200 for three nights. 
One company has reserved more than 600 area hotel rooms with an eye toward 
charging sky-high prices at festival time. 
</P>
<P>
 Day Yusko, a middle-aged hippie who cuts hair and sells a variety of crafts 
out of a storefront in Woodstock, would like to kick the money-changers out of 
the festival. Yusko, a longtime activist in the loose-knit clan known as the 
Rainbow Family, says that after the group's annual Fourth of July gathering, 
many will head for Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to come and unfold their tents wherever they can," says 
Yusko, who predicts that many thousands will come to the area without tickets 
to the Saugerties festival. "People respond to the fact that a new religion was 
born at Woodstock based on the spirit of sharing and caring. And they also 
won't want to miss the party of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 The first to come, says Yusko, will be the "road dogs." These nomadic 
hitchhikers, he explains, are the scouts who will seek out campsites in the 
area and comb the mountains abutting Winston Farm to look for free passage into 
the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang is no road dog, but he still hopes that Woodstock '94 will reflect the 
soul of the original. "There's a tremendous amount of interest in the '60s 
again," he says, "but instead of mere nostalgia, we want Woodstock '94 to be a 
forum to pass along that spirit to a new generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Woody and Louise Sperl have spent 47 quiet years in a small home that borders 
Winston Farm. Their children grew up playing on the farm's vast fields, and now 
also live in houses that border the property that will host Woodstock '94. 
"It's certainly not going to be your average weekend," says Louise who, like 
her husband, is 71, "but then, we've just been through a winter with 17 
snowstorms." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the music sounds halfway good," continues Louise, "I'll sit in the back 
yard. If not, I'll turn on the air-conditioning and listen to Garth Brooks."

FAR, FAR AWAY FROM ARCHIELAND; CARROLL O'CONNOR MADE TELEVISION HISTORY WITH 
THE BIGOTED MR. BUNKER IN THE '70S. BUT THIS WEEK'S EVENTS ON HIS CURRENT 
SERIES, "IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT," POINT UP HOW MUCH THE PRIME-TIME LANDSCAPE 
HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN

 It is late afternoon and Carroll O'Connor is walking through the Beverly 
Wilshire Hotel when a couple of female tourists, armed with cameras, spot him. 
He poses, cracks a couple of jokes and then heads for a table in the bar, where 
he polishes off a sandwich and a nonalcoholic beer. 
</P>
<P>
 He is relaxed but quietly revving himself up -- planning a rest at his house 
in Mexico before resuming production in Georgia this week on the eighth season 
of his surprisingly tenacious CBS show, "In the Heat of the Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, when you thought of O'Connor, you thought of only one thing: 
Archie Bunker in "All in the Family." Thus it is something of a milestone that 
in Wednesday's episode of "In the Heat of the Night," the actor once known for 
playing TV's most famous bigot will marry a black woman in his latest role as 
Bill Gillespie, a sheriff in the Deep South. The bride is played by Denise 
Nicholas, who portrays a city councilwoman long involved with Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
 Says O'Connor: "People say, 'It's curious. You were once playing a character 
that wouldn't dream of this kind of a marriage.' Well, the character I'm 
playing now wouldn't dream of that kind of marriage either, but things happened 
to him that didn't happen to Archie Bunker. A kind of insight and enlightenment 
happened to Gillespie. And the same kind of enlightenment happened to her. They 
found they liked to be with each other an awful lot. And they were laughing at 
things together, a big step forward in a love relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 To a female viewer who didn't like the interracial romantic relationship that 
was developing, O'Connor wrote: "What are they going to do? He likes her and 
she likes him." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In its quiet way, "In the Heat of the Night," honored several times by the 
NAACP Image Awards, has evolved into a series about black and white 
relationships, despite network TV's disgraceful history of avoiding dramas 
about African Americans. If it is not a show that comes to grips in a 
breakthrough manner with the dramatic realities of black family life, 
especially the urban experience, it is nonetheless a lot more than what the 
television industry expected when the series debuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Under O'Connor, who quickly took control of the show as executive producer, 
"In the Heat of the Night" has maneuvered its way through a challenging maze of 
obstacles and backstage problems that added up to an intriguing drama of its 
own: 
</P>
<P>
 Would the public accept O'Connor as anyone but Archie? In real life, there was 
the publicity about the drug and alcohol problems of co-star Howard Rollins. In 
the second season, O'Connor underwent sextuple heart bypass surgery. And then 
there was the matter of no compromise in the ongoing interracial romance that 
culminates with Wednesday's marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, NBC, which launched the series, let it go despite decent ratings 
because its viewership skewed older -- but CBS quickly snapped it up two 
seasons ago. And throughout its run, "In the Heat of the Night" has often found 
itself up against television's hottest series, including "Moonlighting," 
"Roseanne," "Coach" and, most recently, "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 While "All in the Family" was perhaps the greatest situation comedy in TV 
history, O'Connor, 69, says that he has been buoyed in "In the Heat of the 
Night" by the fact that, as an admitted liberal, he is playing someone closer 
to his heart than Archie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. Sure. Archie wasn't even close. Gillespie is a lot closer. Gillespie has 
changed his mind. The funny thing about Archie is that he wouldn't change his 
mind. That was the fun, the comedy and the satire. That's what you laughed at. 
He never laughed at anything himself, Archie. The world was a painful place to 
him. And because it was painful to him, it was funny to you. You got a kick out 
of watching a guy who was constantly in pain over things that you take for 
granted." 
</P>
<P>
 Flat out, which character does he prefer? 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer this character (Gillespie). But I'm probably influenced in that by 
my augmented status with the show. I mean more to this show as executive 
producer, head writer, the star, the guy who even passes on the ladies' wigs. 
It involves me more than Archie did. So it's more fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing for a moment, O'Connor adds what fans of "All in the Family" already 
know -- that despite his later success as Gillespie, "I'll never play a better 
part than Archie. He was the best character, the most fulfilling character, and 
I never thought it was going to develop that way. There's no role that can top 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 According to O'Connor and new CBS Entertainment President Peter Tortorici, "In 
the Heat of the Night" is scheduled to return next season as a group of 
two-hour movies, but will also be on call, if needed, to step in with one-hour 
episodes instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conditions," O'Connor says, "are that the network has ordered four 
two-hour movie productions. But they have ordered seven two-hour scripts. 
They've asked me to do something that they've asked before -- to be prepared to 
break these down into one-hours should they change their minds. So supposedly, 
while they're ordering seven two-hour movies, in their heads they're ordering 
14 one-hours." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor, who won a best actor Emmy for "In the Heat of the Night" in 1989 -- 
he already had four for "All in the Family" -- downplays the idea that he had a 
problem being accepted as a Southern law officer after his years as Archie: "If 
you'll forgive me, this conception of images sticking so hard to performers 
that they can't perform freely is a notion of the press." 
</P>
<P>
 The key, he says, was playing a role different from Archie: "If an actor does 
something entirely different and makes good on it, the public will go right 
with him. Bucking the image is really a problem with producers. They could have 
said, 'He's too well-known as Archie Bunker now. Get Rod Steiger (who starred 
with Sidney Poitier in the Academy Award-winning 1967 movie version of "In the 
Heat of the Night"). Or get somebody more like Rod Steiger.' 
</P>
<P>
 "NBC told Fred Silverman (O'Connor's co-executive producer on "In the Heat of 
the Night") that if they got me to do the show, they'd say yes. Fred came and 
said, 'If you say yes, we'll have a deal within two weeks.' We made a deal 
within 10 days." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems surrounding Rollins, a brilliant actor ("Ragtime," "A Soldier's 
Story"), were more complex. There were various incidents; in March, 1988, for 
instance, the actor was arrested on charges of drunk driving and drug 
possession. Last year, he served a brief jail term following traffic 
violations; he had previously been on probation stemming from drunk driving 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, both he and O'Connor professed mutual admiration during their 
personal crises. "I'm very fond of this man," O'Connor says. And after O'Connor 
had his bypass, Rollins said: "I was sad, and I missed him." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, changes finally were made in the series. Rollins had played 
O'Connor's chief of detectives, but now he became a law student and eventually 
an attorney in the series, making only occasional appearances. Carl Weathers 
was brought in as a new co-star. 
</P>
<P>
 Real life and fiction continued to blend as the cast changes affected 
O'Connor's role as well. With Weathers as the new police chief of the series' 
fictional town of Sparta, Miss., O'Connor, who previously had that post, became 
a regional county sheriff instead. The plot ploy here was that the Sparta City 
Council, while not admitting it, did not like Gillespie's interracial romance 
and forced him out of his job as chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worried a lot of people when I wanted to make the change" from police 
chief to sheriff, says O'Connor, "but I had to make that job change to attract 
Carl Weathers. I had to make him the chief of police." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor's bypass at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta in March, 1989, was 
yet another real-life situation that the series had to deal with. Did the 
actor, a hard worker, contemplate quitting? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he says at first, then adds: "I thought about it, but the doctors said, 
'You don't have to. You'll be fine. Go ahead.' I wanted to get back to work. 
They did the last four shows of that season without me." 
</P>
<P>
 How did the cast of his series react? "They were worried," says O'Connor, "but 
they were reassured that I was going to be fine and that I'd be back, and so 
all was well." 
</P>
<P>
 And his wife, Nancy? "She didn't want me to quit, no, unless it was essential, 
and it wasn't," says the actor. "She was happy that I didn't have to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, O'Connor acknowledged that "I've always been very cranky about 
the material." On "All in the Family," he has said, "I used to get into bitter 
arguments with writers, directors and producers, saying, 'This is wrong for me 
or the wrong thing to be doing or saying. I don't like this. I don't like that. 
This is not a good joke. This is not funny' -- all those things. And I'd get 
into arguments. And they'd become furious. I wasn't always right. I can really 
remember the times that I was wrong, and I'm very sorry for losing my temper 
and being a boor during 'All in the Family.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His tenacity, however, remains, as he has changed the interracial course of 
"In the Heat of the Night" to its present direction without making grand 
pronouncements up front. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do that," he says. "The minute you state a policy, the networks 
say, 'Wait a minute. Let's examine this. Is this what we want to do? Is this 
where we want to go? Is this going to become a black-white show?' -- as, in 
fact, mine has become. If I had said to them five years ago that I want to make 
this a black-white show, they wouldn't know what I was talking about. I 
wouldn't know what I was talking about myself if I had told them in those 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what I did say to network officials was, 'Well, ladies and gentlemen, we 
have to be cognizant of conditions in the South today and the population 
changes in the South. I just want our show to reflect what is happening in the 
Deep South.' They said, 'Sure, sure,' because that's sort of a generalized 
thing and they could accept that. I just did the show and the racial thing was 
part of the whole tapestry against which we were playing. To suppress the 
prominence of blacks in Southern life today is to alter the whole texture of 
the tapestry." 
</P>
<P>
 There were, however, some related problems in the series' early days, says 
O'Connor. When the show first started, it was shot in Louisiana and, says the 
actor, at that time he began pressing for more blacks on the program. The 
original motion picture, he notes, was released in 1967 "but this was now 1987 
when we began -- 20 years later. I began arguing about reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suddenly thought, 'I can't continue doing this series.' This was the first 
seven shows we did. I said, 'Yes, I have a contract, but I'll just go and tell 
them I can't live up to the contract and I am physically, psychologically, 
unable to continue with this.' " He remained, however, but was still unhappy 
about the show's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, after the show's second season, says O'Connor, "I went to MGM (the 
producing studio) and said, 'It's over. It's over. I can't go on.' I'd had the 
heart operation by that time. They said, 'What do you want to do, take over the 
show?' I said, 'Yes, exactly. That's exactly what I want to do.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And they said, 'Even if we let you take over the show, how could you take 
over as executive producer after this thing you've just been through? You'll 
have enough to do.' I said, 'Listen, I feel better than I've felt in years, and 
I can do it, and I will do it, and I want to do it, and unless you let me do 
it, I'm out of here.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So then I took over, and for better or for worse, I've got what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's scheduled marriage broadcast, the episode ends with the 
ceremony and a final freeze-frame of the wedding kiss of O'Connor and Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
 And next season? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, of course she (Nicholas) writes for me too," says O'Connor. "So now all 
of us who write for the program will get some ideas. We're just a married 
couple now. She works for the city, I work for the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1971, when "All in the Family" debuted, O'Connor has been a formidable 
TV force, following that series with "Archie Bunker's Place" and "In the Heat 
of the Night." In head-on competition, for instance, "Archie Bunker's Place" 
walloped one of TV's hottest series, Robin Williams' "Mork & Mindy." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Heat of the Night" also showed muscle against "Roseanne" and 
"Moonlighting." Is O'Connor disappointed at the new, occasional status of his 
show on CBS? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not at all. I don't think anybody figured we'd go eight seasons. They 
figured with any good luck, we'd do five. That's really all that MGM or anybody 
wanted to do. It gives you over 100 shows, and you can go into syndication with 
that. We're already in syndication and doing very well. I feel fulfilled. I'm 
the one who determines what goes on film. If you don't like it, don't blame 
anybody but me."

NEW TALENT IS WELCOME HERE; THE ROYAL BALLET OF BRITAIN IS GETTING A REPUTATION 
FOR BEING DANCER-FRIENDLY, FOR HOME-GROWN AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL TALENT. AS A 
RESULT, EXPECT A NEW LOOK AND LOTS OF DRAMA

 Everyone agrees that the Royal Ballet of Britain was revitalized after danseur 
noble Anthony Dowell took over as artistic director in 1986. Even so, the 
laurels have come with brickbats: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dowell was importing too many foreign dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 * He was letting standards slip in the works of Frederick Ashton and Kenneth 
MacMillan. 
</P>
<P>
 * He was changing the look of the company by bringing in Russian teachers in 
the company school. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the charges, however, few people realized that under his direction the 
Royal was also becoming a haven for dancers who were disaffected with other 
companies and a nurturing ground for younger home-grown talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by the success of this new group, Dowell simply shrugs off the 
negatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the critics in England feel this, but they do sort of live in the 
past," Dowell said in a recent phone interview from Washington, where the Royal 
was dancing before its May 3-8 engagement at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center.  
</P>
<P>
 "But you can't keep an art form frozen. Even though Fred (Ashton) created on 
certain people, he had other casts, who brought other things. We still try to 
preserve the line and speed, the use of the upper body -- all he wanted. If it 
isn't working, that's someone else's opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 As for bringing in too many outsiders, Dowell said: "That sounds like I had a 
whole herd in. In fact, I brought in Irek (Mukhamedov), Zoltan (Solymosi), 
Sylvie (Guillem) is still a guest artist -- and that's it, really. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I grew up in a company (the Royal) that had guests in it. It seems 
terribly blinkered to me not to open the door to people who are very talented 
artists. It's good for dancers to see and learn from them, and it's interesting 
for the public as well." 
</P>
<P>
 All three -- former Bolshoi Ballet star Mukhamedov, the Hungarian Solymosi and 
Guillem of the Paris Opera Ballet -- will be dancing in Orange County. 
Mukhamedov and Guillem are familiar to Southland audiences from previous 
appearances. But Solymosi will be new. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old Budapest native actually had no intention of ever joining 
another company after some bad experiences during his three-year stint at the 
Dutch National Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I had personal problems with the director," Solymosi said. "I 
decided to go free-lancing and did some open-end guesting in Munich and La 
Scala. I told myself I was never going to sign up with another company ever in 
my life. I did not want to sign with the Royal either. The first time I danced 
with them (in 1991) it was as a guest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I found some nice repertoire roles, like Rudolf in (MacMillan's) 
'Mayerling' and Basil in Baryshnikov's 'Don Quixote.' I decided to sign a 
permanent contract. I haven't regretted it so far." 
</P>
<P>
 At least, not entirely. "They have a different style of dancing here," he 
said. "The English school is so different from my Russian (training). In 
Budapest, we have the Vaganova school, which is real, pure Russian style. What 
I really find difficult is to place myself (according to the English style) in 
ballets. They give me corrections. Of course, they want me to look good. But 
that is what they believe in. I have my own school. Diplomatically, it's 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's worth it, " he added. "I need the change. It's important for an 
artist to have a wide view. You have to see and think through a lot of things. 
But for that you need to travel, to see different things, to decide what is 
good and not good, to refine your taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Royal dancers, Solymosi felt greatly influenced by working with 
choreographer Kenneth MacMillan before he died in 1992. "It was a great thing, 
a big part of my life to work with such an interesting choreographer," Solymosi 
said. "Yes, he's difficult to work with, but I didn't care. Basically, great 
people are difficult to work with. If I'm interested in a role, a character and 
the piece that I'm doing, I accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 MacMillan created his last ballet, "The Judas Tree," Solymosi said, on 
Mukhamedov "and me. It's one of my favorite roles."  
</P>
<P>
 Mukhamedov, however, will be the only one of the two dancing the work in 
Orange County. Even so, Solymosi does not feel in the shadow of the great 
Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry about my own dancing," he said. "That's how you can get forward. 
Otherwise, if you worry about other people, it takes away from your own time." 
</P>
<P>
 Leanne Benjamin, 29, who dances opposite Solymosi in "Mayerling," also came to 
the Royal after unhappy experiences at other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my fourth company," the native Australian said. "The first was 
Sadler's Wells (now the Birmingham Royal Ballet). That was actually where I 
gained the most opportunity. Being very young and quite talented from the 
school, I had a lot of opportunities there. But it just wasn't right." Her 
technique and standards were slipping, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter Schaufuss had been trying to get me to join the Festival Ballet (later 
the English National Ballet) for years. I rang him one day after he had stopped 
asking and said, 'I'm ready to come.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Schaufuss moved to Berlin to take over the Deutsche Oper Ballet, Benjamin 
went with him. But things didn't work out well there either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berlin was very difficult for me," she said. "The performances were very far 
and few. Opera takes preference over their ballets. I was on a two-year 
contract, but I left after one year and three months. I was really fed up with 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped dancing for nine months before joining the Royal. I had a bit of an 
injury, so I stopped for quite a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 MacMillan, who also had been director of the Berlin company from 1966 to 1968, 
understood her frustration and proved a catalyst in her career, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He persuaded Anthony to take me into the Royal," Benjamin said. "He reset 
'Different Drummer,' which he had done with Alessandra Ferri, on me. It was 
great. He lifted my inspiration, and I very quickly came back (physically). 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't an easy man," she added, "but he liked me. That made a huge 
difference. He was your typical artist. He couldn't like everybody and be kind 
to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Benjamin and Solymosi like MacMillan's ballets for the opportunities they 
give dancers to express their "individuality." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I really enjoy doing his work," she said. "With the classics, you 
need to have higher legs, bigger jumps, technically be better than the other 
person, although not lose the finesse and style. But standards are (always) 
rising. With his work, you can be totally individual, you can be unique." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Solymosi: "I believe in the dramatic roles. Those are my main interest. 
I'm not crazy about technical things. To live your life to be able to do two 
more pirouettes . . . to worry, worry, worry about your arabesque -- that's too 
narrow for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban dancer Jose Manuel Carreno, 25, spent about 2 1/2 years at the English 
National Ballet, where he went after winning the Grand Prix at the 
International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss., in 1990. And he, too, 
wasn't entirely happy there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a lot of things there, but there were so many problems," he said. "They 
changed directors all the time. So when I got this opportunity to join the 
Royal Ballet, I accepted it. Going to England, working in America or in 
England, had been one of my dreams. For the Cuban people, the political 
situation is so hard. So this is what I tried, to first get to England to 
develop. Now I am still here. I feel very happy here." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not entirely, as it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in the English National Ballet, it was a mixed company," he said. 
"There were so many Italian and French people, and Cuban and Russian. It was 
very mixed. I really enjoyed that. The character and the atmosphere were great. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now in the Royal, I feel it's a little bit harder. Almost all of them are 
English. I really can feel this difference in character. But we get along. It's 
like a balance. In one way, I feel strange. But in another way, if I am 
learning, I feel OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Carreno has two uncles who dance in the Ballet Nacional de Cuba, where he 
spent four years as a dancer. The youngest of two younger brothers also is 
studying dance. "Another dancer is coming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreno will dance with Benjamin in Ashton's "Thais" and "The Dream." Although 
both he and Mukhamedov "dance the same roles," he does not feel in his shadow 
or short-changed in dance opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my temperament; Mukhamedov has his temperament," Carreno said. "We 
dance how we are, even if we're both doing the prince. That is where the 
difference between dancers is -- just in how you are, the charisma, the 
temperament that you have. We can learn from each other. Even when I see Sylvie 
(Guillem), I can learn from her too. It's good to see other people like Irek or 
Sylvie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything they give me, I take the opportunity and do it," he said. "Maybe 
in 10 years I cannot say the same. But I think this is my time and my 
opportunity. I am getting what I want." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Cooper, 22, trained mostly outside the Royal Ballet system but felt the 
impact of Dowell's decision to import Russian teachers when he entered the 
school at age 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult," he said. "For me, personally, it was a big adjustment 
because my classical training hadn't been that. One of the biggest differences 
for me was the virtuosic element -- huge allegro steps that I hadn't done 
before, basically things like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level was so much greater anyway coming in from outside the system. 
Whoever I had been taught by, it would have been a great adjustment for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "But one of the good things, when I was at the school at my year, there were 
more of us from outside the Royal Ballet system than came in from the lower 
school. So we had a great atmosphere within the class. We all wanted to prove 
that we were as good as them, and I think we did." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, while he was a student, Cooper said, he "never thought I would be a 
classical ballet dancer. I didn't think that was my best thing. I always 
thought I was better at modern dance than classical. Getting into the Royal 
Ballet (two years later) changed that opinion. And getting the roles I have 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been extremely lucky. Kenneth took a liking to me early on and gave me 
solo roles to do in his ballets when I was just 18. That gave me a tremendous 
boost and a lot of publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his rapid advancement to principal status -- he will dance Forsythe's 
"Herman Schmerman Pas de Deux" with Guillem -- also got a boost from his 
height. "I'm about six foot," he said. "That was another reason I've got on so 
quickly. I'm tall. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like Darcey Bussell and Sylvie, if one of their partners goes off, 
which has happened, they call on me. That's how I started dancing with Sylvie. 
I did my first 'Swan Lake' with Darcey." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting such major roles at his young age, he admitted, "was a shock. It was a 
great shock. But I don't think too much about getting worked up about it. I put 
my mind to what I have to do and do it. I've never been that nervous about 
doing it -- yet!"

 Bruce Sansom, 30, came up through the Royal school before the Russians 
arrived, joining the company in 1982. He will dance Dowell's role -- Beliaev in 
Ashton's "A Month in the Country" -- in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Cooper, Sansom, too, didn't envision "getting as far as I have done, but 
then you never know how you are going to grow up and how your body is going to 
change and how you're going to adapt to changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very late to develop physically," he said. "I was very slender, very 
slight. I was very immature physically. I hadn't grown into my body, but also 
mentally I was immature in the lack of experience, but that is what all dancers 
suffer from." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he believes that his career has progressed steadily, "for which I'm 
grateful. By the time the foreign dancers started dancing in the company, I had 
been a principal for several years. So that wasn't really a problem. I had done 
a lot of the repertoire that I still do." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he believed he needed wider experience than he was getting, so he was 
a guest dancer with the San Francisco Ballet for a year in 1991. "I had reached 
a point where I wanted to see other dancers and work with other people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Royal) didn't mind at all. It was a wonderful time. What I really 
enjoyed (about) working in America was the incredible enthusiasm that the 
dancers had." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest of the five dancers interviewed here, he feels the pressure of time 
in a way that they don't. "There are certainly things I'd like to dance again 
which haven't been in the repertoire for a while -- MacMillan's 'Song of the 
Earth,' very definitely. If we don't do it again soon, I'll be too old. It's a 
great ballet. That goes for a few other works as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, we all know there is an end to it all, but there's a fascination 
in that as well -- that you are convincing in what you're doing regardless of 
your age. I don't feel uncomfortable. It is a youthful vocation and will 
continue to get more and more so. But until you can see a 20-year-old giving as 
mature a performance as a 35- or a 40-year-old, then it's not a problem. 
There's room for both, and both can learn from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what was so successful about the imports, the foreign dancers. You 
could sit back, watch and learn from them. Hopefully, they do the same in 
reverse."

COVER STORY; HE DIDN'T ASK FOR ALL THIS; EDDIE VEDDER ALWAYS WANTED HIS BAND 
PEARL JAM TO MAKE MUSIC THAT MATTERED. HE CAN SOMETIMES FEEL, AS KURT COBAIN 
DID, THE PRESSURE OF MATTERING TOO MUCH TO HIS FANS, BUT HE'S FINDING A WAY TO 
DEAL WITH IT.

<P>
 It's eight days after the suicide of Kurt Cobain was discovered and Eddie 
Vedder's voice still trembles as he tries to put into words his confusion and 
sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first found out, I was in a hotel room in Washington, D.C., and I just 
tore the place to shreds," says the brooding lead singer of Pearl Jam and the 
artist whose impact on a new generation of rock fans has been most often 
compared to Cobain's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I just kind of sat in the rubble, which somehow felt right . . . (it 
felt) like my world at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder and Cobain were at the forefront of a new generation of American 
singer-songwriters whose songs chiefly reflect the alienation and anger of a 
generation of young people, aged 15 to 25, who feel they have been shortchanged 
by the American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain's music was more acclaimed, but Vedder's was more popular. Pearl Jam's 
"Vs." album has outsold Nirvana's "In Utero" by nearly 4 million copies since 
they were released last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 With Cobain gone, Vedder stands alone -- and the heat was immediate. Pearl 
Jam's record company, Epic, was flooded with requests to talk to the singer and 
songwriter about Cobain's death and what it meant to rock. 
</P>
<P>
 His only public comment came from the stage of a Pearl Jam concert in Fairfax, 
Va., on the night Cobain's body was found. He told the audience, in part: 
"Sometimes, whether you like it or not, people elevate you (and) it's real easy 
to fall . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone the following week from New York, where the band was to appear on 
"Saturday Night Live," Vedder amplified on the remark and the pressures he and 
Cobain both faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think you are this grand person who has all their (expletive) together 
because you are able to put your feelings into some songs," he says softly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They write letters and come to the shows and even to the house, hoping we can 
fix everything for them. But we can't . . . because we don't have all our 
(expletive) together either. What they don't understand is that you can't save 
somebody from drowning if you're treading water yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cobain and Vedder grew up largely on their own -- unable to relate to the 
kids at high school and constantly struggling to find self-worth in troubled 
home environments. Their link was finding identity and hope in rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 When they became famous in the early '90s as the two most celebrated figures 
of the suddenly hot Seattle scene that redefined contemporary rock 'n' roll, 
they worried about what it meant. They had grown up on alternative rock and 
punk, viewing the mainstream rock world as corrupt and its stars as mostly 
poseurs. In a strange twist of emotions, they felt both unworthy of their fame 
and a bit embarrassed by it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Cobain often ridiculed rival Pearl Jam, arguing that it lacked the 
underground purity of Nirvana -- that it was simply an old-line commercial rock 
band in grunge clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cobain, who was 27 when he died, liked Vedder personally, and that made 
him feel guilty about the put-downs. "I'm not going to do that anymore," he 
said in a 1992 interview. "It hurts Eddie and he's a good guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the songs of Cobain and Vedder -- whatever the different musical 
textures of their bands -- touched a nerve in millions of teen-agers and young 
twentysomethings, many of whom were victims of broken homes and low 
self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are limits to the similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder says he's not an addict, whereas Cobain struggled in recent years with 
heroin. Vedder has largely sworn off drugs since his teens -- not complete 
abstinence, but nothing on a regular basis, he says. An observer close to the 
band says flatly, "He doesn't have a drug problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The singer often drank from a wine bottle on stage during the early stages of 
the "Vs." tour last year, but he cut back on that this year, the band observer 
says, and Vedder now describes his alcohol intake as no more than the average 
person after a hard day at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key difference is that Cobain was suspicious of his audience, 
wondering whether much of it wasn't just into Nirvana's music because it was 
the cool thing to do. He tended to isolate himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vedder is something of a missionary, a throwback to Bruce Springsteen or 
U2's Bono. He remembers the comfort and strength he found as a lonely, troubled 
teen-ager in the music of the Who's Pete Townshend -- and how he imagined 
Townshend as someone who understood. 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder has tried to be that good guy to his fans -- sometimes spending hours 
after a show talking to them or even giving out his home phone number on a 
radio call-in show so that they can reach him. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the fans are unrelenting. They write him or try to catch up to him 
on the road, asking for money or help with their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Fame) has been a difficult adjustment for everyone in the band, but 
especially difficult for Eddie because he remembers the time he needed help and 
there was no one there," says Kelly Curtis, Pearl Jam's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be fans standing outside the arena screaming and he's nice to 95 
people, but he finally has to leave and the 96th person says, 'You're an 
(expletive).' It bothers him. He feels he has let someone down." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, a 17-year veteran of the rock scene, says Vedder lets off some of the 
pressure by just disappearing after tours, sometimes for weeks at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he still tempted to run away? 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe he thinks about that every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder is far from the first rock star to worry about the burdens of being a 
"spokesman." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Dylan and John Lennon -- the two most acclaimed rock spokesmen from the 
'60s -- both complained about the pressures of being looked to by fans for 
answers to their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths of Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin have also been 
blamed in part on the pressures of being rock idols. In the '80s, Springsteen 
and Bono cited the disorienting effect of being viewed as spokesmen, though 
they adjusted to the weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Cobain didn't adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 In his suicide note, the leader of Nirvana spoke about a loss of enthusiasm 
for music and for life -- and the accompanying guilt he felt some nights 
because he was faking the enthusiasm on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand what Kurt was talking about," Vedder said, speaking from New 
York. "You just can't do it if you can't be real. I had that same conversation 
with someone the other day . . . about how much fans expect." 
</P>
<P>
 He also acknowledges times in his own life when he wondered whether life was 
worth living. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was around 15 or 16, those kind of thoughts came as often as mealtime, 
you know," he said. "I felt all alone . . . I was all alone -- except for 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then things got better. I got a job and I looked back on those times and 
wondered how I could ever have felt that way. I thought about all the music and 
all the experiences I would have missed if I had acted on those feelings. . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder paused. 
</P>
<P>
 When he resumed speaking, his voice had little of the authority it does on 
stage or on record. He sounded tentative -- as if confused over just how much 
of himself to reveal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know," he said, "there have been times over the last couple of years 
when those feelings came back. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard for those who haven't been touched by the music of Nirvana or Pearl 
Jam to understand the pressures felt by Cobain and Vedder. 
</P>
<P>
 When Andy Rooney said in a heartless "60 Minutes" commentary that he finds it 
hard to feel sympathy for Cobain or his mourning fans, he may unfortunately be 
speaking for many adults who suspect that the talk of troubled childhood and 
reluctant stardom is just rock posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron Crowe, the rock-journalist-turned-film-director, cast Vedder in a 
small role in his film "Singles," which was set against the emerging rock scene 
in Seattle, and later wrote a Rolling Stone cover story on Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would come up to me and say, 'Jesus, the pain in that guy . . . Is it 
real?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Crowe met Vedder before Pearl Jam's first album, "Ten," broke into the charts 
in 1992, and he said Vedder struck him as someone who "feels things 
tremendously . . . an open wound, in fact." 
</P>
<P>
 "I met him at a barbecue at a friend's house and I sat on the rug with Eddie 
as things were winding down that night and he just proceeded to unspool," he 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just started telling stories about all these things that were just 
crowding his head . . . and those stories ended up on that first album. . . . 
Stuff about his childhood and about people he knew and their problems. What you 
see is no pose." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pearl Jam singer, 29, looks out of place this morning among the 
businessmen in their suits and ties in the restaurant of an upscale Atlanta 
hotel, a week before the Cobain suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 He's wearing the same denim jacket and knee-length pants that he'll wear on 
stage that night at the Fox Theatre, where both shows sold out instantly. His 
hair, long and unruly, hangs across his face like a curtain, covering much of 
the angelic sweetness of a face dominated by the wary intensity of his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take some tea if you've got it," Vedder says to the waiter, with the 
politeness of someone who has worked tables himself and remembers the rudeness 
of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder was speaking to a reporter in his first interview since the September 
release of the group's "Vs." album. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about the hype thing . . . that if people start seeing your 
picture everyplace and hear all about this 'spokesman' stuff, they'll get 
turned off," he says, explaining why he refused to talk to Time magazine last 
fall for a cover story calling him "rock's new demigod." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see being on the cover of Time as an accomplishment for the band," 
he says. "I was afraid it might be a nail in the coffin." 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder still drives the same 1990 Toyota truck around Seattle that he bought 
when he was working at a service station in San Diego. When he's asked if he 
keeps the same clothes and truck to remind himself of his roots -- as a way to 
keep in touch with himself amid the glitter of the rock world -- he stares at 
his cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't need to do things like that to remind me of who I am," he says 
firmly. "But maybe it's good that other people see those things and maybe it 
sends them a message, that I still am the same person." 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder was born Edward Louis Seversen III in Evanston, Ill., a suburb of 
Chicago. His parents were divorced before his second birthday and the youngster 
grew up thinking his stepfather was his real father. Until he adopted his 
mother's maiden name, Vedder, after dropping out of high school, he was known 
as Eddie Mueller, using his stepfather's last name. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a happy childhood, he says, but he found a comfort and excitement in 
music. Though the Who would eventually be his greatest inspiration, the first 
record that caught Vedder's ear was the Jackson 5's "ABC." 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder didn't hear the Who until the family -- which includes three younger 
brothers -- moved to San Diego County in the mid-'70s. A baby-sitter brought 
the "Who's Next" album over one night and he listened to it on his stepfather's 
earphones. 
</P>
<P>
 As things grew tense in his family, he listened more and more to rock. He 
talked his folks into giving him a guitar for his birthday when he was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was 15, his mother and stepfather had separated and he was 
paying his own rent rather than living at home, filled with the bitterness and 
anger that is expressed in his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those feelings flare up when he's asked what high school he attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like not to be associated with any of that," Vedder says abruptly. "They 
didn't treat me well." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Vedder softens his answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, maybe it was just that I wasn't going to like anybody because I had to 
work and I had to explain to my teachers why I wasn't keeping up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd fall asleep and things in class and they'd lecture me about the reality 
of their classroom. I said one day, 'You want to see my reality?' I opened up 
my backpack to where you usually keep your pencils. That's where I kept my 
bills . . . electric bills, rent . . . That was my reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder, who supported himself by working at a Long's Drug Store in Encinitas, 
eventually dropped out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 The anger returns when he's asked about that period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resented everybody around me who drove up in a car that someone provided 
for them . . . (with) insurance that someone provided for them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be underneath some shelf putting price tags on tomato soup and I'd watch 
them come in. . . . Obnoxious with their (expletive) prom outfits on, buying 
condoms and being loud about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd think, 'Those (expletives).' Maybe I would have been doing that too, if 
the circumstances were different. . . . Maybe that would have made me more 
forgiving, but I wasn't very forgiving at all. Everything was just such a 
(expletive) struggle for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder's bitterness pushed him closer to punk rock, because he wanted the 
harder, more aggressive sound. 
</P>
<P>
 With little money or goals, he had begun sinking into a shadowy world that 
brought out his survival instincts.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is a thing that happens when you are not as privileged and you start 
hanging out with a seedier crowd because you can afford to do the same things," 
he says. "And all of a sudden the big night out is sitting in somebody's 
trailer, smoking something or getting hold of something to put up your nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is real easy to get into the lower depths and get intertwined. But I was 
always aware of that kind of thing. . . . I didn't want to be put on a leash by 
any kind of conservative, constrictive parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to be in that world, but I also didn't want to be in the web of 
this other thing. I was getting swallowed up in it, but something made me 
realize it was time to get away or I was going to be just another loser." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother and brothers had already moved back to Chicago, and he decided to 
join them. After a couple of years there, Vedder returned to San Diego in 1984, 
accompanied by his girlfriend Beth Liebling, a writer. By this time, he had 
learned the identity of his real father and had picked up a high school 
equivalency diploma. He felt it would help him get a better job. Music remained 
just a hobby, not a career choice for him. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked nights as a hotel security guard and spent his days making demo 
tapes on a home recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, he got involved in the San Diego music scene, spending a short 
period in a band called Bad Radio. Though he had been in a couple of garage 
bands earlier in Encinitas, the transition to a real band was difficult for the 
shy Vedder. For the first show, he wore a mask -- actually, goggles with the 
lenses painted over -- so that he wouldn't have to look at the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually he quit the group, feeling that the members weren't serious about 
things. While he was looking for another band situation, Jack Irons, a friend 
who was formerly in the Red Hot Chili Peppers, gave him a tape from a Seattle 
musician who was putting together a new group. 
</P>
<P>
 That musician, guitarist Stone Gossard, had been in Mother Love Bone, a highly 
regarded group whose promise ended when singer Andrew Wood died of a heroin 
overdose in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to the tape, Vedder went surfing and the music played over and 
over in his head. In the company of the waves, he began framing lyrics to go 
with the music. 
</P>
<P>
 He raced back home to his recorder, and with the sand still on his feet he 
sang the words to the song that eventually became "Alive," one of the 
centerpieces on the first Pearl Jam album. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the song, with its screaming chorus of "I'm still alive," has been 
widely viewed as a statement of youthful self-affirmation, Vedder designed it 
as the story of a mother being drawn sexually to her teen-age son because she 
sees traces of her late husband in him. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience -- which Vedder insists is not autobiographical -- damages the 
son psychologically, turning him into a serial killer (detailed in the song 
"Once") who is executed in prison ("Footsteps"). It's not hard to see the story 
as a sort of Generation X update of the confused youth in the Who's "Tommy." 
</P>
<P>
 Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament, who had also been in Mother Love Bone, were 
thrilled by Vedder's contribution and invited him to Seattle. Pearl Jam was 
born, and within a year the group's first album was No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, there were some reasons to suspect that Vedder and Pearl Jam were 
rock 'n' roll opportunists. The band -- which also includes drummer Dave 
Abbruzzese and guitarist Mike McCready -- was from Seattle and wore grunge 
clothes, but the music didn't have the revolutionary aura of Nirvana's. It was 
more radio-friendly and in line with '70s hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder looked like the star pupil from the Jim Morrison School of Rock Singers 
as he prowled the stage, rolling his eyes with brooding anxiety and thrashing 
around as if possessed by some foreign spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that endeared the group to mainstream rock radio programmers, many of 
whom had grown up on '70s and '80s rock and found it hard adjusting to Nirvana 
and the Seattle grunge sound. The music itself appealed to both the young 
alternative-rock audience and older, more traditional fans. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sound itself was rather conventional, Vedder's voice offered something 
powerful and real. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Metallica brought brains and viewpoint to the mindless assault of 
heavy metal, Pearl Jam brought a new, healthier and more relevant perspective 
to hard-rock, getting rid of the macho posturing and cartoon-show gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
 As fully as the themes of Nirvana songs, Vedder's lyrics reflected the 
loneliness and confusion of growing up, often with frequent physical and 
psychological abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 As both a performer and writer, Vedder has shown increasing individuality and 
depth -- at times now asserting a spark onstage that suggests the ability to be 
a major rock voice throughout the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder sometimes worries that his voice is too "smooth" to convey the raw 
urgency of the lyrics, but there is a force to his vocals that expresses 
alienation and pain in a way that becomes surprisingly life-affirming. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Jeremy," a song about suicide from the debut album, he declares: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daddy didn't give attention  
</P>
<P>
 To the fact that Mommy didn't care.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Cobain, however, Vedder says he was writing things he had seen and 
experienced. He wasn't trying to summarize the mood of his generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a good enough writer to have an agenda or come up with a message and 
try to put it into a song," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more like you write what comes to you. . . . You try to reflect the mood 
of the songs. Take 'Rearviewmirror' (a song from "Vs." that includes the line, 
Tried to endure what I could not forgive ). 
</P>
<P>
 "We start off with the music and it kind of propels the lyrics. It made me 
feel like I was in a car, leaving something, a bad situation. There's an 
emotion there. I remembered all the times I wanted to leave. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The 4,500-seat Fox Theatre is one of the nation's prized concert halls -- a 
former movie theater that offers acoustics and intimacy absent in the usual 
basketball arenas. There was enough demand for Pearl Jam tickets to sell out 
the theater for a week, and scalpers were asking $300 per ticket the night of 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage, Vedder is sitting in a deserted basement hallway, holding the 
Telecaster guitar that he has carried since Encinitas.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can't come from where I came from and not appreciate what has happened to 
the band," he says, his head lowered. "The one thing about going from the 
audience to the stage in just three years is that you know how it feels to be 
down there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in the power of the music. To me, this isn't just a fad. This is a 
positive thing. We went from an era when rock 'n' roll meant wearing a bustier 
as a woman and these spandex things and guys trying to portray someone that 
wasn't realistic. We are trying to make it seem real . . . relate to our 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam was supposed to begin its U.S. summer tour in July, vowing to keep 
tickets (including service fee) under $20 -- a dramatic step away from 
escalating prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dates have been postponed for at least two months, in part because the 
death of Cobain "knocked the wind out of the band," said manager Kelly Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder doubts whether the band will tour the rest of the year -- at least in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron Crowe believes Vedder will learn from the suicide of Cobain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is going to send him off the deep end," Crowe said. "I know 
he had a lot of those feelings, those impulses himself, and I'm just thinking 
he was able to almost see what would have happened had he taken that jump . . . 
and it's not pretty. I think it is going to help strengthen him. I think he'll 
deal with it properly." 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder began dealing publicly with Cobain's death on the "Saturday Night Live" 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 He displayed the letter K, for Kurt, on his T-shirt and put his hand on his 
heart at one point, and ended the band's "Daughter" by singing a bluesy snippet 
from Neil Young's "My My, Hey Hey." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the song that includes the line quoted in Cobain's suicide note: "It's 
better to burn out than to fade away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Vedder didn't sing that line. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he sang these Young lyrics: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rock and roll can never die  
</P>
<P>
 There's more to the picture than meets the eye  
</P>
<P>
 *

 Asked why he omitted the "burn out" line, he said, "I guess I could have 
turned it around and asked, 'Is it better to burn out?' but it wasn't something 
I had planned out. I was just following my emotions at the time. The other 
lines just meant more to me."

 Vedder expects to spend much of his time in coming weeks in his Seattle 
basement, making music. That's the way he has always been best able to deal 
with his problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that process has already begun," he says finally, a note of resolve 
in his voice. "Seeing what can happen (to Cobain) makes me realize I've got to 
work on it . . . to avoid getting swallowed up too."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: COLLEGE CUT-UPS; 
SOPHOMORIC, INSENSITIVE AND PROUD OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Put the movie's title, "PCU," together with its slogan, "Flunk 'em if they 
can't take a joke," and you begin to get the picture: So it's sophomoric -- 
it's supposed to be. "PCU" is a comedy about sophomores (and freshmen, juniors 
and seniors) at an insufferably politically correct liberal arts school ripe 
for ridicule and rebellion.  
</P>
<P>
 Just the sort of campus -- like Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn. -- 
that, coincidentally, producer Paul Schiff and writers Adam Leff and Zak Penn 
found a tad oppressive as undergraduates, even if they attended a decade apart 
and didn't discover the connection until their first story meeting at Schiff's 
office at 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a particularly egocentric way to develop movies," says Schiff ("My 
Cousin Vinny"), recalling his amusement to discover that Leff and Penn 
similarly railed against the student body's rigid moral codes in the late '80s 
as he did in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff had asked to meet with the screenwriters after reading "their first 
draft of 'Last Action Hero,' " he says, as the writers nod in bemusement on 
Schiff's couch for an interview. The duo, then 23, became overnight sensations 
for selling "Last Action Hero" on spec to Columbia in 1991 for $500,000, 
although it later was rewritten by five other writers -- and transformed into 
one of Hollywood's most lamented bombs in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 "PCU," which opened Friday, is a different story. Not only did Schiff think 
satirizing how PC police have overtaken college campuses was a great subject 
for a youth-oriented comedy, he, and the writers, could relate.  
</P>
<P>
 "My psychoanalysis class was taught by a Freudian. I remember on the first 
day, (the professor) said, 'I'm a black lesbian trapped in the body of a white 
male oppressor.' I thought he was kidding," says Penn, the more talkative of 
the team. "Then I looked around and the class was filled with all these ardent 
feminists and they weren't laughing. In the first week, I thought it was 
hilarious; in the second week, I'd wince and think, this place is frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 In "PCU," the feminists call themselves the Womynists and, together with the 
Causeheads, face off against a suited band of insurgent frat-boy types trying 
to make a comeback; the Stoners, and most of all, residents of the Pit, a 
run-down haven for the independently minded that is run by all-American 
screw-off Droz (Jeremy Piven). The Pit is based on Eclectic House at Wesleyan, 
founded as a literary society in the 19th Century that by Schiff's era, when he 
was its president, had become a residence for iconoclasts.  
</P>
<P>
 In trying to appease all factions, PCU President Garcia-Thompson (Jessica 
Walter) tries to close the Pit down, fining its residents. Instead, the 
Pitsters decide to raise the money by holding an old-fashioned beer bust that 
must attract a cross-section of the student body to be successful. First, 
though, everyone has to learn to get along (at least somewhat).  
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers previewed the picture with college crowds around the country, 
including Wesleyan, where students laughed at much of the slapstick, but there 
was some hissing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sucks," said one woman as she stormed up the aisle, according to a 
report in the Hartford Courant. "Thank you," wisecracked Schiff, who was 
sitting near the exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn would rather not hear comparisons to "Animal House," but figures it's 
probably a lost cause. The big difference is generational: the pre-Vietnam era 
of the early '60s in "Animal House" versus protest-everything '90s of "PCU." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff chimes in: "The thing the movie objects to and the position the movie 
takes is those positions are so strident and so dogmatic, there's no room for 
discussion. Once that happens, free expression that should be encouraged and 
nurtured on campuses becomes very difficult to pull off -- and that's where the 
movie (humor) lives."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: WHAT A CONCEPT: JOEL 
SILVER MEETS JOAN OF ARC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You remember the dueling Robin Hoods, Christopher Columbuses and Wyatt Earps. 
Now it seems heavenly voices have been bending studio ears: There are no fewer 
than three versions of the life of Joan of Arc in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's Touchstone is developing a "Joan of Arc" with director Brian Gibson 
("What's Love Got to Do With It"); producer Joel Silver is tackling another for 
Warner Bros. and Kathryn Bigelow ("Point Break"), currently involved in 
"Strange Days," will develop Jay Cocks' "The Company of Angels" for 20th 
Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joan was one of history's most conflicted characters, a young girl who didn't 
want to be chosen and didn't really understand why she was," says Touchstone 
screenwriter Paul McCudden. "She was a female in the most male of worlds. She 
was 17 when she heard the saints' voices, sending her on her mission to rid 
France of the British; she burned to death at 19. Part of the problem with all 
of the previous films is they never really portray her as a young girl, but 
someone who was unshakable in her quest, without any doubts." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson -- who says he has wanted to do a project on the patron saint of France 
for more than a decade -- is convinced his version, expected to be the first 
out of the gate in mid-'95, will be markedly different from Bigelow's or 
Silver's. McCudden says he's written the piece as more of a personal journey.  
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach Silver were unsuccessful, but those familiar with Silver's 
testosterone-charged script say that it reads like "Bruce Willis in a dress, 
brandishing a sword" -- plenty of battle scenes and a no-nonsense, take-charge 
Joan. 
</P>
<P>
 The version Cocks (who co-wrote "The Age of Innocence" screenplay) is doing 
for Bigelow will also be action-packed, but reportedly includes more of Joan's 
internal struggle in dealing with her mission from God. Bigelow's staff 
declined to be interviewed about the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Like studio executives at Fox and Warner Bros., Touchstone's president, David 
Hoberman, as well as producers Charlie Evans Jr. and Carroll Kemp, say that 
they can't let concerns over a first finish consume their focus. Production is 
tentatively set to start this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen how any of the new versions will depart from the 
previous stories about Joan, who in the 15th Century helped defeat the English 
in their attempted invasion of France (and was later burned at the stake as a 
suspected witch). 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Carl Dreyer's 1928 silent "The Passion of Joan of Arc" with Maria 
Flaconetti; Victor Fleming's 1948 "Joan of Arc" with Ingrid Bergman, and Otto 
Preminger's 1957 "Saint Joan" with Jean Seberg, there is an authentic French 
version. The two-part, five-hour "Jeanne La Pucel Les Batailles" and "Jeanne La 
Pucel Les Prisons" ("The Battles and Imprisonment of Joan of Arc"), directed by 
Jacques Rivette, was shown this spring at the Berlin Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his competitors, Gibson says, "I don't want their versions of Joan as 
'Terminatrix' to poison the well. To Joel, I would say good luck with all of 
your 'Lethal Weapon' movies. You do them well, but don't move outside your 
area. You'll tip over." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the subplot behind Gibson's version is almost as interesting as 
the film itself. The film is being developed from Touchstone's discretionary 
fund, a pot of money set aside for studio executives to develop projects. A 
lump sum originally had been reserved to produce a movie about a snuff film 
called "The Brave," a screenplay written by McCudden, to be produced by Kemp, 
Evans and Aziz Ghazal. It was Ghazal who found Gregory Mcdonald's book "The 
Brave," about a broken man who agrees to let himself be snuffed in a movie if 
his family gets the profits. Ghazal tapped his friend McCudden to adapt it for 
the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Ghazal was pitching the project to Touchstone, reports surfaced that he 
was simultaneously negotiating with Jodie Foster's Egg Pictures. His personal 
life began to come apart as well, and on Dec. 1, 1993, Ghazal shot himself to 
death after bludgeoning his estranged wife and 13-year-old daughter to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghazal's death still haunts McCudden. But he, like Kemp and Evans, still 
believes in the project. The producers are shopping "The Brave" to studios 
around town while trying to remain focused on "Joan."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: ALL-SINGING, ALL-DANCING; 
WHAT A FANTASTICK CONCEPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Try to remember the kind of September . . . 
</P>
<P>
 . . . when you could count on a live-action movie musical or two passing 
through the local Bijou. Try real hard: By most accountings, there hasn't been 
a true hit musical since "Grease" in 1978, or a great one since "West Side 
Story" in 1961. There's only been one full-on, non-animated film musical 
released so far this decade, 1992's lambasted "Newsies." When the latest 
botched attempt, "I'll Do Anything," was belatedly released this year with its 
songs hacked out, the genre was so widely presumed dead that few bothered 
ringing death knells. 
</P>
<P>
 But hold the hearse. In 1995, a veritable tidal wave of two film musicals will 
be released -- both from the same brave director, Michael Ritchie. 
</P>
<P>
 United Artists announced a week and a half ago that Ritchie would be at the 
helm of a big-screen adaptation of the 34-year-old, nostalgia-themed Broadway 
hit "The Fantasticks" (source of the standard "Try to Remember"), set to shoot 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And now comes word that Ritchie is preparing an original musical for HBO 
before that. "Peace of Mind," a singing 'n' dancing satire set in a 
contemporary small town, is centered around "America's love affair with the 
gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchie's one-man musical revivalism begs the obvious question: 
</P>
<P>
 What is he, nuts? 
</P>
<P>
 "The catalogue of attempts to revive the form that have failed and disappeared 
is frightening," Ritchie admits. "But it is the great American art form. It is 
uniquely ours, particularly in the sense of film grammar. . . . I just hope 
that in a way for the '90s these two films can not only pay a little 
long-overdue homage but also educate -- not educate, that's too pompous a word 
-- initiate a whole new audience, particularly young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like the character in 'Field of Dreams': Build the musical, and they 
will come. It's so bizarre that, with the musical being the only sure-fire 
success story on Broadway, the movies have been so shy about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchie's latest release, "Cops & Robbersons," might not seem to bode well for 
prospects of his reintroducing a lost art form. But viewers with longer 
memories will recall Ritchie's string of critically hailed '70s satires, 
including "The Candidate" and "Smile," or the Emmy-winning 1992 HBO picture 
heralded as his artistic comeback, "The Positively True Adventures of the 
Alleged Texas Cheerleader Murdering Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace of Mind" reunites the director with two "Cheerleader Murdering" 
cohorts, screenwriter Jane Anderson and composer Lucy Simon, with lyricist 
Susan Birkenhead ("Jelly's Last Jam") completing the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an absolute in-your-face musical," Ritchie assures. "This is not a film 
with incidental music; this is not a film with performance music that takes 
place on a stage like 'Cabaret.' This is a movie in which people sing their 
thoughts and feelings, frequently to each other. It's a picture in which people 
dance in public places. It's all the kind of dangerous things that were cut out 
of 'I'll Do Anything' and that we're bold enough to think we can pull off. 
</P>
<P>
 "And indeed it seemed to us that a subject like the madness surrounding guns 
and gun ownership had to be treated on a slightly surreal level, that the kind 
of inherent insanity that is going on in this country today could only be 
understood if you stepped back from it stylistically with the kind of unique 
overview that a musical format gives you." 
</P>
<P>
 No casting decisions have been announced on either movie. 
</P>
<P>
 These may be projects to warm a hopeful film buff's heart. For a skeptic, 
though, you need look no further than Albert Brooks, who's starring in 
Ritchie's non-musical summer release, "The Scout" -- and whose last movie was 
(gulp!) "I'll Do Anything." 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael thinks he wants to do a musical again, huh?" winces Brooks, just out 
of earshot of Ritchie on the "Scout" set. "God bless him. "Maybe he can make it 
work, and I will be there opening night. But," adds the star, "I'm here to tell 
you, it's the silliest idea I've ever heard. I'm living proof."

A DIFFERENT 'TWILIGHT' FALLS ON NEW YORK; ANNA DEAVERE SMITH'S TAPER-BORN RIOT 
REMEMBRANCE HAS 16 MORE CHARACTERS ON BROADWAY -- AND A STRONGER POINT OF VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, Don Shirley is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago this weekend, Los Angeles was burning. One year ago, Anna 
Deavere Smith was busy preparing her one-woman show about the people who 
witnessed those fires: "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," which opened at the Mark 
Taper Forum last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Now "Twilight" is on Broadway. And Smith's compilation of re-enacted 
interviews with a wide variety of individuals who had something to say about 
the events of April, 1992, is a big hit with New York critics, if not yet a 
sellout with Broadway audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Twilight" that's in New York, however, is not the same show Angelenos 
saw. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Smith played 26 roles. While this may sound like a formidable 
undertaking, it was a snap compared to what she's doing in New York. There, 
she's playing 42 roles. Only 20 of the New York characterizations were created 
in Los Angeles. For New York, Smith dropped six characters and added 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of memorizing to do when I got here," Smith recalled during a 
phone interview from New York last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Her journey to Broadway took a long time. Smith, who lives in Northern 
California, was in New York opening "Fires in the Mirror," a one-woman show 
about a racial incident in New York, when rioting broke out in Los Angeles. 
"Fires" was a hit, but it never went to Broadway. Yet it inspired Taper 
artistic director Gordon Davidson to ask Smith to do a similar show about L.A. 
-- a decision that prompted a few local artists to criticize the selection of a 
non-Angeleno who wasn't even in town during the incidents she would be 
depicting. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith spent much of the next year in Los Angeles, preparing "Twilight." Emily 
Mann, who had previously created the theatrical docudrama "Execution of 
Justice," was brought in as director. Meanwhile, events continued to erupt as 
Smith worked. 
</P>
<P>
 A verdict was reached in the federal trial of the police officers in the 
Rodney King beating case just two months before "Twilight" opened, but the 
officers weren't sentenced until a month after it closed. As she performed, the 
city was still "on the edge" over the events she was depicting, she said. "The 
audience was still trying to get over a trauma. And I knew that I would be part 
of the dramatic tension I was establishing." Another layer of tension was added 
by the fact that the subjects of Smith's research were likely to be in the 
audience in Los Angeles -- not a possibility that crops up very often in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Taper "Twilight" had closed, Smith attended the closing arguments in 
the Reginald Denny beating trial, which affected her perspective, she said. And 
the end of that trial gave her access to certain figures who weren't previously 
reachable, such as Denny co-assailant Keith Watson, one of the characters added 
for New York. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just new characters who were imported for New York. A new director, 
George C. Wolfe, took over as well. The new version opened March 23 at the 
theater Wolfe runs, the New York Public Theatre, then moved to Broadway, where 
it opened at the Cort Theatre on April 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stakes were high in New York because it's the artistic mecca," Smith 
said, "but the stakes were just as high in Los Angeles in a different way. 
There was a lot of emotion in L.A., and I really cherish that experience." 
</P>
<P>
 That emotion came from many different sources, she said. Growing up on the 
East Coast, she had thought of race primarily in black/white terms, but the 
multicultural dimensions of the events in L.A. "began to shake up what I 
thought race was. It's not a two-pronged story." 
</P>
<P>
 Her newfound awareness of this subject proved contagious. Referring to Wolfe, 
she said that "there were times when his head was spinning" over this subject. 
She said she heard and read criticism that in the L.A. production she failed to 
arrive at any particular conclusion, but "I was very cautious of the kind of 
people who wanted to wrap it all up. There hasn't been that much in the past 20 
years that has encouraged people to go beyond the bounds of ethnicity," so she 
felt it was her job simply to let all viewpoints be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Her experience in Los Angeles was a form of "community theater," she said, 
hastily adding that she intends nothing pejorative by using that phrase. "I was 
there to be a part of the L.A. community." Consequently, she conducted a large 
number of post-play discussions in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for such discussions after performances of "Twilight" on Broadway. 
"In New York, the boundaries between me and the audience are much clearer. And 
there is a point in the show in which my point of view becomes much more 
apparent than it was in Los Angeles" -- or, indeed, in her "Fires in the 
Mirror." She believes that the New York "Twilight" is more "conclusive" than 
the Los Angeles one. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the literal conclusion of the show has changed. In Los Angeles, Smith 
ended with rather vague remarks by Gladis Sibrian of the Salvadoran rebel group 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, USA, whose connection to the riots 
was unclear. Now Sibrian's comments are no longer in the show. It ends with 
words by Twilight Bey, an appropriately named gang truce organizer. He appeared 
five characters from the end of the L.A. version. 
</P>
<P>
 "The end in L.A. was really hard to come up with," Smith said. There were four 
dramaturges working on the show -- "that would be a nightmare for most writers, 
but I made myself more available than most writers." Even the designers were 
"groaning about how the show should end. I needed distance to see how I wanted 
to end it. I needed time with the text by myself" -- for which she took a trip 
to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the beginning of the show is no longer the same. Chung Lee of the 
Korean American Victims Assn. replaced sculptor Rudy Salas Sr. as the initial 
character (though Salas remains in the show). Smith credited Wolfe with shaping 
the new beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twilight" now also has an intermission, for which Smith credited her New York 
dramaturge, "Angels in America" playwright Tony Kushner. She compared adding 
the intermission to the experience of "building a house and suddenly deciding 
to add a spiral staircase." But she's happy with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith felt that the lack of an intermission in Los Angeles turned her 
interview with Reginald Denny into "the center of the piece." This "may have 
made sense, because we still didn't know what would happen" in the trial of 
Denny's assailants. But now that incident is largely resolved, and she has 
returned to what she describes as her normal disapproval of the notion of a 
center. "I don't believe in depending on centrality -- it's a false concept to 
expect everything to go to the center or move to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 She admits there are still "certain sequences that gain the audience's 
attention more than others" -- sequences she labeled "whirlwinds." But "it 
doesn't boil down to one person," as she felt it did in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 With the addition of many more characters and 40 minutes, the New York 
production has faster transitions and more intercutting between characters, 
with seven characters returning for second appearances. Smith attributed the 
idea of bringing back some of the characters to director Peter Sellars, who 
spoke to her after seeing the show in Los Angeles. Such interruptions 
realistically reflect the style of communications in L.A., she said. After she 
realized this, "we went kinda crazy at first and we wouldn't let anyone finish 
a speech." Now the show has only one-tenth of the interruptions that it 
initially had in the New York rehearsal process. 
</P>
<P>
 Several prominent non-L.A. characters -- Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), singer 
Jessye Norman, attorney Lani Guinier -- were added in New York to give the show 
a more national perspective. On the other hand, prominent L.A. attorney and 
former police commissioner Stanley Sheinbaum was dropped between Los Angeles 
and New York because Smith eventually felt his material was too L.A.-specific. 
However, this last deletion "breaks my heart," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bloody battle when the fellas suggested I remove" Sheinbaum, Smith 
said. He was a gracious host for her in Los Angeles, she said, but he's also "a 
big metaphor with me in my life -- he's willing not to be on a side for the 
benefit of something bigger." When Sheinbaum recently received an ACLU award, 
Smith performed excerpts from her Sheinbaum interview that hadn't been seen at 
the Taper. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the figures who made the final cut in New York are nonetheless 
represented by different material than they were in Los Angeles. One of them is 
former police chief Daryl Gates. "When I went to Italy, I listened to his tapes 
again. Now he talks more specifically about the events." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith professed surprise that the reactions of the New York audience are as 
close as they are to those of the Angelenos who saw the show. However, she said 
there are a few clear-cut differences. One line that doesn't get the same kind 
of laugh in New York as it did in Los Angeles comes when a talent agent reports 
hearing a rumor that "they're burning down the Beverly Center." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith hopes that others will eventually perform the "Twilight" material, just 
as a cast of four recently did her previously one-woman "Fires in the Mirror" 
in a Minnesota production. But in the meantime, she plans to take the show on a 
12-week tour following Broadway, where it's scheduled to remain through Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because there have been so many changes in this extremely L.A.-oriented 
production, how about a return to L.A.? Smith referred the question to her 
managing producer, Ben Mordecai. He said that should the show return, it 
probably would play the Doolittle, not the Taper, but no decisions have yet 
been made. The first call he would make on the subject, he said, would be to 
his "Twilight" co-producer, the Taper's Gordon Davidson. Through a spokeswoman, 
Davidson expressed enthusiasm for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Further developments in the ongoing Rodney King saga occurred recently, and 
there may be more. But Smith foresees no further changes in the show. 
"Twilight" appears to be in its final form, at last -- 2,500 miles from the 
city that gave it birth.

SID BERNSTEIN'S DREAM: THE BEATLES AT BETHEL '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Milward 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Woodstock inspires all kinds of dreamers. Sid Bernstein made his name 
promoting concerts by the Beatles. He also discovered the Young Rascals, and 
managed them for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, he's taught a course on the entertainment business at New 
York's New School for Social Research, hosted his own public access television 
show, and worked as a consultant. But around 1986, when an acquaintance took 
him to see Max Yasgur's farm, he got the urge to get back into promotion, and 
set out to stage a 20th-anniversary concert in Bethel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to do warm-up festivals in 1987 and 1988," says Bernstein, a sweet, 
potbellied man of 75, sitting in the living room of the Manhattan apartment 
that also serves as his office. "But I made the mistake of saying that I was 
broke. Word got around that Sid takes the bus to Bethel, and it was seen as 
something of a put-down." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein figured he was out of the game when Woodstock Ventures came courting 
Bethel in 1992, but those negotiations stalled when the county and town 
appeared resistant to even a scaled-down festival for 150,000 people. The 
Multiple Sclerosis Society then began bargaining with the town, but when 
financing for an adult-oriented fest for even 80,000 proved problematic, the 
ball finally came down in Bernstein's court. 
</P>
<P>
 By a vote of 3 to 2, the Bethel Town Board gave Sid Bernstein Ltd. the 
go-ahead to start planning a festival for 80,000 on the same weekend as 
Woodstock '94. As Bernstein could not use the Woodstock name for his event, it 
was dubbed "Bethel '94." Facing deadlines in Bethel, Bernstein's financing for 
the $10 million he figures it'll take to mount Bethel '94 remains shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Sid and all the other options fail," says Allan Scott, town supervisor of 
Bethel, "then we're back to square one -- a disorganized scenario where people 
will just show up and we'll just have to make the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein has also made an offer of $25 million to have the Beatles reunite 
for an appearance at Bethel '94. Bernstein added that if the remaining members 
of the Fab Four preferred to appear as solo acts, they could sing from three 
separate stages. Otherwise, Bernstein has announced that Richie Havens, 
Melanie, John Sebastian and Tom Paxton will appear at the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I happen to believe in dreams," says Bernstein of what looks to be an uphill 
battle to produce Bethel '94. He also adds that his six children, some of whom 
are working with him on the project, "have never been prouder of me."John

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL: A SUMMARY OF SELECTED CITY HALL ACTIONS THIS 
PAST WEEK AFFECTING CENTRAL LOS ANGELES.; CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * SPEED HUMPS: Instructed the Department of Transportation to proceed with a 
plan to install speed humps in neighborhoods citywide. The speed humps -- 
smaller than speed bumps -- will be installed in neighborhoods on a priority 
basis, based in part on the number of accidents and prevailing speeds on given 
streets. But before officials consider an installation request, three-quarters 
of the residents of an affected block must approve of the proposal. Several 
council members said they already have requests from citizens willing to pay 
for the humps, which cost about $2,000 each. The cost will be spread among the 
residents of a block requesting them. Plans call for the possibility of city 
funding for the humps in neighborhoods whose residents cannot afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 * L.A. FIESTA BROADWAY: Approved the following street closures until 5 a.m. 
Monday due to the L.A. Fiesta Broadway, which is expected to draw 500,000 
today: Broadway between 1st and 11th streets, Spring Street between Temple and 
9th streets, Hill Street between 5th and 11th streets, Main Street between 9th 
and 11th streets. The closures began Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 * HISTORIC-CULTURAL MONUMENT: Approved placing the Petroleum Building at 714 
W. Olympic Blvd. on the city's list of historic-cultural monuments. The 
11-story building, built in 1925, features a lobby patterned after a Florentine 
palace of the early Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD OFFERED IN MURDER: Approved offering a $15,000 reward for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for 
the death of Lourdes Urmeneta. Urmeneta, 81, was struck in the head by an 
assailant using some type of weapon while she was parking her car near her home 
in the 200 block of West 120th Street on March 11. She died two days later. HOW 
THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * CAR ALARMS: Approved an ordinance to ban the sale and use of car alarms that 
make noise while no break-in is being attempted. These alarms, which emit beeps 
or chirps when they are on, have caused numerous complaints from citizens who 
say the continual noise is a nuisance. A fine of $30 would be imposed for 
violators, but ticketed people would have six months to change their vehicle's 
alarm system without penalty. Passed 12-0. Voting yes: Mike Hernandez, Nate 
Holden, Jackie Goldberg, Rudy Svorinich Jr. Absent: Richard Alatorre, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

 Countries are like people -- you have to evaluate their performance. And when 
you evaluate this country, what you find is that we are very high on civil 
liberties but actually we're quite weak on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 I can open a porno shop if I want to. That's a civil liberty. But we're weak 
in terms of the right to housing. Many people need to see that the right to 
housing is a human right, and we have very serious human rights abuses being 
committed right here by virtue of people not having housing. 
</P>
<P>
 We're also weak in terms of the right to medical care. We're weak in terms of 
the right to an education. Those rights are part of the constitutional 
offerings of many young nations, many new nations. 
</P>
<P>
 In our Constitution, we have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness, which are abstractions. People are looking for concrete rights. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important that people see the relationship between the problems in the 
United States and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at our own city. Right now we have as many as a half-million Salvadorans 
in Los Angeles. We didn't have very many at all until U.S. foreign policy began 
to include assisting the military in El Salvador. And we were responsible for 
assisting in the death of some 80,000 Salvadorans. While that was taking place 
in their country, they were fleeing to our country. We drove them here. 
</P>
<P>
 The same could be said for Guatemala. For 40 years now, Guatemala has 
essentially been a military police state. That has driven many Guatemalans to 
the United States. So we have to realize where the people come from that are 
filling our streets, and we have to realize we helped draw them here. 
</P>
<P>
 The very monies that were spent to prop up the militaries in El Salvador, in 
Honduras, in Guatemala, throughout Latin America are monies that are not spent 
on the problems in the cities in this country.  
</P>
<P>
 We in the United States have always believed that we could control any country 
if we controlled their military. The tragedy of this thinking is that by 
support ing the war system, we are supporting entities that exist only to 
control their own people. The best thing that could happen is the elimination 
of this system. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1948, Costa Rica disbanded its army. As a result, they have an education 
system and they have a health system. 
</P>
<P>
 When Guatemala disbands its army, it will have an education system and it will 
have a health system. 
</P>
<P>
 When the United States stops giving half of its resources to a 
military-industrial complex, we will have a functional education system. 
</P>
<P>
 What we have to understand is the fact that the military is the obstacle.  
</P>
<P>
 The culture of militarism, the idea that the way to deal with the Americas is 
simply to have strong armies, is bankrupt and the people in those countries 
know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Just look at the Zapatista rebels in Mexico today. What the hell did you 
expect? Did you expect them to have their kids live on one tortilla a day for 
the next 10 years? It's the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember one time when I was working as a missionary I had to baptize all 
these babies, and they all looked awful. Dirty, sick. I think one of them might 
have been dead. And I said I'd never do that again. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaccinate them first. God doesn't need them baptized. I don't need them 
baptized. We're going to vaccinate them first. We're not going to spend any 
more time baptizing dead children.

 In a front-page article, the Wall Street Journal on April 21 told the story of 
Tony Bogard, the former gang member slain Jan. 13, who was a driving force 
behind the ongoing truce between the Crips and Bloods gangs in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Headlined "The Rise and Fall of Hope in L.A.: Tony Bogard's Story," it 
recounted Bogard's optimism after he formed Hands Across Watts Inc., a 
nonprofit entity to promote the truce and improve life in Watts, and his 
disappointment at the obstacles he faced in drawing corporate support for his 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Bogard often seemed disappointed by what the outside world had to offer 
compared to the status he enjoyed in the gang world of South-Central Los 
Angeles," the Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Tony had been the equivalent of a CEO,' says Ms. (Barbara Cottman) Becnel, 
the author, but to many in the mainstream he was just another gang member."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The destiny of Africa's scattered people has been decided in more countries 
than popular history has acknowledged. Mainstream history does not reveal how 
Africans benefited from France's humil iating defeat at Puebla, Mexico, on May 
5, 1862. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinco de Mayo is a fitting and spirited annual celebration that reminds us of 
Mexico's heroic though short-lived victory over Napoleon III's larger and 
better-armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two very good reasons why black people should also celebrate the 
French defeat at the hands of Mexican forces. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Napoleon supported the slave-holding Confederacy, and second, Benito 
Juarez, the president of Mexico, had given land to anti-colonial black 
Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon had hoped that the Confederacy would quickly win the Civil War, 
retain slavery and supply French textile mills with cotton. Napoleon had been 
encouraged by the major Confederate victory over Union forces at Bull Run. He 
envisioned an alliance between himself and slave-holding Southerners that would 
guarantee raw material for French industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon was well on his way to satisfying this ambition when the defenders at 
Puebla, though outmanned and outgunned, interrupted his imperialist ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of Confederate ally Napoleon was a historic event that descendants 
of enslaved Africans and all others who uphold democracy should celebrate with 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez had given land to a faction of the black Seminole freedom fighters who 
had carried on a long and courageous war of liberation against Spanish and 
American colonizers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was certainly in the interest of blacks on both sides of the Rio Grande 
that the Juarez government, which had befriended rebellious slaves and whose 
predecessor had outlawed slavery, survive Napoleon's invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 It is interesting to note that Napoleon was urged to overthrow the Mexican 
government by the brother of Archduke Maximilian of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 Maximilian's involvement gives Africans even more cause to join with Latino 
neighbors in celebrating Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years before Napoleon's ill-fated invasion of Mexico, Maximilian married 
Carlotta, sister of King Leopold II of Belgium, a despot who was responsible 
for colonizing, mutilating and annihilating millions of Congolese in his drive 
for profits. 
</P>
<P>
 During this period Europe's ruling elites were busy plotting the conquest of 
non-Western people, often cooperating with one another and occasionally 
competing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the infamous 1884-85 Berlin West Africa Conference, the European powers 
resolved some of their differences and divided Africa among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Through shared misfortune -- conquest and slavery -- the histories of Mexicans 
and blacks in this hemisphere are linked. Few, if any, oppressed people have 
overcome adversity without assistance from allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Indigenous and African people have been one another's primary ally in many 
instances, since the beginning of the pillage, slavery and genocide initiated 
by Columbus in the Americas 500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Present-day black and brown conflicts, whether at high school assemblies, on 
the streets of Venice, in the big yard at San Quentin or between equally 
disempowered Latino and black laborers in South Los Angeles, reward the same 
elites whose wealth and power are dependent upon divided and unorganized people 
of color. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the flash point is Puebla or Chiapas, Cinco de Mayo is a perfect time 
to reflect upon and discuss the continuing resistance by Mexico's people to 
domination. And, when appropriate, the complementary dynamics of the struggles 
for black and brown liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinco de Mayo is not to be commercialized by opportunists or trivialized as a 
one-day superficial and lukewarm acknowledgment of Mexican culture. 
</P>
<P>
 When honest accounts of history are finally written into textbooks, African 
and Latino youth will be better able to affirm, deepen and project their 
long-established unity into the future.

CANDIDATE DISPUTES STATUS OF 'FRONT-RUNNERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You proclaim Bill Mabie and Antonio Villaraigosa to be front-runners in the 
primary race ("Election's Bitter Roots Run Deep," April 3). Perhaps their 
connections to the "political machine" in this part of Los Angeles warrants 
this labeling.A poll of voters in the district, however, will more likely 
reveal these men to be the unknown candidates that they are.  
</P>
<P>
 It appears you also used the amounts of money these candidates have raised to 
support their standing as front-runners. Personally, I find Mr. Villaraigosa's 
belief that he needs to raise another $245,000 to win this election absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that representation can be bought and that a candidate must be 
endorsed by the machine is exactly what is wrong with our political system 
today. Your decision to only cover Mr. Mabie and Mr. Villaraigosa in your 
article is an example of how bias by the media only helps to support the 
machine politicians. This bias locks out independent men and women who, like 
myself, have a desire to be the voice of the community and reform the system. 
</P>
<P>
 I am an independent candidate who wishes only to be the voice of this 
community. We will run a grass-roots campaign which will speak directly to the 
people. All of my campaign funds have been raised locally from independent 
businessmen and businesswomen as well as from concerned citizens of the 45th 
Assembly District. All of my flyers, posters and road signs have been donated 
by local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 My voice is the voice of the community. I want to be heard. I invite you to 
follow my campaign and watch for yourself what can be accomplished with people 
and not money.

 Bell has surpassed Roosevelt as the top regional volleyball power defeating 
the defending City Section 4-A finalist Roughriders, 16-14, 8-15, 15-8, 15-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's match, the last of the regular season, capped the Southeastern 
Conference title for the Eagles (10-0). 
</P>
<P>
 After missing game point in the first game, the Roughriders came back to win 
the second. But Roosevelt's hitters lost their confidence in an extended rally 
in the third game, and their second match to Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roughriders were led by Richard Rodriguez with 14 kills while Dickie 
Purcell led the Eagles with 22 kills and 14 blocks. VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate 3, Jefferson 2 -- The Rams outlasted the Democrats, 15-11, 15-4, 
9-15, 12-15, 15-11, in a 2 1/2-hour Eastern League match Monday. Democrat 
senior Carlos Sevedra had five blocks and 10 kills. Teammate Marcos Meza had 17 
kills and eight blocks and a serving ace.  
</P>
<P>
 Garfield 3, Jordan 0 -- Garfield trounced host Jordan on Monday, 15-10, 15-10, 
15-4. Ricardo Garibay had five serving aces and setter Luis Munoz made 65 
assists in the Central League win. Hitter Alex Montes had 10 kills. SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt 8, Jordan 1 -- The Roughriders scored five runs in the bottom of the 
third on a series of Bulldog errors Thursday. Winning pitcher Liz Ballesteros 
improved her record to 8-2 with a 0.47 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield 13, Fremont 1 -- Four first-inning runs, including Angelica 
Enriquez's single for two RBIs, sparked Garfield in a Southeastern Conference 
game Thursday. Garfield pitcher Alma Limon improved to 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell 14, Huntington Park 11 -- The Eagles led 9-7 by the end of the second 
during a Southeastern Conference game Thursday. The hit parade continued until 
winning pitcher Yvette Serrano shut down the Spartans. Bell had first-inning 
homers by Rosa Delgado and Magdalena Soto.

TRACK; ANOTHER CONFERENCE VICTORY LAP FOR THE BULLDOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southeastern Conference was the first in the City Section to abandon the 
dual-meet format for track and adopt a tri-meet schedule. Four years later, it 
is still the section's only conference conducting such meets. 
</P>
<P>
 And the change has suited Garfield well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs (8-0) captured their fourth conference title in five seasons 
Friday, defeating Fremont and Locke at home Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont Coach Steve Lang and Locke Coach Timm MacDonald, though, say 
Garfield's dominance has proved little. The tri-meet format permits two 
entrants from each school to score per event, and Lang and MacDonald said the 
scoring is biased against sprinter-oriented schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bigger teams are going to be the more successful," Lang said. "It's not a 
true test of who has the best track team." 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield Coach Carlos Jimenez likes the two additional open weeks created by 
the switch to a tri-meet schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez said the change has improved performances in the conference by keeping 
athletes rested and giving them a chance to focus on invitationals. 
</P>
<P>
 The bye weeks, though, have often gone unfilled for Locke and Huntington Park, 
which do not have the budgets to send their teams to invitationals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids always seemed a little sluggish after being off for a week," said 
Huntington Park Coach Tony Guajardo, whose Spartans won the boys' championship 
last year. "There's a lot more fanfare and we didn't have the competitiveness, 
especially with the weaker teams, we do now. I like the tri-meets." 
</P>
<P>
 Lang and MacDonald, however, said they will recommend changes when the 
tri-meet format is discussed at a Tuesday meeting. That meeting will also 
determine seedings for the conference preliminaries, which will be held at Cal 
State Los Angeles on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of running only tri-meets, Lang would like to see the conference 
implement a mixed schedule of tri- and dual meets. MacDonald wants to see the 
tri-meet format scrapped.

FAMILY IN TWILIGHT FOR SUN-SENSITIVE GIRLS; HEALTH: TWO DAUGHTERS HAVE A RARE 
GENETIC INTOLERANCE THAT LEAVES VICTIMS VULNERABLE TO SKIN CANCERS, BLINDNESS 
AND NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE AFTER EXPOSURE TO SUNLIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Harrison family has been harassed, shunned and ridiculed as "vampires." 
Their truck was vandalized, an antenna atop their house was shot off, one of 
their dogs was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 All this because their daughters, Jaime, 9, and Sherry, 7, have a rare genetic 
intolerance for the sun that leaves its victims vulnerable to skin cancers, 
blindness and neurological damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls spend their days inside a dimly lit house. Only before dawn or after 
dusk can they venture out for typical kid pastimes like school, ballet, judo 
and camping. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it gets dark, we go out to play," Jaime said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 7 1/2 years since the disease was diagnosed, the family has adapted to 
living in the twilight. They wish others would be more tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it seems that for every good person, there's four or five bad 
people," said Jim Harrison, 38, a cabinetmaker and part-time judo instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 After experiencing persistent harassment while living in Illinois and other 
Northern California towns, the family found relative peace in this tiny Sutter 
County town four years ago. Meridian is about 70 miles north of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 A television movie about the Harrisons was expected to bring new attention. 
Kim Harrison, 34, said they were willing to trade some privacy to help educate 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children of the Dark," starring Peter Horton and Tracy Pollan, aired recently 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would make a lot of difference for the movie to come out, and more 
people will know," said Kim Harrison, the girls' mother, before the showing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrison girls have xeroderma pigmentosum, or XP, an often fatal disorder. 
Only one in about 250,000 people carries the gene. Because the gene is 
recessive, both parents have to carry it for the disorder to be passed on. Even 
then the chances are one in four of having a child with XP. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not contagious. The girls' 16-year-old half-brother, Bobby, does not 
have the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Aurora, Ill., Jaime showed symptoms early. Baby pictures show 
her screwing her eyes shut and turning her head from the sun. Her skin burned 
badly, though usually not for 24 to 48 hours after exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors initially thought she had a rash or allergies. 
</P>
<P>
 On a camping trip in 1986, Jaime became seriously ill and had to be 
hospitalized. Photos show her skin a mass of blisters. Her eyes were swollen 
shut. Her mouth was so cracked and raw she couldn't drink from her bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 A skin biopsy revealed XP. Doctors said she would likely die at an early age 
from melanoma cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry was tested a short time later; the results were the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as giving it to the kids, we felt really bad about ourselves for a 
long time. . . . We felt very defective," Kim Harrison said. "We've learned a 
lot since then. We understand that all kinds of people have gone through things 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Their mother has started an informal network for people with XP. She has heard 
from about 25 others, including people in Canada, Europe and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think these kids are less than perfect," she said. "A fluke of 
nature happened that changed something about them. They're not less than the 
rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people advised the Harrisons to open all their windows and let nature 
take its course. Instead, they closed up the house and began a nocturnal 
existence. In 1987, they moved to California. 
</P>
<P>
 When the girls must leave the house in daylight, they put on gloves, 
long-sleeved shirts, sunglasses and ultra-strong sunscreen, then cover 
themselves in sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach seems to work. Tumors normally develop in XP children by age 7, 
Kim Harrison said. So far, her daughters are healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 They attend school three days a week. Teachers cover the windows when the 
girls are there. The sisters also study at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime said she doesn't mind staying indoors. But Sherry, who has never been 
exposed to direct sunlight, sometimes chafes under the restriction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrison house overflows with toys and animals. One room looks like an 
indoor playground with a giant inner tube, climbing bars and a small pool 
filled with plastic balls instead of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing well medically. They're doing well socially. They're doing well 
in school," Kim Harrison said. "I think we've proved a point. And that's not 
what we set out to do. We wanted to save our children."

TREMORS IN GLASS TOWERS; WITH EXECUTIVES JITTERY, IT MAY BE TIME TO REGULATE 
'DERIVATIVES' TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the last three weeks enormously costly blunders by major companies using 
arcane financial instruments known as derivatives have sent shock waves through 
executive suites. What's going on here? Has Corporate America been too lax in 
policing these sophisticated and volatile devices? Clearly it should do more. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from another 
asset, such as stocks, bonds or commodities. Their purpose is to diminish risk, 
and to achieve this they offer all sorts of contracts -- "swaps" or "forwards," 
to name a couple -- that can be used to hedge against the normal fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. However, big 
and sudden changes in interest rates, for example, can make for a bad 
derivative day. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of Procter & Gamble. The company disclosed in mid-April that it 
had to take a $157-million, one-time, pretax charge to close out two interest 
rate "swap" contracts. Betting that U.S. and German interest rates would fall, 
the company entered agreements with Bankers Trust New York Corp. to give the 
bank options to sell P&G Treasury bonds and German government bonds at a fixed 
price in exchange for floating rate debt, akin to variable-rate mortgages. When 
those interest rates rose instead, P&G had to close out the contracts, at a 
huge loss. 
</P>
<P>
 In another high-profile case, General Electric was forced to take a 
$210-million after-tax charge against first-quarter earnings because of 
problems arising from some derivative activity at its investment banking 
subsidiary, Kidder Peabody. As a result of the loss, Kidder fired the head of 
its government bond trading desk, alleging he created "phantom" trades using 
"forward" contracts that generated $350 million in nonexistent profits. Kidder 
later fired another trader for allegedly covering up $10 million in losses on a 
separate bond-derivative transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 These losses have cast a spotlight on the shadowy world of derivatives, which 
have become widely used by companies, banks, investment firms and mutual funds. 
With the face value of derivatives currently estimated at $15 trillion, the 
potential risks are daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Used with care and intelligence, derivatives provide a means to manage and 
reduce borrowing costs. But they can be dangerous, especially if they are 
poorly monitored. Worse yet would be a company's secret overuse of derivatives, 
which are not broken out on income statements or balance sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater disclosure and accountability would help. The Financial Accounting 
Standards Board has proposed rules that would require companies to provide 
details of derivative strategies and the size of such holdings. Disclosure 
might prevent jolting surprises for management and for the millions of 
investors, large and small, who deserve to know what's going on.

NASTY WAR'S NASTY QUESTION: IS WEST BLINDED BY RELIGION?; MUSLIMS FEAR BIG 
POWERS WILL ACCEPT SLAUGHTER OF NON-CHRISTIANS IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Are the major powers, or at least some of them, more tolerant of genocide 
against a Muslim minority than they would be of the same against a Christian 
minority? This suggestion, long whispered in connection with the slaughter of 
the Bosnian Muslims, is being spoken aloud since former President Richard Nixon 
included it in a book completed just before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 It cannot be claimed, as the Muslim Public Affairs Council did two weeks ago, 
that the "United Nations is effective only when it acts against Muslims." 
(After the rape of Gorazde, the council called on Muslim countries to withdraw 
from the United Nations.) To mention the U.N. rescue of Muslim Somalia from 
famine and anarchy is to refute that claim, and other instances could be named. 
</P>
<P>
 But Muslim distress over Bosnia is steadily rising. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher faced an angry delegation of all six foreign ministers of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council last week, frustrated that their lobbying for bolder U.S. 
action has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, which has a relatively small Muslim population, there is 
virtually no history of major domestic problems involving this minority; 
foreign conflict, such as with the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, has never 
been with Muslims as such. Bosnian leaders have occasionally named American 
religious pluralism as the reason that the United States has ended up as the 
Bosnian Muslims' least weak defender. Differing histories may be a better key. 
Virtually all of Europe's historic victories were over Muslims. This is not to 
say that the greatest battles in European history were fought against Muslims. 
But on the rare occasions when Europeans were not fighting one another but were 
fighting as Europeans against a non-European enemy, that enemy was Muslim. 
Charles Martel stopping the Moors at Tours, France, in 732; Roland, slain 
fighting the Saracens in the Pyrenees; El Cid, continuing the epic reconquest 
of Spain in the 11th Century; John of Austria and his European armada 
destroying the Turkish fleet at Lepanto off the coast of Greece in 1571; 
Sobieski of Poland, stopping Muslims at the gates of Vienna in 1683 -- these 
are heroic names and fabled places that every European schoolchild memorizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the memories matter in 1994? Do they bear on relations between the British 
and their Pakistani minority, the Germans and their Turks, the French and their 
Algerians, the Spanish and their Moors, the Russians and their Central Asians? 
And are Europeans likely to be affected by this broad cultural background as 
they view the Serb Christians fighting the Bosnian Muslims? 
</P>
<P>
 To the Serbs, their epic resistance against the Turks at Kosovo Polje in 1389 
was as important for Christendom as was Tours, and the national epic that 
celebrates it is as immortal as the "Chanson de Roland" or "El Poema del mio 
Cid." But the Serbian national epic has been generally ignored in the West and 
scarcely celebrated in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In looking at the continuing dithering of the West, many in the Muslim world 
see a rising question of whether a non-Christian minority is to be considered 
expendable. As this war drags on, the question looms ever larger; and the 
question in itself is of consequence. Christians and Muslims are fighting each 
other in disturbingly many places around the world, sometimes with words, 
sometimes with guns: Sudan, Lebanon, Armenia/Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Egypt, 
Pakistan and elsewhere. Some students of foreign affairs -- notably Samuel P. 
Huntington writing in Foreign Affairs last summer -- see the re-emergent 
Islam/Christendom line as a kind of new cold war divide. 
</P>
<P>
 If a new condition rather than a new superpower threatens world peace, that 
condition surely must be (or include) bloody intra-national competition among 
ethnic and religious groups. In that context, past history and present 
sociological reality in Europe make Bosnia seem a more fateful conflict than 
ever and one that may require the major powers to examine themselves as closely 
as they do the combatants clashing in the Balkan hills.

 The Red Cars did not "die out," as you suggest in Newswatch ("Riding Past,"

manufacturers systematically bought the rights of way and did in the Red Cars 
during the '40s and '50s.

 This resulted in our dependence upon the automobile as our single and decadent

BREAST CANCER STUDY OFFERS REASSURANCE; * HIGH INCIDENCE OF DISEASE HERE, MORE 
DIAGNOSES POINT TO IMPORTANCE OF UCI RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent report on breast cancer by three UC Irvine researchers underlined 
the importance of scientific research, despite occasional scandals over 
falsified results that too easily can cast doubt on the work of scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The UC Irvine study of nearly 6,000 Orange County women found that lumpectomy, 
which is the removal of the cancerous tumor, is as effective and safe a 
treatment of the disease as mastectomy, removal of the entire breast. The 
watchword in surgery is the less radical the operation, and the less that needs 
to be removed, the better. The results were especially helpful in reassuring 
nervous women who had undergone lumpectomies but had become worried by other 
research that, although confirming the operation was effective, later turned 
out to have been tainted. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine is an appropriate site for the breast cancer study because, 
according to researchers, Orange County has the largest instance of the disease 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoda Anton-Culver, one of the authors of the study, established the UCI 
College of Medicine's epidemiology program and in 1984 created a landmark 
program to study all kinds of cancer in the county. The registry records 
diagnoses and treatments and follows cancer patients until death; it worked 
well enough that state officials wisely used it as the model for a statewide 
reporting program. And the registry proved its worth again when it provided the 
data for the breast cancer study. 
</P>
<P>
 Anton-Culver said the high incidence of breast cancer in the county may be due 
to several factors. For one, the majority population is white, a grouping she 
said was more susceptible to the disease than Latinos or Asian Americans. Also, 
affluence has meant diets rich in fats and low in fiber, a risk factor. In 
addition, more women here are middle-class or professional, and tend to have 
children later or no children at all; that also seems to increase the 
likelihood of the disease. Anton-Culver also said that it may simply be that 
the disease is diagnosed more often here because women have access to health 
care and the insurance to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the National Cancer Institute gave the UCI researchers $2.3 
million for a four-year study that will explore the role of genetics in breast 
cancer and how it ties in with environmental factors such as diet and hormones. 
Diagnoses of breast cancer are growing, and the latest estimates are that one 
in eight American women will suffer the disease. That underlines the importance 
of research.

JAIL SYSTEM DEMANDS OFFICIALS' ATTENTION; * SUPERVISORS, VOTERS MUST STOP 
EVADING RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several years ago, officials in Orange were promised that if they allowed 
Orange County to expand the Theo Lacy Branch Jail, only minimum- and 
medium-security prisoners would be housed behind the bars. Last month the 
promise was broken, and four dozen maximum-security inmates were moved into the 
facility on The City Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange City Council members and residents predictably were outraged, with some 
erroneously blaming Sheriff Brad Gates. It was not Gates who promised the ban 
on maximum-security inmates, but other county officials, including 
then-Supervisor Don R. Roth. And when Orange wound up suing the county over the 
expansion anyway, angry county officials contended the deal was off. They 
warned that if the county won the lawsuit, which it did, it would put 
higher-classification inmates at Theo Lacy when it had to. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the inmates had to be housed at Lacy because he had no room 
elsewhere. He said that for years the department had been forced to turn loose 
some inmates before they served their full sentences, because the cells were 
needed for other criminals. Last year the department reported releasing 10,141 
inmates early for lack of jail space. Among them were 183 convicted of assault 
with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday will mark the 16th anniversary of a federal judge's order to Orange 
County to improve conditions in its jail system. The judge waited another seven 
years before finding that Gates and the five county supervisors were in 
contempt for not heeding his 1978 order. The problem then, as now, was that 
when a judge ruled on the jail, or a riot broke out, or a new lawsuit was 
filed, the system was routinely deemed to be undergoing a "crisis." But after 
much talk, and on rare occasions some action, the issue disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more obvious problems is that no supervisor wants a new jail built 
in his or her district. The three supervisors who already have a jail in their 
districts do not want them expanded or upgraded to take tougher inmates. All 
assume they are reflecting the voters' wishes. But it may be time to ask the 
voters again, and see if what is thought to be an electorate afraid that crime 
is increasing is willing to put a jail in its own district. 
</P>
<P>
 That goes for financing, too. If the county's residents are truly concerned 
about crime and think locking people up is a way to help solve the problem, 
they should be willing to pay for new jails, either through taxes or bonds. In 
1991, pollsters reminded county residents that Gates was forced to release 
accused criminals because there was no room at the jail to hold them while they 
awaited trial. Sixty percent of respondents said they would pay an extra 
half-cent sales tax to build a new jail in Gypsum Canyon, 10 miles east of 
Anaheim. But four months after the poll, when countywide voting on a ballot 
measure proposing a sales tax increase took place, it was defeated by a 3-1 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent flap over maximum-security prisoners in Orange is a reminder that 
the problem of jail overcrowding has not gone away, even if it has largely 
faded from public discussion. Ideas worth more consideration are possible 
public-private partnerships on jails like the one planned in Seal Beach, 
improved municipal jail facilities, and finding sites for alcohol 
detoxification facilities. In recent years new cells have been added and such 
alternatives to jail as confinement at home have been expanded.  
</P>
<P>
 Those represent progress, but they are not solutions. County supervisors need 
to devote far more attention to the problem.

A BIT OF SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO IS RESCUED; * HANKEY / ROUSE COTTAGE PROVIDES A 
VALUABLE LINK TO SOUTH COUNTY'S RICH HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rescuing even one small corner of history from demolition or alteration in 
South County is a considerable victory.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the historic Hankey / Rouse cottage, which was on San Juan 
Capistrano's list of historic landmarks, was spared destruction in the name of 
progress when a local contractor purchased it and moved it a mere 100 feet to 
await restoration. May it stand proudly 100 feet from disaster as a symbol of 
the county's rich history. 
</P>
<P>
 Preserving such reminders of the past provides a needed sense of place at a 
time when change on the suburban landscape is often overpowering and driven by 
short-sighted motivation. The house is closely linked with historic land use in 
Orange County, and Carl Hankey, a prominent rancher, citrus grower and school 
board member, played a prominent role in the construction of Ortega Highway. 
Over its long history beginning in 1883, the house served as the center of a 
walnut ranch and as a citrus farm. Later it doubled as a landing area for 
foreign exchange students getting away from campuses on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 The house might have gone the way of too many historic vestiges of Orange 
County's past were it not for the 11th-hour intervention of contractor Michael 
Palmer, who bought an adjacent parcel of land and moved the house so that it 
could be restored. Even as a crew of workers lifted and moved the house to its 
new location, Palmer observed, correctly, "We've got to preserve our history 
for our children and our children's children." 
</P>
<P>
 This dilemma was brought on when the City Council on appeal had agreed to the 
demolition as requested by the Hankey descendants. Since they had all grown up 
and moved on, they understandably sought to subdivide their family parcel, but 
were originally denied by the city's Cultural Heritage Commission. The purchase 
by Palmer was a happy resolution.

EL TORO ENTERTAINMENT CENTER URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * What to do about El Toro Marine Corps Air Station? 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't we build a world-class entertainment center at El Toro, to include 
all things bright and beautiful (i.e., theaters, restaurants, hotels, 
landscaped gardens, flowering walkways, small lakes with waterfalls) -- 
something like Branson, Mo., and Myrtle Beach, S.C. (a recently closed military 
base), where they have built all those theaters that attract visitors from 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 We can encourage private industry to build theaters with various types of 
entertainment: Broadway music, country music, opera, ballet, professional ice 
skating, Cirque de Soleil, Western rodeos, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 California is no longer competitive with states like Nevada, Florida and South 
Carolina, which lure tourists (and tourist dollars) by continually constructing 
new attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 A new entertainment complex in Southern California would provide thousands of 
jobs in the construction, hotel and restaurant, and entertainment industries. 
It would generate millions/billions of dollars in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 And we would be building something for our enjoyment, as well as our future 
financial security. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a rare opportunity to do something wonderful here. Let's not allow it 
to slip away from us!

BOLSA CHICA PROJECT HAS NO PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is important to set the record straight. An article ("Agency Stands Fast 
on Bolsa Chica OK," April 19), reports that the "California Coastal Commission 
has decided not to rescind its permission for the Koll Real Estate Group to 
build 4,286 homes around Bolsa Chica." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission did not make such a ruling. The Commission simply 
declined to revoke a permit to demolish two World War II bunkers. In fact, the 
Coastal Commission has been highly critical of Koll's plans to build 4,884 
housing units on the Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll has no permits from the Coastal Commission, the County of Orange, the 
Army Corps of Engineers, or any other agency to build anything on Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope this will help clear up any misunderstanding.

TRI-CITIES BOARD CHIEF GOES ON RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Several articles concerning the San Mateo Basin Project have contained a 
number of inaccuracies. It is regrettable that those with various personal 
political agendas have chosen to compromise a water project which will serve 
the best interests of South County residents. I would like to set the record 
straight: 
</P>
<P>
 1. The San Mateo Basin Project has been under development between Tri-Cities 
Municipal Water district and the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton for 15 
years and did not surface as a result of current discussions on special 
district consolidation, as your editorial suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Ratepayers in San Clemente and Capistrano Beach will always pay less for 
San Mateo Basin project water than for MWD imported water, because that is the 
way the agreement between the agencies is structured. Moreover, initial project 
costs advanced by Tri-Cities will be reimbursed in full in water credits, by 
the Marine Corps.  
</P>
<P>
 3. Water quality in the San Mateo Basin is excellent. In some cases, the water 
quality is higher than the imported water we drink today. In all cases, it 
falls well within state and federal standards. Records verifying this have been 
made available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 4. An incorporated city in Orange County cannot legally annex property to 
operate facilities in San Diego County, nor are any cities currently authorized 
to operate pipelines or other facilities across central and southern Orange 
County. Tri-Cities owns and operates water facilities serving several South 
Orange County water districts. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Tri-Cities' public information program has been driven in large part as a 
response to the gross misinformation advanced by project detractors and far 
exceeds any legal requirement. It has been our intent to share information 
about this project with the ratepayers in a straightforward manner. We have 
offered to meet with those who have raised questions about the project in an 
effort to provide a direct response to their questions, but they have refused. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tri-Cities director who has chosen to criticize the district for retaining 
a public information consultant and a legislative support staff in Washington 
voted affirmatively for both decisions. It is unfortunate that the real issues 
of south Orange County's quality of life and our need for another local water 
supply would be lost to local politics. 
</P>
<P>
 What value should we place on 60 days' emergency supply in the event of a 
firestorm recurrence or a major quake which separates our vital pipelines or 
aqueducts?

TWO VIEWS ON SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am a sixth-grade student who wishes to graduate from high school in the 
year 2000 in a smoke-free environment. On behalf of our class and all kids, I 
would like to express my concern about the quality of the air we breath.We're 
depending on you to care and help spread the message that we need to start 
clearing the air. 
</P>
<P>
 As you know, we have tobacco product vending machines that are accessible in 
many public places! The poisonous gases from smoking surrounding us contribute 
to air pollution. When people go to restaurants or any public place where 
smoking is allowed, they're getting harmful carbon dioxide in their lungs. This 
is because these gases are enclosed and, in a crowd, people inhale smoke 
faster. We can stop these problems by eliminating these machines and 
prohibiting smoking in public areas. 
</P>
<P>
 If these problems continue, today's children will become tomorrow's unhealthy 
adults. I'm fully aware we cannot change the whole world's air pollution 
problems, but we should at least start somewhere and the sooner the better. Why 
don't we start with our city and right now. So please adopt these ideas and 
give some needed TLC to the air and people. 
</P>
<P>
 SARAH STEFANOS 
</P>
<P>
 La Palma 
</P>
<P>
 * Just as nonsmokers feel entitled to clean air, smokers feel they should be 
able to enjoy a smoke in a public restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is extremely simple: proper ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, I eat in a restaurant where the smoking section has such pure air 
that it is often occupied by nonsmokers who want to avoid noisy children in the 
"family" nonsmoking section. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's not allow hysteria over tobacco to overwhelm us. There is room for 
smokers and nonsmokers in this world.

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; CRAVENS CUP HAS A STRONG LOCAL HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before professional sports moved into the area, the unique Cravens Cup 
golf tournament was a major event each May in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Club golf tournaments were big around here. The Cravens, involving most of the 
top amateurs, was something special. It commanded widespread interest and the 
attention of the media. 
</P>
<P>
 With the arrival of horse racing, the Rams, Dodgers, Lakers and Angels, 
amateur golf was shunted to the back -- or ignored completely. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cravens Cup, generally known now as the Cravens Invitational, has 
survived nicely. The Scotch foursome tournament, now 70 years old, is still 
going strong. Without the fanfare of pre-World War II days, more than 400 
amateur golfers, in two-man teams, still participate. This year it will be 
played May 11-14 at San Gabriel Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Walker Cup players have been among the winners -- Johnny Dawson, Bruce 
McCormick and Dr. Bud Taylor. Former Ram Merlin Olsen, Stanford and 
professional basketball star George Yardley and football's Bob Chandler, John 
Elway and Glenn Davis have played in it. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a team of special interest this year to USC football fans and 
alumni. Pat Haden and J.K. McKay, who gained fame as one of the great passing 
combinations in Trojan history, will compete. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a grueling event. To win the championship, a team might have to play as 
many as 108 holes, counting the qualifying round. 
</P>
<P>
 There is considerable pressure, too. The first arrives after the qualifying 
ends Thursday, May 12. There are openings in the championship flight for 32 
teams. Often several spots have to be determined by four-hole shootouts. There 
have been years when as many as 20 teams battled for the last two positions. By 
the time the playoffs start, there is always a big gallery. For many, the 
gallery presents a big problem. 
</P>
<P>
 John Cravens, a Southland sportsman, got the idea for the event when he saw 
the two-ball foursome matches played in Scotland. He staged the first 
tournament at the old Midwick Country Club, long gone and now a housing 
project, in 1924. It was moved to San Gabriel Country Club in 1943 and has been 
there ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are simple. Each player must have a handicap under 12 (11.2 index) 
and be an amateur. The winners of each match are based on net scores. All 
players must walk. There is no riding on carts except to reach tees to begin a 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 It differs from Scotch foursomes only in that one member of the team hits the 
drive on the odd holes, the other on the even. In pure Scotch play, each player 
hits every other shot. The change makes it important for both players to be at 
the top of their game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Kirkpatrick, who played for USC in the 1960s, and David Mendez of Friendly 
Hills Country Club have won the championship flight the last two years. Their 
success helped bring a change in the rules. Each player, instead of using his 
current handicap, will use his lowest rating in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time only twosomes from Southern California clubs were sent 
invitations. But it has become worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been only 11 Cravens chairmen since the tournament shifted to San 
Gabriel. The first was Tex Schramm, father of the former president of the 
Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 New chairman Frank Haltom, a San Marino real estate executive, said that 550 
invitations had been sent out for this year's tournament. A field of more than 
200 teams will begin qualifying rounds on May 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The final two days, in which winners must play two 18-hole matches, usually 
draw big crowds to the Las Tunas Drive course. According to Haltom, there will 
be about 35 San Gabriel teams, now working with club professional Michael John 
Kelley and teaching pro Jim Petralia, in the hopes of returning the 
championship to the home club. Golf Notes

 Jerry Barber, who turned 78 last Monday, celebrated two days early by shooting 
a one-under-par 69 in the second round of the Senior PGA Reunion in Dallas. . . 
. The annual Ducks Unlimited charity tournament at Crystalaire Country Club on 
May 16 will be dedicated to Mark Wilkinson. Wilkinson, who founded the event 
that helps protect wildlife, died shortly after last year's event. 
</P>
<P>
 Deane Beman, resigning commissioner of the PGA Tour, has received a special 
exemption for the U.S. Senior Open, June 30-July 3 on the No. 2 course at 
Pinehurst, N.C. Wonder how those 51 seniors he recently fined will feel about 
playing with their former boss? . . . Jim Ferree, who came back from prostate 
cancer to win almost $500,000 on the Senior PGA Tour last year at 62, is off on 
another comeback. He shot 209 for 54 holes and earned $6,630 in his first event 
after rotator cuff surgery on his left shoulder.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON DISCRIMINATION; THERE ARE SOLUTIONS FOR 
WOMEN'S LACK OF ADVANCEMENT AT UC; THE CHANCELLOR SHOULD NAME A BLUE RIBBON 
COMMITTEE ON GENDER EQUITY, WITH THE POWER TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MORRIS W. HIRSCH, Morris W. Hirsch is professor emeritus and former chairman 
of the department of mathematics at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why is it that in 1992, women were almost half of new American Ph.D.s, but 
fewer than one-fifth of UC faculty -- well behind the national norm? How does 
it happen that in UC Irvine's College of Medicine only 7% of the tenured 
faculty is women -- and all 23 departments are chaired by men? In the UC 
Berkeley math department, why are there only three women in more than 50 
faculty positions? Why did the Federal Equal Employment Opportunities 
Commission make the official finding in 1993 that the UC San Francisco 
psychiatry department had discriminated against women? 
</P>
<P>
 These issues were discussed recently at an extraordinary meeting at UC Irvine: 
a "Roundtable Conference on Gender Bias and Gender Equity at the University of 
California." State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Tom Umberg 
(D-Garden Grove) were there. UC Irvine was represented at the round table by 
Executive Vice Chancellor Spencer Olin, who came, he said, as a "student" to 
listen and learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Riveting personal testimony by women from several campuses, and trenchant 
analysis of employment patterns by UC Davis law professor Martha West, left no 
doubt of a pervasive pattern of gender discrimination, often combined with 
sexual harassment, in our university. West, an expert in employment 
discrimination law, reported that "illegal discrimination against women seeking 
faculty positions at America's research universities has been getting worse, 
not better, over the last 10 years." And the higher, the better paid, and the 
more secure the positions, the fewer held by women, West said. "The only 
beneficiaries of any 'affirmative action' have been white men -- the only ones 
who continue to be hired, year after year, at percentages higher than their 
availability in the qualified national labor pool." 
</P>
<P>
 At the round table, women told of herculean struggles, often unsuccessful, to 
obtain academic justice. They told of sex bias that stalled and sometimes 
wrecked promising academic careers; of extraordinary research and teaching 
achievements that went unacknowledged by their department chairmen; of 
retaliation, including denial of research facilities and even firing, against 
women who complained in good faith of discriminatory practices; of deliberate 
violation of UC procedures by officials seemingly intent on appointing only 
white males to tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 I was at the UCI round table to tell the story of my colleague, Jenny 
Harrison, who was denied promotion to tenure in the Berkeley math department in 
1986. After she sued, alleging gender discrimination, UC last year finally 
signed an agreement that included a monetary award and the formation of a 
distinguished independent committee to judge her qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the committee's unanimous recommendation, she was appointed full 
professor, including tenure. This seven-year struggle for equity has created a 
bitterly divided department that even now is often distracted from its work of 
research and teaching by the fallout from this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when they win, these women pay dearly for their struggle, not only 
financially -- legal expenses of more than $100,000 are common -- but 
professionally and emotionally. And these fights also cost our tax-supported 
university enormous sums of money. Besides the time spent by staff, faculty, 
administrators and regents' counsel in hearings and trial preparation, the 
university hires outside lawyers at hundreds of dollars per hour. There are 
currently at least seven gender discrimination cases against UC; the costs are 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent press conference, Sen. Torres, a senior member of the Senate 
Education Committee, announced that in preparation for the vote on the 
university's budget, he was calling on the legislative analyst to review the 
amount spent by the university's general counsel's office, and by privately 
contracted law firms, on defending discrimination suits. "I will make sure 
every member of the Legislature, specifically those on the budget subcommittee 
on higher education, are aware of the university's record with women 
professors," Torres said. "The University of California is lagging far behind 
the rest of the country in recognizing women as a valuable asset." Referring to 
sexual discrimination cases, Torres said, "Current university procedures in 
dealing with these lawsuits are unworkable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrison case and others suggest there is a way to settle such cases that 
would be fairer, faster and cheaper than costly legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of mindlessly denying every allegation of discrimination, the 
university should set up a regular procedure in which a panel of distinguished 
scholars quickly investigates such cases and makes recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The key step is to obtain an impartial judgment on the worth of a faculty 
member. Normally such judgments are made by the member's department; but when 
discrimination by that department is the issue, this is obviously 
unsatisfactory. To ensure impartiality the panel would have to be chosen 
largely from outside the university, as is routinely done now in evaluating 
university departments. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's College of Medicine made historic progress 20 years ago in the admission 
of female medical students. But those gains have not led to similar progress in 
the hiring and promotion of female faculty members. Some women at UCI are 
already suing, and others are talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, legislators and federal officials have begun to take a close look 
at what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 There couldn't be a better time for UCI Chancellor Laurel Wilkening to take 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving at UCI last year she has spoken often of her commitment to 
diversity. If the chancellor were now to name a blue ribbon committee on gender 
equity, with the power to make a real difference in individual cases, to set 
goals for diversity, and to require progress toward those goals, this could 
transform UCI and become a model for the rest of UC.

SHE'S NOT HOSTILE TO NEWPORT HOSTEL

<TEXT>
<P>
 * I would like to respond to your article about the proposed Newport Beach 
Backpacker's Hostel ("Backpacker Hostel Plan to Be Heard," April 21). 
</P>
<P>
 I am a single mother in my 40s and I have lived in Newport Beach for 34 
years.I was privileged to be able to backpack throughout Europe several times 
in my youth because I stayed exclusively in hostels. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, my budget was $2 a day for food and lodging. If it weren't for 
the safety and security of the hostels, I wouldn't have had the delightful 
experiences that I did.  
</P>
<P>
 I can vouch that there are strict rules and conditions. I vote to give it a 
chance. We will be giving a few travelers a taste of this beautiful city where 
they otherwise couldn't afford it.

SYMPATHY AND SARCASM OFFERED REPUBLICANS TIRED OF THEIR ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Since no one forced Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) to become a 
career politician it's difficult to have much sympathy for his "frustration" as 
a "minority member" in the House of Representatives ('Republicans Tire of 
Minority Status in House," April 24). 
</P>
<P>
 If Dornan finds his 16-year career in the House as a Republican tiresome and 
"so frustrating" then he ought to do something about it. Two easy-to-implement 
suggestions come quickly to mind. First, Dornan could resign and go back to 
hosting talk shows for a living instead of running for his ninth term in 
office. Sixteen years in the House is a long time, especially for someone who 
claims to believe in term limits and delights in bashing career politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Dornan could pull a Phil Gramm and simply change parties. Dornan a 
Democrat? Stranger things happen in politics all the time. Think about how 
exciting it would be. It would drive the House Democratic leadership crazy; 
reason enough for Dornan to make the switch, since he's accomplished little 
else of legislative importance during his long tenure in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least Dornan's "fantasy" of sitting in the Speaker's chair as a 
member of the majority party would come true before Prop. 164 puts a decisive 
end to his frustration, whining and abundant vitriol. 
</P>
<P>
 MARK P. PETRACCA

<P>
 * I have a suggestion for the Republicans who are tired and frustrated over 
their minority status in Congress. Your chances of becoming a majority party 
would improve greatly if you got rid of Neanderthal extremists like Robert 
Dornan and Dana Rohrabacher. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * So the Republicans are "frustrated with their minority status in house." 
Perhaps then, one might imagine they would demonstrate some empathy for 
Democrats who live in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But no, try attending a meeting called by Republican Congressman (Dana) 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). I even called ahead and asked to be allowed 
to comment on his votes and issues of concern to me. The staff was aghast that 
a Democrat would even consider being allowed to speak at "his" meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between operations of Congress and here at home is that our 
congressman are elected to represent all the people in their districts, not 
just members of their own political party. (There are 101,700 registered 
Democrats in the 45th Congressional District). 
</P>
<P>
 When meetings of our elected officials are called, paid for by our taxes, time 
should be given for members of other parties in their districts to comment on 
issues of importance to Orange County residents.

 * A recently released book may be of interest to Rep. Dornan and House 
Republicans longing for a chance at the gavel. To quote an author: "In a fair 
system, a permanent majority should not exercise all the power and a permanent 
minority should not always lose." The book is "The Tyranny of the Majority: 
Fundamental Fairness in Representative Democracy" by Lani Guinier.

<P>
 * I want to thank and congratulate the Los Angeles Times for publishing the 
article "Republicans Tire of Minority Status in House."  
</P>
<P>
 As a conservative Republican member of our state Legislature, dominated by the 
Democratic Party almost continuously for 40 years, I can only say that I fully 
understand and share the feelings expressed in that fine article. The Congress 
and our state Legislature have been ruled and dominated by the Democratic Party 
for so long that it has had a corrupting influence on both parties.  
</P>
<P>
 It isn't just that powerful leaders like Willie Brown can determine the 
political, economic, educational and moral direction of California. It's the 
fact that he does. Under his leadership, the assault on the ego of Republican 
members is unrelenting. The majority party trashes, then steals our bills, then 
demeans us in committees, then consigns us to small rooms with meager staffs. 
But we can cope with those things and, in fact, they often invigorate us. 
</P>
<P>
 The more difficult aspect of this unfairness is our knowledge that California 
and America are deteriorating under the Democrats' control. We are being forced 
away from jobs, away from growth, away from security. The state is continually 
moving in a direction directly opposite the one we would move it, were we ever 
to achieve majority status. 
</P>
<P>
 It is increasingly difficult to keep up the fight when the hometown media, 
through lack of understanding and sympathy, continually condemns Republicans, 
especially conservatives, for continual "opposition and ineffectiveness." Those 
criticisms cause even greater personal damage to the spirits of the individual 
Republican members than the tyranny of the majority party. It causes some of 
our members to become subservient to the majority leaders and members. They 
begin to toady or knuckle under to the other side, knowing they will be repaid 
with petty privileges and, more importantly, the authorship of a successful 
bill here and there. For this, they are hailed in the hometown press as 
"effective political representatives." 
</P>
<P>
 You might wonder why we remain in politics when it is so personally 
frustrating. Well, we stay and we continue to fight for the same reason 
Americans volunteer to risk their lives in wars that threaten our country. We 
are effective. Our opposition sometimes stops them, and forces them to change 
directions. If nothing else, it always slows them down. More important, it 
alerts our party and all voters and taxpayers that this wonderful freedom we 
cherish is being slowly lost.

WHY NOT OFFER A FEW GOOD EXCURSIONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Wouldn't it be a natural tie-in for the Marine Corps Air Show and Amtrak to 
team up and alleviate some of the gridlock and dangerous freeway parking that 
prevails at air show time? Passengers could get off the train right at Irvine 
and take shuttles to the base. Of course, some tempting "excursion" rates would 
add to the attraction.Specials to the Angels games, with a station right in 
their back yard, would be a good promotion as would excursions to Disneyland, 
Del Mar races and the San Diego Zoo, and even the Renaissance Pleasure Faire in 
the other direction. It's possible these package deals would make money for all 
concerned. Besides, the train ride is fun!

MODERATES: THE FRUSTRATED MAJORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with interest Terry Baas' letter "Conservatives Ruining a Good Party" 
(April 14). Don't be "embarrassed" by being a Republican, Terry.I agree that 
the conservative wing seems to have a disproportionate influence to its numbers 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The moderate Republicans, like you, either have to stand up and be counted or 
else merge with the moderate Democrats and form a third party. 
</P>
<P>
 I would prefer to help change the image of the "Grand Old Party" but the 
number of people who responded to Ross Perot's abortive campaign is indicative 
of a lot of Americans who are unhappy with what is being offered by the old 
guard of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The "silent majority" might be better named the "frustrated majority." They 
are the ones in the middle and they are only silent because both parties seem 
to espouse the dictates of their extreme edges.

THE MOMENT, THE HONOR IS IN THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Who were these people who stood in line? I was stunned by their number, 
patience and devotion. Most stood in line for six to eight hours to honor a 
fallen leader. I looked at their faces: They were all ages and races and seemed 
to represent the entire spectrum of the American middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Were they waiting to have the privilege of seeing the casket of the only man 
who had resigned from the presidency? Or were they standing there because the 
very controversies and tragedies that had besieged Richard Nixon throughout his 
entire political career exposed his vulnerability and flaws and made him more 
human than any President we can remember? 
</P>
<P>
 Who were these people who stood in line for a man who admittedly was 
uncomfortable with others? Maybe they believed that he, more than any other 
President, was one of us, humble beginnings, middle-class outlook and 
sensibilities, totally lacking celebrity appeal. Maybe they felt that more than 
a man was being buried that dreary day. His political life was so intertwined 
with our history that possibly they saw an era in that flag-draped box. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a man who throughout the week was defended and extolled for his 
contributions to world peace and international affairs, but whose view and 
pursuit of international affairs was based on real politic, the use of hard 
pragmatism in the pursuit of American interests abroad. Yet there was no real 
politic evident at 5 a.m., only principles and heartfelt grief. 
</P>
<P>
 They stood in line for Richard Nixon and they stood in line for reasons more 
basic. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era where only Madonna, Michael Jackson or any issue remotely related to 
sex can seem to ignite the public's interest, the sight of thousands calmly and 
peacefully waiting in line was remarkable. It speaks not just to the legacy of 
Richard Nixon, but to the inherent and immutable connection that exists between 
a people and their chosen leader. A connection that survives despite the loss 
of office, power and prestige of the leader and resides not in the editorial 
pages, the talking heads of television or with the current ruling elite. It 
rests alone with those who stand in line. 
</P>
<P>
 I would not be able to stand in line to pay my respects to Richard Nixon that 
day. Instead, I took a long moment, as night turned into day, to pay my 
respects to those who stand in line.

HANOI DIDN'T REMEMBER NIXON FONDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with interest "Nixon Remembered as Vietnam's Savior in O.C.'s Little 
Saigon" (April 24). 
</P>
<P>
 I would take exception to Yen Do's remark that "Now there are no more American 
politicians who were involved deeply in Vietnam left." Mr. Do has overlooked 
Nixon's secretary of state, Henry Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kissinger who was instrumental in opening U.S. policies toward China 
and who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for ending U.S. involvement in 
Vietnam in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Also awarded the Nobel was North Vietnamese negotiator, Le Duc Tho, who 
refused the prize and $100,000 on the ground that peace in Vietnam had not in 
fact been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent fact-finding mission to Vietnam I found myself in a classroom of 
one of Hanoi's large foreign language schools.  
</P>
<P>
 The students here were eager to test their English skills (excellent) and 
joust with an American journalist. Amid noisy banter, we joked about pop icons 
Madonna and Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a bombshell question: "What is your opinion of Mr. Nixon?" 
</P>
<P>
 You could hear a pin drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was after all the man responsible for escalating the bombing of their 
city when these students were just babies.  
</P>
<P>
 I told them candidly that Mr. Nixon, as both a man and politician, had good 
and bad qualities. That though he was forced from office for unethical conduct, 
he would still be remembered as a world statesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Nixon, in fact, wrote a book, 'No More Vietnams,' and genuinely wanted 
peace." This was met with stony silence. I realized then that the memory of 
Richard Nixon had already been buried in Hanoi long before his body was laid to 
rest in Yorba Linda.

RED SOX STILL OWN ANGELS; BASEBALL: CLEMENS GIVES UP FOUR HITS IN EIGHT INNINGS 
AS CALIFORNIA WINDS UP DREADFUL MONTH, 4-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It began so full of hope, with dreams this might be the season that would the 
end the seven-year jinx that has haunted this franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it seemed only fitting the Boston Red Sox, the team that has left the 
Angels in disarray since Dave Henderson's homer in the 1986 playoffs, again 
were there Saturday night to end the Angels' month of misery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox, behind the pitching of Roger Clemens, defeated the Angels for the 
fifth time this month, 4-1, in front of a sellout crowd of 55,057 at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (9-16), who have lost eight of their last nine games, have now 
equaled the worst start in their 34-year history. They also established club 
records for losing the most games in April, and their worst start at home, 
2-11. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been as difficult a month as I've ever been involved in," Angel 
shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. "I've never seen so many freak things happen in 
one month. You name it, and it's happened to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "The frustrating thing is that we've been playing just good enough to lose. 
It's like we're playing in a fog. We need to be more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been putting such an emphasis on winning instead of doing the things 
that make us successful." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a month that left starting pitcher Mark Langston, catcher Greg Myers 
and reliever Ken Patterson on Dr. Lewis Yocum's operating table. It was a month 
that sent their starting first baseman (J.T. Snow) to the minors, replacing him 
with their starting left fielder (Eduardo Perez). It was a month in which Chuck 
Finley, Phil Leftwich and Langston combined for one victory, and rookie Brian 
Anderson emerged as the ace of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a month, however, that revealed the benefit of being realigned 
into perhaps the weakest division in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have the fifth-worst record in baseball, but in the American League 
West, they are only two games behind the first-place Seattle Mariners (10-13). 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God we're in this division," Manager Buck Rodgers said. "Believe me, I 
don't make any qualms about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe that's why I don't feel that bad about things." 
</P>
<P>
 Said General Manager Bill Bavasi: "Hey, compared to some of the minor league 
months I've been through, it hasn't been tough. I thought I'd have to prepare 
for worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, whose highlight of the evening was left fielder Dwight Smith's 
rendition of the national anthem, had little else go right for them. Clemens 
(3-1) not only yielded only four hits while striking out eight, but he allowed 
the Angels to hit seven balls out of the infield. He dominated them from the 
outset and made sure everyone knew that he's ornery as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starting pitcher Mark Leiter, who was victimized by three unearned runs, 
hit Red Sox first baseman Mo Vaughn in the stomach with a pitch in the first 
inning. Vaughn stopped and stared at Leiter. Rookie home-plate umpire Fieldin 
Culbreth stepped in front of Vaughn, and Red Sox Manager Butch Hobson came out 
of the dugout and escorted Vaughn to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens decided to wait and pick his spot. It came when Chili Davis stepped to 
the plate, and on a 1-and-2 pitch, was drilled in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis strolled down to first base without looking at Clemens and playfully 
pushed Vaughn. He has been in this game long enough to know that there would be 
retaliation and sensed he would be the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens, of course, has had a knack of leaving teams in complete frustration 
for the last 10 years. The only time the Angels were able to score off Clemens 
in his eight-inning stint was in the third. Harold Reynolds drew a one-out 
walk, stole second base and scored on DiSarcina's single to right field. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the extent of the Angels' offense, which has produced only eight runs 
the four games of this home stand. They also have lost 13 of 15 games in which 
they have failed to obtain at least 10 hits.

air at Shea Stadium. He was rounding first as the ball cleared the 
right-center-field fence, and Wallach, usually calm, pumped a fist into the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Wallach connected, the Dodger bench erupted, and they were already 
in a craze. Mike Piazza had crushed a three-run homer the opposite way moments 
before, putting the Dodgers even with the New York Mets at 10-10. Two batters 
before that, pinch-hitter Chris Gwynn had hit another two-run shot. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game laden with poor pitching and more fielding mistakes, Wallach's home 
run capped the most dramatic comeback victory most of these players have been 
involved with for some time. The Dodgers, trailing, 10-5, with two out in the 
eighth inning, scored six runs on three homers and went on to beat the Mets, 
12-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big win," said Wallach, who hit two home runs in the game, the 
second time he has hit two homers in a game in a week. "After last night's 
tough loss, to keep coming back like we did today, it's tough to keep your 
emotions up. We didn't do anything for five innings, then we got close and we 
would score three runs and they would score three, we would score two and they 
would score two. Some teams just lay down and die when they are behind, but not 
this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Down in the bullpen before the eighth inning, Darren Dreifort decided to try 
something to spark his team. With some tobacco, he turned to Todd Worrell and 
told him he was going to do a "rally-chew." 
</P>
<P>
 "Worrell was going to have one with me, but he doesn't chew," Dreifort said.  
</P>
<P>
 Had he ever done a rally-chew before? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, but it's never worked before," Dreifort said. "My dad is going to love 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 While Dreifort chewed, the Dodgers scored six runs against Josias Manzanillo 
(0-1), who was called up by the Mets on Monday to replace Jonathan Hurst, who 
gave up too many home runs. But the Dodgers still had two innings to play, and 
this time Manager Tom Lasorda put in his rookie ace and stayed with him. 
Dreifort retired the final six Mets to earn his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got contributions from a lot of people today, which we need to be 
successful," said Piazza, who was four for five with a double, his fourth homer 
of the season and four runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I hit the home run, I looked into the dugout when I got around second 
and saw the reaction of the players," Piazza said. "We had tied the game and it 
kind of gives you that adrenaline flow. It's a pretty good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach, waiting in the on-deck circle, said Piazza's high-five nearly took 
his thumb off. Brett Butler said Piazza nearly broke his arm. "I don't remember 
a comeback victory like this one," said Butler, who was three for five and 
scored two runs. "There was one at Philly this season, but nothing like this 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 There were 29 hits, including four doubles, one triple and seven homers, in a 
game that looked all but lost for the Dodgers. Ramon Martinez, struggling with 
his control, gave up three homers before he left the game after five innings 
with the Mets leading, 5-0. The Dodgers scored three in the sixth on two 
singles and Wallach's first home run, but the Mets scored three in the bottom 
of the inning to go ahead, 8-3.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers scored two runs in the seventh and had the bases loaded with one 
out. But Wallach, who had been watching the fastballs Manzanillo threw to 
Piazza, was fooled by a slider and struck out. Eric Karros ended the inning, 
grounding into a forceout. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort's performance helped lift the mood of the bullpen, which gave up five 
runs -- four earned -- before he entered the game. Roger McDowell struggled in 
the sixth inning, giving up a run and leaving two runners on base for Omar 
Daal. As Daal was trotting in from the bullpen, the crowd of 21,734 was treated 
to rendition of "I Love L.A." -- and that was before Daal balked in a run. It 
was also before Jim Gott gave up two more runs, but came right after Cory 
Snyder, starting at second base in place of Delino DeShields, made another 
costly error. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Dallas Green must have thought the Dodgers were going to hand his team 
this victory, as they did Friday night. But Manzanillo, who relieved Doug 
Linton in the seventh inning, changed that. Manzanillo had two out when Gwynn 
started the homers flying. Closer John Franco, who has pitched in three of the 
last four games, started warming up immediately, but he wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can run him out there when I am supposed to, but I can't kill the man," 
Green said. "The other guys are paid to get outs, too."

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; SHARKS TAKE FINAL BITE OUT OF RED WINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jamie Baker found some luck and the San Jose Sharks refused to fold after 
blowing a lead Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing left 21-year-old Chris Osgood totally devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 In their third year of existence, the Sharks continued their run at NHL 
history when Baker's third-period goal lifted them to a 3-2 victory over the 
Detroit Red Wings in the deciding game of their Western Conference quarterfinal 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still dreaming," Baker said. "You can't consider us a contender yet. I 
mean, we're an eighth seed. But when you get great goaltending, anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks are the first team since the 1975 New York Islanders to advance to 
the second round in their playoff debut. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the second consecutive season that the Red Wings have failed to 
advance past the first round, losing in Game 7 each time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has been talking about the goaltending all year," said Osgood, the 
rookie's body shaking as he wept. "I wanted to prove everybody wrong. This just 
proves everybody right. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd made that play, we'd still be playing. All I can think about is the 
last 10 minutes of that game." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit outshot the Sharks, 11-5, in the third period but never seriously 
challenged Arturs Irbe, who faced 30 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Osgood, who faced 17 shots, cleared the puck to the stick of Baker on the left 
side. Baker, without hesitation, rifled home a slap shot from inside the blue 
line at 13:25. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came right to me," Baker said. "It was rolling. But, thank God, it settled 
about a foot before it got to me. That was all the difference, right there. 
Otherwise, I might have fanned on it. Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a fluky goal. I'd just come on the ice. I hadn't been on three 
seconds. I got good wood, and it went in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Wings pulled Osgood for an extra attacker with 47 seconds remaining, 
but they managed only one weak shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Goals by Johan Garpenlov and Sergei Makarov gave the Sharks an early 2-0 lead. 
Kris Draper scored late in the first period and Vyacheslav Kozlov pulled the 
Red Wings into a 2-2 tie early in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get a lead. That's been our script all year," Shark Coach Kevin Constantine 
said. "We felt getting off to a big start was the key. The idea all year was to 
give ourselves a chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit had finished first in the conference and fourth overall in the NHL 
with 100 points. The Sharks, 18 points behind the Red Wings, were eighth in the 
conference and slipped into the playoffs with a losing record. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 4, Calgary 3 -- Pavel Bure's second goal of the game, on a breakaway 
at 2:20 of the second overtime at Calgary, gave the Canucks a victory and a 
date with the Dallas Stars in the next round of the playoffs, beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Vancouver's second consecutive overtime victory over the Flames, and it 
came when Bure took a lead pass from Jeff Brown and beat goaltender Mike 
Vernon. The Canucks became the 10th team since 1987 to rally from a 3-1 deficit 
to win a playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver's Greg Adams forced the overtime by scoring with 3:37 to play in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoren Fleury scored twice and Ron Stern had a goal for the Flames, who last 
won a playoff series in their 1989 Stanley Cup championship season. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Courtnall also scored for the Canucks.

<P>
 A Campbell, Calif., Little League coach fired for letting his team wear 
unauthorized black pants has his job back. The pants, however, have to go. 
</P>
<P>
 A compromise was reached between parents and the league board of directors. 
The parents agreed to the required white pants and the league agreed Sal 
Machuca could stay as coach of the Butchie's Pet Feed team. 
</P>
<P>
 Machuca was ejected from the field and the league on Tuesday when he and three 
players wore the banned pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league was just afraid of change, maybe that teams will show up in purple 
shorts next year," Machuca said.

 Trivia time: Who holds the NBA playoff record for most three-point baskets in 
a game? 
</P>
<P>
 Phantom opponent: Art Aragon, recalling his fight in Los Angeles with Carmen 
Basilio on Sept. 5, 1958, said he lost because he was too nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bell rings for the first round and I rush to the center of the ring and 
throw two left jabs, a hard left hook, two right hands and an uppercut," Aragon 
said.

ability to throw an effective sinker. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter asked her name, Niekro declined.

GOLF ROUNDUP; MAGGERT, HEINEN JOIN KITE IN LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Kite, after losing a two-shot lead, birdied the final hole Saturday to 
forge a three-way tie with Jeff Maggert and Mike Heinen after three rounds of 
the Houston Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite finished with a one-under-par 71 for a 204 total, 12 under par and two 
better than Hal Sutton, who shot a 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Heinen, a PGA Tour rookie who has made the cut in four of 10 events this year, 
was 14 under until he double-bogeyed No. 7, his 16th hole of the day, when his 
tee shot on the par three was blown into the water. He finished with a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggert, who lives at the Woodlands and plays out of the TPC course being used 
for the $1-million event, shot a 68 with a birdie on No. 5, his 15th hole of 
the day, to go 12 under. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggert started the rain-delayed third round three shots off Kite's pace and 
played par golf until beginning his surge with a birdie at No. 15, his sixth 
hole of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Woodlands played through the rain for a 66 and was at 207 with Rick Fehr, 
who shot a 68, and Doug Martin, who had a 70. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a 2-hour 55-minute rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long-hitting Jim Dent took advantage of hard fairways that produced drives of 
up to 340 yards for a six-under 66 and a one-stroke lead after two rounds of 
the $900,000 Las Vegas Senior Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit it awful well today," said Dent, who moved to eight-under 136, one 
stroke better than George Archer entering today's final round. 
</P>
<P>
 Archer shot 69 to stand at 137, a stroke ahead of Chi Chi Rodriguez, Raymond 
Floyd, Tom Wargo, Jack Kiefer and first-round co-leader Kermit Zarley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sherri Steinhauer, who has only one victory in a decade on the LPGA tour, 
threatened to run away with the $1.2-million Sprint Championship at Daytona 
Beach, Fla., the richest tournament in women's golf. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old golfer from Madison, Wis., matched the day's best round with a 
five-under 67 to go to 13 under at 203 and open a three-shot lead over Kelly 
Robbins heading into today's final round. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins had closed to within two strokes at No. 17 with a birdie while 
Steinhauer had her second bogey of the day after missing a short putt for par. 
But Steinhauer birdied the 18th to pad her lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Barb Bunkowsky, who has earned $964 on the tour this year, moved into third 
with a four-under 68, anchored by a 32 on the back nine. She was at 208.

NBA PLAYOFFS; NOT LETTING SLEEPING HAWKS LIE, HEAT CHOKES, THEN LOSES GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Atlanta Hawks had just fought off a Miami Heat rally, but there was still 
a sense of lethargy about, so Danny Manning issued a wake-up call with two 
flagrant fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat wasn't about to take it lying down. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Long's hard foul on Atlanta's Duane Ferrell was retaliatory, and it 
ignited a third-quarter melee in the Hawks' 104-86 victory Saturday night that 
evened the best-of-five first-round playoff series at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight, which emptied both benches and interrupted the game for seven 
minutes, "pumped us up and the fans and got us and the fans back in the game. 
It was an emotional influence," Ferrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrell scored 10 of his 23 points after the brawl, and Atlanta pulled away in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight started after Ferrell scored a rebound basket and was fouled by 
Long. Ferrell taunted Long, who began choking him as other players on the court 
started pushing and shoving and both benches emptied. Reserves Keith Askins of 
the Heat and Doug Edwards of Atlanta were ejected, as was Long. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami assistant coach Alvin Gentry broke his right hand and a finger trying to 
break up the fight, as police officers, coaches and trainers came onto the 
court trying to help the officials restore order. 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Ed F. Rush said Manning's fouls were not cause for ejection, but Miami 
Coach Kevin Loughery disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were protecting ourselves," Loughery said. "It is ridiculous to allow a 
guy to get two flagrant fouls like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 96, San Antonio 84 -- Fight night also had a show at San Antonio, where 
Dennis Rodman was ejected with 3:16 to play when he had a few words for the 
Jazz after a scrap with John Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton, who scored only three points in the series' first game, had 17 
before leaving because of a thigh bruise he suffered in the exchange with 
Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone was less concerned about Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to hit me harder than that. My daughter hits harder than that," 
Malone taunted. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone had 23 points and 14 rebounds for the Jazz, who evened the series, 1-1, 
by holding San Antonio without a field goal in 25 shots over a 16-minute span 
of the second and third quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 103, Orlando 101 -- Reggie Miller scored 32 points at Orlando, where 
the Pacers limited Shaquille O'Neal to a season-low 15 points to move closer to 
winning their first NBA playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 97, Denver 87 -- Gary Payton scored 18 points and Sam Perkins made a 
critical three-pointer in the final three minutes as the SuperSonics overcame 
27-for-42 free-throw shooting at Seattle to take a 2-0 lead in their 
first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins' three-pointer came with 2:47 to play and gave Seattle a 90-81 lead 
after the Nuggets fought back from a 14-point deficit with eight consecutive 
points to cut the SuperSonics' lead to 87-81.

COLLEGE TRACK AND FIELD; UCLA RUNNER ERASES DOUBTS IN 5,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA distance runner Karen Hecox had never run the 5,000 meters on a track 
until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 And even then Bruin distance coach Eric Peterson had to persuade her to do so 
in the California-Nevada Collegiate championship track meet at Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecox excelled, winning in 16 minutes 24.98 seconds to qualify for the NCAA 
championships next month in Boise, Idaho. It was the second fastest time in 
school history behind the school record of 15:49.37, set by Kathy Mintie in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've run 5,000 meters in cross-country, but never in track, but it's a lot 
different," Hecox said. "I was reluctant. I didn't know how it would be to keep 
seeing the lap counter for 12 1/2 laps. On the cross-country course, you have 
hills and different things to look at, but on the track it's just lap after 
lap." 
</P>
<P>
 Hecox, who has the nation's second-fastest time in the 3,000 (9:14.41), says 
she will probably run the 1,500 and 3,000 instead of the 5,000 at the NCAA 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Harris of Fresno State won the men's 5,000 in 14:20.04. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's and women's 5,000 were the only finals held on the first day of the 
meet, which features 22 schools. The finals in all other events will be held 
today, with the field events starting at 10:45 a.m. and the first running event 
at 12:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA junior John Godina, the defending Pacific 10 Conference shotput and 
discus champion, was the leading qualifier in the shotput. His first effort of 
64-1 1/2 was only four inches off his best outdoor throw of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Godina, the national collegiate leader in the discus at 204-2, didn't compete 
in the discus because of a pulled chest muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, the only school in the nation with four 60-foot shotputters, also 
qualified three others in the event. Senior Joe Bailey (58-9 1/2), sophomore 
Jonathan Ogden (57-4 1/4) and sophomore Mark Parlin (57-5). USC's Gary Kirchoff 
was the No. 3 qualifier (57-11 1/4) behind Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 USC sophomore Balazs Kiss, the defending NCAA hammer champion and the 1994 
national leader, was the top qualifier in his event at 221-1. Kiss used an 
17.6-pound hammer, which is 1.6 pounds heavier than the competition implement 
because he is in training and hopes to break the national record of 257, set by 
Oregon's Ken Flax in 1986. He will use a 16-pound hammer in today's finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State javelin thrower Todd Riech, the national collegiate leader, was 
the top qualifier at 237-9. 
</P>
<P>
 USC sprinter Inger Miller, the national leader in the 100 and 200 meters, 
didn't compete in the meet because of a foot injury. Coach Jim Bush said she 
hopes to compete in the Pac-10 meet May 20-21 at Washington State.

 Unfazed by a morning snowstorm that sent other athletes packing, Carl Lewis 
and Gwen Torrence flashed gold-medal form Saturday to win feature races in the 
cold, soggy Drake Relays in Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis easily outsprinted three opponents in his first 100 meters of the year, 
winning in 10.28 seconds. Torrence had a tougher time, holding off a determined 
charge by Indiana State's NCAA champion, Holli Hyche, to win the 200 in a 
meet-record 22.40. Hyche finished in 22.66. 
</P>
<P>
 Both races were run in challenging conditions, although the heavy snow that 
fell Saturday morning had given way to rain by early afternoon. But it was only 
36 degrees and patches of snow clung to the infield grass as Lewis loosened up. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first snow at the Drake Relays since 1950. Still, the eight-time 
Olympic gold medalist said he never thought about not running and the near 
capacity crowd of 18,000 greeted him warmly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the crowd can come out and sit for hours, I can at least run 10 seconds," 
Lewis said. "I've never been here before. I wouldn't miss this opportunity to 
run." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the athletes who pulled out were the Wisconsin women and Texas El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 The brutal weather didn't drive the Arizona athletes away, and they responded 
with some good performances. The Wildcats' David Loshonkohl won the hammer with 
a throw of 217 feet 11 inches; Brenda Sleeuwenhoek won the women's 1,500 in 
4:27.70 and four teammates won the women's shuttle hurdle relay in 56.51.

 Olympic 800-meter runner Tony Parrilla ran a sizzling 1-minute 44.5-second 
anchor to overcome three other runners and help Tennessee run a 3:13.28 in the 
men's sprint medley relay in the 100th Penn Relays in Philadelphia, breaking 
the Franklin Field and race records of 3:13.65 shared by Seton Hall and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee's victory shared the spotlight with Louisiana State's women's 
800-meter relay team, anchored by Cheryl Taplin, which set an American record 
of 1:32.55. The previous mark was 1:32.57, set by Louisiana State in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of the men's and women's Olympic development 1,500-meter races turned 
in sparkling times. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Holman, a 1992 Olympian and former Georgetown star, ran the fastest time 
in the world this year in the men's 1,500, clocking 3:36.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Procaccio won the women's 1,500 in 4:09.25, smashing the race record of 
4:11.8 set by Diana Richburg in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Drummond, leadoff runner for the winning American 400-meter relay team in 
last year's world championships, beat relay teammate Andre Cason in a special 
100-yard race. The two were trying to break the American record of 9.21 shared 
by Charlie Greene and Johnny (Lam) Jones. Drummond won the rarely run race in 
9.33, with Cason second in 9.36. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond also ran the anchor leg for a Nike team that won a 400-meter relay in 
39.05 and ran the third leg on a Nike team that won an 800-meter relay in 
1:20.60. Michael Johnson, the 1993 world champion at 400 meters, ran on both 
relays.

 With Rickey Henderson and Mark McGwire on the bench because of nagging 
injuries and a pitcher who had been in the minor leagues earlier in the day, 
the Oakland Athletics knew it might be another tough game. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there have been a lot of tough games lately for the A's, whose 7-5 
loss to the New York Yankees on Saturday was their 12th in a row.Oakland's skid 
is its longest in 16 years and is two losses short of a club record, set in 
1977.

 "I think they understand how many games it's been since we've won a game," 
Manager Tony La Russa said. "There's no easy answer as to what effect there is, 
except to go out there and try to win a game."

<P>
 Jimmy Key (4-1) gave up two runs and six hits in the first three innings, but 
gave up only one more run before leaving after the eighth. He got help from Jim 
Leyritz's two homers.

 Miguel Jimenez (0-1), moved up from the minors before the game, pitched three 
hitless innings then walked five batters in the fourth and left after getting 
only two outs.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MARTINEZ GIVES HITTERS THE INSIDE PITCH AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No apologies. No explanations. Pedro Martinez has hit six batters already this 
season -- he has walked only eight -- and he'll probably hit a few more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to quit pitching inside. I don't care if I hit 1,000 batters," 
Martinez said Saturday after getting his first major league victory as a 
starter in the Montreal Expos' 5-3 victory over the San Diego Padres at 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, he had better keep his boxing gloves handy. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (1-2) touched off a bench-clearing brawl for the second time this 
season by brushing back Derek Bell on an 0-and-2 pitch in the fifth inning. He 
had hit Keith Lockhart in the arm in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 In his previous start at Olympic Stadium, on April 13, Martinez took a perfect 
game into the eighth inning before hitting Cincinnati's Reggie Sanders, who 
charged the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it will take, but you can't keep hitting this many guys 
without someone saying something," said Lockhart, who left the game because of 
a bruised right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell said plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 He glared at Martinez while umpire Tom Hallion tried to defuse the situation. 
Martinez struck out Bell on the next pitch, but Bell lingered around the third 
base coaching box before breaking for the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Expo third baseman Sean Berry intercepted Bell as the benches emptied. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second time that this happens with a hitter that cannot hit the 
inside part of the plate," Martinez said. "He (Bell) is going to have to turn 
on that fastball if he wants anyone to change their style." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell was ejected from the game, and Martinez was relieved after the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind a guy coming inside 0-2, but when you start up around the head, 
that's ridiculous," Bell said angrily. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 1, Philadelphia 0 -- John Burkett gave up seven hits in 7 1/3 
innings and Matt Williams hit his 10th homer for the Giants at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkett (3-1) struck out four and walked two before being relieved by Mike 
Jackson in the eighth inning. Rod Beck pitched the ninth for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 Curt Schilling (0-4) retired the first 12 batters in order before Williams' 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 4, Cincinnati 3 -- Gary Sheffield hit his 10th home run, tying 
Williams for the major league lead, at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield homered in the fifth inning to break a 3-3 tie. It was his seventh 
homer in eight games at Joe Robbie Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 2, Atlanta 1 -- Denny Neagle outpitched two-time Cy Young Award 
winner Greg Maddux at Pittsburgh and the Pirates defeated the Braves for the 
fourth time in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux is 10-13 lifetime against the Pirates and 4-9 in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 15, St. Louis 5 -- Jeff Bagwell and Steve Finley each homered, drove 
in four runs and scored three times at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell went four for five, with a double, as the Astros got 20 hits. Finley 
doubled, singled and tied a career high for runs batted in.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CARTER ENDS A HOT MONTH ON A COLD NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the fourth inning, Joe Carter set a major league record with his 31st run 
batted in during April, at the same time assuming the American League home run 
leadership with a solo shot. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a chance to add to both totals and bring his Toronto Blue Jays back to 
even at Minneapolis with two out and runners on second and third in the eighth 
inning Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been very hot this month," Twin closer Rick Aguilera said. "He was 
certainly one of the last guys I'd want to face." 
</P>
<P>
 But Aguilera retired Carter on a fly ball and then pitched a scoreless ninth 
for his sixth save in the Twins' 11-9 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you like action, the ballpark was the place to be," Twin Manager Tom Kelly 
said. "Plenty of hitting, not too much pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins had lost all eight games in which they had given up more than nine 
runs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Hrbek doubled home two runs and Scott Leius followed with a two-run 
homer, highlighting a five-run fourth inning that gave Minnesota the lead for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning, however, the Twins might have lost Hrbek. 
</P>
<P>
 He doubled twice, tying him with Rod Carew for third on Minnesota's all-time 
list with 305. But he suffered a strained right hamstring on his fourth-inning 
double and had to leave the game. The Twins are listing his status as day to 
day, but Hrbek could barely move in the clubhouse and said: "It's pulled, and 
it's pulled good." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had begun Saturday tied with Colorado's Andres Galarraga for the April 
RBI record with 30, but Galarraga's game in Chicago was rained out. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 14, Cleveland 6 -- Juan Gonzalez drove in six runs with a homer, double 
and single as the Rangers won in a cold, persistent downpour at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Clark had four hits and Ivan Rodriguez hit a tiebreaking two-run double 
in the seventh inning. The Rangers, who outhit Cleveland, 19-9, scored 12 runs 
in the last three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland starter Dennis Martinez gave up two runs -- one unearned -- and 
eight hits in six innings, walking none and striking out six. He left with a 
4-2 lead, but the Indian bullpen blew it, keeping him winless in six starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 4, Kansas City 3 -- Turner Ward scored from first on Dave Nilsson's 
two-out double in the 10th inning at Kansas City, sending the Brewers to a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, who made three dazzling catches in right field, singled against Hipolito 
Pichardo (0-1) with one out in the 10th. One out later, Nilsson hit a sinking 
liner to left field, and when Vince Coleman slipped and fell trying to make a 
play, Ward scored all the way from first. Coleman was charged with an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 6, Seattle 4 -- Mike Mussina (5-1) went seven innings for his fifth 
victory, and Brady Anderson hit a three-run double at Seattle as the Orioles 
won for the fifth time in their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Smith struck out one batter in a perfect ninth inning for his 12th save in 
as many chances.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRACK AND FIELD / ORANGE EMPIRE CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
RIVERSIDE MEN, WOMEN WIN TITLES, BUT RANCHO SANTIAGO HAS BRIGHT SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Riverside, as expected, dominated the Orange Empire Conference track and field 
championships Saturday, but the men's relay teams from host Rancho Santiago had 
impressive performances as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tiger men won five events, winning the title with 212 points. Rancho 
Santiago (106) was second and Orange Coast (99) third. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside women won nine events and finished first with 254 points. San 
Diego Mesa (120) was second and Saddleback (79) third. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago ended the day on an uplifting note by charging from behind to 
win the 1,600 relay, the final running event. Riverside led after the first 
lap, Orange Coast took over on Lap 2, and Riverside took the lead again on the 
third lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rancho Santiago stayed near the lead. On the final lap, the Dons' 
Hector Flores moved into first coming out of the final turn and pulled away. 
Flores was put into position to win by teammates Ernie Wilson, Ty Wynn and 
Andre Mosley. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago's time was 3 minutes 17.35 seconds. Riverside was second in 
3:17.94. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons also got the running events off to a strong start by setting a 
conference record in the 400 relay. The Dons' team of Bernard Hardaman, Mosley, 
Flores and Wilson won in 41.49. Wilson pulled in front in the final 50 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside (41.81) was second and Saddleback (42.46) third. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley also won the 400 in 50.01, edging Fullerton's Roshawn Sims (50.08). 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Riverside was the favorite (in both relay races)," Rancho Santiago 
Coach Al Siddons said. "But sometimes in these meets, the kids rise to the 
occasion. I'm very proud of them because they all work so hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago's Gary Van Sluis set a conference record in the pole vault by 
reaching 15 feet 6 inches. He missed three times at 16-2. Fullerton's Jerry 
Sanchez, who started the year at 11 feet, was second at 14-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's Kevin Carlson was expected to challenge the conference high jump 
record of 7-0, but settled for winning at 6-8. He missed three times at 6-10. 
Carlson got his body over the bar on his last two jumps, but kicked it loose 
with his heel each time. His best this season is 6-10 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback got first-place finishes from Brian Cullum in the steeplechase 
(9:39.71) and Adrian Brown in the long jump (23-1 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Mezo of Saddleback was the only woman from an Orange County team to win 
an event Saturday. She took first in the javelin with a throw of 124-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast's Adrienne Sweetser won the 5,000 in 18:55.6 Tuesday.

MUSTAFA, ROBERTO EMERGE AS THE CLASS OF COMPETITION IN WSC CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Isaiah Mustafa of Moorpark and Auria Roberto of Glendale crammed a month's 
worth of competition into one meet Saturday night in the Western State 
Conference track and field championships at Bakersfield College. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither Mustafa nor Roberto could overcome the field-event depth of the 
Bakersfield men or sprint strength of the Santa Monica women in the battle for 
the team titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield won its third title in four years with 176 points. Defending 
champion Moorpark (147) was second, followed by Glendale (132 1/2) and Santa 
Monica (112). 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica women won their second consecutive title with 167 points. 
Runner-up Glendale had 116. Ventura was third with 80 1/2 points, followed by 
Moorpark with 67 and Bakersfield at 52. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa, runner-up in the state decathlon a year ago, had a hand in 43 points. 
</P>
<P>
 He cleared 6 feet 6 inches to win the high jump. The 6-foot-3, 190-pound 
sophomore finished third in the 100 (11.09), 200 (22.21), 110 high hurdles 
(15.14) and long jump (22-11) and was sixth in the triple jump (43-4). Mustafa 
also ran a leg on the Raiders' 1,600-meter relay team which was third in 
3:21.41. 
</P>
<P>
 Had it not been for a dropped baton in the 400 relay, Mustafa might have 
qualified for Saturday's Southern California preliminaries in an eighth event. 
The top six in each event advanced. 
</P>

 "We needed points and I had to sacrifice myself for the team." Mustafa said. 
"After the 200, I felt dizzy and delirious. I just had to forget about it and 
push harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto, who won the 5,000 meters in 18 minutes 36.5 seconds in the first day 
of the two-day meet April 22, accounted for 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman from Belmont High recorded victories in the 800 (2:23.60) and 
1,500 (4:51.06), and finished fourth in the 3,000 (10:53.40). Roberto, along 
with Anna Hernandez and Margarita Renteria, led 1-2-3 Glendale sweeps in the 
800 and 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto ran with the leaders in the 3,000 before being overtaken by Ventura's 
Josefina Sanchez and Valerie Aceves with 600 meters to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Turner of Glendale won the 800 meters in 1:54.31 and anchored the 1,600 
relay team of Henny Branford, Charles Smith and Mike Campos to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Landtiser of Canyons won the 400 intermediate hurdles in 53.54 and 
finished .21 seconds behind Glendale's Drue Powell (14.81) in the 110 high 
hurdles. Moorpark's Sean McKeown won the shotput by nearly three feet with a 
heave of 51-4 1/4 and was second in the hammer at 152-9.

CSUN RUNNERS IMPRESS WHILE THEY QUALIFY; COLLEGE TRACK: TRIO POST PERSONAL-BEST 
TIMES, ADVANCE TO FINALS OF CALIFORNIA-NEVADA CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Troy Collins, Chris Brown and Marshall Evans of Cal State Northridge produced 
personal best performances in their qualifying heats during the 
California-Nevada collegiate track and field championships at UCLA's Drake 
Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether they will have anything left in today's finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins couldn't speak for Brown and Evans, but the fifth-year senior said he 
had plenty in reserve after running 1 minute 51.30 seconds in the 800 meters to 
place second in his heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt good," he said. "It didn't feel that hard. I felt good throughout the 
race. It really wasn't that difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said that his time -- which lowered his previous best of 1:51.78 set 
in 1991 -- was long overdue after running consistently in the 1:52-1:53 range 
for the past two seasons at Northridge after transferring from Southern 
Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been frustrating because I've been running much better in practice than 
I've showed in races," he said. "It's really been a mental thing on my part. My 
body has been ready to run much faster, but my mind hasn't let me." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Don Strametz echoed those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "(He's) still not coming through the (600-meter mark) like he can," Strametz 
said, "But today was a breakthrough race for him. We've been waiting for this 
for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The heats of the men's 800 produced an abundance of quality marks. Youseff 
Choukri of Cal ran a solid 1:51.5, but failed to qualify for the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins' time moved him to 13th on the all-time Northridge performer list in 
the 800. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's second-place effort of 47.94 in the 400 ranks 10th on the all-time 
Matador list. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans trimmed .01 seconds off his previous best in the 200 when he ran 21.49 
to finish third in his heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think from the standpoint of this being the first (conference-type) outdoor 
meet that we have competed in the last three years, we handled parts of it very 
well and we didn't handle other parts of it quite so well," Strametz said. "I 
think this team will learn a lot and grow a lot from competing in this meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Hicks, Mike McClintock, Ivy Calvin, Kristin Dunn and Beth Burton advanced 
to the finals of their weight events. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge women's team suffered a blow when Teresa Stricklin failed to 
advance to the finals of the discus. 
</P>
<P>
 Stricklin won the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational with a personal best of 164-8 on 
April 15, but her 146-8 effort Saturday was only good enough for 13th, four 
places shy of advancing to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just didn't throw well," Northridge assistant John Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock was the No. 3 qualifier in the javelin with a season best of 207-6. 
Hicks had the No. 4 qualifying marks in the shotput (57-7) and hammer (200-9), 
as did Calvin in the discus (169-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn threw the women's javelin 152-11 to qualify second with Burton fifth 
(45-1 1/2) and Stricklin eighth (43-8 3/4) in the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's Terrence Carn appeared to get a bad break when he won his heat of 
the 400 intermediate hurdles in 53.12, yet failed to advance to the final 
because he had the 10th-fastest time overall. 
</P>
<P>
 His luck changed shortly thereafter, however, when Koutas Koutalas of Pt. Loma 
Nazarene -- the No. 6 qualifier -- withdrew from the final because that 
school's athletes do not compete on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Lori Miller was the only other Northridge athlete to win her 
qualifying heat, timing 4 minutes 37.62 seconds in the first section of the 
1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the relative ease with which she ran, Miller appears capable of 
shaving several seconds off her personal best of 4:36.05 in today's final. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Reed of UCLA and Kipp Ortenburger of Fresno State, former standouts at 
Canoga Park and Taft highs, qualified for the finals in two individual events. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed had the No. 2 qualifying mark in the 100 (10.69) and the No. 5 mark in 
the 200 (21.37). 
</P>
<P>
 Ortenburger placed second in the third heat of the 800 (1:51.3) and was 
runner-up in heat two of the 1,500 (3:49.19).

PIERCE TURNS DULL START INTO ROUSING FINISH; COLLEGE BASEBALL: WARREN SETTLES 
DOWN AFTER LEADOFF HOMER AS BRAHMAS POUND GLENDALE, 18-2, TO RETAIN ONE-GAME 
LEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Never try to guess the ending of a baseball game by its beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Those at Pierce College on Saturday who watched a Western State Conference 
matchup between Glendale College and the Brahmas can attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
 After Glendale took a quick lead when center fielder Bryan Warner opened the 
game with a home run, Pierce pounded two of three Vaquero pitchers for an 18-2 
victory to retain their South Division lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas (23-14, 15-7 in conference play) lead Bakersfield by one game with 
three games remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 Pierce defeated the Renegades, 6-3, on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 With Saturday's victory, the Brahmas also eliminated Glendale (12-19-1, 
10-11-1) from the South race. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were two big games for us this week," Pierce Coach Bob Lofrano said. 
"We responded well." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Glendale, the Brahmas answered with a 19-hit attack and a strong 
outing from right-hander Jason Warren (4-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, a freshman from Agoura High, allowed only three hits, struck out five 
and walked none in eight innings before giving way to closer Chris Frith-Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren retired the last 14 batters and was flawless except for Warner's 
opening shot and a solo home run by Randy Vickers in the fourth.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the ninth home run for the left-handed Warner and the 13th for Vickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a big performance by a freshman," Lofrano said of Warren.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has beaten these guys twice. He let the offense have a chance to take 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 That they did, with a seven-run explosion in the fourth to take a 9-2 lead, 
and with six runs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder Heath McElwee provided the big blow in the fourth with a 
three-run home run against Vickers (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Wickers usually plays shortstop for the Vaqueros.  
</P>
<P>
 The right-hander finished the inning but was relieved in the fifth by Rick 
Luna after yielding 10 hits and nine runs, eight earned. 
</P>
<P>
 Luna, a freshman right-hander, couldn't stop the onslaught. The Brahmas 
touched him for another nine runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-fielder Robert Vazquez, who was three for five with six RBIs, hit his 
third consecutive double in the seventh inning, a two-run liner down the 
right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored moments later on a sacrifice fly by pinch-hitter Mike Rutter. 
</P>
<P>
 Third baseman Lou Tapia and catcher Brian Sturges also had three hits for 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 And McElwee added a single in the seventh to go with his fourth-inning homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce has picked up momentum at the right time and Lofrano hopes the Brahmas 
can keep it going for the final three conference games and into the state 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we'll have some confidence (going into those games)," Lofrano 
said.

CSUN WINS AGAIN WITH EXTRA EFFORT; COLLEGE BASEBALL: SHANAHAN'S SINGLE IN 10TH 
GIVES MATADORS SECOND STRAIGHT VICTORY OVER FIRST-PLACE SAN DIEGO STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sure, he was the right guy in the right situation, but this was almost a 
fail-safe proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The bases were loaded with none out and all Jason Shanahan had to do was put 
the ball in play. Anywhere, practically. This was kid-in-the-candy-store time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great time to hit," Shanahan said. "You can almost screw up and win 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 He put the thumbscrews to San Diego State by hitting a single to drive home 
the winning run in the 10th inning and give Cal State Northridge a 10-9 victory 
in another tension-filled Western Athletic Conference game at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Screw up? Unlikely that Shanahan, the Northridge first baseman, would do any 
such thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The red-hot junior had three hits, including a solo home run, and drove in 
three runs as the Matadors (24-24, 12-8 in conference play) closed to within 
one-half game of the first-place Aztecs (29-29, 11-6) in the WAC's West 
Division. Northridge has four games left; the Aztecs seven. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's 7-6 victory, Shanahan contributed a key single as Northridge broke 
through to win in the 12th. To the surprise of no one on the Northridge bench, 
he again came through a day later. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's on one of those uphill-type development spurts," Northridge Coach Bill 
Kernen said. "Sometimes this can happen pretty fast, in a few days or a few 
weeks, and a guy can improve pretty dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasis on dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 In 20 WAC games, Shanahan is batting .452 (38 for 84) with six homers and 28 
runs batted in. He has hit safely in a career-high 15 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 The pivotal 10th was almost an instant replay of Friday's final inning. It was 
the same Matador foursome -- Steve Moreno, Eric Gillespie, Joey Arnold and 
Shanahan -- who put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading off against right-handed reliever Mark Gapski, Moreno singled to 
center and moved to second when Gillespie walked. Right fielder Steve Rushford, 
a left-hander, was brought in to face Arnold, who bats from the left side. 
</P>
<P>
 Rushford was a familiar sight. He came in from right field to face the 
switch-hitting Shanahan with runners at first and third and two out in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 How good are things going for Shanahan? Batting from the right side, he 
grounded out to short -- but only after Rushford wild-pitched a run home from 
third to give Northridge a 9-8 lead. Rushford returned to right in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Aztecs tied the score in the ninth, it didn't go much better for 
Rushford in the 10th. Arnold singled sharply to right to load the bases and 
Shanahan, again batting right-handed, whacked a high curveball down the 
third-base line to drive in Moreno with the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Rushford might not have been the greatest decision. Shanahan, batting 
.363 overall, is hitting .413 from the right side. With all the Aztec pitching 
moves -- four changes were made over the final four innings -- Shanahan didn't 
seem too sure who he burned for the game-winning hit. But then, does it matter? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wondering who was going to bounce where (in the Aztec lineup)," 
Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is fast becoming a story about bouncing back. With a victory in today's 1 
p.m. series finale, the Matadors can, almost unbelievably, move into first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 This from an injury-riddled team held together with plaster casts and 
bandages. Like Shanahan's game-winning at-bat, this too is a no-lose situation. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, Northridge can't afford to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where we wanted to be," Shanahan said. "Realistically, though, we're 
in the same situation as Friday. We've got to win."

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; NEVADA GETS TO WAGNER AND BEATS TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's Matt Wagner gave up seven runs on eight hits in six 
innings in the Titans' 7-2 loss to Nevada on Saturday at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended Wagner's 10-game winning streak, dropping him to 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (34-10, 11-5) managed only four hits off Wolf Pack starter John 
Patton (5-1), who struck out six in eight innings. Reliever Jason Rogers 
retired the side in order for Nevada in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan shortstop Jack Jones had one hit and scored a run, and right fielder 
Mark Kotsay doubled for the Titans' only extra-base hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Dante Powell walked, stole a base and scored the Titans' other 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss drops Cal State Fullerton out of first place in the Big West, one 
game behind the Wolf Pack (34-7, 11-3). The Titans host the series finale at 1 
p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 In Golden State Athletic Conference baseball: 
</P>

 Southern California College 5-6, Concordia 3-8 -- Ryan Seidel was two for four 
with two doubles and an RBI and David Seeley was two for four with a home run

</P>
<P>
 Christopher Kindreich was three for four with two RBIs for Concordia (16-26-1, 
5-12) in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 In Big West Conference softball: 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton 7-9, New Mexico State 1-0 -- Shannon Dolan's grand slam in 
the second game led the Titans (25-25, 14-9) to the sweep at home. Dolan, a 
junior catcher, had three hits and drove in six runs.

DINGER FOILS HIS PURSUERS IN WINNING SAUGUS MAIN

<P>
 Scott Dinger captured his third main event of the season with a victory in the 
Pro Stock oval feature race Saturday night at Saugus Speedway.  
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley resident started on the pole, but was shadowed by three cars 
for the entire 25 laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of pressure," Dinger said. "The car wasn't handling very 
well. It was hard to keep it under me." 
</P>
<P>
 That was primarily because Santa Clarita's Jeff Schrader was breathing down 
his neck.  
</P>
<P>
 Schrader moved past Gerrit Cromsigt of Pine Mountain Club on the sixth lap and 
was never more than half a car length behind for the final 19 laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Arleta's Brian Kelley provided similar pressure in third place, followed 
closely by Cromsigt, who finished fourth.  
</P>
<P>
 Dinger, 34, who entered the night with a 24-point lead over Richard Karvasek 
in the points standings, added a victory in the figure-eight trophy dash.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Mini Stock main event, Terry Limberopoulos of Bellflower moved past 
points leader Jeff McCall of Gardena on Lap 13 and cruised to his second 
feature victory in three starts. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall wound up second, with Robert Hynes of West Hills and Newbury Park's 
John Petsco finishing third and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Lloyd of Gardena won the Mini Stock Racing Assn. main event. El 
Monte's Kenny Smith was second.

scoring a run in the ninth.

 Sweden spotted the United States an early lead before scoring five 
second-period goals on Mighty Duck goaltender Guy Hebert to secure a 6-2 
victory at the World Hockey Championships. The U.S. team (3-1) still is assured 
a medal-round berth, however. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games Saturday, Norway tied the Czech Republic, 2-2, and Finland, 
with a goal from the Kings' Jari Kurri, eliminated France, 8-1. Russia beat 
Germany, 6-0, as Canada routed Britain, 8-2. Four teams in each group enter the 
medal round, which begins Wednesday in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Bob Beers' power-play goal in the first period put the U.S. team 
up, 1-0, and Edmonton teammate Shjon Podein scored in the third for the 
Americans, who face Finland on Monday. The U.S. team bolstered its lineup with 
Chicago defenseman Chris Chelios.

VENTURA TRIUMPHS DESPITE EFFORTS OF OXNARD CATCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a record effort by Oxnard College catcher Robert Sanchez, Ventura 
defeated the Condors, 5-4, Saturday in a Western State Conference baseball 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth inning, Sanchez gunned down three Ventura runners trying to 
steal second. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a record that can be tied, but never broken," Ventura assistant Don 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, a freshman, threw out four runners in the game. Ventura leads the 
conference with 86 stolen bases this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (22-14, 11-9 in WSC games) jumped to a 5-1 lead and held on when Bob 
Patterson pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth inning en route to 
his first save. Craig Arnold pitched five shutout innings in relief for Oxnard 
(15-20, 9-12).

MIKE PENNER: TIME, RAMS, RAIDERS ARE RUNNING OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Time marches on everywhere, except on the professional football fields of Los 
Angeles and Anaheim, where today it is the first day of May, 1994, and in 15 
months, it will be . . . 1945?  
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago, the local turf was as barren as can be when it came to pro 
football. No Rams; they still belonged to Cleveland. No Raiders; there were 
just a twinkle in Al Davis' eye. No Dons even; the old All-American Football 
Conference, of which the L.A. Dons were charter members, did not begin play 
until 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1945, life for the Southland football fan was uncomplicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was reserved for high school football. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday was devoted to USC and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was a day of rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine no pro football. I wonder if you can. A closed Coliseum. An empty 
Anaheim Stadium. Nothing to thrill or vie for. No Jerome Bettis too. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cities of Baltimore and Orlando, or St. Louis and Memphis, or San 
Antonio and Hartford -- or any combination thereof -- get their way, the 
greater Los Angeles metropolitan area could be going completely retro by the 
fall of 1995. We could be Ram-less and Raider-less and NFL-less once again, 
leaving us with nowhere to turn on Sundays except Fox, NBC and the San Diego 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Chargers, home team for everyone in the 619, 714, 909, 310, 213 
and 818 area codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unthinkable? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the cast of characters assembling for this outgoing saga. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are owned by Carpetbagger Al Davis, who only wants to be loved, or 
bathed in thousand-dollar bills, and has threatened in recent years to move his 
team to Oakland, Irwindale, Sacramento, San Jose, Orlando or a sucker to be 
named later. He's liable to blow any second. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are owned by Georgia Frontiere but run by John Shaw, who lives for 
the art of the deal, and is wringing his hands as he prepares to welcome all 
suitors this Tuesday, when Shaw officially exercises the escape clause in the 
Rams' Anaheim Stadium lease and makes the team a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these franchises were born to run. The Raiders have moved once 
already, from Oakland to L.A., in 1982. The Rams have moved twice, from 
Cleveland to L.A. in 1946 and from L.A. to Orange County in 1980. Both have 
stayed put for more than a decade now. A couple of trigger fingers have to be 
getting itchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Over lunch the other day, Shaw made his pitch as to why it is good business 
for the Rams and Raiders to consider greener pastures, and to do it ASAP. (Shaw 
ordered crabcakes -- a very nice touch, I thought -- and was disappointed to 
learn that the kitchen had run out of them. That shouldn't be a problem in 
Baltimore.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw portrayed Los Angeles as a "difficult marketplace" for pro football, 
noting the Rams' meager $500,000 radio deal -- "The lowest in the league" -- 
and that the Rams and Raiders both ranked near the bottom in home attendance in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recession has hit here harder than in other places," Shaw said, "and I 
still feel that fans in L.A. believe they have the ability, the luxury, to 
support winning teams. If you don't win, it's reflected more radically in the 
gate here than in other cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but few cities have been hit as radically on the football field as 
Anaheim lately. The Rams are 19-45 in the 1990s. That's a .297 winning 
percentage. Ram fans are sick and they are tired. After four long, hard years, 
they have earned the right to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Shaw complains that the Rams averaged "only 57,000 in a year the 
team went to the conference championship game" -- 1989 -- home attendance 
actually increased in 1990, to an average of 58,492, when the Rams finished 
5-11. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Ram fans have demonstrated a tolerance for the occasional down year -- 
just not four occasional down years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you define 'successful?' " Shaw wanted to know. "Were the Raiders 
successful last year?" 
</P>
<P>
 They made the playoffs, beat Denver in the wild-card game, OK, sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the Raiders had some sellouts, but they drew poorly in other games," 
Shaw said. "Look at the Lakers. Five championships, in the playoffs every year. 
Finally one year they don't make it, and look what happened to the attendance." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw went down the roster. Angels -- down in the standings, down in 
attendance. Clippers -- last in the NBA in attendance. Kings -- not hurting 
yet, but the team missed the playoffs and the ownership is in disarray. Lakers 
-- even Magic II couldn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the L.A.-Anaheim stable, only the Dodgers and the Ducks are thriving. Two 
out of eight franchises -- and one of them a novelty item. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do take some responsibility for putting a bad product on the field," Shaw 
said. "And yet, understanding that, we're having an almost impossible time of 
making it financially in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore or Memphis would be more forgiving, Shaw believes. And initially, 
they would. When you're starving, inferior product is preferable to no product. 
Jim Everett could have been mayor in Memphis. What, no Marcus Allen? In the 
eyes of Orlando, Nick Bell looks nothing less than All-World. 
</P>
<P>
 And, from the perspective of the Ram and Raider front offices, which is the 
simpler assignment: 
</P>
<P>
 Getting to the Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 Or getting out of town? 
</P>
<P>
 So the race is on, and a race it is, according to Shaw. The NFL has no 
intentions of hanging a vacancy sign on its second-largest market, so it will 
fight to keep at least one team in Los Angeles. Hence, the sense of urgency. He 
who hesitates could get held up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have already begun to negotiate with Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams join the fray Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the last NFL team to leave Los Angeles please bring the flag? 
</P>
<P>
 * WILL ANAHEIM LOSE GAME?: Tuesday, the Rams will invoke an Anaheim Stadium 
escape clause and become free to look for better opportunities elsewhere. What 
are the chances they'll leave? A1, A16-18 Building the NFL

HOLY BULL SEES BEST OF WEST; KENTUCKY DERBY: BROCCO HEADS THE SEVEN-HORSE 
CALIFORNIA CONTINGENT THAT WILL TRY TO UPSET PROBABLE FAVORITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California gold rush to the Kentucky Derby, which swept aside almost all 
comers during the 1980s, dried up abruptly when that decade turned the corner. 
But now, with the 120th Derby less than a week away, California might be back. 
At least the West Coast troupe has the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is being projected as one of the toughest Derbies to win in years, 
seven California-based 3-year-olds -- nearly half the field -- are expected to 
run next Saturday, and each is a contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by the first three finishers in last month's Santa Anita Derby -- Brocco, 
Tabasco Cat and Strodes Creek -- the rest of the California Seven are Valiant 
Nature, Soul Of The Matter, Blumin Affair and Powis Castle. 
</P>
<P>
 Those four hit the Derby trail early, running in prep races in Kentucky, 
Oklahoma and Arkansas in recent weeks, and although their five starts produced 
only a string of second-place finishes, their trainers came away encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 From the East, the only obstacle in their path might be Holy Bull. In March, 
when trainer Jimmy Croll's horse won the Florida Derby, the only California 
horses in the field were a couple of badly beaten third-raters, so no East-West 
comparisons could be made. But a month later, in the Blue Grass Stakes at 
nearby Keeneland, Holy Bull won by 3 1/2 lengths over Valiant Nature, the 
Hollywood Futurity winner over Brocco. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do I think of Brocco now?" Croll said after the Blue Grass. "Well, part 
of that question was answered in this race. The California horses beat each 
other all the time, and they're very similar to Valiant Nature. At least I'm 
hoping that they're all the same. My horse has a good shot with those 
(California) horses." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Holy Bull has won seven of eight starts and will go off at close to 
even money Saturday, California trainers aren't daunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what happens to favorites in the Derby, don't you?" said Jack Van 
Berg, who trains Blumin Affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Spectacular Bid's victory in 1979, 14 consecutive post-time favorites 
have been defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody will run with Holy Bull (early), and then we'll see what happens," 
said Van Berg, who saddled the winning Alysheba in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this colt, I don't feel quite as good about going into this Derby as I 
did with Alysheba," Van Berg said. "But I think this colt might be fitter going 
into the race. I think he's fit enough right now, and I don't plan any works 
for him during Derby week. We lost some time with Alysheba, when he had that 
surgery for that entrapped epiglottis." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Gato Del Sol came out of the West to win the Derby in a 21-1 upset in 
1982, there had been some rocky, embarrassing years for California contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cassaleria has only one eye and a lot of courage," someone wrote about 
trainer Ron McAnally's Derby horse in '82. "But the real knock against him is 
not based on vision, but geography. He's accustomed to running on drag strips. 
California horses ring up swift times on that rubberized asphalt and then spin 
their wheels on the Churchill Downs surface." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, California horses came, didn't spin their wheels and conquered. 
After Gato Del Sol, Sunny's Halo won the Derby in 1985. Calling Sunny's Halo a 
California horse might be a stretch because both of his Derby preps were at 
Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, but the sore-legged colt wintered with trainer David 
Cross at Hollywood Park and rounded into shape with the help of the track's 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no gray area about the California horses who won after that: 
Ferdinand in 1986, Alysheba in '87, Winning Colors in '88 and Sunday Silence in 
'89. Even without Sunny's Halo, there were five West Coast winners in eight 
years. There were no more jokes about California racetracks. 
</P>
<P>
 What has happened to the hopefuls from the West since 1990 is unrelated to 
track surfaces, quality of horses or training philosophies. Simply put, 
California horses have had an incredible run of bad luck even before the last 
four Derbies have been run. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the 19-10 favorite was Mister Frisky, the Santa Anita Derby winner. 
He was that Derby rarity, an undefeated horse, and no Derby horse had gone into 
the race with 16 victories in a row. The first 13 had been in Puerto Rico, 
against far lesser opposition, but Mister Frisky's Santa Anita form validated 
his ability. 
</P>
<P>
 During Derby week, rumors that something wasn't right about Mister Frisky were 
discounted by trainer Laz Barrera. Mister Frisky, second after six furlongs, 
was eighth at the wire, and 2 1/2 weeks later, after a third-place finish in 
the Preakness, the colt underwent emergency surgery for an abscess in his 
throat and almost died. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, there was another hard-luck Santa Anita Derby winner. Dinard was 
working poorly at Churchill Downs, and a torn ligament was found in one of his 
legs. California had to settle for Best Pal's second-place finish behind Strike 
The Gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Santa Anita Derby winner A.P. Indy, the favorite for the 
Kentucky Derby, was scratched on the morning of the race because of a bruised 
hoof. Lil E. Tee scored a one-length victory over Casual Lies, who had finished 
two lengths behind A.P. Indy at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, two of California's better Kentucky Derby candidates were through 
early. Gilded Time and River Special, who had finished first and third, 
respectively, in the national voting for best 2-year-old colt in 1992, were 
injured during the winter. They didn't even make it to the Santa Anita Derby, 
and the horse who won that race, Personal Hope, ran fourth at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the California contingent would have been even deeper if Irgun, who 
won Aqueduct's Gotham and Wood Memorial, hadn't been eliminated from the Derby 
because of a hoof abscess last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Irgun was running in New York because his trainer, Steve Young, believed the 
pickings were easier than in California. After Irgun ran a strong second to 
Strodes Creek in a March race at Santa Anita, Young convinced the colt's 
owners, Brandon and Marianne Chase, that there was a mother lode in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "That Santa Anita allowance race is going to stand up as a race that could 
have been a stake," Young said. "It was on a par with a stake as far as 
toughness." 
</P>
<P>
 Toughness. That word again. Shug McGaughey, a New York trainer, used it last 
fall, after California horses had run off with most of the accolades in the 
Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we don't train our horses tough enough back home," McGaughey said. 
"Maybe we should re-evaluate how we're doing things." California Connections

MIKE DOWNEY: L.A. WILL BE THE LOSER IF MCNALL BECOMES A RELIC OF SPORTS SCENE

 Versed as he is in the study of ancient Rome, possibly Bruce McNall can 
comprehend as few can the concept of "Fabian tactics;" that is, the endeavor to 
tire out an adversary by delay or evasion, rather than by direct confrontation. 
In the sovereignty of coins and antiquities in which McNall became a king and 
amassed an amazing fortune, more than once he endured crises by doing a little 
sidestep, stalling for time until a market could rally or until a shady 
business associate or incensed foreign government could be assuaged with 
promises that whatever had gone wrong, McNall would make it right.  
</P>
<P>
 Unquestionably he had counted on maneuvering and treading water long enough to 
avoid some of the very tribulations in his professional life that have now 
surfaced, such as McNall's having to abdicate his title as one of hockey's 
chief executives, having to abandon some of his most loyal subjects in a Black 
Friday purge at his Century City headquarters and having to respond to an 
inquiry from his own nation's government. This is a faceoff that Bruce Patrick 
McNall cannot afford to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the downsides of befriending an owner, coach or athlete, or, for that 
matter, anyone in any livelihood, is in its inherent difficulty in believing 
the worst about that person. Throughout the last few years, so many individuals 
have become so smitten by McNall -- an undeniable charmer and bon vivant 
described by one old and dear acquaintance as someone who "could sell pictures 
to the blind and snow to the Eskimos" -- that many have been willing to 
overlook or dismiss his self-acknowledged penchant for prevarication or 
embellishment, his know-how at how to succeed in business by trying practically 
anything.  
</P>
<P>
 It is with this in mind that acquaintances dread the thought of McNall being 
jeopardized by bankruptcy, corruption or anything else that would reduce his 
role as one of the most popular and fascinating Players ever to populate the 
back lots of California sports, a jocular jock mogul with a endearing 
accessibility that makes one root for McNall to emerge from this morass of 
hassles he has gotten himself into, if for no better reason than the sheer 
vivacity of his personality. Face it, the guy has been valuable to Los Angeles 
sports in ways too numerous even for a numismatist to count. We have no desire 
to see his empire crumble.  
</P>
<P>
 McNall came striding into the various sports of kings in a limitless 
collection of dapper dark suits, sort of the anti-Jerry Buss, dressed for 
success. Step by step, the ambitious McNall went from being a minority investor 
in such losing propositions as the L.A. Kings of hockey and the Dallas 
Mavericks of basketball to becoming a legitimate bigwig, an American sportsman 
who tacked hockey teams, football teams and thoroughbred horses onto his walls 
like the trophies of a hunter. He was not so much an owner as a collector.  
</P>
<P>
 Shrewdest of the wheeler-dealers, McNall went out and bought one of the most 
expensive, unattainable athletes in North America, then co-opted that 
individual, Wayne Gretzky, into investing in the most expensive, unattainable 
picture of an athlete extant, a gimcrack of Honus Wagner valued as though 
painted by Renoir. This transaction was negotiated by McNall with the same 
sanguine resolve that had enabled him two decades ago, at the tender age of 24, 
to sit inside a Zurich boardroom and outbid agents of Aristotle Onassis and 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing for a decidedly rare 5th-Century coin. Not long ago he 
put up for sale another coin, a gold commemorative so historic that it was said 
to have been minted by Brutus on behalf of Caesar.  
</P>
<P>
 This is no piker, Bruce McNall. And yet what was often ignored in eventual 
tributes to McNall's status and sociability were the means by which he 
accumulated many of his holdings. Inside his portfolio, for example, reportedly 
were mentions of his graduate studies at Oxford or of his financial 
consolidations with Howard Hughes and J. Paul Getty, all of them figments of a 
vivid imagination. McNall cut corners and took chances, sneaking genuine coins 
of the realm, to borrow a phrase from Sydney Greenstreet, out of foreign lands 
even inside his socks or shoes, or acquiring artifacts with methods tantamount 
to smuggling. His was a risky business.  
</P>
<P>
 On the sports page, however, his identity was solely that of a marvelously 
wealthy eager beaver, intent upon making a go of ice hockey in Los Angeles in a 
venture only slightly less difficult to sell publicly than snow to Eskimos. For 
nearly a quarter of a century, the Kings had entertained audiences with 
scarcely more competitive legitimacy than skaters in the Ice Capades. Seldom 
had one team been so poor for so long. Never champions, they were rarely even 
challengers.  
</P>
<P>
 McNall was a breath of fresh air. Not that the previous owner hadn't been 
committed to winning, but Buss' attentions were divided, whereas McNall was 
single-minded. He was a boy with a great new toy. Unlike other boys, however, 
McNall did not merely play with his toys; he built and built upon them, like 
Lego blocks or electric trains. He spent. Money seemed to be no object. When 
the winning would begin, McNall would unearth other methods of making something 
on his investment, among them an escalation of ticket prices that made rinkside 
seats affordable only to those who did not have to inquire what they cost.  
</P>
<P>
 With the great Gretzky came renewed interest, and with each triumph came the 
band wagoneers. The locker room became a place where players could no longer 
undress or accommodate interviews without first socializing with musicians or 
golfers who were invited into the private sanctuary by McNall as though it were 
some members-only Sunset Strip lounge. It became not uncommon to find a Goldie 
Hawn or a Candice Bergen milling about the dressing room, as though having been 
appointed honorary assistant coach. McNall had finally begun to derive from 
hockey what Buss had long enjoyed from basketball, a juicy mixture of success 
and glitz.  
</P>
<P>
 And in the process, he had even made the selfless gesture of removing himself, 
at least theoretically, from the everyday role of immediate superior to the 
team's ranking hockey expert, turning it over to two men who ostensibly would 
oversee the entire operation. Insiders insist that this was little more than 
posturing, that McNall was as involved the past two seasons as ever. 
Nevertheless, it was at the very least a clever maneuver during a time when 
other owners of teams refused to accept any responsibility for their teams' 
failures. In a world of George Steinbrenners and Jerry Joneses, here was a boss 
who seemed willing to buy the horses but let his hired hands handle them.  
</P>
<P>
 This has been the public McNall, a hail fellow well met. In his uncomfortable 
struggle to keep up appearances, McNall has been contending of late that all is 
well, that his pockets remain deep, that his sudden move to sell majority 
interest in the Kings reflects no dire straits on his part, that parting with 
high-priced football player Rocket Ismail brought him little sorrow, that his 
reported $92-million debt to Bank of America will be addressed and that, 
fortuitously, the volatile rare-coin business is bouncing back. Yet creditors 
are at the door. So are investigators. McNall must find a way to hold them off. 
 
</P>
<P>
 In one fell swoop Friday, meanwhile, he relinquished his role as pro hockey's 
chairman of the board and laid off some personal employees. Tumult has come to 
the Byzantine house of McNall.  
</P>
<P>
 Businessman, movie producer, mover and shaker, on the sports page Bruce the 
boss remains, although his story by now certainly transcends his status as 
employer of a bunch of hockey players. Given time and means, perhaps McNall 
will extricate himself from this sinkhole and go back to the simple pleasures 
of watching a stallion gallop, watching a skater skate. The guy has been in 
tough fixes before but usually got out of them, richer for the experience. 
Bottom line, good luck figuring a way out of this.

JIM MURRAY: BUTLER IS A NATURAL AT TOP OF THE LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was in the seventh inning of a tie game when Brett Butler committed his 
dastardly act. He hit the first pitch. It rollicked down the right-field line, 
another inexcusable bit of treachery on his part. Brett Butler's hits are 
supposed to land in short left -- if indeed they leave the infield in the first 
place.  
</P>
<P>
 It drove in a run. Later, he stole third and came home on a hit to build a 
Dodger lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, this is grossly unfair to the pitchers' union. For a pitcher, this was 
behavior barely to be countenanced. It was like seeing St. Francis of Assisi 
drowning birds, or Mother Teresa showing up at a disco. The Phillies should 
have protested the game.  
</P>
<P>
 It is written in stone that Butler a) never even offers at the first pitch, 
and b) if he does, he bunts it, and c) either way, it goes to the left side of 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitchers count on this. In some dugouts, managers post fines for any pitcher 
who throws anything but a strike on the first pitch to Butler. And woe betide 
the third baseman who plays deep.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler, you see, is a pure leadoff man. Not the careless modern type who 
completely misunderstands the nature of leadoff hitting. The Rickey 
Henderson-Tim Raines-types who think the proper way to lead off is with a home 
run.  
</P>
<P>
 No proper leadoff man would have any truck with a home run. Brett Butler has 
no use for the home run. He hit only one last year and only three the year 
before that. Brett likes to make more of a production of his runs. He gets them 
90 feet at a time, and he has to connive, work, think, dissemble and string 
them out.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a throwback," Butler says. "I'm a Richie Ashburn-Wee Willie Keeler-type 
of leadoff. Rickey Henderson is not a leadoff hitter. He's a three-hole hitter. 
He hits 21 to 28 home runs a year. Why waste that? I would be on base for him. 
We'd get two." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler never tries to overpower a pitch -- or a pitcher. He tries to outsmart 
him, and it. Every at-bat is a kind of game of liars' poker. There's a lot of 
bluffing going on.  
</P>
<P>
 The modern ballplayer usually leaves the dugout swinging. There are some 
players so aggressive, they swing at passing butterflies. A pitcher could get 
two strikes without letting go of the ball.  
</P>
<P>
 Not Butler. He makes the pitcher work for his out. Every out is a marathon.  
</P>
<P>
 "What a batter has to do up there is, get his pitch," Butler insists. "He has 
to make the pitcher throw the pitch he can hit. You have to work for that 
pitcher's mistake and jump on it. You can't do that by swinging at everything 
that leaves his hand. Impatience has ruined more hitters than the curveball." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a riverboat gambler, Butler feels that the more of the other guy's cards 
he sees, the bigger his advantage. Last year, he was second in the league in 
pitches looked at and rejected with 2,743. Butler scrutinizes a pitch the way a 
jeweler inspects a diamond. The slightest imperfection and he passes it up. He 
should wear a loupe at the plate.  
</P>
<P>
 Barry Bonds led the National League in four-base hits last year. But the other 
BB, Brett Butler, led the league in one-base hits. That's his stock in trade. 
He lets other guys work the fences. He has led the league in singles four years 
in a row.  
</P>
<P>
 He plays what he calls a "maitre d' " kind of baseball. "I set the table for 
the guys in the No. 3 and No. 4 hole," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 He says this is more important to club morale than a leadoff homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pull the team along," he said. "You unnerve the pitcher. You start 
rallies." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler comes with first base attached. He reached first 272 times, fifth in 
the league, last year. He has as many ways to get on base as a burglar has of 
getting into a bank. He can hit away. He had 147 singles last year. He can bunt 
his way on. He had 26 bunt hits last year. He had 41 in 1992 and has more than 
250 for his career. He can beat out an infield hit. He had 47 last year and 70 
in 1992. He leads the league annually in infield hits. He can walk his way on. 
He had 86 walks last year, fifth highest in the league, and 108 in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 "He does more with less than any player in the game," a rival manager once 
complained.  
</P>
<P>
 They walk Barry Bonds out of fear. Bonds walked 126 times last year, and 43 
times the walks were issued intentionally. Brett walked 86 times last year -- 
only once intentionally. Brett has to slicker the pitcher out of his base on 
balls. Bonds gets them tied with ribbons.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler is a throwback, all right. He would have been just as at home playing 
in 1908, when the ball was a beanbag and the advantage was all the pitcher's.  
</P>
<P>
 But his real edge, he feels, is his love for the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait to get to the ballpark," he says. "I'll tell you something: I'm 
a fan! When we don't make the playoffs, you'll find me in the seats in Atlanta 
watching the postseason games. A lot of guys just go home and don't even watch 
on TV. Not me. I love baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 It shows. Butler almost never has a scowl on his face, a curse on his lips. He 
plays the game like a kid on a sandlot with a new glove.  
</P>
<P>
 His dedication was tested this spring. The Dodgers had traded for Delino 
DeShields, the speedy leadoff man from Montreal who has stolen 187 bases in 
four years.  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball wisdom seemed to call for the younger, speedier DeShields to lead 
off, Butler to bat second.  
</P>
<P>
 But would Butler do it? He has a proud record of 1,128 runs scored as a 
leadoff man. Wasn't he jealous of his position? 
</P>
<P>
 No problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "Great idea!" Butler says of DeShields leading off. "That way I can help him, 
give him a chance to steal! I take a lot of pitches anyway and this would give 
Delino a great chance to take another base." 
</P>
<P>
 So, he would accept the supporting role? 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen," Butler says. "I would sell tickets! Whenever I think they took this 
kid who was under 5 feet tall and weighed 80 pounds in high school and he got 
put in a big league uniform and played for 14 years and only needs a few hits 
to reach 2,000, I don't think anybody owes me anything. I owe the game. I play 
where we win." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, when the Dodgers need a role filled, or a run scored, they ring for 
their Butler.

VALET OF THE SUNS; JERRY COLANGELO PRESIDES OVER NBA TEAM'S RISE IN PHOENIX, 
BUT HE ISN'T FINISHED WITH BIG PLANS FOR ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun streams through the windows that make up three walls of Jerry 
Colangelo's corner office in his Taj Mahal, the $90-million America West Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 To the north sit the downtown office buildings. In 1966, when he arrived, it 
was a metropolitan black hole. New Arizonans checked their urbanity at the 
state line. 
</P>
<P>
 To the south sits the site of a proposed $253-million domed baseball stadium. 
Colangelo leads the local group applying for a major league expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe they'll put the facility east of America West. They aren't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert fox watches an empire emerging in the hard-baked Valley of the Sun. 
Colangelo's basketball team has become one of the NBA's entrenched powers, but 
until the '90s he was a guerrilla pitted against the rich and famous, the 
purple and gold, the shadow that fell across his kingdom . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers. "Immediately to the west of us was the giant, L.A.," Colangelo 
says. "Phoenix, first of all, was kind of a stepchild city to Los Angeles. And 
the proximity and the stars that the Lakers had. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The salary cap leveled the playing field. Time leveled the Lakers. Now it's a 
scramble to fill the vacuum, with the Suns in the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
 Their storybook '92-93 season preceded this year's third-place finish in the 
Western Conference, but they have elite players and resources beyond those of a 
team in the nation's 19th-biggest television market. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 19,023-seat arena always sells out. Walk into a convenience store and 
there's a four-foot cardboard cutout of their mascot, the Gorilla, hawking a 
scratcher game. Colangelo plugs America West, the airline, not the building. 
Coach Paul Westphal endorses Neiman-Marcus. Frank Johnson, the backup point 
guard for heaven's sake, does a TV spot for the official chiropractor of the 
Suns. In one corner of the arena is the swank Phoenix Suns Health Club. A block 
away is Majerle's, the night spot co-owned by Dan, the local bare-chested 
poster king. Wherever you go are the voice, image, opinions, commercial 
endorsements and further adventures of the Sun God himself, Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 Given every break last season, other than the three-point basket by the 
Chicago Bulls' John Paxson that won Game 6 of the NBA finals, the Suns made 
more money than any other team. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning's hard-nosed agent, Ron Grinker, praises Colangelo for doing it 
right. Indeed, it's hard to argue with the Suns' all-in-the-family operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The front office is run by basketball people, starting with Colangelo, a 
University of Illinois point guard in the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Two former Sun coaches remain on the payroll, one of them Cotton Fitzsimmons, 
who left, was brought back, then moved to the front office where Colangelo 
thought up a title for him -- senior executive vice president, or as friends 
call it, VP in charge of golf -- to keep his brain in-house. 
</P>
<P>
 The current coach, Westphal, took Colangelo to arbitration twice but was 
forgiven when he showed promise. Neal Walk and Connie Hawkins work in community 
relations, Dick Van Arsdale in administration, Alvan Adams in the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 In lesser places, players are soon forgotten -- remember when ex-Laker Pat 
Riley was turned away from the Forum press lounge? -- but here there's an 
alumni lounge, next to the family lounge for current players, across from the 
decadently luxurious home team's dressing room and the practice court. 
</P>
<P>
 So conspicuous had Colangelo become as a rival that Magic Johnson, retiring 
for the last time in 1992, blasted him for having stage-managed a campaign to 
get him out of the Suns' way. 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo acknowledges raising the medical issue of Johnson's return at a 
board of governors meeting but says that's as far as it went. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day I heard the news he'd retired (in 1991), I was stunned," Colangelo 
says. "I cried. That doesn't sound to me like someone who's leading a 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns play to 100% capacity; the local NFL team runs closer to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hungers for major league baseball, its appetite whetted by the Cactus 
League and the old Arizona State dynasty. Colangelo says he has been assured by 
baseball officials that Phoenix will join the National League and St. 
Petersburg, Fla., the American in the next expansion. A quarter-cent sales tax 
increase to build a new stadium has been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo is sometimes called the most powerful man in Arizona. He has to deny 
speculation he will run for office. The anti-tax people are upset at him. The 
minor league hockey people fear he will use his friendship with NHL 
Commissioner Gary Bettman, the former NBA counsel, to import still another 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a guy who arrived at 27 with a wife, three kids and "$1,000 in my 
pocket," is it? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not that anyone was buying what he was selling in those days. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Willy Loman, Colangelo was out there on a smile and a shoe shine, 
proprietor of an enterprise no one had sought or wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The group that decided to buy an NBA expansion franchise was made up of rich 
men from Tucson and Beverly Hills. Their bid was accepted at a league meeting 
far, far away, with no Phoenix reporters in attendance. The city awoke one day 
to find the Suns on its doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo was a brash young man, brimming with drive and street smarts. His 
experience consisted of a year with the expansion Chicago Bulls. He was a 
Chicago kid and for all he knew, Phoenix was in the Sahara and as likely a 
place for a basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The day he climbed on a plane in snowy Chicago and disembarked in sun-drenched 
Arizona, he was halfway there. 
</P>
<P>
 He then talked the prospective owners into a $22,500 salary in a league in 
which general managers were happy to earn $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo was young and headstrong, with a weakness for looking over his 
coaches' shoulders before chopping off their heads. He dispatched the first 
one, his friend Johnny Kerr, during the second season and took over personally. 
His second coach, Fitzsimmons, posted 48-34 and 49-33 records, remarkable for 
the third and fourth years of an expansion franchise, and immediately bailed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be serious," Fitzsimmons said at the time. "You don't think Jerry wasn't 
going to fire me sometime?" 
</P>
<P>
 Says Colangelo: "He felt I still wanted to coach, that I was looking over his 
shoulder. . . . He probably was correct. Because we'd won in that first 
experience I had (the Suns went 24-20 the rest of the way, made the playoffs 
and took a 3-1 lead against the mighty Chamberlain-West-Baylor Lakers before 
falling), ego probably wanted me to think, 'I'd like to take a team from camp, 
go through the whole season, see what would happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzsimmons was followed by Butch van Breda Kolff, a happy-go-lucky man anyone 
would enjoy socializing with, but best suited to a relaxed employer. Colangelo 
pulled the rip cord in seven games and took over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't hit it off real well," Colangelo says. "A lot of things were 
starting to wear on me. We were 3-4." 
</P>
<P>
 He went 35-40 and was cured of his coaching bug. His next coach, John MacLeod, 
lasted 13 seasons, building a snappy little unit around Adams and Westphal. The 
Suns didn't have a true center -- MacLeod played the 6-foot-8 Adams at such a 
high post that opposing centers needed binoculars to find him -- but they 
posted four 50-victory seasons and made the NBA finals once. 
</P>
<P>
 Age wore at them. The great drug scandal of the '80s threatened to finish off 
the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 At the low point, Colangelo put together a group to buy out the old owners, 
gaining a small piece for himself to go with the operational control he had 
always enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 He rehired Fitzsimmons to coach the 1988-89 season and they began to rebuild. 
They traded their last star, Larry Nance, to Cleveland for Ty Corbin, Mark West 
and a rookie backup point guard named Kevin Johnson. They signed Tom Chambers, 
the first free agent under the current system, a gunner by reputation who 
averaged 26 points for them in two seasons. They went from 28-54 to 55-27, the 
third-greatest single-season turnaround in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
 They haven't won fewer than 53 games in a season since. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was something missing. 
</P>
<P>
 A title. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Big guys don't brag about 50-victory seasons. Big guys win titles or go home 
miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns were still smart, small, entertaining . . . and usually home by the 
conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo had a last card to play, the Suns' great depth, a result of draft 
expertise that led to the selection of players such as Jeff Hornacek, Cedric 
Ceballos and Andrew Lang with second-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was out there and its name was Charles Barkley, who was coming off 
a reign of terror in Philadelphia that involved arrests, fights and published 
criticism of teammates, management, the press and anyone else he thought of. 
His skill was undeniable, but it would take a brave organization to tie itself 
to the back of this tiger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who could have acquired him by trading Charles Smith, declined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns had another advantage. Barkley and Fitzsimmons were golf buddies, 
giving Fitzsimmons an invaluable, and at the time, rare look at Barkley's lucid 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo packed off Hornacek, Lang and Tim Perry to Philadelphia and 
harvested the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of speculation," Colangelo says. "Why would you go after 
Charles Barkley, he's this, he's that. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he was, was one of the most talented players in the league. . . . Give 
him a new team in a new city with all the things we had going for us, we were 
going to catch him on the rebound, he was going to be so excited to get out of 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after we made the trade, he walks into this office -- we'd only been 
in the building for two weeks -- and he was excited as all get-out. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hugs me and he says, 'You got me out of purgatory.' I said, 'Charles, take 
a good look around. This building is sold out. We don't need you to sell one 
ticket.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'So you got me here to win.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'That's it. That's what this is all about.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It almost happened, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns, supposedly still too short, too casual on defense, too this, too 
that, won 62 games, best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 They rose from an 0-2 deficit against the Lakers in the first round of the 
playoffs to reach the finals. They lost the first two games at home against the 
Bulls, but still forced a Game 6, which they led in the closing seconds, making 
the possibility of a Game 7 in America West very real, indeed, until Paxson's 
three-pointer dropped on their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He came, he saw . . . he retired? 
</P>
<P>
 How can you have a happy ending if your prince walks away? 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley is talking about retiring. His back hurts. His buddy, Michael Jordan, 
is gone, as are Magic Johnson and Larry Bird and all the other superstars he 
measured himself against. He might not feel like staying only to call Scottie 
Pippen more names. 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo notes that Barkley hasn't reached the league's salary stratosphere 
and here's his chance, suggesting Barkley won't be allowed to bolt for the golf 
course without at least touring the Suns' vault. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he leaves, the Suns will have a large salary slot with which to pursue 
a free agent. Manning might be available and Phoenix is on his short list. 
</P>
<P>
 The most powerful man in Arizona will think of something.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; KEY TO LAKERS' REBUILDING EFFORT? IT'S CLASSIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 GIVE US FIVE YEARS, RETIRE AT 45 AND BUY MAUI 
</P>
<P>
 Wanted: Big-time coach to revive dynasty. Must baby-sit young players and 
weather a bad season or two while we sign some superstars. Total salary exceeds 
$20 million for the right man. Contact Dr. J. Buss, Forum, Inglewood, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Jerry Buss if it isn't hard to find good help. 
</P>
<P>
 He reportedly offered the job that Magic Johnson gave back, plus a 
$21-million, five-year contract, to Kentucky's Rick Pitino. Pitino reportedly 
turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they went back to their offices to play charades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers refused comment, suggesting it was media hype. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitino insisted he hadn't been offered anything. Then he asked: If he had been 
offered the money in the headlines, wouldn't he have had to check it out? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Lakers aren't keen on acknowledging that people are turning 
them down. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Pitino is sensitive about going down as the new Larry Brown, 
even though he has moved around and does like being courted. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pitino recruited Roderick Rhodes two years ago, he promised he would stay 
at Kentucky until Rhodes left. 
</P>
<P>
 What is he supposed to tell the kid now: "I thought about stiffing you but 
decided not to?" 
</P>
<P>
 However, Buss gushed about Pitino all last winter. Then Pitino showed up in 
town for a "speaking engagement," just as reports circulated that he had been 
offered the job. This is a lot of coincidence for a lifetime, much less a 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike my colleague, Mike Downey, I think Pitino would have been great. Of 
course, Pitino has an ego as big as all outdoors, but I prefer that to a 
humbler man with more to be humble about. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitino has turned around every stumbling program he has taken over -- Boston 
University, Providence, the New York Knicks, Kentucky. He'll make a fine NBA 
coach one day, but probably didn't intend to leave this year or to start at the 
bottom with a team like the Lakers, even if Buss' offer must have taken his 
breath away. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss might have trouble accepting a hard reality -- that the Lakers as he knew 
them are finished -- but he remains a great owner for one reason: When he says 
he wants the best, he means it and will pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 While the guy across town cuts his offer to his newest franchise player, after 
having alienated his old franchise player the same way, Buss offers Pitino more 
than twice the salary of the game's highest-paid coach, Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 With Johnson and Pitino out of the picture, Buss' wish list has run out, 
making that old Jerry West favorite, Roy Williams of Kansas, a prime contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams turned West down two years ago but is said to be intrigued by the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he's interested in pro ball," a friend of Williams says. "He started 
two years ago to prepare himself for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was in Phoenix when the NBA was holding a draft camp last week but 
said it was a coincidence, that he was vacationing with his son or something 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidence is very big this time of year. A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE BRAT PACK 
</P>
<P>
 No one has ever seen young players like today's, stars of the boffo NCAA 
tournament, entering a prosperous NBA, full of sneaker money and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes you shudder to think what the next century will offer. 
</P>
<P>
 How about: no uniform pants and shirts down to their ankles? 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it wasn't right for Johnson to equate the '94 Lakers he 
joined as coach with the '79-80 Lakers he joined as a player. 
</P>
<P>
 The '94 guys don't have the attitude the '79-80 guys had? Guess what? There 
are a few other things these kids are missing. 
</P>
<P>
 The '79-80 Lakers had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jamaal Wilkes and Norm Nixon. The 
'94 team had Vlade Divac, Elden Campbell and Nick Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
 Attitude is wonderful, but I'll go with the 7-2 guy who takes the occasional 
siesta but can drop a sky hook at crunch time. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson blasted his young players several times. Once, OK. They pulled a 
no-show in Phoenix and he was just telling it like it was. Twice? OK. He was 
explaining one of his frustrations on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, it was too much. The Laker youngsters aren't any worse than anyone 
else's. Management in basketball and other major league sports has always 
involved the art of handling head cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Divac has improved from the days when Johnson, the player, snarled, "C'mere!" 
at him on the floor, although Vlade does not yet have the fire of, say, Alonzo 
Mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Christie is a 45-r.p.m. record playing at 78, but a talent they'd better 
think twice about before trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Peeler is a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel is a prospect, if a stubborn one. George Lynch is a plus, even if he 
gives new dimension to the term small forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell is a write-off. He actually is making progress, but at his pace, he 
won't be a good NBA starter until he's 40. 
</P>
<P>
 This club was never two years away, or two players away. It doesn't need to be 
revamped, overhauled or shaken up, it needs to be rebuilt.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this fundamental is still resisted at the Forum. After a season in 
which Sedale Threatt averaged 26 minutes a game to Christie's 23, the Lakers 
finished with only the 10th-worst record -- and a 125-1 shot at the top pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, cut these kids some slack. They've got worse problems than attitude. 
SUNRISE OVER NEW YORK: HOW IT WILL GO 
</P>
<P>
 For those impatient to know how the playoffs will turn out: 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 3, Denver 0. Denver had two players with a total of 101 minutes of 
postseason experience. Coach Dan Issel said nobody expected anything of them 
and they proved it, trailing by 25 at halftime of Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 3, Portland 1. Swan song for Rick Adelman? 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 3, Golden State 2. Don Nelson, who uninvented the center position, is 
trying the same for point guard, which he divides among four players, two of 
whom, Chris Webber and Billy Owens, are forwards. He'll almost uninvent the 
Suns, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 3, San Antonio 2. Dennis Rodman's zeal doesn't mean as much in the 
playoffs, when everyone tries hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 3, Miami 2. Hawk insiders say it's really Mookie Blaylock's team, 
which explains the Hawks' late slide. Correcting for three-pointers, Blaylock 
shot 47% in the first 77 games, 35% in the last five, went three for 16 in 
Atlanta's Game 1 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 3, New Jersey 1. What, them tired? Riley just took the Knicks to 
Charleston, S.C., for his annual pre-playoffs boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 3, Cleveland 0. Mike Fratello finished a remarkable season without 
Brad Daugherty and Larry Nance and, as a reward, lost Hot Rod Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 3, Orlando 1. Only the Houston Rockets shot more three-pointers than 
the Magic, but they don't fall as easily in the thick playoff air. Nick 
Anderson made the Magic's first two in the Game 1 loss, after which Orlando 
went one for 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second round: 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 4, Utah 2. George Karl has three guards to hound John Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 4, Houston 3. The Rocket bench is hurting. Mario Elie is coming off a 
broken bone in his right hand. Carl Herrera's knee is so sore, the Rockets put 
Earl Cureton on the playoff roster just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, Chicago 2. Riley didn't invent the carrot and stick but might try 
to copyright it, as he did Byron Scott's "three-peat." Before this series, he 
takes the Knicks to Peoria for a riverboat gambling excursion. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 4, Atlanta 2. Danny Manning, averaging 16 points as a Hawk after 24 as 
a Clipper, takes the heat for the loss and signs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In the conference finals: 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 4, Seattle 3. It's still a superstar's game, and the Suns outrank the 
SuperSonics, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, Indiana 2. Riley takes the Knicks to Bloomington to meet Bob 
Knight, so they can realize how good they've got it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the finals: 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 4, New York 3. Riley can't find a theme park and takes his players to 
watch Charles Barkley partying in Scottsdale. John Starks and Anthony Mason get 
too close and are arrested in a melee that starts when Barkley throws a nun's 
autograph book in the street. A friendly D.A. springs Barkley to bring home the 
title. Barkley retires and is elected governor of Alabama, running on a 
law-and-order platform. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 A plague on all their houses: A board of governors meeting, perhaps smelling a 
tank job by Detroit (13 losses to end the season), Minnesota (10 losses to end 
the season) and Milwaukee (1-9 in its last 10, a victory over the Pistons), 
broke their three-way tie at 20-62 by giving them all the same chance in the 
lottery. . . . The Clippers finished 1-9 for seventh worst, giving them a 23-1 
chance for the first pick and about 8-1 for one of the top three. . . . The 
Lakers, 10th worst, are 125-1 for the top pick, about 40-1 for one of the top 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise move, the Bulls left Horace Grant's heir apparent at power 
forward, No. 1 pick Corey Blount, and center Will Perdue, recently signed to a 
five-year contract, off the playoff roster. Perdue said he might attend the 
games but added, "If it's cutting into my golf time, or the White Sox or the 
Cubs game, I might have to decline." . . . Stars of last week's Phoenix 
pre-draft camp: Arizona's Khalid Reeves now figures to go around the bottom of 
the lottery. Nebraska's Eric Piatkowski, a 6-foot-6 guard, was MVP and moved 
into the low teens. The other all-tournament picks: Brian Grant, a 6-9 forward 
from Xavier of Ohio; Eric Mobley, a 6-11 center from Pittsburgh, and Dickie 
Simpkins, a 6-9 forward from Providence. All were dark horses who now figure to 
go in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Solidarity only goes so far: The Knicks' Charles Smith, Charles Oakley, Derek 
Harper and Herb Williams shaved their heads for the playoffs, but Ewing said he 
likes his flattop. Riley didn't even consider it. "I don't think they want me 
to do that," he said. "It would be such a shock, they wouldn't be able to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte's non-playoff finish means Seattle will get a lottery pick, probably 
No. 11, to complete that Kendall Gill-for-Eddie Johnson-and-Dana Barros steal, 
er, deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brown's wife, Shelly, on their triumphant first season in Indiana: "We 
never make the assumption when we buy a house that we'll be there forever. But 
I have unpacked some boxes that Larry hasn't unpacked in 20 years."

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES: SEE THROUGH THE SMOKE DON'T BAN CIGARETTES, BAN 
CIGARETTE PROMOTION; IT'S TIME TO THROW TOBACCO OUT OF AMERICAN SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On television this month from Indiana, whenever Indy 500 race cars are on the 
track, several of the fastest will double as movable billboards for cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one way the industry bypasses a 1971 federal law prohibiting televised 
tobacco advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other ways: 
</P>
<P>
 * At some sports events, cigarette ads are placed to catch the eye of the 
viewing public through the eye of the TV camera. Near scoreboards, for 
instance, or in other choice photo positions, tobacco signs adorn many American 
stadiums, ballparks and racetracks. 
</P>
<P>
 * In recent years, women's tennis tournaments have been promoted by tobacco 
interests whose role is routinely mentioned by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two other prominent national motor sports groups -- the stock car and drag 
racing associations -- plug tobacco during races nearly every weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this they do even though, for three decades, every U.S. surgeon general 
has identified smoking as life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 The nicotine in a cigarette is so addictive, according to a finding by the 
National Institutes of Health, that a drug classification for tobacco is being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tobacco is a poison," Joycelyn Elders, the new surgeon general, told a 
Washington group the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 A critical question: Why are so many sports people playing ball with 
poisoners? 
</P>
<P>
 The plain answer: It pays. There are nice rewards for those who will help the 
tobacco companies hook new enthusiasts for an addiction so overpowering, some 
research shows, that it is as hard to kick as heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an annual tobacco-related death rate of more than 400,000 -- by 
comparison with, for example, 58,000 American deaths during the whole of the 
Vietnam war -- cigarette smoking has lost none of its appeal to the addicted. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what makes effective pushers so valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, any sportsman or woman with a tobacco sponsorship is frequently the most 
valuable player on the cigarette team. INDY: TOBACCO ROAD 
</P>
<P>
 Most human beings have habits they would like to end -- habits as harmless, 
but persistent, as a craving for fudge or ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Throw in the addictive element, and, as most smokers discover, they are nailed 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Their addiction and its consequences -- including some fatal second-hand-smoke 
illnesses -- have finally provoked America to fight back. This year, as never 
before, tobacco is under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 City, state and federal officers have all begun handing down long-overdue 
no-smoking regulations or otherwise promoting smoke-free areas. And 
increasingly, ballpark and other stadium administrators have been insisting on 
smoke-free events without tobacco billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, doesn't mean that the battle against tobacco has been won -- or 
that it is turning into a rout -- as some say. Far from it. Millions of 
Americans spent $47.5 billion on tobacco last year, when hundreds of thousands 
of new smokers were, as usual, recruited -- most of them children. 
</P>
<P>
 The only difference this year is that nonsmokers are no longer sitting on 
their hands. There has been widespread campaigning in most states for a 
cigarette-free country. 
</P>
<P>
 That seems to have won the approval of most leaders everywhere -- the major 
exception being a persuasive bunch in professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Europe, where Formula One racing thrives and smoking is much more 
prevalent than in the United States, some countries prohibit cigarette 
advertising. Thus, when tobacco-sponsored cars race in England, Germany and 
France, the tobacco stickers have to come off the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely that, after a British race, a car owner could promote 
cigarettes on television with comments of the kind Roger Penske made in the 
Indianapolis winner's circle a year ago when he told U.S. viewers, "I'm just 
thrilled for Marlboro." 
</P>
<P>
 After winning, driver Emerson Fittipaldi said, "Marlboro is back up." 
</P>
<P>
 It all helped give the Indianapolis track the look of a 1990s Tobacco Road. A 
TRAP FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys show that three adult smokers out of four would quit if they could. 
Every educated adult knows that smoking can lead to premature death. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell that to a kid today, though, and he's likely to laugh at you. 
</P>
<P>
 Children, therefore, are a tobacco salesman's one, great, natural 
constituency. And happily for cigarette manufacturers, whose most loyal 
customers die off every year, the sports world provides one simple, easy way to 
keep reaching new generations. 
</P>
<P>
 For, pollsters report, numerous teen-age smokers are sports fans or wanna-be 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco's increasing need for new customers was recently stated mathematically 
by Suzi Gates, health communications officer for the Atlanta Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a very conservative estimate, there were more than 418,000 
smoking-attributable deaths last year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, every day last year, hundreds -- some say thousands -- of teen-agers 
began experimenting with and then got hooked on cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most (smokers) are hooked by the time they're 20," Elders said. "What's sad 
is that they're addicted before they're old enough to have adult judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the kids who grow up to join the crowd of 46.3 million American smokers, a 
majority emerge from two groups: the undereducated and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Incidence of smoking) is radically down for those with one or more years of 
college," Gates said. "But it's still rising for smokers with a high school 
education or less. And it's higher yet if you're just above the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a group, cigarette smoking is rising fastest among adolescents." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what makes pushing tobacco so unreservedly shameful for athletes, 
or for sports organizations or others in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tobacco companies are focusing on two markets now," Gates said. "Youth 
and international." 
</P>
<P>
 The Joe Camel campaign, she said, adds up to one way to interest kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The international campaign, which is tobacco's response to aggressive 
anti-smoking activity in America, focuses on Third-World countries 
particularly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Third World is home to unlettered millions of potential smokers. It is, in 
truth, home to the planet's largest collection of ignorant kids and adults who, 
living slightly above the poverty line, are poised to give cigarette companies 
another century of lovely profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, the "merchants of death" were munitions makers. Now they 
export tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide today, that might be America's greatest sin. THE LINCOLN DIMENSION 
</P>
<P>
 If cigarettes are so hazardous that they give thousands of the addicted no 
realistic choice but to die smoking, shouldn't it follow that no person in the 
able-bodied, thriving world of sport should take money for pushing tobacco? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a workable platform: 
</P>
<P>
 * No smoking at any stadium, racetrack or school. 
</P>
<P>
 * No distribution of free smokes. 
</P>
<P>
 * No tobacco sponsors for athletes or sports events. 
</P>
<P>
 * No tobacco signs or billboards in sports venues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Specifically in auto racing, no tobacco signs or symbols at the track or on 
race cars or drivers' uniforms or their other paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who disagree with any of the above often cite first-amendment, 
free-speech privileges and argue that they aren't doing anything wrong because, 
if a product is legal, it's perfectly proper to promote it. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alibi, that is plausible but fallacious. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that tobacco is legal in America today in part because as a 
society, we don't have much interest in making another drug illegal. 
Prohibition didn't work with alcohol in the 1920s, it isn't working very well 
with cocaine and other drugs in the '90s, and there's no reason to believe it 
would work with tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 The real question is this: Just because a poisonous product is legal, do we 
have to promote it? 
</P>
<P>
 A century and a half ago, an American president, Abraham Lincoln, faced an 
intimidating, uncertain situation that was somewhat similar if unspeakably 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavery was legal then, commanding the explicit approval of the Constitution. 
And so Lincoln at first couldn't emancipate the unpaid servants of the South. 
</P>
<P>
 But he could keep hard-eyed apologists and propagandists from promoting and 
extending slavery into the vastness of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The genius of Lincoln's solution was in drawing a line. He would accept an 
evil temporarily. But even if it meant civil war, he would not allow the poison 
to spread. And in the crucible of a frightful war, slavery, as Lincoln perhaps 
foresaw, died. DRAWING A NEW LINE 
</P>
<P>
 In today's America, things needn't come to war, but one good place to draw the 
line is against tobacco's apologists and propagandists. Last year alone, $500 
million was spent to advertise cigarettes, Gates said from her Atlanta office, 
and no less than $3.5 billion went into tobacco promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The $3.5 billion didn't all go into sports," she said. "But much did." 
</P>
<P>
 That any went into sports is embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 A civilized society should make one change immediately. It should put an end 
to the promotion perversion, prohibiting not tobacco but all tobacco ballyhoo. 
</P>
<P>
 But are Americans that civilized? 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls suggest that about half the citizenry still supports smoking in 
restaurants, as well as offices, and that more than half are in favor of 
tobacco sponsors for sports events. 
</P>
<P>
 Such attitudes, social scientists say, are typical of the historic national 
response to misconduct in America. Historians note that in Lincoln's century, 
for example, slavery held the support of nearly half of all voters -- even in 
Northern states -- and that until the present century, nearly half the 
population, women included, opposed women's right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if Americans of good will decided to outlaw tobacco propaganda. Would 
any legitimate businesses be imperiled? 
</P>
<P>
 "A ban on (tobacco promoters) would do significant damage to motor racing," 
said Bryan Tracy, vice president of the National Hot Rod Assn., drag racing's 
major sanctioning group.  
</P>
<P>
 Most race car owners agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Others argue that in a sports boom era, new sponsors would take up much, if 
not all, of the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with fewer sponsors, though, it would seem more responsible for any sport 
to quit pushing destructive devices that ambush children and painfully end so 
many lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, in fact, whether a sport deserves to exist if it can't 
operate without creating addicts to a deadly substance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days when slavery was legal, Lincoln often said, "If slavery isn't 
wrong, nothing is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, if hooking children on cigarettes isn't wrong, nothing is wrong.

GREAT OPENING DAY FOR ANGLERS; OUTDOORS: IDEAL WEATHER AND ABUNDANCE OF TROUT 
GREET FISHERMEN IN EASTERN SIERRA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day was unseasonably warm, with a gentle breeze blowing and the sun's rays 
streaking through the clouds that shrouded the steep Sierra peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing missing was a rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, you happened to be a fisherman. For them, rainbows were 
plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday was opening day of the 184-day fishing season in the Eastern Sierra. 
And what an opening day it was for catching rainbow trout, and to a lesser 
extent brown and brook trout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely red hot, smokin' hot," said Rick Rockel of Ken's Sporting Goods in 
Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
 It was surely one of the more productive openers in history, thanks to nearly 
ideal weather conditions and record trout plants by the state in the weeks 
leading up to the event. If anybody was concerned that the DFG won't have as 
many fish to stock in the summer months, having released most of them early to 
save money, they didn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
 At Crowley Lake Fish Camp above Bishop, an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 showed up, 
anticipating easy limits. Unlike last year, when a freezing wind blew and the 
lake was so cold that the fish could hardly move, much less put up a decent 
fight, the popular reservoir didn't disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had five people hit their full limit by 10 a.m.," said Joe Yamasaki of 
Cypress, a 10-year opening-day veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringer upon stringer was plopped onto cleaning tables, where it was 
elbow-room only from late morning until midafternoon, by which time most people 
had already caught their five-fish limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Landgard of San Clemente had one of the most impressive stringers, 
mainly because of the wild-looking, 4.24-pound brown trout hanging next to four 
fat rainbows. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leslie Wanagihara of Oxnard caught the biggest fish at Crowley, a 
6.36-pound rainbow. By 5 p.m., it was reportedly the largest fish caught in the 
Eastern Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 Up U.S. 395, at Convict Lake below Mammoth, fishermen were packed on the lake 
like sardines in a can, but that didn't stop them from limiting out on trout. 
By noon, the counter in the general store at Convict was littered with Polaroid 
shots of fishermen and their stringers of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Ramsey, a teen-ager from Culver City, caught a 5.2-pound brown trout. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mammoth, about 600 at Twin Lakes had few problems catching limits of mostly 
pan-sized fish, and higher up at lakes Mary, George, Mamie and Horseshoe, 
fishermen pulled limits of rainbows, browns and brookies through the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 At the June Loop, things were no different at each of the four lakes on the 
loop, but the fish were bigger, many topping out at more than five pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Bridgeport, Rockel was impressed with the fish coming out of 
Bridgeport Reservoir, but even more so with those being put back into the East 
Walker River. It appears to have recovered from the massive fish-kill in 1988, 
when Nevada farmers drained Bridgeport reservoir, silting up the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one father and son who caught and released 100 fish," said Rockel, 48, 
who has lived in the Bridgeport area for 29 years. "It's the best it's been in 
years. Everybody is catching a tonnage of fish."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; AND, IN CLOSING, MISERY HAS PLENTY OF COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a bad week for former, current and projected closers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Oakland Athletics released Dave Righetti, one-time ace of the New York 
Yankees' bullpen, and the Seattle Mariners released Bobby Thigpen, the Chicago 
White Sox's one-time ace. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Angels revised their relief plans and sent Mike Butcher to Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And the Florida Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals had to put Bryan Harvey and 
Mike Perez on their respective disabled lists. 
</P>
<P>
 If misery loves company, Harvey and Perez have plenty of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The disabled lists are already bulging with closers: John Wetteland of the 
Montreal Expos, Duane Ward of the Toronto Blue Jays, Rob Dibble of the 
Cincinnati Reds and Gregg Olson, who made his mark with the Baltimore Orioles 
and is now with the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson is not expected to be ready until midseason, if then. Dibble is probably 
sidelined for the season. Ward is back throwing, but his return from biceps 
tendinitis is uncertain. Harvey, Perez and Wetteland are expected to return by 
the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the overall dilution of major league pitching, age and attrition have 
diminished the closer ranks, reduced the percentage of converted saves from 70% 
in 1993 to 55% through April, tightened the trade market and seemingly spawned 
a new generation of closers. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, only 10 teams are operating with injury-free veterans whose 
names are synonymous with the closer role and who remain successful in it. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Todd Worrell of the Dodgers, Randy Myers of the Chicago Cubs, John 
Franco of the New York Mets, Doug Jones of the Philadelphia Phillies, Tom Henke 
of the Texas Rangers, Jeff Montgomery of the Kansas City Royals, Rick Aguilera 
of the Minnesota Twins, Jeff Russell of the Boston Red Sox, Lee Smith of the 
Orioles and Mike Henneman of the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Eckersley remains the A's closer, but at 39 he no longer boasts his 
trademark control or swaggering confidence. Mitch Williams might already have 
worn out his welcome with the Houston Astros, who have given save opportunities 
to Todd Jones and Tom Edens. Goose Gossage is strictly a spectator in the 
Seattle bullpen. Jeff Reardon is still getting work with the Yankees, but he 
has to get in line now. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Hernandez of the White Sox, Xavier Hernandez of the Yankees, Ken Ryan 
of the Red Sox, Trevor Hoffman of the San Diego Padres, Darren Dreifort of the 
Dodgers, Mike Wohlers of the Braves, Rick White of the Pittsburgh Pirates and 
Hector Carrasco of the Reds are among relievers who figure to be the next 
generation of closers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you lose the dominant closer, all you can do is scramble," Montreal 
Manager Felipe Alou said, fortunate to have Mel Rojas as a interim replacement 
for Wetteland. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, set-up man Mike Jackson has helped fill the void for the Giants, 
starter Todd Stottlemyre has stepped into the breech with Toronto and Carrasco 
has virtually come from nowhere to head a Cincinnati committee successfully 
replacing Dibble. 
</P>
<P>
 At 24, Carrasco has undergone reconstructive elbow surgery, compiled an 
undistinguished minor league record, been released by the Mets and traded by 
both the Astros and Marlins. He had never pitched in competition higher than 
Class A, but Cincinnati Manager Davey Johnson was reminded of Roger McDowell 
when he saw the movement on Carrasco's fastball in the instructional league 
last winter. Johnson told General Manager Jim Bowden: "He needs some work, but 
there's always someone who comes out of spring training as a big surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Dibble was sidelined because of his rotator-cuff problem, and Carrasco became 
the surprise. He is 3-1 with two saves and a 1.13 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, he's shown he can handle it," Johnson said. "Some of his previous 
clubs may have made a mistake using him as a starter. I'm comfortable calling 
on him as the closer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Carrasco-led bullpen has been the key to the Reds' strong start in the 
National League Central, but seldom does a mystery man step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays, seeking their fourth consecutive title in the American League 
East and already in the market for a starting pitcher, know their chances of 
acquiring a relief pitcher are virtually nil. The hapless Twins might 
eventually make Aguilera available, but the price will be steep. Harvey could 
also become available if he returns, but that price will be even steeper. In 
the meantime, the Blue Jays are hoping to return Stottlemyre to the rotation 
and use the talented but inconsistent Mike Timlin as the closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing we can do until we know about Ward," General Manager Pat 
Gillick said. "But even if he can't pitch, it may cost too much to trade for 
someone because there are so few closers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden, the Reds' general manager, thinks there will be fewer trades now, 
regardless of the position involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of realignment and the playoff system, it's going to be increasingly 
difficult to make the type trade that might win a (division title) for you," he 
said. "More teams know they can win, which means fewer teams will be ready to 
throw in the towel in midseason, concede they have no chance and trade away a 
veteran player for future prospects." MISSING EDGE 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants led the National League with a .276 batting average 
last season and are now last at .233. They miss Will Clark, but they miss the 
real Barry Bonds more. Bonds is batting .227 and suspects he is trying too hard 
to be nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need Barry Bonds back," he said of his nastier persona. "I don't care if I 
need to call him collect, or fly him here on a Lear jet. I miss him more than 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds said he got tired of reading what a bad guy he was, thought he could do 
it like Magic Johnson or Michael Jordan and learned he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always liked being the bad guy, having the odds against me," he said. "I 
know I want to be the best, and I know now I'll have to take everything that 
goes with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Dusty Baker acknowledged that some of Bonds' arrogance and confidence 
have been missing, but he thinks Bonds' struggle is more the result of a sore 
shoulder and bad timing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such a finely tuned machine," Baker said. "If you have a Volkswagen and 
the timing is off, it still runs OK. If it's a Ferrari and the timing's off, it 
runs like a tractor." PHLOPS? 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Phillies left Los Angeles Wednesday night with a 1-6 record 
for their first West Coast trip, a 1-9 record in games determined by one run 
and an 8-13 overall mark compared to 16-5 through 21 games last year, when they 
led wire to wire in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Jim Fregosi said they have been deficient in all areas and "atrocious" 
on defense. General Manager Lee Thomas said his players have misplaced their 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where this great macho attitude we're supposed to have has gone, 
but it's not there anymore," Thomas said. "I'm disappointed with the effort. 
We're waiting around to get beat." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't fall on only one person, but the players keep waiting for Curt 
Schilling (0-3) to show the intensity he did in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Darren Daulton, after Tuesday night's loss to the Dodgers, glanced at 
Schilling and said, "I'll tell you what stops this. When you have a starter who 
goes out and puts the fire out. When the No. 1 guy goes out and stops it. We 
need someone to step up and shut everything down. Someone who doesn't allow the 
team to lose." TRIBE TROUBLES 
</P>
<P>
 If the Cleveland Indians are to sustain their promising start, they will have 
to overcome the loss of catcher Sandy Alomar and shortstop Omar Vizquel. 
</P>
<P>
 Alomar, on the disabled list for the fifth time in the last four years, is 
expected to sit out two or three weeks after splitting the webbing between his 
middle and ring fingers blocking a pitch in the dirt. He suffered the same 
injury two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Vizquel might sit out two months because of a sprained knee ligament suffered 
when he was cut down at second base by Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez on a late 
slide. Many in the American League say Rodriguez takes cheap shots when the 
opportunity is there, and Cleveland General Manager John Hart said this one was 
blatant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He put Omar squarely in his gun sights and went out and got him," Hart said. 
"He could have ended his career." NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
 * BLUEBIRDS: In a four-day span starting Monday, the St. Louis Cardinals were 
rained out of consecutive games at Busch Stadium for the first time in the 
29-year history of the synthetic field, then put three pitchers on the disabled 
list. Rheal Cormier has a shoulder bruise, Mike Perez a shoulder strain, and 
Rick Sutcliffe suffered a pulled hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Urbani, who had been optioned to Louisville on Tuesday, was recalled 
Thursday even before he had left town. Urbani is familiar with the process. 
</P>
<P>
 He had four stints with the Cardinals after beginning last season at 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 "Limbo is better than Purgatory," Manager Joe Torre said of Urbani's often 
in-between status. 
</P>
<P>
 * MOUNTAIN HIGH: The Colorado Rockies led the National League in runs, home 
runs and slugging percentage through Thursday, with Ellis Burks, Andres 
Galarraga and Dante Bichette on a pace to hit 200 home runs and drive in 485 
runs. Galarraga, who set a league record for April RBIs, also aims to repeat as 
league batting champion, although he was down 74 points Thursday from his .370 
of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being one of the top 10," he said in a spring interview. "I want to 
see my name all the time. I don't want to give the batting title to somebody 
else. I want to hit .400, but I know I can help the team more by driving in 
more runs." 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD ROCKIES: Of his club-record 16-game hitting streak, former Angel 
Bichette said: "Unless you're going to break Joe DiMaggio's (56-game) record, 
who cares? Who knows who had the second-longest streak in history?" 
</P>
<P>
 * SABO'S LAMENT: A herniated disk that forced Chris Sabo to spend 15 days on 
the Cincinnati Reds' disabled list last season and scared off some teams before 
he signed a $2-million contract with the Baltimore Orioles as a free agent, is 
again causing Sabo discomfort and has him thinking of early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can't be productive, should I still sit around collecting something for 
nothing?" the 32-year-old third baseman said in Anaheim the other night. "I 
don't think that's right or fair to anybody and I'm not going to do it. I'm not 
going to waste anybody's time." 
</P>
<P>
 * RELEASE POINT: New York Yankee Manager Buck Showalter said that telling Bob 
Ojeda he was being released was the toughest thing he has ever had to do. Ojeda 
lasted three innings in two starts with the Yankees, giving up 11 hits and 
eight runs. He started nine games and appeared in 11 with the Yankees and 
Cleveland Indians after the tragic boat accident in the spring of 1993, 
yielding 59 hits in 46 innings with a 5.67 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "People keep asking me if I'm going to write a book or be in a movie," the 
former Dodger said. "I keep telling them I don't want to write an ending yet 
because it ain't over." 
</P>
<P>
 * NEON'S LIGHT: Deion Sanders is making them forget Otis Nixon. The Atlanta 
Braves' center fielder leads his club's starters in average at .368 and in 
walks and RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Manager Bobby Cox: "I don't know where the idea came from that Deion 
couldn't do the job. He's a prototype leadoff hitter but with power. Rickey 
Henderson is the greatest leadoff hitter ever to play the game and Deion is 
similar because he has power and speed. I'm not surprised by what he's doing. 
He's played well for us for two years." 
</P>
<P>
 * TO ERR IS . . . Manager Lou Piniella says he can't explain it, but his 
Seattle Mariners made 25 errors through their first 24 games after leading the 
majors in fielding last year. Second baseman Rich Amaral, who made only 10 
errors in 460 chances last year, made seven in his first 95 this year. He 
dropped a popup against the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night, then kicked the 
ball into the outfield corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Piniella: "I didn't know if he was playing baseball or soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 * CUB BASHING: Chicago finished 0-for-April at Wrigley Field, and its six 
victories for the month put them only one up on Bob Tewksbury, the St. Louis 
Cardinal pitcher who was released by the Cubs in 1988.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; INJURIES HASTEN RETURN OF DESHIELDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers nearly ran out of second basemen during Saturday's game against 
the Mets at New York. With Delino DeShields still sidelined after suffering a 
concussion and the Mets starting left-hander Eric Hillman, Manager Tom Lasorda 
started Cory Snyder ahead of Jeff Treadway at second. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seventh inning, first baseman Eric Karros injured his wrist in a 
collision with David Segui. Karros left the game, and X-rays were negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder moved to first base, and Treadway took over at second. In the eighth, 
Treadway was hit by a pitch from Josias Manzanillo and left the game. X-rays 
were negative. 
</P>
<P>
 The only second baseman remaining was DeShields, whose head is feeling better 
but said he wasn't supposed to play until today or Monday. But Lasorda had no 
other choice, so DeShields went in.  
</P>
<P>
 "The only other thing I could do is put (Tim) Wallach at second and Carlos 
Hernandez at third," Lasorda said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has been some time since Wallach, who is batting .419 in his last nine 
games with five homers and 19 runs batted in, has felt as good as he is this 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been so long, I don't remember," he joked. "I guess the last time was in 
'87, the other year of the juiced ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Manzanillo, who gave up three homers to the Dodgers during the eighth inning, 
said that now he knows the ball is juiced. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was called up, I heard about the balls bouncing all over the place, 
but now I can say something about that," Manzanillo said. "I can tell you that 
the balls do fly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Met Manager Dallas Green said he will keep Bobby Bonilla at third base, rather 
than moving him back to the outfield to protect his shoulder. Green said he is 
happy with Bonilla at third and wants him there as long as he can handle it. 
Bonilla was four for four with two RBIs and a home run Saturday. MARYANN HUDSON

 The Oakland Athletics signed former Dodger second baseman Steve Sax and put 
him in the lineup Saturday against the New York Yankees. Sax, 34, was released 
by the Chicago White Sox on April 21 after starting the season on the disabled 
list with a bruised left heel.He went two for four Saturday. Junior Noboa, who 
was batting .325 in 17 games, was designated for assignment to make room for 
Sax. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Pirates, desperate for a backup to take some of the catching 
load off Don Slaught, signed eight-time All-Star Lance Parrish, 37, off the 
Detroit Tigers' triple-A roster. To make room for Parrish, who has caught only 
10 games in the majors since 1992, the Pirates designated catcher Jerry Goff 
for assignment. Parrish was immediately put in the lineup against two-time Cy 
Young Award winner Greg Maddux of Atlanta. He went 0 for 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Pena, who hasn't thrown a pitch in a regular-season game since the 
Pirates signed him 17 months ago because of elbow surgery, then an ulcer, was 
activated after Saturday night's game.

DESPITE SEASON OF 'COASTING,' SUNS STILL RISE TO OCCASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last season was the honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
 This season was the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phoenix Suns, lost in the backwash of Houston's 22-1 start and Seattle's 
26-5 finish, nagged by injuries -- only Dan Majerle started as many as 70 games 
-- finished No. 3 in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley, the most valuable player in his first season in town, fell 
off in scoring (26 to 22), rebounding (12.2 to 10.9), assists (5.1 to 4.7) and 
games (76 to 71). 
</P>
<P>
 His back hurt, his best friends in the game had retired and some nights he 
looked bored. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's played for nine years," Denver's Reggie Williams said after an April 
game in which Barkley had four field goals, three rebounds and six turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might just be getting tired. It was like he was coasting out there." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Suns' organization, there was concern that he wasn't the only one 
coasting. Late in the season, Paul Westphal, steaming over a loss at 
Sacramento, closed practice and asked the driver of the team's bus to wait 
outside as he delivered a tongue-lashing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns clicked off seven consecutive victories to end the season. With 
Barkley and Kevin Johnson, they're still the only contender with two 
potentially unstoppable players. MARK HEISLER

CHEW ON THIS: IT'S BAD FOR BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From a public relations point of view -- meaning the view from a typical 
American living or television room -- baseball's major league players made a 
major league error last year when they voted to continue chewing tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Many TV fans keep saying that the things chewers do are the worst things about 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 But as an unfortunate situation, it doesn't have to last. The players can 
still change widespread impressions that they don't care what viewers think. 
</P>
<P>
 They can vote to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow veteran players to chew away, if they wish, until the day they die -- 
which probably will be prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deny rookies and all other new young players permission to chew tobacco on 
any major league playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 Or in any dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 Or anywhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 That would assure a tobacco-free environment for the so-called national 
pastime at some point early in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that too long to wait? Yes, but at least we'd know it's coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The way things are now, we don't. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, today, baseball is in an anomalous position. It is beginning to fight 
tobacco smokers -- banning cigarettes in ballparks here and there -- at a time 
when it is still encouraging smokeless tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 And that hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent studies show that although far fewer Americans chew than light up, 
those addicted either way are dying at about the same rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst of it is that smokeless users are on the rise," health officer Suzi 
Gates said from Atlanta's Centers for Disease Control. "Last year, (smokeless 
tobacco-related) deaths were over 8,000." 
</P>
<P>
 The smokeless hold on baseball -- a national scandal since the invention of 
television -- is based on directives prohibiting players from smoking on the 
basepaths, or even while running after a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus baseball's tobacco addicts can see no choice but to chew. 
</P>
<P>
 And there might be one good reason not to disrupt their filthy progress toward 
suicide: Until now, they've been behaving within the rules of baseball, it 
wouldn't be fair to change the rules in the middle of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Lending some hope, chewing is now banned in the minor leagues. And, surely, 
there should be a day when major league fans no longer have to put up with it, 
either. If it's reasonable to grandfather the players and managers who learned 
to chew in a different world, the least we should expect of baseball and its 
players today is the promise of a better world. BOB OATES

TROUBLE-SHOOTER BROWN KEEPS THE TITANS RUNNING; TRACK: COACHES, ATHLETES GET A 
LOT OF MILEAGE OUT OF THE DEDICATED EX-SPRINTER WHO SERVES AS AN ASSISTANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Ben Brown was the new guy on the block on Yorba Linda Boulevard. He had just 
moved into an apartment across from the Cal State Fullerton campus, and while 
he was walking his dog, he noticed the school's track nearby. It was little 
more than a grubby quarter-mile circle of dirt, but it was a track, and for 
Brown at that point, that was just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started working out there every day," he said. "It wasn't too long before I 
saw these college kids watching me run. I could see them talking quietly among 
themselves, and finally one of them came up to me and asked me if I'd like to 
be on their track team." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown couldn't hold back the laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," Brown said. "I don't have any eligibility left." Never 
mind that about a half-dozen years before, he had won the NCAA 440-yard 
championship in 1975 for UCLA. Never mind that in 1976, he had stood on the 
victory stand at the Montreal Olympics along with the other three members of 
the U.S. 1,600-meter relay team with a gold medal around his neck. And never 
mind that he had threatened the world record in the quarter-mile. 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't mention any of that. That's not Brown's style. He is a man of the 
moment. He enjoys life, and at age 40, he has found his own lane in it. 
</P>
<P>
 He still is a regular at Fullerton's track, even though he now lives in 
Ontario with his wife and 4-year-old son. Where more than 10 years ago there 
was an old dirt track, there is now a sleek all-weather surface. Now, Brown 
doesn't just run there; he's an assistant track coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton and Coach John Elders couldn't ask for a better deal. It's 
the school's good fortune that Brown's daytime job is at nearby Hughes 
Aircraft. After a full workday there as a computer specialist, Brown is only a 
short drive from working with the Titan sprinters, hurdlers and jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 He likes the blend. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hughes, he is a trouble-shooter for computer problems that develop at any 
of the company's area operations. "For me, the two jobs sort of go hand in 
hand," he said. "I'm a people person. I enjoy helping people. I feel I'm doing 
that in both jobs. Both my regular work and the school have been flexible about 
my situation and that's nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, he isn't coaching at Fullerton for the money. He's paid $2,500 per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cross my fingers every year that he'll be back with us," Elders said. "He's 
been a tremendous asset to us in the six years I've been head coach. We're very 
fortunate to have him." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown says he doesn't think about workload compared to dollars earned, 
although he smiles and says that his wife, Besela, gets on his case now and 
then about the time he spends coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tell her I want to do what I need to do for the program to be 
successful," Brown said. "The money's not the important thing. . . . I'm 
coaching because I want to. I'm the one who offered to help. I enjoy it and 
feel good about it. Coaching gives me a chance to transfer my experiences in 
track to the kids I coach. I know I can help them become better athletes. But 
the thing that I always tell them is that they have to believe in themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 They do, thanks to Brown. When he arrives for a practice, they quickly huddle 
around him, as they would a rock star. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know how fortunate we are to have him as our coach," said Jeri Young, who 
runs the 800 meters for the women's team. "If he sees something you're doing 
well, he lets you know you're the real stuff. In practice the other day, I had 
to do 20 100-meter sprints, and I was really dragging. . . . Ben jumped in and 
ran the last 11 of them with me. He does that kind of thing, just to push us. 
He knows we can use all the encouragement we can get." 
</P>
<P>
 Encouragement from Brown takes on special meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always has confidence in you," said Zaylore Stout, who competes in the 
hurdles, the high jump and the triple jump. "He's got us all believing in 
ourselves. He told me that I had my foot in the door to eventually becoming a 
world-class athlete if I keep working at it. That was like having Edwin Moses 
come up to me and say I'm a really good hurdler." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fullerton doesn't have a nationally prominent track program, Brown 
says he enjoys the improvement the team has made this season. "They're on the 
lower scale of it all right now, but things definitely are getting better," he 
said. "When we won our first meet this year, I could really tell a difference 
in the kids after that. They've been rooting for each other a lot more since 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 If Brown has regrets about his running career, one is that the money wasn't 
there for him the way it was for those in high-profile sports, such as 
football, basketball and baseball, after his college eligibility ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity to make money in track was very limited," he said. "And what 
money that was being paid in international track at that time was being paid to 
the distance runners. They were the ones benefiting. There were a few sprinters 
getting a couple of hundred dollars in appearance money, but not many of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is different. There's some big money to be made in track around the 
world now if you're one of the best. A few are getting thousands of dollars 
just to go to a meet. In the late 1970s, I was one of the best in the world at 
what I did at the time, and I couldn't make any money out of it. I had no 
choice but to go into the real world and try to make a living for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, he feels he wasn't ready for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA didn't really prepare me," he said. "No one talked to the athletes then 
about what they should be doing academically the way they do in colleges now. 
In those days, UCLA was La-La Land . . . a Disneyland for athletes. There were 
always things being done for you. You were treated really well . . . spoiled 
almost. But once your eligibility was gone, it was different." 
</P>
<P>
 He left UCLA without completing his degree, and his first job was as a staff 
assistant at a downtown Los Angeles gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company that owned the gym was real big on computer fitness, and I kept 
getting more and more involved in computer-related things," he said. "I learned 
a lot about computers and kept advancing in that area. One of our clients was 
Hughes Aircraft, and so I moved there from the fitness company." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, he completed work toward his degree in physical education at Cal 
State Los Angeles after going back to school part-time for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has continued to train and run in masters events. He won the 800 in the 
35-39 age group at the masters nationals in 1992 with a time of 1:56. He also 
has become involved in corporate track competition. "In those meets, we run 
mostly relays," Brown said. But nothing, of course, has come close to those 
days at UCLA when he had personal best times of 44.7 in the 400 meters and 45.0 
in the 440 yards. "I regret that I never was able to break a world record," he 
said. "I thought I would have a good shot at it my senior year in the NCAA 
championships, but it just didn't happen." He also ran on NCAA champion 
mile-relay teams in 1972, 1973 and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, Brown is not one to bask in past glory. "Some people I know don't 
have any idea that I have a gold medal," he said. "And I don't go around 
telling people about it. I want people to have their feelings about me as a 
person now, not for what I did as an athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 And the gold medal is stored at his mother's home in Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hers," he said with a laugh. "I just borrow it now and then . . ."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / KENNEDY COSGROVE: FERGUSON DELIGHTED BY ROYAL SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Longtime Royal High volleyball Coach Bob Ferguson had never witnessed the 
rabid intensity at a volleyball match he saw Friday night when his Highlanders 
played host to Marmonte League rival Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The electricity in the gym was just incredible," he said. "Downright 
incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened both sides of the bleachers and it was full. I'd say there were 
1,000 people. That doesn't happen in L.A. It doesn't happen in the CIF 
playoffs. In high school volleyball, that never happens." 
</P>
<P>
 But it did happen because events leading up to the match built substantial 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks entered the match 11-0 in league play and ranked first in 
Southern Section Division II. Royal was 10-1 in league play, its only setback a 
five-game loss to the Lancers on March 22. 
</P>
<P>
 That match marked not only Royal's first defeat in 66 league matches -- a 
streak spanning more than six seasons -- it also was the first time Royal had 
lost a game in league play, snapping a string of 198 victories in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenge was certainly on the mind of Royal, a perennial powerhouse which 
occupied the strange position of trailing an area rival. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only worry before the match was that the adrenaline would be too much," 
Ferguson said. "I tried to be really calm talking to them after school, telling 
them that they just had to do their job. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in the team room (before the match), their eyes were on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Their performance was equally smoldering. Royal opened the match with a 
resounding stuff block of a Thousand Oaks spike attempt and the crowd erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders proceeded to play their best match of the season and defeated 
the Lancers, 15-9, 15-6, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams have 11-1 league records with two matches to play. If they finished 
tied, they would be declared league co-champions. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Royal would get the league's top seeding for the Southern Section 
playoffs, because its victory against Thousand Oaks came in only three games, 
while the Lancers' victory against Royal required five games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely important for us to win in three or four games," said 
Ferguson, who was able to savor one of the sweetest victories in his seven 
seasons as Royal's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still bubbly about it," he said. "I've been to high school basketball 
games like that, but never to a high school volleyball match like that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome addition: Equally important for Royal, ranked third in Division II, 
has been the return of 6-foot-6 senior Matt Olsen, who has faced more than his 
share of adversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen suffered a foot injury before the season and missed the first month and 
a half, returning barely three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on April 18, his mother, Lorraine, died of cancer. The entire Royal team 
attended the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen played in a match the next day, and also last Friday, one day after he 
attended a second funeral for his mother in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's handled it really well," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen, who has had only eight days of practice this season, led Royal with 16 
kills and had three stuff blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson estimates that the talented opposite hitter has recovered to only 75% 
of his pre-injury level, and is excited by the prospect of having an improving 
Olsen in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really changed what our team looks like," Ferguson said. "Put (6-5) 
Garrison (Chaffee) or (6-5) Eric (Carlsen) next to Matt, and it's awfully hard 
for opponents to hit around them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Give us another two weeks and we're going to be dynamite." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie can: Talk about good theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa's Charlie Boch stepped to the plate in the bottom of the eighth 
inning in a key Channel League game Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 The game matched the first-place Spartans against Ventura, one of three league 
teams that trailed Rio Mesa by one game. 
</P>
<P>
 The bases were loaded and Boch's team trailed by three runs. Heroics were 
needed -- and nearly delivered when Boch smoked a 2-and-1 fastball over the 
left field fence. But the ball curved foul by about 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind blows from left to right, and I figured the wind might help keep it 
fair," Rio Mesa Coach Rich Doran said. "But it just kept hooking." 
</P>
<P>
 The count was 2 and 2. Boch then let the next pitch -- a very close pitch -- 
go by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I surprised myself that I let it go," Boch said. "I guess I was trying to 
settle down after that first hit. I think the umpire wanted to see a little 
battle going on there too." 
</P>
<P>
 Full count. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff pitch. Boch swings at a fastball on the outside corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just put everything into it," Boch said. "I was either going to go down 
swinging, or . . . well, I was going to go down swinging." 
</P>
<P>
 He drove it over the right field fence for a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darned if that wind didn't help us out on the slam," Doran said. 
</P>
<P>
 And darned if it wasn't Boch who had the winning hit. The junior outfielder 
has been on a tear. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last three games, he has 11 runs batted in, five runs scored and two 
home runs. "If we had to have somebody up, we're happy it was him," Doran said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory kept Rio Mesa, winners of six consecutive games, in first place in 
the conference and dropped Ventura two games back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt ecstatic," Boch said. "It was an unbelievable feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Singing the blues: He's probably accused umpires of making the same mistake, 
but El Camino Real baseball Coach Mike Maio made a call too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scheduled game Tuesday against Reseda was postponed twice, Maio wanted 
to play it Friday. He was told Friday morning by the San Fernando Valley 
umpires assn. that no umpires were available, so he reluctantly postponed the 
game again, until next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating because we played pretty good Thursday (a 10-1 victory over 
Reseda), and we wanted to keep things going," Maio said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, umpires were found by game time and they showed up . . . to an empty 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time there should be no snafu. "We called the umpires," Maio said. "We 
know they're free next Friday."

MASTER'S ROLLER COASTER STOPS, HARRISON STEPS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The winningest baseball coach in The Master's College history called it quits 
on Saturday after a doubleheader split that exemplified his roller-coaster 
four-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Harrison, who only a year ago guided the Mustangs to a school-record 28 
victories, resigned his position at the request of school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, 34, NAIA District 3 Coach of the Year in 1991, said he was told by 
Athletic Director Bill Oates that the school administration "wanted new 
direction" for the baseball program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one of those things that happen," said Harrison, who also vacates 
his post as the college's sports information director. Harrison's career record 
at Master's was 83-100-2. Until this season, he was the only baseball coach in 
the school's history with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs' 14-32-2 finish changed that, but Harrison was optimistic about 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the type of program we have here," he said. "You can't build a team 
where you have front-line guys and then others who you're grooming. We never 
had those kinds of resources. It was build, then rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew going into this year we would be down. We just didn't have that much 
coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison took the reins at Master's in 1991 after his brother, Pat, left to 
take a job as an assistant at Oklahoma. Prior to coming to at The Master's, he 
coached at Kansas State, Gordon (Mass.) College and in Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustang players were told by Harrison late Friday night that Saturday's 
District 3 doubleheader at Biola would be his last appearance as their coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's defeated Biola, 8-1, in the first game, but lost the second, 10-9, 
leaving the tying run stranded at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison had a career record of 47-40 in District 3 games. He said his overall 
winning percentage would have been better had he not annually scheduled tough 
nonconference opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside of league we got hurt bad, but I felt like we needed to play the top 
competition we could," Harrison said. "With the young team we had this season, 
we took our bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we could have played 35 games, an easier schedule, gone with our top 
pitchers more and probably had a better record. But I never wanted to play it 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison said he might pursue another job in baseball. He turned down a 
Division I assistant's job last season to remain at Master's.

RAM NOTES; JONES' STATUS DOESN'T BOTHER BOUTTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmie Jones has a new uniform, a pricey new three-year, $7.7-million 
contract, and a comfortable new spot on the Ram defensive line next to tackle 
Sean Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 So where does that leave Marc Boutte, who started at left defensive tackle 
last season? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no problems with being the backup," Boutte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones worked out with the Rams' first-team defense for most of Saturday's 
mini-camp practice. And although the starting position won't be decided until 
training camp, the Rams didn't spend all that money on Jones to have him on the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones started only four games in the past two seasons for the Cowboys, but had 
9 1/2 sacks for 39 yards in losses. Boutte started 31 games in that time, with 
only two sacks for a minus nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I'm looking to start and be an impact player," Jones said. "I know 
I've got to come in and work hard. It's not going to be there for me on a 
silver platter." 
</P>
<P>
 When he signed with the Rams as an unrestricted free agent in March, Jones 
traded a shot at winning a third Super Bowl ring as a backup in Dallas, for 
getting a shot at starting for a 5-11 team. 
</P>
<P>
 A fat contract and a chance to start next to a Pro Bowl player such as 
Gilbert, who attracts double-teams like a magnet attracts metal, came along 
with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm right back at Dallas," Jones said. "It's like a puzzle here, 
we're just getting all the pieces together. By the time camp is over with, we 
will have it together." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is one of seven Dallas players who have left via free agency, along with 
defensive lineman Tony Casillas and linebacker Ken Norton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chemistry of that team has been great, unbelievable," Jones said. "Now 
that's been destroyed. You hope they'll put it back together, but it will be 
hard because you saw how long it took to put that team together." 
</P>
<P>
 So what does Jones think of joining a team that won only 19 games in the past 
four seasons? For him, it's a familiar story. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was Dallas' third-round draft pick in 1990 from the University of Miami, 
where he played on two national championship teams. He joined a Dallas team 
that had gone 1-15 the previous year, but built its roster through the draft 
and won two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone said when I came out of Miami that I was going to a losing program 
in Dallas," Jones said. "We went 7-9 that year, but me, Emmitt Smith and 
Alexander Wright were among only four rookies on that team. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the Rams are coming off a better record than Dallas was, and we have 
better talent here than when I first got to Dallas. The Rams went out and got 
the key players to put in the spots they needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made the commitment, and we're going to turn it around quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback search: Free-agent quarterbacks Chris Chandler and Jack Trudeau 
are scheduled to visit Rams Park late this week, and Coach Chuck Knox said the 
team also might try to sign Steve Bono, released Friday by San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to investigate it," Knox said. "He's certainly someone you would give 
major consideration to. I've heard that the 49ers want to re-sign him, but 
we're going to pursue it." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox, searching for an insurance policy in back of Chris Miller, is high on 
Chandler, the former Phoenix quarterback. Chandler had visited the Rams on 
March 7, the day they signed Miller. Trudeau was waived in April by the 
Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole lot of people still out there -- Bono, Mark Rypien, Trudeau, 
Chandler, Andre Ware, Scott Secules," Knox said. "We're going to take a look at 
some people." Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Contract talks for linebacker Joe Kelly, waived by the Raiders last week, are 
at a standstill. The Rams offered a one-year deal at $500,000 and are waiting 
for an answer from Kelly. . . . Linebacker Shane Conlan sat out Saturday's 
workouts because of back spasms but returned for afternoon practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie wide receiver Isaac Bruce, the Rams' 33rd draft pick, had a couple of 
nice catches Saturday, including one grab with cornerback Todd Lyght, the 
team's top coverage man, draped all over him. . . . Mini-camp concludes today 
with a morning workout.

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; AS SUMMER NEARS, EAGER LAMB HOPES TO SPRING TO A 
REAL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shortstop David Lamb has had his fill of spring training. It's May, for 
heaven's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd definitely like to be somewhere else," said Lamb, who is in the Baltimore 
Orioles' extended spring training camp in Sarasota, Fla. "I'd like to be 
playing in front of some fans. Hopefully, I won't be down here too long." 
</P>
<P>
 He might not be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased with his progress at this time," said Doug Melvin, the 
Orioles' director of player development. "He has impressed our people with the 
way he handles himself, both on and off the field. He shows real good hands and 
good knowledge and feel for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say he reminds them a little of how Cal Ripken plays. He has real sure 
hands, positions himself well and has a good arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb, a second-round pick in 1993 from Newbury Park High, is playing in 
extended spring training rather than for a minor league club because he signed 
in mid-July last year and played only 16 games at rookie-level Sarasota, Melvin 
said. But he is playing well enough this spring that he could be moved up 
within the next few weeks to Class-A Albany, Ga., Melvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest adjustment for Lamb has been hitting with a wooden bat. He hit 
.179 in 56 at-bats at Sarasota last year. No official statistics are kept 
during extended spring, though Lamb said he is hitting over .300 and hit his 
first home run last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year there was no way I could have hit a home run," he said. "I just 
wasn't used to the wood bat. I couldn't get it through the hitting zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb was one of the Orioles' prospects called up to play in a major league 
exhibition game in March, and he made an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can just see it in his face that he's all baseball," Melvin said. "He has 
a real desire to get to the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Waiting in the wings: With the Angels' pitching staff lugging around a 5.27 
earned-run average, left-hander Andrew Lorraine (Hart High) can't be far from 
the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first full professional season, Lorraine is 2-1 with a 1.71 ERA in four 
starts at triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's throwing very well," said Gary Ruby, Vancouver's pitching coach. "He 
seems to be adjusting very quickly to the triple-A level. For a young pitcher, 
usually it is a pretty big jump." 
</P>
<P>
 A big jump, indeed. This time last year Lorraine was a junior at Stanford. 
After the Angels made him a fourth-round pick, he was assigned to Class-A 
Boise, Ida., where he was 4-1 with a 1.29 earned-run average in six starts. He 
was invited to the Angels' major league camp this spring, and he might not be 
far from rubbing elbows with major leaguers again. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ruby: "At the rate he's going, I think after the first half of the year 
(he will be ready to contribute at the major league level)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's one: Nearly five years after the Seattle Mariners made him the third 
selection in the 1989 amateur draft, Roger Salkeld (Saugus) recorded his first 
major league victory.  
</P>
<P>
 He pitched 6 2/3 innings of shutout ball against the New York Yankees on 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally getting the win is a big weight off my shoulders," Salkeld told the 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Salkeld, who was making his first start at the Kingdome and fourth of his 
major league career, gave up two hits, struck out three and walked five. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could call it effective wildness," Salkeld said. "I'm happy with 
my performance because we won, but I was a little wild at times." 
</P>
<P>
 Salkeld's outing was "rewarded" by a demotion to triple-A Calgary on Friday. 
But the move was simply because the Mariners have two off days next week and 
the team wants him to pitch on a normal four days' rest. He will pitch Tuesday 
night at Calgary, then return to the major league club and start against the 
Detroit Tigers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Salkeld underwent career-threatening reconstructive surgery on his right 
shoulder in October 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What ever happened to. . . .?: Sam Minyard (The Master's) has retired. A 1993 
draft pick of the Florida Marlins, Minyard pitched eight innings in Class-A 
Elmira (N.Y.) last season before arm problems ended his career. . . . Casey 
Burrill (Hart) also has retired. Burrill, who had shoulder surgery while at 
USC, spent last season in Class-A Idaho Falls, Ida., after the Atlanta Braves 
made him a 27th-round pick in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Vatcher (Cal State Northridge) is playing for the New York Mets' triple-A 
team in Norfolk, Va. . . . Jerry Willard (Hueneme), who played in the 1991 
World Series with the Braves, is playing for the Mariners' triple-A team in 
Calgary. . . . Still in extended spring training are 1993 draft picks Derek 
Swafford (Ventura) of the Pittsburgh Pirates, Nate Dishington (Hoover) and 
Tighe Curran (Thousand Oaks, Ventura College) of the St. Louis Cardinals and 
Bryan Corey (Thousand Oaks, Pierce) of the Tigers.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; ARCANGUES HEADS FIELD FOR JOHN HENRY HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is one thing certain about Arcangues in the $159,300 John Henry Handicap 
today at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-year-old Sagace horse won't pay $269.20 as he did when he won his last 
start -- the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Hindered by a bad back and problems with his hoofs this winter, Arcangues is 
ready to go now and he will have only four opponents in the John Henry, which 
is run at 1 1/8 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally scheduled to be retired after he shocked Bertrando and 11 others in 
the Classic in his first start on dirt, Arcangues was sent to trainer Richard 
Mandella for another year of racing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-5 morning-line favorite today, he will be ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, 
but the main objectives for Arcangues is the $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup on 
July 2 and another shot at the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trained back and forth (on dirt and grass)," Mandella said. "Our big 
goals are on the dirt . . . the Gold Cup and the Breeders' Cup. Hopefully, 
he'll be in good enough shape by then to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're trying the turf again to try and get a race into him, and 
hopefully, it will be easier on his back. I think he's prepared well. His work 
on Wednesday (five furlongs in 1:00 1/5) was just what we were looking for. We 
were just looking for an easy five." 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Of Barking, who has won three of five starts on the Hollywood Park turf 
course, is the 5-2 second morning-line choice. BOB MIESZERSKI

HOLLYWOOD PARK; HUBBARD SAYS BOYCOTT RUMORS ARE MERE TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After hearing from what he called "several different sources" about rumors of 
a possible boycott of the entry box, Hollywood Park chief operating officer 
R.D. Hubbard held a brief news conference late Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I picked up was the same two or three trainers are advocating a boycott 
here at Hollywood Park," Hubbard said. "We want owners to know the possibility 
that some of their horses might not be entered. The entries haven't been that 
strong to begin with, and any number of horses that don't enter right now hurts 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a half dozen or a dozen trainers who are stabled at Hollywood Park who 
talked to me and told me they were fully supportive of Hollywood Park. No 
trainers stabled here as far as I know are actively involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, any talk of a boycott has to do with the recent passage of AB-991, 
a bill that would split California horsemen into separate groups for owners and 
trainers. The bill passed the Assembly by a large margin on Thursday and is now 
awaiting Gov. Pete Wilson's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The bill) is a devastating blow to everybody," said Bart Heller, a director 
of the California Horsemen's and Benevolent Protective Assn. "It's up to 
(individuals). If they want to enter, they enter. If they don't, they don't. 
(The bill) is a complete division of horsemen's rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Darrell Vienna, a CHBPA director who has been critical of Hollywood 
Park, said the CHBPA has not sanctioned any form of boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know a lot about it," Vienna said. "I would suspect that I 
would have heard more than I've heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Under AB-991, state funding for horsemen's groups will be reduced by 
one-third, with that amount going toward purses. Two-thirds of the remaining 
funds will go to the owners' group and the rest will go to the trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Sweeney, the chief operating officer of the CHBPA, has indicated that 
his group will try to get a new bill through the legislature to eliminate 
AB-991 before it becomes law on Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was no ruling by the Hollywood Park stewards Saturday morning regarding 
the five-day suspension of Kent Desormeaux, meaning he is clear to ride Lakeway 
in the Kentucky Oaks on Friday and Soul Of The Matter in the Kentucky Derby the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
 A court hearing on the matter has been postponed until May 20, steward Pete 
Pedersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuance means that the stewards won't be able to issue the ruling on 
Desormeaux until May 21, the day of the Preakness, meaning the suspension would 
probably begin on May 25. 
</P>
<P>
 It was announced on Friday that the California Horse Racing Board had 
disallowed Desormeaux's appeal of the suspension resulting from his 
disqualification aboard The Wicked North in the Santa Anita Handicap on March 
5. The CHRB also accepted hearing officer Steven Schwartz's recommendation that 
the appeal by The Wicked North's owner, Phil Hersh, be disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike California, Kentucky does not have a designated-race rule that permits 
suspended jockeys to ride in certain graded stakes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Claimed for $32,000 by trainer Mike Orman on Dec. 1, Rabiadella earned nearly 
twice that much Saturday when she won the $105,800 Senorita Breeders' Cup 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Second in the Providencia at Santa Anita in her previous start, the 7-1 shot 
opened up a 12-length lead under Laffit Pincay through a 1:09 4/5 six furlongs, 
then went on to beat 7-1 shot Magical Avie by 2 1/4 lengths in 1:34 4/5 for the 
mile on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the third victory in six starts for the 3-year-old Dynaformer filly 
since she was claimed by Orman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought a colt for (owner) Mr. (Bill) Boswell in Florida by Dynaformer and I 
watched her run in her first start at Del Mar (on Aug. 30) and I liked the 
heart she showed," Orman said. "I thought she was going too fast down the 
backside, but she didn't quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Magical Avie, in her first start on turf, finished four lengths ahead of 3-2 
favorite Fancy 'N Fabulous, whose two-race winning streak ended. She had beaten 
Rabiadella by 3 1/2 lengths in the Providencia, which is run at 1 1/8 miles.

GRIEF REMAINS WHEN ONE PARENT WHISKS YOUNGSTERS OUT OF U.S.; CUSTODY: OFTEN THE 
CHILDREN ARE SNATCHED DURING A BITTER DIVORCE. THE ABDUCTORS USUALLY HAVE 
STRONG TIES IN THE OTHER COUNTRY.

 Lilly Waken's husband and two young daughters left home for a party and never 
came back. Frantically she called police, she called hospitals -- then she 
learned her Arab husband had bought three one-way tickets to Damascus, Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 18 months ago, and Waken hasn't seen her children since. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband returned to Miami once -- without the children -- for a divorce 
hearing. A judge awarded Waken custody of their two girls, but her husband, 
Mohammed, ignored the court order and slipped out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamia has since turned 3; Dalal is 6. Waken wonders where they are, and 
whether they remember her. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart is stolen, my soul is gone," she said from her Miami home, where she 
keeps the girls' room ready for them. "Unless your children were taken, no one 
can know the pain I live with." 
</P>
<P>
 There are others who know. U.S. parents are seeking to bring home more than 
1,000 children taken from this country by a mother or father, according to 
State Department records. And children's advocates believe many more cases go 
unreported. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the children are snatched during a divorce. The abducting parents 
usually have strong ties in the other country. But sometimes an American-born 
mother or father will take off for an unfamiliar nation to flee U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-behind parents suddenly find a maze of foreign laws and customs standing 
between them and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a missing child within the United States is daunting. But finding a 
missing child abroad often seems hopeless -- especially for those like Waken 
who cannot afford specialized attorneys, private detectives and international 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the mothers live a kind of quiet agony if they don't have the money," 
said Shayna Gluck Lazarevich, who has searched Serbia for her two children for 
4 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those with money to spend often find it's not enough. After Lazarevich's 
ex-husband kidnaped their two children from her home in Santa Cruz, Calif., a 
bank seized his $70,000 account and turned it over to her. 
</P>
<P>
 The money paid 10 lawyers, and helped Lazarevich take her custody case all the 
way to Serbia's highest court -- winning at each step. It helped her travel to 
Serbia to search for the children. It took her to Washington to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Secretary of State James A. Baker III championed her cause, and 90 
members of Congress signed a petition for the return of her children. She met 
with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
 But 11-year-old Sasha and 8-year-old Andre are still missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian officials have been unable or unwilling to find the children and turn 
them over to her. The civil war in Bosnia only makes things worse. And her 
money has run out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done everything right and still I don't have my children," Lazarevich, 
32, said during one of many visits to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't sense the agony, the anguish, the desperation that parents 
feel," she said. "That must be understood before we will get any real help." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents searching for their children in other countries get only limited help 
from the U.S. government. A State Department brochure warns them, "You must 
direct the search and recovery operation yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 The department does offer some basic help in finding children. "We will 
attempt as best we can to locate the child and visit them and report on their 
health," said State Department spokeswoman Nyda Budig. 
</P>
<P>
 The department will ask another nation to check travel and school records for 
a missing child's name, for example. But some nations don't keep complete 
records. And some missing children live under false names. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Budig points out, some parents don't even know which nation their 
children are living in. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents complain that consular officials don't do enough to help them. 
Maria Rojas of Centreville, Va., is organizing a march in Washington this 
summer to demand more help for parents searching for internationally abducted 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My children are U.S. citizens, but the people at the State Department don't 
want to be bothered with them," she said. "They just don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a missing child is only the start. 
</P>
<P>
 A parent must then take his or her case to the foreign country's legal system. 
Most nations do not recognize custody orders from U.S. courts. Even when 
criminal charges have been filed against the abducting parent in America, many 
nations will not honor a U.S. request for extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 And some nations may discriminate against women or Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department will give a parent information about a foreign legal 
system, but cannot intercede in court on the parent's behalf, Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most children who are taken abroad are not returned," said Betty Mahmoody, an 
American who escaped with her daughter from an abusive husband in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 She formed an organization to help parents of children kidnaped abroad, called 
One World: For Children. Mahmoody said the group has helped parents of 900 
children taken to "difficult" countries; only 49 were returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time, it's an impossible situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department has logged 5,500 cases of international child abduction 
by parents since it began keeping records in 1978. The number rises each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty percent of the cases are now considered inactive. But it's unclear how 
many of the children have come home. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cases were dropped from the files when the State Department didn't hear 
from the left-behind parent for two years; others were closed when the missing 
child turned 18. Officials are sifting through the files to compile statistics, 
Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's difficult to document, the State Department says the odds of 
bringing a kidnaped child home from abroad are improving. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, President Clinton signed a law making it a federal felony to 
kidnap a child to another country. But it's too early to assess the impact that 
will have, said Howard Davidson, director of the American Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very easy to pass a law to say certain things will become federal crimes 
without providing the resources to investigators and U.S. attorneys and federal 
courts to fulfill the intent of the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoody said, "Every deterrent we have is helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest advance came in 1988, when the United States signed a 
treaty with 30 other nations, agreeing to return kidnaped children to their 
home countries. Courts in the home country then will resolve any remaining 
custody disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hague treaty has been proven successful in returning children to the 
United States from the mostly Western nations that have ratified it. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost half of the 806 abductions reported to the State Department in 1993 
were not covered by the Hague treaty. The Middle Eastern countries of Egypt, 
Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Syria -- among the nations least cooperative 
in returning children to the United States -- have not signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The State Department isn't doing a whole heck of a lot to give the parents in 
non-Hague countries any hope," said Frederick Rooney, a Bethlehem, Pa., 
attorney who does pro bono work for women whose children are in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another treaty in which nations agree to work together on children's 
issues, including international kidnaping. It is the United Nations Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, adopted in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty has been signed or ratified by 170 nations, including some Mideast 
countries such as Syria and Iran. But the United States has yet to sign it, so 
it's of no help to U.S. parents. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has ordered a review of the treaty, to be completed this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the American Bar Assn. has been educating judges and attorneys 
about the risk of child abduction during divorce cases. Often parents' fears 
are dismissed, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazarevich, for example, told the court that her former husband, Dragisa, had 
threatened to take their children to Yugoslavia. But the judge granted him 
unsupervised visits anyway. During one of those weekend visits, he abducted the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's advocates say stricter controls on passports and children's travel 
would make it tougher to sneak a child out of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Waken suspects her girls are now living with their paternal grandparents in 
Saudi Arabia. "I would do anything to get them back," said Waken, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 She pulled out a photograph of her daughters as she last saw them -- the 
curly-haired baby and smiling older sister -- and described the Christmas 
presents she keeps wrapped and ready for their return. 
</P>
<P>
 She was reluctant to put the photograph back in her purse, pausing to kiss 
each face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to hear my daughters' voices at least," she said. "I don't want 
them to forget me."

'LOST' GI GOING HOME AT LAST; KOREAN WAR: ONLY NOW, AFTER WIDOW ENDURES LONG 
UNCERTAINTY, WILL FRANK MORALES BEGIN HIS FINAL JOURNEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE MOKRZYCKI, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Minerva Morales sat in her living room and confided that, in a way, she still 
just didn't believe it. But as she held the metal "dog tags" stamped MORALES F 
M, RA 352345345 and looked at the color photo of his partial denture, she knew 
the evidence was undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Army Sgt. Frank M. Morales, had finally been accounted for, more 
than 43 years after he disappeared in a Korean War battle often compared to 
Custer's Last Stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army's mortuary affairs chief broke the news to Mrs. Morales in this room 
two days earlier: Her husband's remains were the first from the Korean War to 
be positively identified since shortly after the shooting stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales was lost, at age 37, at Unsan, North Korea. It was the first major 
Chinese Communist attack on U.S. forces in the Korean War -- a trap sprung to 
the sound of whistles and bugles and fought with everything from truck-mounted 
rockets to bare fists. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales had been in "the Lost Battalion," abandoned after the enemy surrounded 
it. There had been no evidence he survived. But there was no proof he was dead, 
either -- until North Korea returned his remains in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Morales' 74-year-old widow has other questions. "You don't know how he 
died, how he suffered -- and not only him. All of them." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be impossible to answer. In the rout at Unsan, nobody stopped to 
count the dead or record what happened to whom. And now so much time has 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press tracked down 11 survivors of the battle, but they didn't 
remember Morales, didn't know how he died. Nor did his remains give Army 
pathologists any clue. 
</P>
<P>
 But from survivors' accounts, books, records and interviews with his widow, a 
picture emerges of this soldier's life, death and long-delayed journey home, to 
his homeland, where he will be buried the first of May. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales was born June 10, 1913, in Naguabo, a town on Puerto Rico's east 
coast. He came to New York when he was about 8. He joined the Army at 18 and 
served in France during World War II, his widow said. According to the Army, 
his service records were among those lost in the 1973 fire at the military 
personnel records center in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Discharged after the war, Morales met his wife-to-be -- also Puerto Rican, 
reared in San Juan -- in 1947 through a niece. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played the piano beautifully, accordion, and I think the guitar, too. He 
loved music," Mrs. Morales recalled in an interview in her modest Queens 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months after they met, he proposed. Minerva, with three children by a 
previous marriage, accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales, meanwhile, re-enlisted in the Army. "He could not live without the 
Army," his widow said. 
</P>
<P>
 They were wed on May 15, 1948, she in a simple gown and veil, he in his best 
uniform, with corporal's stripes on the sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days earlier, the first elections had been held in the southern, 
U.S.-supported half of the Korean peninsula. Soviet-backed northern Korea 
boycotted the vote, formalizing the World War II-era split along the 38th 
Parallel. The division set the stage for the Cold War's first military 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales was posted to Ft. McKinley in Maine, then to Ft. Devens in 
Massachusetts. He was there on June 25, 1950, when the North Korean People's 
Army invaded South Korea. The United Nations formed a U.S.-led multinational 
force to repel the aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Troops at Ft. Devens quickly were organized into the 3rd Battalion, 8th 
Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division. They went by train to California and by 
troopship to the port of Pusan in southernmost South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales and his wife, living in New York City, didn't get to see each other to 
say goodby. She remembers that he told her not to worry, that his age and prior 
war service would keep him out of combat. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the 3rd Battalion reached Korea on Aug. 25, 1950, it joined the 8th 
Regiment's other two battalions defending the Pusan Perimeter, the last U.N. 
stronghold in Korea, against furious North Korean attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales' unit took severe losses at the "Bowling Alley," a valley where 
rockets and artillery ricocheted crazily off the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-September, the U.N. forces' commander, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, staged 
his bold counterstroke at Inchon, recapturing the South Korean capital of Seoul 
and trapping North Korean forces to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1st Cavalry broke out of the Pusan Perimeter and raced to Seoul, then 
chased the battered yet still battling enemy back into North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Morales has misplaced, over the years, her husband's letters from the 
front, but she recalls much of their content. "The more we kill," he wrote in 
one letter, "the more we find." He also wrote with pride when the 3rd Battalion 
crossed the 38th Parallel into North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 That happened on Oct. 8, 1950. When it reached the North Korean capital of 
Pyongyang on Oct. 19, the 3rd Battalion had lost 400 of its original 700 men. 
Mrs. Morales remembers her husband complaining that U.S. troops lacked warm 
clothes in what would become Korea's coldest winter in a decade. But they 
shared MacArthur's optimism that the war was nearly won and they would be home 
by Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last letter, "He said, 'Now we're going to Japan, and in Japan I'm 
going to buy you a lot of beautiful things.' He says, 'I'm going to get you a 
kimono.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But as Morales' unit, strengthened with green replacements, waited in reserve 
in Pyongyang (and saw a Bob Hope show) the course of the war was changing. 
China was following through on its threat to intercede on North Korea's behalf 
if U.N. forces crossed the 38th Parallel. 
</P>
<P>
 It did so in the last week of October. More than 150,000 Chinese army troops 
streamed from Manchuria across the Yalu River into North Korea. Setting forest 
fires to avoid air reconnaissance, they marched south and wiped out South 
Korean forces, called ROKs (for Republic of Korea). 
</P>
<P>
 By Oct. 28, U.S. area commander Gen. Walton Walker realized the Chinese were 
trying to set an Inchon-like trap. He ordered the 1st Cav's 8th Regiment to 
Unsan, a town nestled in the mountains 65 miles north of Pyongyang. There, the 
troops dug skimpy, poorly sited lines along the Nammyon River. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have court-martialed whoever sent us up there," said Billy Joe 
Campbell of Amarillo, Tex., then a private in L Company. "You don't set up in a 
valley." 
</P>
<P>
 The night of Nov. 1, 1950, Morales' L Company was dug in just northwest of a 
bridge on a main road from Unsan, waiting as battalion officers prepared, on 
orders, to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 20,000 troops of two Chinese divisions had routed ROK units to 
the east and the Cav's 1st and 2nd battalions to the north. Disabled American 
vehicles blocked the main road south. To the west were mountains -- and more 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3 a.m. on Nov. 2, by most accounts, a column of about 30 men in South 
Korean uniforms reached the Nammyon bridge. "Sixth ROKs," their leader shouted 
cheerfully. M Company sentries allowed them to cross. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharp Swords had infiltrated the 3rd Battalion. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers were Chinese, wearing captured uniforms. The Sharp Swords name 
was for the unit's cloak-and-dagger exploits in the civil war against Chinese 
Nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, under bright moonlight, the Sharp Swords reached the 3rd 
Battalion command post, a roadside dugout. An 18-year-old known as Little Liu 
sounded a bugle as Capt. Lao Kongcheng hurled a satchel charge at a U.S. truck. 
Other bugles answered from across the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then all hell broke loose," recalled former Master Sgt. Troy Reid, in a 
comment echoed by other survivors. Reid, 72, of Fitchburg, Mass., said he knew 
Morales, though not well, and didn't know how he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Truck-mounted "organ-pipe" launchers rained Russian-made 82-millimeter 
Katyusha rockets on the Americans. Then Chinese infantry hit the 3rd Battalion 
from all sides. They carried U.S.-made Thompson submachine guns seized from the 
Nationalists, Japanese rifles from World War II Manchuria and Soviet burp guns. 
Some carried grenades, or pistols, or knives tied to the ends of sticks. Many 
carried no weapons at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one got killed, one of the ones in the back would pick up his weapon and 
start fighting," Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hand-to-hand combat, with whatever you could get hold of," recalled 
squad leader Herbert Miller, now 67, of Pulaski, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 In the darkness, Billy Joe Campbell recalled, "You didn't know if you were 
shooting your own people or the Chinese." But one thing was certain: "There was 
a heck of a lot more of them than us." 
</P>
<P>
 After 90 minutes, the Chinese retreated. Remnants of L and K companies pulled 
back to the command post. If Morales still was alive, he would have been among 
about 200 men able to fight. There had been three or four times as many to 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors dug in around three tanks near the command post and fought off 
new Chinese attacks until daybreak. Then they retrieved 170 wounded. The 
uncounted dead included the 3rd Battalion commander, Maj. Robert J. Ormond. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day on Nov. 2, a sister regiment, the 5th Cavalry, tried to break a 
Chinese roadblock south of Unsan to rescue the 3rd Battalion. But with 
superiors refusing to commit howitzers big enough to reach Chinese positions, 
the 5th Cavalry failed at a ridgeline dubbed Bugle Hill, suffering 350 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the 1st Cavalry commander, Maj. Gen. Hobart Gay, reluctantly ended the 
rescue effort, abandoning the 3rd Battalion's living and dead. 
</P>
<P>
 If Morales still was alive, he would have faced renewed Chinese onslaughts the 
night of Nov. 2, after U.S. planes left the area. The Chinese unleashed heavy 
mortars, then six infantry attacks. Americans set their own vehicles afire with 
bazookas and killed hundreds of Chinese silhouetted in the light. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, untroubled by air attacks, the Chinese kept the Americans pinned 
down all day and staged several more raids that night. 
</P>
<P>
 By dawn Nov. 4, American survivors decided to try a breakout. "We literally 
crawled over Chinese bodies, a carpet of them, for almost 100 yards," recalled 
Walter Mayo of McLean, Va., a retired colonel who was then a first lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys got killed coming out of the perimeter," said Robert McGreevey 
of Cumberland, Md. "There were guys falling everywhere. We were zigzagging 
every which way. It was utter chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 Some managed to escape through an open field, but two days later, many of 
these were killed, wounded or, like Mayo and McGreevey, captured by Chinese 
troops about 10 miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales probably never got that far, judging from where his remains were found 
years later. There's also no indication he was taken prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1st Cavalry history says 1,481 of its soldiers were killed, wounded or 
missing at Unsan. The 8th Regiment lost more than 1,000, mostly in the 3rd 
Battalion, said historian Edward Drea of the Army's Center for Military History 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York City, Minerva Morales got no more letters -- only a Pentagon 
telegram regretfully informing her that Frank M. Morales was missing in action 
in Unsan, North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese drove the U.N. forces back across the 38th Parallel. After 2 1/2 
years of stalemate, a truce was signed; the war never officially ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides repatriated prisoners and remains. North Korea returned more than 
1,900 sets of remains through 1954. Morales' wasn't among them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 31, 1953, Morales -- promoted posthumously from corporal to sergeant 
-- was officially declared dead, one of 33,629 Americans to die in combat in 
the Korean War. He was awarded a Purple Heart, sent to his widow. "For military 
merit," it says. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1990, lacking diplomatic relations but troubled by economic problems, 
Pyongyang made an overture to the United States. It returned five sets of what 
it said were U.S. soldiers' remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight more times, the Koreans would return remains to U.S. officials at 
Panmunjom, the strange little village in the demilitarized zone between the 
Koreas. In all, 194 sets of remains have been returned, though none since last 
Dec. 21, as tensions escalate over allegations that Pyongyang is developing 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 30, 1993, North Korea handed over 33 sets of remains, including what 
turned out to be Morales'. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they called me on the phone and said, 'I've got news about your husband' 
-- oh, my God, I thought they were joking," Mrs. Morales said. "Now everything 
has come back again. It's very, very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Tears welled in her eyes. "Forty years, and now -- it's such a shock."

BOUNTY KIN SEEK TO KEEP SELF RULE; SOUTH PACIFIC: THE PEOPLE OF NORFOLK ISLAND 
SAY AUSTRALIA IS REQUIRING THEM TO OBEY MORE AND MORE FEDERAL LAWS. TO FIGHT 
BACK, THEY'VE PETITIONED THE U.N. FOR THE RIGHT TO GOVERN THEMSELVES. 
</P>

<P>
 Discontent is stirring among the Norfolkers, descendants of convicts and HMS 
Bounty mutineers who only reluctantly tolerate Australian rule over their 
isolated speck of land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Norfolk Island . . . have never been accorded the right of 
referendum to decide their destiny," Norfolk legislator Ric Robinson wrote in a 
26-page letter to the U.N. secretary-general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and other islanders fear Australia is trying to erode Norfolk's home 
rule by requiring it to obey more and more federal laws. They want a 
U.N.-supervised vote to verify their status. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the 1,700 Norfolkers seem to want either complete independence or 
incorporation with Australia. If there is consensus, it is for self-government, 
with Australia handling defense and foreign relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The very idea of discontent seems absurd on a 5-by-3-mile dab of paradise 930 
miles east of Australia, blessed with sparkling beaches, a mild climate, 
imposing cliffs and the famous, towering Norfolk Pines. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism has brought general prosperity. Life is simple and crime virtually 
unknown. Cows have the right of way over cars on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 But the island's history is written in rebellion and blood. 
</P>
<P>
 England turned Norfolk into a branch of its Australian penal-colony 
experiment, sending prisoners here from 1788 to 1814, but then evacuating it 
because the colony was too costly and remote. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1825, Norfolk Island was revived as a punishment station, the end of the 
line for up to 2,000 incorrigible felons and Irish rebels whose spirits were 
broken with floggings, hard labor and prolonged isolation in silent, 
blacked-out cells. 
</P>
<P>
 "My object was to hold out that settlement as a place of the extremest 
punishment, short of death," Gov. Ralph Darling of New South Wales proclaimed 
in 1827. 
</P>
<P>
 He succeeded brilliantly. After a prison rebellion failed in 1834, a priest 
sent to comfort the convicts reported: "Those who were to live wept bitterly, 
whilst those doomed to die without exception dropped on their knees, and with 
dry eyes, thanked God that they were to be delivered from such a place." 
</P>
<P>
 Norfolk's notoriety contributed to revulsion in England about the practice of 
sending prisoners to Australia, and the punishment station was shut down in 
1854. Now, the ruins of the prison settlement are a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1856, British authorities transferred 194 Pitcairn Island families, most of 
them descendants of Bounty mutineers, to Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen Victoria declared the island a "separate and distinct settlement" that 
year and Norfolkers governed themselves until 1896, when New South Wales took 
control. Australia's federal government now has the last word on Norfolk 
affairs, but the island has its own Legislature and courts. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 of today's 1,700 islanders are descended from Fletcher 
Christian's Bounty mutineers and the Tahitian wives they took. Pitcairn names 
still dominate the local telephone book: 40 Christians, 28 Quintals, 17 named 
Adams, eight McCoys, seven Smiths. 
</P>
<P>
 Norfolk Island was uninhabited when Capt. James Cook discovered it in 1774, so 
the current Norfolkers proudly claim to be the indigenous people. They speak 
English in public, but among themselves use "Norfolk," a blend of old English 
and Polynesian words found only on Norfolk and Pitcairn. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said Boutros-Ghali had not replied to his letter, but "I did get a 
nice reply from the U.N. Working Group on Indigenous Peoples inviting me to a 
conference in Geneva at the end of July." 
</P>
<P>
 Norfolkers pay no taxes to Australia and get no general revenues from it. They 
raise most of the island's annual budget, equivalent to about $5 million, 
through local taxes, predominantly on activities connected to tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Norfolkers have argued for a return of complete self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a people has had self-government, they never forget that they did and 
the urge is to have it back again," said novelist Colleen McCullough, 
Robinson's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 A report in 1978 by the private U.N. Assn. of Australia said it was "a tribute 
to, among other things, the islanders' general temperament of civilized 
tolerance and introspective humility, nurtured by their isolation, that they 
have endured this state of affairs so quietly." 
</P>
<P>
 In a non-binding referendum three years ago, 82% of Norfolk voters rejected 
union with Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who as deputy president of the Legislative Assembly also serves as 
minister of commerce and the environment, supports home rule in all domestic 
matters. He suspects Australia wants to incorporate Norfolk into the federal 
system in order to assure access to natural gas deposits discovered in 1975 
about 190 miles south of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 David Buffett, president of the Legislative Assembly, and John Brown, the 
leader of government, share Robinson's views on home rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they stuck to the original idea, that would be fine: all the powers except 
for foreign affairs, defense and perhaps coinage," Robinson said. "That would 
suit us down to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he said, Australia "would be a friend and ally instead of this colonial 
overlord bashing us about the ears when we don't do things that satisfy them."

MUTINEERS' DESCENDANTS PREFER BRITISH CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the sun finally sets on the British Empire, the last rays may touch 
Pitcairn Island, the tiny island where a few dozen descendants of the HMS 
Bounty mutineers still live. 
</P>
<P>
 They are happy, comfortable and content with British administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain "tends to be looking after us quite well," Jay Warren said in an 
interview conducted via the island's only telephone over several thousand miles 
of ocean. Warren, the local "magistrate," serves as mayor and local 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no such amiability when Fletcher Christian led a mutiny against 
Capt. William Bligh in 1789. But then, it's been 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the island currently number 40 descendants of the mutineers, plus 
an imported schoolteacher and a Seventh-day Adventist minister with a wife and 
two children. A few Pitcairners are away for medical treatment or higher 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren said life on the island is "beautiful" and everyone plans to stay 
forever, so they may outlast the Falkland Islands as Britain's last colonial 
outpost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be leaving, I don't think," was how he put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Garth Harraway in Auckland, New Zealand, British commissioner for Pitcairn, 
said the island's "infrastructure has been improved in recent years, making 
their lives easier and chores more manageable." 
</P>
<P>
 On Pitcairn, 14 or 15 able-bodied men do the heavy work, principally loading 
the 30 to 60 tons of supplies that arrive by freighter two or three times a 
year into longboats that carry the goods to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Reefs surrounding the island often damaged wooden longboats, putting them out 
of commission for fishing or other chores, so Britain has provided two 40-foot 
aluminum boats. It also gave the island better electricity generators and the 
satellite telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone is so expensive that the islanders save it for emergencies or 
special occasions, using ham radios to chat with faraway relatives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone not on the island is far away indeed. Pitcairn, only two miles long and 
one mile wide, is in the middle of the South Pacific, about 5,100 miles east of 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Its isolation was the reason for its settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 After Christian and his mutineers set Bligh adrift in the Bounty's launch with 
18 other officers and crewmen, they sailed back to Tahiti and embarked again 
with nine mutineers, six Polynesian men, 12 Polynesian women and a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian headed for Pitcairn, discovered in 1767 by Capt. Philip Carteret. 
Carteret had mischarted the island by 177 miles, so it was years before any 
ship other than the Bounty found it. 
</P>
<P>
 Madness and murder quickly wiped out nearly all the mutineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Polynesian men rebelled when a mutineer tried to take one of their wives. 
Christian, four other mutineers and all the Polynesian men were killed in the 
battles that followed. Another mutineer, William McCoy, leaped off a cliff to 
his death while drunk on home-brewed liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 After Matthew Quintal's wife died, he went mad and threatened to kill the 
remaining mutineers, Edward Young and John Adams. They killed him with an ax 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 Young died of asthma in 1800 and Adams became the communal husband of the nine 
remaining Polynesian women, bringing up the mutineers' 19 children by strict 
moral rules. 
</P>
<P>
 When two British warships arrived in 1814, they found a community so peaceful 
and respectable that they did not interfere or arrest Adams, who died in 1829. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's Pitcairners spend much of their time fishing, cultivating their 
gardens and carving wooden curios to sell to passing ships. The island also 
makes money from postage stamps and from the interest on investments worth 
about $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the interview, Warren said his work was waiting.

CALAMITY OF EXERCISE TIGER OVERSHADOWED BY D-DAY; WORLD WAR II: IT BEGAN AS A 
DRESS REHEARSAL AND ENDED IN TRAGEDY AS GERMAN TORPEDO BOATS STUMBLED ONTO 
EIGHT LANDING SHIPS. TWO WERE SUNK, A THIRD WAS DAMAGED, 749 U.S. SOLDIERS AND 
SAILORS WERE KILLED. 
</P>

<P>
 Exercise Tiger began innocuously as a dress rehearsal for D-Day; it ended in 
cataclysm, with 749 U.S. soldiers and sailors dead in the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next day -- and for the many days after that -- no word of the 
disaster appeared in American newspapers. It had to be hushed up, lest the 
Germans know the Normandy invasion was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, the April 28, 1944, catastrophe is still shrouded in 
D-Day's shadows, much to the anguish of the men who survived it and the 
families of those who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should know the story. These men should be recognized," said Evelyn 
Brannock of Perry, Kan., whose brother, James Oliver Cottrell, was among the 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anything about it in the history books. Nothing. Zero. It's kind 
of sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise Tiger was the U.S. 4th Infantry Division's final tuneup for D-Day, 
which took place in June. Tiger involved 3,000 ships and 30,000 men outfitted 
in full battle dress. 
</P>
<P>
 The men and ships sailed into the channel to practice a landing at Slapton 
Sands. But the drill became a death trap when a pack of nine German torpedo 
boats operating from France stumbled onto the eight LSTs (landing ship, tanks) 
of Convoy T-4 shortly after 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The German speedboats, traveling at 40 m.p.h., darted around the lumbering 
LSTs, chugging along at 5 m.p.h. Two LSTs were sunk and a third was damaged in 
30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 On LST 507, Navy medical officer Eugene Eckstam heard a deafening explosion 
and rushed to help trapped men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got thrown back by the roar of the fire. I could hear guys screaming and 
hollering. I can still hear them," said Eckstam of Monroe, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 LST 531, hit next, went under in seven minutes, losing 424 of the 496 men on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bang! There was an explosion. Just a big ball of fire," said John Perry, of 
Johnstown, Pa. "The Germans just picked us off. We were sitting ducks. We never 
knew what hit us." 
</P>
<P>
 LST 289 was also torpedoed. The final toll -- 551 soldiers and 198 sailors 
dead, and 89 participants wounded -- made Exercise Tiger the war's most deadly 
U.S. training exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Allied lapses worsened the tragedy, according to investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The convoy was guarded by only one British ship. Additionally, because of a 
typographical error on operational orders, the American ships were tuned to the 
wrong radio frequency, so British warnings of German boats never reached them. 
</P>
<P>
 And GIs improperly buckled their flotation belts around their waists rather 
than up under their shoulders. Top-heavy with field packs, rifles, ammunition 
and steel helmets when they splashed into the 42-degree waters, many were found 
floating feet up. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who handled the corpses was Emmett Bailey, a member of a graves 
registration unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't shed a tear at the time because it was my job. Now I can hardly keep 
my eyes dry when I think about it," said Bailey, of Henderson, N.C. "Things 
like that stick with you." 
</P>
<P>
 British newspapers published brief stories repeating German radio reports 
about some shipping being lost. The first official mention came at an Aug. 5 
briefing when Exercise Tiger's casualties were included in post D-Day reports. 
</P>
<P>
 One final casualty came that same day. Rear Admiral Don P. Moon, in charge of 
the American part of the exercise, killed himself on his new assignment in the 
Mediterranean, due at least in part to admonishment from his superiors for the 
losses at Slapton Sands. 
</P>
<P>
 Years after the war, accounts of Exercise Tiger appeared in some military 
history books, but the Pentagon did not declassify its records until 1974. Ten 
more years passed before the secrets of Exercise Tiger were published, when Dr. 
Ralph Greene of Chicago, a medical officer who treated some of the survivors, 
wrote about it in American Heritage magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, a granite memorial placed near a Sherman tank recovered from the 
channel was dedicated at Slapton Sands. Two years later, VFW Post 1531 of New 
Bedford, Mass., dedicated a monument there that includes a Sherman tank and a 
cobblestone for each casualty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some type of acknowledgment should be made of their service and the lives 
they gave for their country," said Ed Gilchrest, president of the Exercise 
Tiger Memorial Assn. in New Bedford. "These were the forgotten dead."

 Almost 23 million Americans live in places that don't meet federal standards

 Those people -- 9.1% of the population in 16 counties across the country,

NEWS ANALYSIS; WASHINGTON'S EXPERTS SEEM POWERLESS TO AID OWN CITY; GOVERNMENT: 
THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO HELP FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, A 
LONGTIME RESIDENT SAYS. NOR ARE THEY ASKED TO HELP STEM THE POVERTY AND CRIME 
THAT SURROUNDS THEM.

<P>
 Washington, awash with problem-solvers, is a city awash with problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington sends experts to Warsaw to prop up the zloty and to Tirane to teach 
democracy to Albanians. It swarms with criminologists, city planners, lawyers, 
lobbyists, journalists, medical researchers, educators, executives, 
administrators, consultants, "facilitators." 
</P>
<P>
 It is home to government and monuments and seven full-blown universities, 
including one that graduated the occupant of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Washington that's community to 607,000 people is in trouble, and all 
that talent here isn't helping. Nor is it asked to help. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a bit strange. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Washington is in trouble the way many of the country's big cities 
are in trouble -- the middle class is fleeing, leaving behind a city of the 
comfortably rich and the more numerous, uncomfortably poor. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is in trouble in ways particular to this city. Washington has only 
quasi self-government. It has an overseer. Congress can veto any law the City 
Council passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the real estate is exempt from property taxes. On top of that, the city 
is barred from taxing commuters -- people who live in Maryland or Virginia, but 
work here and benefit from city services. City officials tend to blame some of 
their troubles on that. 
</P>
<P>
 Those troubles are legion. No place in America comes close to equaling 
Washington's murder rate. The city averages better than one killing a day. 
</P>
<P>
 In virtually every other category used as a warning flare -- infant deaths, 
drug use, high school dropouts -- Washington is among the leaders. The 
Washington Post says 42% of the city's black male population is in prison or 
jail, on probation or parole or being sought on an arrest warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the city is broke and may have to turn to the federal 
Establishment for a bailout that would not come without a further loss of 
independence and self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton is simpatico to the city. He has made himself a Washingtonian. He 
jogs the city's streets and visits its restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, at wit's end about crime, asked him for 
permission to call out the National Guard, Clinton gave her a sympathetic 
listening and a gentle turndown. He had no real choice. Any other answer would 
have made Washington seem as lawless as Mogadishu and would have embarrassed 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, graduate of Georgetown University, is like so many other important 
people who come to town with a new Administration: fairly inactive about the 
city's down-home problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cleveland or Louisville, the community's leaders -- its businessmen and 
other solid citizens -- get involved when their community is in trouble. Not 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the child health expert who lives down the street knows more about 
infant mortality on Indian reservations than in Anacostia, an especially poor 
and isolated Washington neighborhood. The international economist who works 
downtown for the World Bank knows more about the deficit in Belarus than in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is that residency in Washington is often temporary duty. 
After a tour here, many will go home. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a racial element too. Washington is a proud predominantly black city, 
with a strong black middle class, a black history and a black culture. Almost 
all its city officials are black. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers -- the government people -- are predominantly white. They may 
think it would seem patronizing to offer Washington their advice and attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, to a prosperous person living in a prosperous neighborhood, 
Washington's problems are easy to ignore. Not only is there a disconnect 
between the city and some of its brainiest residents, there is a divide between 
prosperous (and mostly, but not entirely, white) Washington and the rest of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a beautiful city, especially in spring, a flowering, blooming place. For 
the comfortable, it can be a most comfortable place. One can even park without 
much trouble. The Saturday morning sound is not the rat-tat-tat of an automatic 
gun; it is the World Bank economist, mowing his lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Washington has desperate problems. That is this city's dirty little 
secret -- secret even from some of its most powerful residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Feinsilber, a resident for 26 years, reports on events in Washington for 
the Associated Press.

NORTH CAROLINA BLACKS PRAY FOR END TO CRIME; VIOLENCE: OF THOSE CHARGED IN

 Slightly stooped and dressed all in black, Eddie Byers is out of step with the 
sharply tailored men and women who have tumbled out of their office buildings 
for a sunny lunchtime stroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The stunning arrest of Henry Louis Wallace, a suspect in the serial murders of 
at least 10 young women, already has begun to fade as this city on the verge of 
radiant spring resumes its gentler rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Byers, though, stands very still. Here, smack in the middle of town, he is 
eventually joined by a few other regulars, and together they join hands in a 
brief, quiet vigil against black-on-black crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The brutal truth is that Henry Louis Wallace is only one black man, and the 
young black women he is accused of strangling here are merely additions to an 
already lopsided set of grim statistics mirrored nationwide. Of a record 122 
homicide victims in Charlotte last year, 94 were black. Of those charged with 
violent crimes over roughly the same period, about 70% were black. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take a person like Mr. Wallace and, well, there's so much killing, so 
much crack cocaine going on, he's just another grain of sand on the beach," 
said Byers, who describes himself as being "from the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, every day at noon, they come to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Conrad Pridgeon, pastor at the Greater Bethel AME Church, is absent 
this day. But Robert Walton, a county commissioner, is present. So is Michael 
Justice, a young waiter committed to change. Sometimes, only one or two people 
show up. Sometimes, there are more. 
</P>
<P>
 But never enough, these men say. "It will take so many more to repair what's 
wrong," Walton explained before bowing to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lord, we need healing in this here land," he intoned as people streamed by in 
twos and threes, black and white, snatches of their conversations carried by 
the midday breeze. No one stopped to ask about their prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one ever does," Justice said. "Until something happens, like a Henry 
Wallace. That's when people have questions. After the fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone wants to understand what might have driven Wallace, how he could have 
slipped so repeatedly through the justice system's cracks. Might things have 
been different if he'd gotten help? Did the police and media pay enough 
attention when the bodies of young black women began turning up? 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone wants to know, it seems, for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then it's back to business as usual," Justice said, "people out here dying 
all the time. And no one getting to the issues. Henry Wallace isn't the issue. 
He's just easy to identify." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of life has been called epidemic. President Clinton has prevailed on 
black leaders to take back their streets; the Rev. Jesse Jackson has launched a 
similar crusade, despairing at the relief he's come to feel when the footsteps 
behind him on a city street belong to someone white. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real point is that black people not just here but in communities all over 
the country are dying, in all kinds of ways, every day," said Sandifer 
McCullough, finishing up a fast-food breakfast at the Bojangles where four of 
the strangled women worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reality is that I'm considered an old man in my community because I'm 
nearly 30 and I'm not rotting in jail and don't have a bullet through my head," 
said McCullough, who counsels juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reality is that sometimes I might just be walking to a Bible study class, 
and the police will stop me because I'm a black man. . . . My reality is that 
they don't show guys like me in the news. They show our young men wearing hoods 
and handcuffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Violence is pervasive, and the sense of it has pushed crime to the top of 
white agendas. But clearly the danger is skewed: Blacks, who make up about 12% 
of the population, were the victims in 50 of every 100 homicides committed 
nationwide in 1992, according to federal statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 In this context, the accusations against Henry Louis Wallace are nearly 
dwarfed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to think about, but we as citizens need to think about it that way 
if we're ever really going to do anything about it," said Harper Wilson, a 
special agent with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 But the daily death toll mostly goes on in silence, newsworthy not so much for 
its extraordinary upward spiral as for the chilling ordinariness of it all. 
Disproportionate arrest and murder rates, unemployment, drug abuse, poverty and 
racism are complex and difficult to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the media focus on the exceptions, the glamorous, the macabre, the 
bizarre, the unique," said Dr. Carl Bell, a Chicago psychiatrist known for his 
work on race issues. "It's simple-minded, stereotypical, misleading, distorted 
and . . . certainly isn't helpful."

LANDOWNERS SAY THEY, AND NOT BIRDS, ARE ENDANGERED; CONSERVATION: FEDERAL LAW 
AIMS TO PRESERVE SURVIVING WOODPECKERS, AMONG OTHERS. BUT CRITICS SAY THAT CAN 
PENALIZE PEOPLE WHO PRESERVE THE BIRDS' HABITAT. 
</P>

<P>
 Ben Cone wanted to create some good bird habitat on his property near the 
North Carolina coast. It wound up costing him more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The quail loved it when he burned and cleared underbrush on his property. So 
did the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 1,600 acres of prime 60- to 70-year-old forest are home to the 7-inch 
black-and-white bird with a white splotch on its cheek. The federal Endangered 
Species Act won't allow Cone to cut the timber or do anything else to damage 
the bird's habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "For doing what (environmentalists) want, I get a damaging economic hit," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also has frustrated wildlife officials. It protects existing 
woodpeckers, but doesn't encourage landowners to help the bird population grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone, for instance, plans to cut some timberland not yet inhabited by the 
woodpeckers. "I can't afford to let them take over the whole place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woodpecker was placed on the endangered list in 1970. But, in the last 
decade, its population on privately owned land has declined more than 45%. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely the birds are going elsewhere. Woodpecker groups of one to seven 
birds need about 100 acres to survive. They don't migrate; if left with a 
sliver of forest, they eventually die out. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Carolina, wildlife officials estimate there are 896 of the endangered 
birds, with 400 on private land and the rest on state or federally owned 
property. That's the highest concentration on private land in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Northwest, where logging restrictions to save the northern spotted 
owl have been placed mostly on government-owned land, restrictions to save the 
woodpecker in the Southeast fall heavily on private property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start to interfere with people's private property rights, they're 
gonna howl," said Dwight Stewart, a private forester. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry C. Bynum worries about property his family has owned for more than 40 
years. A private forestry company discovered red-cockaded woodpeckers on the 
land in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his family doesn't depend on timber harvest income, Bynum sees the 
1,600 acres as a sort of savings account. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been passed down, and it's been cut and reforested. I hoped someday to 
pass it to my children. But it looks like I'll be passing it to the 
woodpeckers," Bynum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart and two partners owned land that was under restrictions because 
woodpeckers on neighboring U.S. Forest Service property foraged there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Forest Service bought the property, but Stewart said he and his partners 
lost money on 10,000 acres of timber they couldn't harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to have to be some compromises," Stewart said. "If we don't, 
people are not going to manage for the red-cockaded woodpecker." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists stress that the bird is an important piece of a bigger 
ecological puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you remove one (species), you don't know what the consequence for the 
others will be," said Michael Bean of the Environmental Defense Fund. "Our own 
welfare depends in the long run on maintaining biological diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 But if it's that important, a landowner shouldn't have to absorb all the cost, 
said Joe Young, chairman of the South Carolina Forestry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "If what he's losing is for the good of the many, then the many should pay for 
it," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saving timber to protect a single woodpecker group can cost a landowner about 
$100,000, said Al Epps, a private forester. 
</P>
<P>
 Endangerment of the northern spotted owl and the woodpecker shows that a 
unique ecosystem, the old-growth forest, is disappearing, Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1800s, the United States had 92 million acres of longleaf pine, the 
woodpecker's home of choice. Now there are 1.8 million acres, according to 
Ralph Costa, woodpecker recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service in Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
 Where once there were as many as 400,000 woodpecker groups, now there are 
about 4,000, Costa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic forces arrayed against saving the small bird can be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 Timber is one of the region's largest industries. In South Carolina, for 
instance, the $5 billion-a-year industry is the state's third largest behind 
chemicals and textiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some government officials are searching for a compromise between environmental 
goals and landowners' and business concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia officials agreed in September to look at ways landowners with 1,000 
acres or less could harvest timber while also helping the woodpeckers. South 
Carolina officials are discussing similar options. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb Smathers, a wildlife economist at Clemson University, proposes giving 
landowners economic credits for having birds reproduce on their property. The 
more juvenile birds produced, the more credits earned. Young birds eventually 
could be moved to a public forest set up as a recovery site, and the privately 
owned timber could be harvested. 
</P>
<P>
 The woodpecker credits, like credits given to businesses for reducing air 
pollution, could be bought and sold, Smathers said.

DISABLED CHILD'S SCHOOL EXPERIENCE DOESN'T MAKE GRADE, PARENTS SAY; NEW YORK: 
ALBA ENTERED REGULAR CLASSROOM AFTER HER TWIN SISTER PLEADED HER CASE WITH 
PRESIDENT CLINTON. BUT NOW FAMILY ACCUSES DISTRICT OF DUMPING HER IN THE 
MAINSTREAM WITHOUT SPECIAL HELP. 
</P>

<P>
 It was a touching moment -- Anastasia Somoza, looking up from her wheelchair 
at the White House to plead that her more severely disabled twin, Alba, be 
allowed to attend regular school. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's eyes filled with tears. And her wish, expressed at a town 
meeting last year, was soon granted. 
</P>
<P>
 But this fairy tale and its 10-year-old heroines have not found a happy 
ending. Alba's parents contend she was "dumped" into the regular classroom 
without the help she needs to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Mary Somoza, promotes a concept called "inclusion": allowing 
children, whatever the nature of their handicap, to spend their entire day in a 
regular classroom, with special services brought to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The family contends that the city's Board of Education has violated Alba's 
civil rights. Somoza attorney Salem Katsh says the law requires "every effort" 
to include disabled children in regular classrooms, with whatever special help 
they might need. 
</P>
<P>
 Katsh said the Somozas are "asking for compensatory services: special 
tutoring, special training for communications, an outside consultant to monitor 
the board's compliance with relief. We are asking for a motorized wheelchair . 
. . to prevent fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
 "For too long, these children were shunted aside," agreed Larry Becker, 
attorney for the city Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 But he argues that inclusion is "a theory, not a legal mandate. Federal law 
says handicapped children should be educated in "the least restrictive 
environment" -- and "least restrictive," Becker says, should not always mean 
"regular classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education is holding hearings on the case; no ruling is expected 
until later this month, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Somozas contend that the schools continue to fail their 
daughter, as they have failed her since she was five years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The Somoza girls are great-granddaughters of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio 
Somoza, who was assassinated in 1956. One of his sons, Anastasio, the girls' 
great-uncle, was overthrown by the Sandinistas in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Anastasia and Alba have cerebral palsy. Anastasia, who has a milder form of 
the disease, speaks clearly -- at times eloquently -- and has attended regular 
classes from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Alba, a quadriplegic, cannot speak but communicates with nods, moans, and 
glances toward symbols on a "communication board." Experts say both sisters 
have above-average IQs. 
</P>
<P>
 Luanna Meyer, a special education expert from Syracuse University who 
testified for the family at the hearing, said that Alba "understands virtually 
everything said to her in English and Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 "She laughs at a joke, frowns or nods her head appropriately," said Meyer. 
Despite her physical limitations, Alba "is a very bright little girl. . . . 
With today's technology, she could become a rocket scientist." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Somoza said Alba functioned at normal grade level after preschool. But 
"when she started public school, year after year she regressed." 
</P>
<P>
 She was placed in a special education class with one teacher and 15 students 
who included the learning disabled, the emotionally disturbed and those with 
speech or physical impairments. 
</P>
<P>
 Her individual education plan, said Mary Somoza, was poorly coordinated and 
"inadequately written." 
</P>
<P>
 During the years she was "in segregated classrooms, she didn't receive any 
education," Katsh contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, four months after Anastasia's chat with the President, the school 
system decided to allow Alba into a regular fourth-grade class at Public School 
234 in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 The family says the school system merely responded to the publicity with 
"window dressing" -- "dumping" Alba into the classroom without necessary 
support services. 
</P>
<P>
 Does she like her new class? Alba answered yes "with a smiling face," said 
Anastasia, who often acts as her sister's interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Socially, of course, she's better off," said Mary Somoza. But "academically, 
it's the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Somoza estimates that, despite her intelligence, Alba is doing schoolwork 
at only the first- or second-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Meyer: "There seems to have been a judgment that she wasn't able to learn 
certain things, such as literacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the Board of Education's lawyer disagrees with any 
suggestion that the schools are at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's dumping when you plan for the child's enrollment, plan 
for a special teacher, for integrated therapy in the classroom, for 
communication devices and a communication specialist," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a special education teacher works with both Alba and her classroom 
teacher. The curriculum has been adapted for Alba. An aide helps her with 
health needs. And an occupational therapist, physical therapist and 
communication specialist are at her service. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker said the board is fulfilling its legal requirements toward Alba. He 
doesn't fault her parents for going to bat for her, but contends, "To do more 
might be detrimental to the rest of the children in the class." 
</P>
<P>
 "The school, overall, is excellent with a very warm and sensitive and caring 
staff," said Becker. "They've really done a tremendous effort to provide Alba 
with an appropriate setting." 
</P>
<P>
 But not enough, says Alba's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be curriculum planning, team efforts. . . . There has to be 
staff development," said Mary Somoza. "We're not saying the teachers are bad. 
They just don't know because they haven't been trained."

RETARDATION NO LONGER BAR TO COMFORTABLE RETIREMENT; AGING: BETTER MEDICAL 
TREATMENT AND SOCIAL SERVICES HAVE KEPT THEM ALIVE LONGER THAN PEOPLE WITH 
SIMILAR PROBLEMS YEARS AGO. SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES OFFER BENEFITS.

 At 59, Carl Nelson is relishing his golden years. The days of washing dishes 
or building wooden pallets are long over. 
</P>
<P>
 Slippers cover his feet. "The Price is Right" is on the television. Two 
bowling trophies sit proudly on his night stand. And four pals are right down 
the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm home all the time. I watch TV and sleep a lot," boasted Nelson, nestled 
into a flowered sofa as Bob Barker barks in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, he probably would have been dead or locked away in an 
institution by now. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson and his four retired house mates are among a growing population of 
elderly people who are mentally retarded. Improved medical treatment and better 
social services programs have kept them alive longer than people with similar 
disabilities years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of structured mainstreaming -- such as washing dishes in a 
Salvation Army kitchen or building wooden pallets in a workshop -- Nelson and 
others said, enough. 
</P>
<P>
 They told the agencies charged with their care that they noticed their own 
aging, were worried it would affect their everyday lives and expressed 
frustration over not being able to keep up with younger workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies responded by placing elderly people with developmental 
disabilities in single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a trend across the country, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clients have been saying as they get older, 'I'm tired of doing this. I am 
ready to kick back and relax,' " said Joni Fritz, executive director of the 
Annandale, Va.-based American Network of Community Options and Resources. Her 
group represents 550 private providers of services for people with 
developmental disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really how these programs have grown," Fritz said. "People with mental 
retardation are expressing themselves, and providers are listening." 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstreaming remains, but the structured days are over. Nelson and 
friends now do whatever they want. 
</P>
<P>
 There's tiny Murray Shieff, 68, who eats spinach with dinner every night. 
There's 56-year-old John Rieggle, who hangs out during the day at a nursing 
home up the street. And there's Anthony and Herbert Schatzel, ages 67 and 71, 
two brothers who favor a senior citizens center and plan an occasional game of 
bingo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all has to do with choice, giving these folks a choice," said Patti 
Marino, spokeswoman for the Assn. for Retarded Citizens of Allegheny County, a 
Pittsburgh-based provider that just purchased its second home exclusively for 
elderly clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson lives in the agency's first home, which opened in November, 1992, in 
McCandless Township, about 8 miles north of the city. The home offers four 
televisions, a two-car garage, a game room and a back-yard rock garden. 
</P>
<P>
 ARC-Allegheny counselors staff the home but care for the people only as 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can still do their laundry, they do it," said Chris Schopf, who 
developed the elderly accommodations program for ARC-Allegheny. "As much as 
they can do, they do for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson used to work five days a week and lived in an ARC-sponsored apartment. 
He was presented with the retirement option after complaining about his noisy 
building and hectic pace. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, people with developmental disabilities were institutionalized, 
which experts say limited their personal advancement and the medical care they 
received. But in the late 1960s and early '70s, the concept of working them 
into society -- mainstreaming -- became the norm, resulting in today's elderly 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty to 30 years ago, it was common for a physician to recommend 
institutionalization," said Dr. William Cohen, a developmental pediatrician at 
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closing of institutions and the fact that people were being raised at 
home showed they have value, they have rights, they can learn, and people began 
paying much more attention to their health needs," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors also learned what problems to expect. In cases of Down's syndrome, for 
instance, heart problems that can lead to early death can be remedied by 
surgery six months after birth. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1955, less than 50% of infants born with Down's syndrome survived the first 
year and only 40% were still alive by age 5. In contrast, by 1989 more than 80% 
of children with Down's syndrome were still alive by age 5, according to a 
study conducted by Canadian researchers Adele D. Sadovnick and Patricia A. 
Baird. 
</P>
<P>
 The precise size of the population of elderly people with mental retardation 
is not known because statistics have not been kept. But Matthew Janicki, who 
directs aging services for New York's mental retardation and developmental 
disabilities office, estimated that for every 1,000 people 60 and older, four 
of them are developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The number could double by the turn of the century, Janicki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since clients are living longer, the agencies look for homes that are 
environmentally friendly to the elderly. For example, ranch-style homes on flat 
property are preferred to homes with steep landscaping or many steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a house is chosen, agencies often face the same problem ARC-Allegheny has 
encountered in Hampton Township with its second home -- reluctant neighbors who 
argue that a group home will lead to lower property values and increased 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents have enjoyed little success in court when confronted with a 
federal housing law prohibiting discrimination against the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The home where Carl Nelson lives previously was owned by a man whose wife used 
a wheelchair. When purchased, it had ramps and an oversize shower. The laundry 
room is on the same floor as the bedrooms, living room and kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital and shopping mall are within a five-minute drive. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, there is nothing that sets the house apart from any of the 
other homes in the middle-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us would object to living there," said Dennis Ceccarelli, 
ARC-Allegheny's facilities manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," he said.

SOCIAL SECURITY PAID BONUSES TO WORKERS; GOVERNMENT: AGENCY SPENT $32 MILLION 
ON THE SPECIAL PAYMENTS AS IT PRESSED CONGRESS FOR MILLIONS TO COVER SHORTAGE 
IN ITS DISABILITY PROGRAMS.

<P>
 The Social Security Administration spent $32 million on employee bonuses last 
year at a time when it was pressing Congress for millions to deal with serious 
problems in its disability programs. The largest single award -- $9,256 -- went 
to an executive who had been on the job for less than three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the agency's 65,000 employees got a cash bonus in 1993, 
according to Social Security spokesman Phil Gambino. 
</P>
<P>
 Records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that the biggest 
award went to Lawrence Thompson, who was named the agency's second-ranking 
executive by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala on July 19. 
</P>
<P>
 His bonus, recommended by Social Security Commissioner Shirley Chater and 
approved by Shalala, was for the fiscal year that ended 73 days later, on Sept. 
30, Gambino said. Thompson's annual salary is $120,594. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Security is not unique among federal agencies in awarding employee 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency's decision to spend $32 million is striking because Social 
Security lobbied Congress last year for additional money to process a growing 
backlog of disability claims. Some ill and injured workers have died, lost 
their homes or turned to welfare while they waited for their first Social 
Security check. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress gave the agency an extra $200 million to speed up those decisions, 
and Rep. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) questions whether Social Security would have been 
able to finance its bonuses without that money. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunning, the senior Republican on the House Ways and Means Social Security 
subcommittee, called the bonuses outrageous and criticized the agency for 
giving Thompson such a large sum after such a short time on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get $9,256 for 2 1/2 months of service in the Social Security 
Administration, that is an outrage that we all ought to be made aware of," 
Bunning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gambino argued that Thompson's bonus covers both his work at Social Security 
and his last nine months at the General Accounting Office, where he served as 
assistant comptroller general for human resource programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The money to pay for the bonus, however, came out of Social Security's budget. 
And Thompson would not have received a bonus if he had stayed at GAO, because 
that agency didn't have the money for any awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Gambino said the agency awarded bonuses to 2,891 high-level managers totaling 
$3.1 million, or an average of $1,060 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 42,727 rank-and-file workers collected bonuses totaling $29.1 
million, or an average of $681 each. The cost of the bonuses to Thompson and 25 
other senior executives totaled $172,822. 
</P>
<P>
 Agencies are allowed to give annual cash awards equal to 0.5 percent to 1.5 
percent of their total payroll costs, Gambino said. Social Security's bonuses 
amounted to 1.4 percent of its total payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonuses are based on the employee's work performance and salary. Gambino said 
they are meant to reward a work force of 65,000 stretched thin by a 20% cut in 
the number of employees and growing demands.

TEAM COMPILES BOSNIA ATROCITIES FOR WAR CRIMES TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For Marcia McCormick, the day begins and ends with unforgettable horror. 
</P>
<P>
 Hour after hour, she pores over pages filled with the words of women whose 
bodies have been brutalized and souls scarred in war. They are as young as 5, 
as old as 81. All are rape victims in the former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick, a lawyer, catalogues each of these hundreds of reports into a 
computer. Her task: to record a first draft of history. Her hope: that the 
testimony will be a first step toward justice. 
</P>
<P>
 She is among about 40 people at DePaul University's College of Law compiling a 
data base of atrocities and aggression in the former Yugoslavia to be used by 
the prosecution at a United Nations war crimes tribunal -- the first since Nazi 
and Japanese leaders were tried after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have here is the beginning of historical archives," said M. Cherif 
Bassiouni, project director and international law professor at DePaul. "We owe 
it to the victims; we owe it to ourselves in terms of our own humanity to make 
a record of the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Bassiouni began the project in late 1992 after being named to a five-member 
U.N. commission selected to investigate war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. 
Last May, the U.N. Security Council set up an 11-judge tribunal at The Hague. 
</P>
<P>
 DePaul's team of lawyers and researchers -- many of them volunteers -- will 
present to the commission a compendium of cruelty in the 
Serbian-Muslim-Croatian conflict: more than 5,000 incidents of murder, rape, 
torture, kidnaping, mass graves and prison camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the sort of thing one reads about with respect to medieval wars and 
thinks, gee, these things didn't really happen, or if they did, they won't 
happen again," said the Egyptian-born Bassiouni, who has stood among corpses in 
mass graves and dodged sniper fire during trips to the war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say these ethnic groups have been fighting for hundreds of years so 
it's just inherent in their nature . . . but that's not the case," said Mark 
Bennett, assistant project director. "It shows what human nature is when there 
are no controls. I think this would happen anywhere in the world given the same 
set of circumstances -- and that's what's most frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 The DePaul team's series of reports has been culled from 63,000 pages of 
documents, including eyewitness and victim testimony, news stories and reports 
from governments and human rights groups such as Amnesty International and 
Helsinki Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering facts immediately is critical, said Bassiouni, who secured 
foundation funding and support from DePaul. The United Nations did not provide 
any money. 
</P>
<P>
 "People change their views," he said. "Their perceptions also change. The 
information disappears. You have to do it when it's fresh in the minds and 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some human rights experts doubt there is the political will and 
financial resources in the international community for trials. The tribunal 
still has no top prosecutor or indictments and a February report by Helsinki 
Watch claimed "the U.N. has delayed and obstructed its ability to function." 
</P>
<P>
 But politics isn't the focus on the fourth floor of DePaul's International 
Human Rights Law Institute, where boxes of affidavits and maps line the halls 
and walls and staffers sit hunched over computers, using special software 
tailored to classify war crimes in a conflict that has killed up to 200,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Some reports are spare, but shocking: a girl known as K.J., shot 10 times, 
bullets piercing her lungs and liver; the forced evacuation of Croatian 
patients from a hospital to Ovcara where it is believed 280 prisoners were 
executed; a 28-year-old woman raped in an outdoor stadium by 28 Serbs in a 
single day before she blacked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cliche but it comes back to haunt you," said McCormick, who is 
compiling the rape report. "At the beginning it was much easier to be upset 
when I read (the testimony). . . . Now, I'll have a horrible nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Translators decipher documents in Serbo-Croatian, French or German, but 
lawyers have a more arduous mission -- trying to find a method in the madness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every big case I've worked on has an element of what I'm doing -- putting 
together a puzzle," said Penny Venetis, a New York lawyer who tackled savings 
and loans cases before taking a leave to work at DePaul. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to figure out relationships between 700-odd (prison) camps we 
have identified," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If they succeed, the project could be very valuable, said Diane Orentlicher, 
professor of international law at American University in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're doing can become state-of-the-art documentation. . . . they're 
creating the potential for tracking the movement of soldiers and showing 
patterns of abuse that make it possible to see things you can't by looking at 
one case, then another one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also will transfer more than 140 videotapes to CD-ROM, breaking them 
down frame by frame to identify perpetrators, which sometimes is surprisingly 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In areas where some of the worst atrocities occurred, they were carried out 
by people who had lived together," Bennett said. "They knew their perpetrators 
and, in a lot of instances, they made no attempt to hide their identity." 
</P>
<P>
 But identifying them and prosecuting them are two different matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribunal will not try anyone in absentia and governments can't be forced 
to turn over citizens, though the court's president has expressed optimism that 
they will. Two war-crime suspects are in custody in Denmark and Germany; two 
others have been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassiouni is confident there will be trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is how many, how long it will take and how high they will 
reach," he said. "If we catch 10% of the people who committed the crimes and 
prosecute them . . . the message we will be sending will be extraordinary."

AFTER 15 YEARS, MEDICAL SLEUTH UNRAVELS MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF IDAHO MAN; 
HANTAVIRUS: PNEUMONIA-LIKE ILLNESS BECAME AN EPIDEMIC LAST SUMMER, BUT IT 
APPARENTLY FIRST SURFACED IN 1978. ROOKIE FEDERAL HEALTH INVESTIGATOR NEVER 
FORGOT THE CASE; LAST DECEMBER, HE PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mysterious death of an Idaho man from a pneumonia-like illness so 
perplexed a rookie federal health investigator that he kept his personal notes 
on the case for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a few months ago, those files turned out to be much more than a 
sentimental keepsake. That's when Dr. Rick Goodman recognized that details 
about the death -- his first case -- matched those in a report describing a 
respiratory disease that was killing dozens of people in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just hit me," said Goodman, now an editor at the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. "I'd been staring a case of hantavirus in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 The Idaho man's death in 1978 is no longer a mystery: It's the earliest 
confirmed case in the United States of hantaviral pulmonary syndrome, as the 
disease is called. 
</P>
<P>
 That finding is important because learning the history of a virus helps 
scientists determine what causes epidemics, said Dr. Gary Simpson, an 
infectious disease specialist with the New Mexico Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 After determining what factors lead to epidemics, health departments can 
develop "sentinels," or tip-offs, to alert the public when the same conditions 
arise again -- just as they now use in the Southwest to prevent outbreaks of 
bubonic plague, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But until last summer, researchers were unaware of this form of hantavirus or 
its ability to attack a victim's lungs. Hantavirus, in an even rarer form that 
destroys the kidneys, has been in the United States for years without causing 
epidemics. 
</P>
<P>
 Only recently have scientists learned that the respiratory form may be just as 
old. No one knows why it has resurfaced so fatally. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the outbreak almost a year ago, Goodman has edited more than a dozen 
reports for the CDC about the rodent-borne hantavirus and the respiratory 
disease it causes. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until December, while reading about another suspected case, that 
Goodman linked it to the death he reviewed shortly after joining the CDC's 
investigative epidemiology team. 
</P>
<P>
 Still nostalgic about his first work assignment and puzzled by the death of an 
otherwise healthy 24-year-old man, Goodman had kept his personal notes on the 
case, even as he moved from research to administration as a CDC editor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tore open the filing cabinet, found the notes" and showed them to a 
colleague, who also was struck by the similarity to hantavirus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a case of not seeing the tree for the forest," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After making the connection, Goodman gathered autopsy specimens from state 
health officials and the University of Utah Hospital, where the man died on 
Sept. 22, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman confirmed his suspicions after painstaking laboratory tests showed 
that the virus -- the same strain that struck the Southwest -- had killed the 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 11, he talked to the victim's widow, who is now remarried. She 
declined to talk with the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1978, the man's death had sent Goodman to Montpelier, a small Rocky 
Mountain town of about 3,000 in southeastern Idaho, near the Wyoming line. 
</P>
<P>
 His job was to find out what had killed the young man, an avid sportsman who 
was a volunteer fireman. Goodman conducted numerous interviews with his widow, 
hunting buddies and co-workers at a chemical fertilizer plant. 
</P>
<P>
 All he found was dead ends. He couldn't even confirm a local physician's 
belief that cases of respiratory disease were increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We left, basically, without a clear answer as to what caused his death," 
Goodman recalled. "It always struck me that we went out there and we didn't 
find anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he marvels at connecting the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few instances in medicine where you solve the problem such a 
distance of time from it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman's discovery is an example of "serendipity in science," said Victoria 
Harden, historian at the National Institutes of Health. The apparent luck 
actually comes after much hard work, when "suddenly it all falls into place 
when you least expect it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar happenstance at the CDC came when researchers were investigating 
another often fatal respiratory illness, Legionnaires disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of Legionnaires was discovered in 1976 when CDC scientist Joe McDade 
connected information he had found in his files to the outbreak in Philadelphia 
months earlier. Later, the agency eventually linked the disease to earlier 
cases -- just like hantavirus. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the full history of such a virus -- that it can start with just a 
single case and lead to outbreaks years later -- forms the basis for the CDC's 
research and prevention efforts, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Idaho man, even knowing the cause of his death would have given 
physicians little help in curing him. There is still no treatment today for the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Hantaviral pulmonary syndrome is believed to be carried in airborne particles 
of dried feces or urine from rodents. In the Southwest -- and the Idaho case -- 
the carrier is the deer mouse. Researchers are still trying to identify the 
rodent carrier in cases in Florida, Louisiana, California, and the Northeast. 
So far, the CDC has confirmed 60 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Early symptoms resemble the flu, but the disease progresses rapidly to 
breathing difficulties and shock. It is fatal about 60% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The hantavirus family is named for the Hantaan River in Korea, where the first 
strain was discovered decades ago. That virus infected about 3,000 American 
soldiers during the Korean War, killing 190 by destroying their kidneys. The 
virus itself was not identified until more than 20 years later. Hantavirus

Prevention. Numbers may differ from those provided by state health departments 
because some departments list suspected cases. Arizona: 11 Colorado: 5

'JUSTIFIABLE PARANOIA' AFFLICTS LAWYERS, PSYCHOLOGIST SAYS; STRESS: HE TRIES TO 
TEACH ATTORNEYS HOW TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS THEY FACE, INCLUDING PUBLIC 
REVULSION, DEPRESSION, DIVORCE, ALCOHOLISM, DRUG ADDICTION.

<P>
 Fifteen years ago, when Paul Messing told people he worked as a public 
defender, he felt pride. Today, he feels like a pariah. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel like everybody is out to get you," said Messing, the deputy chief of 
the Philadelphia public defender's office. "And you live it; you live it 24 
hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Amiram Elwork has heard it before. Lawyers comprise half of his psychology 
practice in suburban Philadelphia. He has seen the effects of the stress 
Messing has felt: depression, divorce, suicide, anger, alcoholism, drug 
addiction and a mental problem he calls "justifiable paranoia." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than treat the problems once they have taken a toll, Elwork has begun 
addressing them before they occur. He has taught a course at the Widener 
University School of Law in Wilmington, Del., called "Non-Legal Challenges in 
the Law Practice." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not your imagination that someone is out to get you all the time," 
Elwork said. 
</P>
<P>
 Widener, where Elwork is director of the Law-Psychology Graduate Program, has 
billed the course as the only one of its kind offered in any law school 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of class, Elwork doused his 15 eager students with harsh 
realities of practicing law. 
</P>
<P>
 He told them about several studies that found attorneys suffer from depression 
and substance abuse at twice the national average. He told them associates 
often work 60-hour weeks to fulfill their billing requirements. He told them 
that by the year 2000 there will be one attorney for every 300 people; if they 
get a job, it probably will not pay what they expected. 
</P>
<P>
 They will work in a politically charged, bottom line-oriented environment that 
will not leave time for the intellectual musing they enjoy in law school, he 
said. Their mistakes would be considered monumental. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked about the burnout, the disillusionment, the dissatisfaction, the 
lack of vacations and society's general dislike of lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He laid it on thick," said Laura Wampler, a third-year student. "I thought, 
'Why didn't we take this class first year when we could have gotten out of 
this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 On the second day of class, Elwork began to show the students how to avoid 
becoming one of the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was startled at first," said Kathy Banfield, a fourth-year evening student. 
"But by the end of the class I said, 'This won't happen to me. I'm prepared.' " 
</P>
<P>
 No one in the class dropped out of law school, as far as Elwork knows. But 
they re-examined what area of the law they wanted to practice after learning 
about the strong points of their personalities and the compatibility with 
various practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little frightening to see how naive the students were," said Ann 
Britton, a law professor at Widener who monitored the class. 
</P>
<P>
 Before entering a practice, Cathy Sikorski did not have the insights Elwork 
offers his students. She quit practicing law after nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she never thought she would "save the world," but she also said she 
never understood the workaholic environment of law. 
</P>
<P>
 As time went on, Sikorski began to doubt she wanted to spend the rest of her 
life focused almost solely on work. Five years ago, she opened up her own 
business in her Pottstown home. 
</P>
<P>
 "People still say, 'You'll go back.' . . . They can't understand giving up a 
career like that, that there could be anything bigger or better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The time and effort it takes to first become a lawyer prevents many who are 
dissatisfied from leaving the profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this happens gradually," said Philadelphia lawyer Neil Perloff. "By 
the time you realize it's happening, you've created a career for yourself. You 
also get a feeling that maybe you can change things. You see you can't and it 
impacts on your psyche. Then, it becomes to late." 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawyers think their only alternative is to quit. Until the profession 
itself changes, Elwork often helps them find ways that they can continue to 
practice, but in a less stressful environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who is concerned about justice," he said, "should be concerned about 
this issue."

LUGGAGE SYSTEM LAGGING IN DENVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A computerized baggage system that's supposed to whisk luggage from one flight 
to another at the new Denver International Airport is performing so poorly its 
maker said the airport's opening may have to be postponed for the fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly wasn't a success," Gene Di Fonso, vice president of BAE 
Automated System Inc., said Thursday after a daylong test of the $193-million 
system."A failure? Yeah, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 "Without declaring defeat we need to be intellectually honest about what we 
saw in today's testing: The May 15 opening is in serious doubt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.2-billion airport was supposed to open Oct. 31, but that was postponed 
to Dec. 19 and then to March 9 because of construction and training delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Wellington Webb blamed the baggage system when he postponed the opening 
again to May 15. TV screens showing flight information and about 25 security 
doors were not ready for the March opening either.

BLACK INFANT DEATHS WILL TRIPLE WHITE BY 2000 AT CURRENT RATE, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Black babies will be three times more likely to die than white babies by the 
year 2000 if the gap in the U.S. infant mortality rate continues to widen, 
federal health officials warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks' risk of dying before their first birthday was twice that of whites in 
1960, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.The disparity is even 
greater now. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1980 to 1991, the most recent year for which data are available, the rate 
of black infant deaths dropped 20.7%, from 22.2 to 17.6 per 1,000 births. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rate for whites fell 33%, from 10.9 to 7.3 per 1,000, the CDC said in 
its weekly report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report did not include figures on other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two-thirds of the gap was due to an increase in the number of very 
low birth weights among black newborns, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the U.S. infant mortality rate was 8.9 per 1,000 births in 1991, down 
29.4% from 12.6 in 1980, the CDC said.

'GREEN' WAR WAGED AT PENTAGON AMID MILITARY DRAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LEE, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deep inside the belly of the Pentagon, past the corridors where the brass 
design New-Age missiles or track the latest moves in Bosnia, Sherri Goodman 
charges forth on an unlikely mission: promoting natural-gas vehicles and other 
up-to-date environmental technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 As deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security, Goodman is 
responsible for, among other tasks, maintaining high standards of pollution 
prevention equipment at U.S. military bases and other Defense Department 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 With state-of-the-art environmental technologies constantly changing, and 
military bases worldwide pushing their own demands, Goodman is bringing a new 
culture to a department not often viewed as environmentally correct or "green." 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to look at our facilities and try to find ways they can use 
alternative-fuel vehicles and anti-pollution devices, and ways to get rid of 
ozone-polluting substances," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides the environmental considerations, I'm also looking out to see that 
the department gets the best value for the money it spends." 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department has long had an environmental watchdog section, but the 
Clinton Administration has significantly upgraded and expanded it. Although the 
agency has a staff of only 118, the Office of Environmental Security's overall 
budget of $5.7 billion rivals that of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The office also has a broad reach. Beyond overseeing environmental standards 
at bases worldwide, it is charged with the cleanup of closed Defense Department 
bases, the upkeep of Defense Department lands in the public trust, overhauling 
contaminated defense facilities and guaranteeing the department's compliance 
with federal environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
 With a wide range of bases closed across the country in 1993, and others 
slated for closure this year, the cleanup of defunct military facilities has 
become one of the office's top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The object of the cleanup process, Goodman said, is to get the bases to the 
point where they can be leased and used as commercial facilities. With toxic 
dumps and munitions buried on some sites, cleanup sometimes can involve 
complicated soil and water cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
 One practice Goodman favors is using plastic beads to strip the paint off 
F-16s and other aircraft. The process, recently introduced at Hill Air Force 
Base in Ogden, Utah, is conducted by robots. Under the old process, maintenance 
crews used paint-stripping solvents. Because the beads can be recycled, they 
are considered more environmentally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Other environmentally efficient technologies that Goodman supports include 
using natural-gas-powered vehicles and machines that wash equipment parts with 
citron-based cleanser instead of toxic solvents. Both methods are employed at 
some U.S. military bases, but their use should be expanded, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman, 35, apparently arrived prepared to oversee the cleanups. Before 
joining the Clinton Administration, she was a Boston-based environmental lawyer 
specializing in hazardous-waste cases. She served earlier as an aide to the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 To help jump the hurdles involved in cleaning up Defense Department sites -- 
addressing public concerns about cleanup activities near neighborhoods, for 
example -- Goodman's office typically brings together a coalition of parties to 
develop a workable plan. The group often includes officials from the Defense 
Department and EPA as well as state agencies and leaders in the communities 
around the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 One Environmental Security office task that seems to range far afield from 
usual Defense Department operations is protecting endangered species. As 
landlord of hundreds of thousands of acres of Western lands, the Defense 
Department also is viewed as protector of the endangered birds and animals that 
roam across them. Officers at Ft. Irwin Army Base in California changed their 
tank training venues and rearranged some of their facilities to keep from 
unsettling the habitat of the desert tortoise, an endangered species.

WITH SPRING'S THAW, CEMETERIES DIG IN; BURIAL: ACROSS THE FROSTY NORTHERN TIER 
OF STATES, FUNERAL DIRECTORS ESTIMATE THAT INTERMENTS FOR 80% OF WINTER DEATHS 
MUST BE DELAYED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A darker, more urgent rite of spring follows the melting snow and blooming 
daffodils in northern New England. As the earth thaws after one of the worst 
winters on record, cemetery workers are rushing to bury hundreds of people who 
died months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In tiny Van Buren, funeral director Jim Ouellette is already on the phone 
contacting families, getting plots readied and assigning burial times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be crazy," said Ouellette, who runs funeral homes in Van Buren 
and Ashland. "Fifty percent of our (annual) burials will take place in a 
three-week period in May." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouellette has 30 delayed burials scheduled for various cemeteries in May, with 
15 set for one day alone at St. Bruno's cemetery in Van Buren. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the frosty northern tier of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Upstate 
New York, funeral directors estimate that burials for fully 80% of winter 
deaths must be delayed until the ground thaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper obituaries commonly include the phrase, "Burial will be in the 
spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Some modern cemeteries can conduct burials throughout the winter, clearing 
plots with snowplows and cutting into the frozen turf with jackhammers. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the tidy, older cemeteries that dot the landscape of northern New 
England close when the snow piles up and the ground freezes, sometimes 7 feet 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
 In Parsonsfield, a person can't walk in the woods without stumbling across a 
graveyard. There are more than 100 small cemeteries here, although only five 
remain active. Traditionally, all close for the winter, said Diane Morrill at 
the town office. 
</P>
<P>
 May provides a brief window of burial opportunity, between the first week when 
most cemeteries reopen and Memorial Day, when many families make special visits 
of remembrance to grave sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Flanigan, a retired English teacher, has observed the ritual of spring 
burial for 20 years from his home next door to St. Bruno's. 
</P>
<P>
 On some days, he says, the burial ground will be almost raucous with heavy 
machinery digging plots, a crane hoisting concrete liner vaults from a flatbed 
truck into the graves, a hearse following with caskets, and another crew 
filling in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cemeteries permit mourners to attend graveside services in the spring, 
but at St. Bruno's, mourners are discouraged because services would slow up the 
assembly-line efficiency, Ouellette said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to have lost the humaneness," Flanigan said. "It's almost a 
mass-production type of a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The word "necessity" comes up often when funeral directors talk about delayed 
burials. But the climactic realities don't make the wait, as long as seven or 
eight months in some cases, any easier on mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just hanging over your head. It's unfinished business," said Paul Tully, 
a funeral director in the Portland area. "It reopens old wounds. There's nobody 
who will deny that." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the winter, bodies are usually kept at the cemeteries in caskets 
placed in charnel houses, a Dickensian term for receiving vaults. The vaults 
offer security and natural cooling for the remains. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole arrangement fascinates residents of more temperate climes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you stop to think about it, it makes sense," said James Wylie of the 
Florida Funeral Directors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just say, 'Golly, I'm glad I don't live there.' "

HISTORY UNFOLDS WITH WALK THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE GARDENS; WASHINGTON: 
GARDENER'S 44 YEARS ON JOB DEVELOP EXPERTISE ON JEFFERSON AS A LANDSCAPER TO 
JACQUELINE KENNEDY'S TOPIARY HOLLIES AND AMY CARTER'S TREEHOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 8,000 Oxford red tulips surrounding the fountain on the South Lawn of the 
White House are blinding bright in the spring sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The lavender magnolia blossoms drift softly over the grass near the Rose 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 And head gardener Irvin Williams, commander in chief of this green domain, is 
content. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardener Williams, 68, holds 44 years of memories of presidents and cherry 
blossoms. Through the glorious gardens of the White House grounds, Williams can 
trace the history of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 On a walk through the gardens, he speaks of the struggle to keep the squirrels 
from devouring the 100,000 tulip bulbs planted each year. He mourns the 
historic trees lost to winter storms. He is cheered by the mallard ducklings 
that appear each spring with the tulips and the hyacinths. 
</P>
<P>
 William leads a walk to the 1826 John Quincy Adams elm, dead for three years 
but living on as a graft on an elm sapling. He and his gardeners fight to 
prolong the life of Andrew Jackson's ancient Southern magnolia, transplanted 
from the President's Tennessee estate in the mid-1830s in memory of his wife, 
Rachel. 
</P>
<P>
 John Adams, the first President to live here, inherited acres of grounds 
littered with construction debris. His successor, Thomas Jefferson, a 
passionate gardener, planned the first landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Each President added something -- a new tree, a fountain, a bench in a shady 
spot, and, in modern times, a putting green, a horseshoe pit, a swimming pool, 
a tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey commissioned by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 gave the grounds their 
contemporary look. Roosevelt's gardeners opened up the view to the south to 
frame the still unbuilt Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now more than 400 trees and 4,700 shrubs on the White House grounds, 
which cover 18 acres inside the iron fences and 2.5 acres between the East Wing 
and the Treasury. Thirty-two of those trees were planted by presidents or their 
wives. And each year the gardeners plant those 100,000 donated spring bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the tulips at the South Fountain go they're replaced with 1,500 geranium 
and salvia; that's our summer show," Williams said. "We'll come back in 
September with chrysanthemums." 
</P>
<P>
 To do the planting, weeding, trimming, and pruning, as well as maintain the 
drives and the outside Secret Service guard posts, the gardener has a staff of 
18, including electricians and plumbers. Eight other gardeners tend a 
greenhouse elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gardening is my life," Williams says as he conducts a tour around the garden 
mounds erected by Jefferson's staff 190 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an awful lot of work," he says. "What makes it so great is when people 
tell you how beautiful it is." 
</P>
<P>
 And he adds another thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to provide what the first family needs. But what's great about the 
job is that our trees, our plants, our shrubs, know nothing about politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams started working on White House garden projects in the Truman 
Administration and was asked to manage the grounds full time by the Kennedys, 
who "took great interest in wanting to improve the grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden on the East Side of the White House, Williams 
points out the topiary hollies that frame springtime hyacinths, pansies and 
tulips. 
</P>
<P>
 He pushes aside an arrangement of potted plants to display the silver 
dedication plaque, its text in the former Mrs. Kennedy's handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 The white-painted iron chairs under the trees date to the administration of 
Millard Fillmore in the early 1850s. The concrete benches are believed to have 
their origins in Abraham Lincoln's White House years. "Not really very 
comfortable," the gardener says. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams considers the statue of a young girl that stands on the other side of 
a small rectangle of water, pointing out her gardener's smock, trowel, watering 
can and the plant she hoists over her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see Caroline Kennedy in that statue," Williams says. "She rode Macaroni, 
her pony, on the grounds near here every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams moves south across the grass, a combination Kentucky bluegrass and 
fescue, a mixture tailored to help the lawns survive the oven-heat of 
Washington summers. 
</P>
<P>
 The gleaming black limousines of the presidential motorcade purr past the 
Jefferson mounds and Clinton emerges at the path leading to the Oval Office. 
Socks, the cat, leaps to greet him, trailing a long leash. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first White House year, the Clintons have already planted three 
trees: a willow oak, a little leaf linden and an American elm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Socks got all tangled up in the willow oak," Williams says. 
</P>
<P>
 He points to the spreading limbs of an Atlas cedar. "That's where Amy Carter's 
tree house was. She would sleep out here at night." 
</P>
<P>
 The trees are all neatly labeled and marked. Jimmy Carter insisted on the 
labels, Williams recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't tell him, but I had wanted to do it for years," he says. "But if it 
hadn't been for President Carter, they still wouldn't be labeled. As it turned 
out, one of Amy's school projects was tree identification." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams moves onto the flagstone path shaded by low-hanging holly that leads 
to the White House children's garden, given to the grounds by Lyndon and Lady 
Bird Johnson at Christmas, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before it was used for that purpose, this is where Mrs. Kennedy had her 
trampoline," Williams says. "She'd come down even in cold weather and use it." 
</P>
<P>
 After the trampoline was gone, President Johnson installed a doghouse for his 
two beagles, named Him and Her. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrance to the children's garden is marked by 17 bronze hand prints of 
presidential grandchildren. At the garden's dedication, LBJ's grandson, Patrick 
Nugent, "took off and ran in here and fell straight into that pool," Williams 
recalls. "He was all smiles, wet or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking back to the White House, Williams points out the horseshoe pit favored 
by George Bush, the putting green where Clinton practices his golf swings, the 
swimming pool built for Gerald R. Ford and the swing on the tall tree planted 
by Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 And Williams has his little joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the windows of the Oval Office, protruding from the West Wing like the 
prow of a ship, is a bronze statue of a deer. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he placed it within view of the President's desk because it 
reminds him of the sign Harry Truman kept on his desk: "The buck stops here."

DAN THRAPP; RELIGION EDITOR, BIOGRAPHER OF THE OLD WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan L. Thrapp, a biographer of the Old West whose novels and anthologies 
brought him as many accolades as his work as religion editor of the Los Angeles 
Times, died Friday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter, Linda Nicholl, said he died at his Tucson home of a cerebral 
hemorrhage. He had retired to Arizona from Los Angeles in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 For two decades he covered religion for this newspaper; his Sermon of the Week 
became one of its more popular features. 
</P>
<P>
 From the early 1950s to the mid-1970s, he sat in pews in Southern California 
cathedrals, synagogues and storefront churches, working without notes to report 
the messages of Buddhist and Catholic priests, Presbyterian pastors, rabbis and 
Muslim ministers 
</P>
<P>
 In that period, he was singled out for praise by clergymen and institutions 
ranging from Rabbi Edgar Magnin of Wilshire Boulevard Temple to Methodist 
Bishop Gerald Kennedy to the National Religious Public Relations Council and 
Chapman College, which awarded him an honorary doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time and well past his retirement, he pursued a love of the West, 
writing novels under pseudonyms, and biographies and histories under his own 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kirsch, the late Times book critic, called Thrapp "one of the most 
promising young historians of the West" for Thrapp's life of Al Sieber, soldier 
and Indian fighter. His account, "The Conquest of Apacheria (Apache Land)," was 
called by another critic the definitive work of that 19th-Century U.S.-American 
Indian war. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter said his most scholarly work, and the one for which he will best 
be remembered, was his four-volume Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography, in which 
he researched the lives of more than 5,000 men and women who had an impact on 
the settling of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past several years, he was editor of the journal of the Council on 
America's Military Past. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his daughter, Thrapp is survived by a son, Col. Richard Platte of the 
Army Medical Corps.

SAFE DRIVING, NOT DRUNK DRIVERS, IS THE REAL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Death at Roscoe and Corbin" (April 10) blames drunk driving for the 
problems at that intersection because one of the accidents involved a drunk 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the police did a crackdown in that area and issued 417 citations, 
but only one of those motorists was cited for drunk driving. Obviously, the 
major offender at that and all other intersections is the inattentive, 
inconsiderate or just plain reckless sober driver who speeds, runs red lights 
and does not pay attention to the task at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the media continue to emphasize the drunk driver. Why not promote a 
safe-driving campaign aimed at all drivers?

SCHOOL BOARD WAS NOT RACIST IN REMOVING HENTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial "Quiz for the Burbank School Board" (April 17) totally missed 
the mark in suggesting that race had anything to do with the removal of Keiko 
Hentel at Burbank High School. Because the article states that "we are left 
with questions and concerns," I can only presume that the entire editorial 
board has forgotten a basic rule of journalism: Getting the facts! 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some facts that will shed some light on your "questions." 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Board of Education originally hired Keiko Hentel! How could your 
editorial possibly question whether a board was racist in its employment 
practices when it hired Hentel in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino and African American student groups at Burbank High School are 
thriving despite the presence of a new principal. Despite all of the recent 
press scrutiny of Burbank High, no reports have ever even remotely 
substantiated any change in the school's scope, diversity and constant 
encouragement of multiethnic groups and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank was recently singled out for having all of its middle schools 
designated as California Distinguished Schools. (This is an immense achievement 
that The Times never even reported.) The state awards this honor only to 
schools that have established successful programs that meet the needs of all 
its students. Clearly, the Burbank Unified School District's progressive and 
innovative policies and educational strategies have been a major factor in the 
district's success in meeting the diverse needs of its nearly 50% minority 
middle school population. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the suggestion that the Burbank school board might be out of touch 
with Burbank's changing demographics, all of the board members have lived in 
Burbank for more than 10 years, and some are lifelong residents. The board's 
president has two Latino grandchildren. Another board member is fully fluent in 
Spanish, holds bilingual and multicultural education degrees, minored in Asian 
studies and has spent nearly two decades establishing bilingual educational 
programs in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 As a lifelong resident of Burbank, I was insulted by your editorial.

WHO'S MINDING THE STORE FOR THE CITY?; L.A. SHOULD TAKE WACHS' ADVICE TO TRIM 
SUPPLY COSTS THROUGH FRUGAL PURCHASING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents the northeast San 
Fernando Valley, might be on to something. Wachs recently assumed leadership of 
the council's Governmental Efficiency Committee and has been clamoring about 
waste in city purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Wachs visited a typical office supply store and came out 
claiming vast savings from what the city normally pays for everything from copy 
paper and writing tablets to computer disks and manila folders. A good "photo 
op," as we say in this business, or just another sound bite? Maybe, but when a 
fiscally strapped local government is as large as that of Los Angeles, the 
costs of those paper clips can add up to serious money. 
</P>
<P>
 For guidance in these matters, we relate a story from our nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 For years there, the local government was told that it was wasting millions of 
dollars annually by paying much more than it should have for basic supplies and 
equipment. Few took the admonitions seriously. But later reports from the 
federal General Accounting Office and the National Institute of Government 
Purchasing finally caused the bureaucrats to take notice. Those reports said 
that Washington, D.C. could save $20 million annually with more frugal 
purchasing practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the D.C. government began looking into regional collective 
purchasing programs involving adjacent municipalities, and other government 
purchasing cooperatives involving neighboring and southern states. Such 
programs allowed participating governments to buy more for less by pooling 
their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is already hamstrung in these matters through ill-advised bidding 
preferences to county companies. That may promote local businesses, but it can 
also cost more. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when higher taxes are unlikely and probably not economically 
desirable, and at a time when few are willing to consider reduced city 
services, getting as much as possible for every public dollar makes eminent 
good sense. That may mean a rethinking of the city's purchase policies.

SHORTSIGHTED VOTERS VICTIMIZE THE STUDENTS; SCHOOLS DECAY UNDER BOND ISSUES' 
TWO-THIRDS RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We'd like to point out that American employees work in an increasingly 
interconnected global economy. They are engaged in a fiercely competitive world 
marketplace that has seen companies such as IBM shed one-third of its U.S. 
workers in just the past three years. Just how well-prepared are we for this? 
Not very well at all. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the Public Broadcasting System aired a four-part, two-evening 
series entitled "Challenge to America." Among other things, the programs 
pointed out the disturbing fact that Japanese and German students were 
substantially better prepared than their American counterparts for the modern 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 It should have been required viewing in places such as Burbank and Glendale. 
And the related remarks of educators such as Cal State Northridge President 
Blenda Wilson deserved wide circulation there as well. "The support base for 
public education is eroding at precisely the time when a strong education 
system is necessary to our economic recovery in California and across the 
country," Wilson has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, folks in Burbank and Glendale have set a woeful example in this 
regard. So too have residents in many other California communities. Too many of 
them have taken the most shortsighted and miserly approach possible. Too many 
of them have done nothing to inspire public school students in their cities to 
strive for the knowledge needed for the new global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Times' reporter Jill Bettner's tour through 72-year-old Burbank High School, 
for example, showed dangerously dark classrooms. It was difficult to read in 
the dim, yellow haze of 40-year-old fluorescent lighting fixtures. Electric 
power failures are common there, as are clogged toilets and shower drains. When 
the weather is cold, students wear their coats throughout the day. Or it can be 
hot. "I'm confident there are days when the temperature in some of these rooms 
hits 115 or 120 degrees," says David Gott, the school's director of facilities 
planning. There are enough boarded windows to make the place resemble a barely 
occupied housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a shameful state of affairs that is hardly conducive to serious study, 
and Burbank's Burroughs High School is in similar disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters in this city could have changed all that if the required two-thirds 
majority had favored a school bond issue earlier this month. The measure would 
have provided funding for the replacement of one of the high schools and 
renovated the other. But voters failed to rise to the occasion. The issue 
failed in a sparsely attended, 5,766-5,061 vote -- or 53% to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin persuaded Glendale Unified School District officials to not even 
try to place a similar bond issue before the voters before 1995. Well, that was 
awfully courageous of them. Most of Glendale's schools were built in the 1920s, 
and some of their classrooms have just one electrical outlet. So much for the 
accouterments of cutting-edge educational technology. 
</P>
<P>
 We have long agreed that a two-thirds majority vote should not be required to 
pay for new and improved schools. We agree that the 53% vote in favor of the 
Burbank bond issue should have been sufficient. But two-thirds is the current 
requirement, and it can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank school officials should seek another bond issue in November. Glendale 
school officials ought to find the backbone to launch an attempt, period. Along 
with the town meetings that have been scheduled to drum up support for such a 
measure in Burbank, school officials there should offer tours of their schools. 
It might be harder for the voters to say no once they see that conditions in 
these schools are comparable to those in some of the nation's most impoverished 
inner cities.

TRUSTEES BOWED TO FRINGE GROUP ON CLAS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a concerned citizen in the Antelope Valley and an English teacher for 22 
years in the Antelope Valley Union High School District, I am outraged and 
embarrassed by the school board's cavalier defiance of the Education Code, 
which requires school districts to give the California Learning Assessment 
Standards test. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Billy Pricer invited representatives of the Eagle Forum and 
the United States Justice Foundation -- both groups from the San Diego area -- 
and listened to their concerns at the April 6 board meeting.At the April 20 
board meeting, I presented a 30-minute explanation of the tests and answered 
each of their stated concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Mr. Pricer and his two colleagues on the board, Sue Stokka and Tony 
Welch, prefer to bow to the viewpoints of fringe groups (with questionable 
agendas and from outside our area) than to listen to logical explanations by 
professional educators within their own school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The television show "Hard Copy" recently called Lancaster "the town that 
banned sex." I'd like to propose a new title for the Antelope Valley: "The 
place that banned critical thinking."

 * Your story on a state Assembly panel's rejection of mandatory earthquake 
insurance for Californians (April 14) makes it obvious that Assemblywoman Paula 
L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) has mastered the art of reelection by being 
perfectly unclear, as her statement regarding her "no" vote on the legislation 
attests: "As good as this bill sounds, I also support a federal program." 
</P>
<P>
 Also ? Doesn't also imply that she voted for the state-run insurance program, 
when in fact she voted against it?

NORTH HILLS VA HOSPITAL HAS FULL ARRAY OF SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I would like to clarify some points made by veterans and reporters who say 
the Sepulveda VA Medical Center in North Hills is closed and there is no 
transportation to the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda's new mission is to provide a full array of outpatient and nursing 
home care to the veterans we serve.Inpatient services will be provided by the 
West Los Angeles center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sepulveda VA outpatient program is fully operational. This includes 
medical, surgical, mental health, drug and alcohol abuse clinics. In addition, 
the 120-bed nursing home care unit will be opening soon. There is an active vet 
center on the medical center grounds. Research and education will continue to 
be important activities at Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sepulveda VA Medical Center is affiliated with UCLA and will continue to 
provide the most sophisticated health care available today with a staff of 
highly skilled physicians, nurses and allied health professionals using the 
most modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
 An urgent care section has been initiated here at Sepulveda and is open from 8 
a.m. to 11 p.m. daily, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Veterans 
seeking care at the Sepulveda VA facility who need emergency hospitalization 
will be examined and transferred to the nearest private-sector hospital by 
ambulance. Veterans needing elective or non-urgent inpatient hospitalization 
are transported to the West Los Angeles center. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda has been offering a wide range of specialty services to the veterans 
of the San Fernando Valley and the surrounding areas for more than 40 years. 
When the new state-of-the-art outpatient clinic is completed in December, 1995, 
it will further enhance these services.

'SPECIAL INTEREST' IS WRONG TERM FOR ANIMAL GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The remarks of outgoing animal regulation Commissioner Lynne Exe ("Supporter 
of Coyote Trapping Quits Panel," April 13) cannot be left unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commission is controlled by special interests," she contends, referring 
to animal rights advocates. Huh? Has Exe written her own dictionary or what? In 
English, the term special interest refers to a group or industry that takes a 
stand from which it receives economic benefit. I challenge Exe to explain how 
the humane community profits financially from the ban on coyote trapping!

POST-GAME HANDSHAKE NEEDS TO BE SINCERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Restoring the handshake is not enough ("Schools Dump No-Handshake Policy," 
April 20). 
</P>
<P>
 Most post-game handshakes that I have witnessed resembled running a stick 
along a picket fence.To display the demeanor of sportsmanship, let's consider 
requiring the participants to stand still, establish eye contact and perform a 
complete handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 Shallow ambition to be "the best" pollutes children's efforts to do their 
best. After giving lip service to sportsmanship, parents and coaches scream 
foully at referees. 
</P>
<P>
 The child is pressured to win or be withdrawn from the opportunity to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Values are never cheap. They must be cultivated. Isn't this what civilization 
is about? 
</P>
<P>
 Dialogue on gamesmanship, sportsmanship and civilization as we would shape it 
can lead to the development of positive programs that model behavior that 
reflects inner values.

SEEKING OFFICE DOES NOT JUSTIFY ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * One of the more distressing aspects of running for public office is the 
staged press attacks, of which Toni Casala's letter (April 18) is a good 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Casala purports to be "outraged" at the series of public meetings I have 
held as a member of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 She should have taken the time to learn the facts first: 
</P>
<P>
 I am statutorily the public member of the conservancy from the San Fernando 
Valley, and I have a legal duty to discharge that representation. 
</P>
<P>
 I am also the only member of the conservancy appointed by a statewide elected 
authority, the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 I have an environmental record stretching back 25 years, including my most 
recent stint as state planning director. I do not need to be educated by Ms. 
Casala or anyone else on environmental issues. The purpose of these meetings 
was to receive public input. 
</P>
<P>
 The total expense of the meetings was $39, which was paid out of my own 
pocket. No taxpayer dollars were expended, although it would have been proper 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as "living in the community" for a while, I was born here, which is 
more than I can say for the incumbent, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I am the only congressional candidate of either party who was born in 
Los Angeles County and who still lives here.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; WATCH OUT FOR PARKLAND DEALS MADE ON SHAKY GROUNDS; THE $20 
MILLION SPENT TO SAVE CANYON OAKS' 662 NOT-SO-TERRIFIC ACRES FROM THE BULLDOZER 
COULD HAVE BOUGHT 3,000 ACRES OF SCENIC WOODLANDS AND CANYONS ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE BROWN, Dave Brown is on the citizens advisory committee of the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was general rejoicing a few weeks ago at the dramatic conclusion to the 
Canyon Oaks development controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks, you will recall, was the longest land-development controversy in 
Los Angeles County history. The plan to build houses and a golf course in upper 
Topanga Canyon aroused furious opposition among residents. On March 10, the day 
the county supervisors were to vote on it, a last-minute deal was announced 
that stopped the project. 
</P>
<P>
 I, too, was opposed to the Canyon Oaks development, but I am not comfortable 
with the way it was "defeated" -- by being bought out with park funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors had abundant grounds for turning it down. It exceeded the 
amount of development permitted by the county's own area plan; there was not 
enough water to serve it; there were no sewers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Canyon Oaks was not denied by the supervisors. It was bought by the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy with almost $20 million, mostly money that county 
voters set aside in 1992 for the purchase of parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks cost $30,000 an acre. By comparison, the National Park Service has 
bought 20,000 acres of the Santa Monica Mountains over the past 15 years at an 
average price of $6,200 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks became a cause celebre because it was the battleground between 
Valley-type tract development and the rustic community of Topanga. It was a 
land-use battle, but it was resolved with park money. 
</P>
<P>
 Did we get a high-quality park for our money? Does Canyon Oaks have the 
qualities a mountain park should have? 
</P>
<P>
 * Does it have an unspoiled scenic backdrop protected against future 
development? Summit Valley, the main part of Canyon Oaks, provides a scenic 
view, but unfortunately we did not buy all of that view. Eighty-five percent of 
the ridgelines surrounding Summit Valley remain in private hands. Some are 
already developed, including a particularly obtrusive mobile home park on the 
north ridgeline. 
</P>
<P>
 * Does it have reasonably level areas for picnicking, camping and parking? 
Canyon Oaks has almost no flat land. 
</P>
<P>
 * Does it have accessible natural areas nearby, especially woodlands and 
streams? There are patches of oak woodland in some of the side canyons. There 
are woodlands, small streams and sandstone formations in a 400-acre section of 
Canyon Oaks east of Summit Valley. But it takes a fair amount of hiking to get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there good road access to the park with adequate parking? Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard goes right through Canyon Oaks, but parking on the highway is 
limited. The only road into the property is a steep track connecting to the 
highway on a blind hairpin curve, and only a handful of cars will fit at the 
bottom of this track. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks suffers by comparison with other current park purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan Ranch. In June the National Park Service purchased the 2,308-acre ranch 
from a reluctant, tightfisted Bob Hope for $16.7 million, a per-acre price of 
$7,235 -- one-fourth of the per-acre cost of Canyon Oaks. We got a 
two-mile-long, oak-filled valley protected from ridge top to ridge top; plenty 
of level land; a scenic upland meadow with panoramic views in all direction, 
and thousands of oak trees with wilderness habitat for mountain lions and 
golden eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Avatar. This 348-acre property will cost almost as much per acre as Canyon 
Oaks but is accessible right off the streets of Woodland Hills and Tarzana and 
is only a few blocks from Ventura Boulevard bus stops. There are oak and walnut 
trees with room for picnicking and trail head parking with easy trails up to 
Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka. The conservancy is buying this property for a main park visitor center 
and staging area. For this purpose, Soka is far superior to Canyon Oaks. It has 
more than 100 acres of level meadows ringed by oak trees, access to adjoining 
parkland (Canyon Oaks has no other parks nearby), easy freeway access and 
plenty of parking and a spectacular scenic backdrop in Malibu Creek State Park. 
Its buildings can be used as visitor centers, museums and overnight facilities 
for schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks, by comparison, is an average piece of parkland, a Volkswagen. We 
paid a Mercedes-Benz price for it because we allowed park money to be used to 
resolve a heated land-use conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting Topanga is a commendable goal, but it is a land use goal, not a 
park goal. Park money should buy the best possible parks, not be used to 
protect communities from development threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Land use issues should be resolved through fair and open planning and zoning. 
This is difficult to achieve in unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County 
because Supervisors Deane Dana and Mike Antonovich support just about every 
development that comes along. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because the board practically never enforces the County General Plan, 
uncertainty hangs over land value. Appraisers have no idea what the county will 
approve. So appraised values can rise far above the land's real market value. 
</P>
<P>
 Land development controversies like Canyon Oaks generate political heat for 
elected officials, as well as anxiety, anger and frustration for residents. 
Often someone starts a campaign to "buy it for a park!" A park agency looking 
for public support is tempted to respond, and harried developers and elected 
officials may see government purchase as a win-win action for placating the 
contending parties. No one asks whether this "park" will really serve a 
regional public need. Often it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, outstanding potential parklands, some of national park quality, in 
less developed areas of the Santa Monicas are not being purchased because there 
is not an aggressive resident constituency to lobby for them. The money spent 
on 662 acres of Canyon Oaks would have bought 3,000 acres of scenic ridges, 
woodlands and canyons at typical prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Even existing parks are incomplete and not fully protected from development 
impacts. For example, some of the best views from Point Mugu State Park, Circle 
X Park, Leo Carrillo State Beach, Solstice Canyon Park, Malibu Canyon, Malibu 
Creek State Park and existing state parklands in Topanga are still in private 
ownership and open to development. Views that were unspoiled 10 years ago are 
now marred by graded roads, large cut-and-fill pads and garish mansions. 
Potential parks have been ruined and existing parks degraded. 
</P>
<P>
 Money to complete the purchase of Solstice Canyon Park was diverted to buy out 
an overpriced development in Studio City three years ago. Now Solstice Canyon 
is threatened by development. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu Canyon -- one-third as deep as the Grand Canyon and a backdrop for 
Malibu Beach -- was threatened by a tract proposal on the east rim. The 
developer was persuaded to offer the property to the conservancy, but the money 
to buy it has now been diverted to Canyon Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "Canyon Oaks" of the Ventura Freeway corridor is Malibu Terrace, the 
wooded hillside and valley you see in the distance going west over the 
Calabasas Grade. Seven years ago, a controversial apartment development was 
proposed there. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways Malibu Terrace would make a better park than Canyon Oaks -- and 
cost less. But it faces a different fate. A few days ago, the Regional Planning 
Commission approved 112 homes and a mini-mall on Malibu Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks will live. Malibu Terrace will die. And that's no cause for 
rejoicing.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; 'TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO WORK' DAY IS SEXIST; PARENTS SHOULD 
BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING DECENT EDUCATIONS FOR BOTH THEIR SONS AND 
DAUGHTERS THAN ABOUT THIS GIANT FOR-GIRLS-ONLY PHOTO OP AT THE OFFICE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I didn't take my daughter to work on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids know fairness. They count the items in their Christmas stockings to make 
certain Santa is an equal opportunity donor. They know whose turn it is to sit 
in the front seat of the car, to push the grocery cart, to get the mail. How 
could we single our daughter out for a fun trip and force our son to face the 
grind of another day at school? It just wouldn't fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ms. Foundation told parents all across the country that we should take our 
daughters -- just our daughters -- to work. They called it a national day to 
make girls "visible, valued and heard." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if we haven't done our part. We have dutifully told both our 
11-year-old son and our 8-year-old daughter that some nurses and teachers are 
men and some physicians and astronauts are women. We have encouraged them to 
plan to be almost anything they want to be, if they study hard -- and do well 
on the SATs. 
</P>
<P>
 How could I have explained preferential treatment for daughters? By saying 
girls are so needy, so long discriminated against, that Katie will now begin to 
get special favors? That Jonathan should stay back in school being taught the 
Ms.-approved lesson plan designed to increase his consciousness about the 
plight of women? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it really in this new generation's best interest for me to perpetuate an 
image of girls as needy victims, requiring special consideration to allow them 
success? 
</P>
<P>
 What were parents in the less-glamorous jobs supposed to do? Was the checker 
at the supermarket encouraged to pull her daughter from a day of study -- her 
best real chance for a good job -- to stand at a cash register for eight hours? 
Did the garbage collector bring his daughter along for inspiration? The bank 
teller? The maid? The gardener? What should the stay-at-home mother do? Keep 
her daughter away from school so the two of them can chase after a toddler 
sibling? 
</P>
<P>
 No, taking the daughters to work is not geared to the real jobs of most people 
but is designed to let adorable little upper-middle-class girls go to fun 
publishing jobs in Manhattan or sit behind Daddy's desk in a pine-paneled 
office, or wear a shiny stainless steel stethoscope while Mommy does rounds at 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, parents who want their children to succeed -- their sons and 
their daughters -- can expose them naturally and gradually to their work lives 
and to the careers of their friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 When problems come up at work, the whole family can discuss them, together, at 
the dinner table. The kids can drop by and see the office or help stuff 
envelopes on a Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But parents should fret more about securing decent educations for their sons 
and daughters than about ensuring an isn't-this-cute lunch and a photo op at 
the office -- with just their daughter. Besides, anyone who can bring a child 
to work all day isn't planning on accomplishing a lot of true toil. 
</P>
<P>
 We had them flip a coin to see who'd do the dishes.

<P>
 A hands-on lesson with traditional Chinese instruments will highlight a free 
music festival May 14 at Alpine Recreation Center designed to introduce people 
of all ages and ethnicities to Chinese musical forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chinatown Spring: A Festival of Music" will begin at 11 a.m. with a workshop 
on Chinese instruments taught by Wen-Hsuing Yen, a Pasadena City College 
professor and specialist in music history and ancient instruments.Yen will 
bring traditional string and percussion instruments, and will invite audience 
members to try their hand. 
</P>
<P>
 From noon to 4 p.m., members of the Chinatown Cultural Performance Coalition 
and Yuet Sing Music Club will perform and demonstrate Chinese opera, dance and 
instrumental pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival is the first in a series of events planned by the Chinese 
Cultural and Community Center of Greater Los Angeles to maintain Chinese 
culture and heritage as well as promote harmony among the people of Los 
Angeles, said Victor Huey, a center board member. 
</P>
<P>
 With $6,500 in donations and grants from the city's Cultural Affairs 
Department and Kaiser Permanente, the center also will hold fall Moon Festival 
activities, a Festival of Lions dancing exhibition and a Festival of Drums. 
</P>
<P>
 For the lion dance and drum festivals next year, organizers hope to invite 
other ethnic groups to demonstrate and discuss their related art forms, Huey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the healing, the harmony we want to establish for Los Angeles -- 
not just for Chinatown," he said.

ON ACCOUNT OF OTHERS; O.C. BANKER OPENS DOORS TO HOME OWNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine banker JoEtta Brown has often played the role of liaison between social 
causes and corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Dream Coalition begins offering incentives this week to help 
Californians of modest means become homeowners, and Brown has been a leader of 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 As community outreach coordinator and vice president of American Savings Bank, 
Brown, 53, chaired one of two key committees for the Coalition, an alliance 
formed by 30 banks, mortgage lenders and the California Assn. of Realtors. The 
Coalition held 359 seminars across the state at which 15,000 people learned 
about down payments and how to qualify for a loan. Those people will now get 
incentives such as lower fees if they buy homes by the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairwoman of the Coalition's education committee, which trained 960 
volunteers to set up and lead the seminars, she pushed to get the word out in 
Southern California to people, especially minorities, who might otherwise be 
intimidated by the home-buying process. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is one of a cadre of financial executives who are combining their jobs 
with public service, said Marci Mills, a San Francisco banker who worked with 
Brown in the Coalition. Unlike after the Watts riots of 1965, when most 
remedies for social problems were government-based, market solutions are at the 
heart of the effort today, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dream Coalition could also help to jump-start the California economy, said 
Mario Antoci, chairman and chief executive of American Savings. The 
participating banks and real estate agents will be competing for new business 
from the 15,000 seminar attendees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real estate has always led the way out of recession," Antoci said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coalition was not Brown's first experience as a negotiator for a social 
program. She was an adviser to Rebuild L.A. after the 1992 riots, creating a 
business expansion loan fund. She was instrumental in the expansion of Olive 
Crest, Orange County's organization for abused children, into Los Angeles. And 
she persuaded American Savings to donate $125,000 to the Los Angeles Urban 
League to train Inglewood bank tellers and loan officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm constantly amazed by how well-connected JoEtta is," Antoci said. "She 
gets me into the mayor's office -- and they all give her a kiss on the cheek." 
</P>
<P>
 But easy access does not ensure fast action, and Brown concedes that she often 
gets impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a frustration with systems, society and people that prevent things 
from changing," she said. "Working where I do, I see the very worst kind of 
living conditions. So I take a lot of deep breaths, and I fight over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Linda Smith-Gaston, a member of Rebuild L.A. who worked with Brown: "She 
is a person with a vision, and not everyone shares her vision. . . . Business 
people tend to work slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Tragash, executive director of the American Dream Coalition, said he 
chose Brown to head one of the group's two biggest committees because "JoEtta 
showed sensitivity to people." Also, he said, "this committee is a collection 
of competitors, and I needed someone with a lot of diplomacy. She kept people 
happy, kept the program moving and kept a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting people into their own homes has become a crusade for Brown because 
absentee ownership, she says, is a main cause of the decline of South-Central 
Los Angeles -- the neighborhood where she grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the key to community," she said. "If you own a home, you're not going 
to be as destructive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Home ownership can also lead to entrepreneurship, she said, noting that a 
large percentage of minority business people who start their own companies do 
so with home-equity loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, born in Kansas City, Mo., was the only child of a single mother. They 
moved to South Central Los Angeles when JoEtta was 8. She attended Hobart 
Boulevard Elementary School and Manual Arts High School. Her mother worked as a 
domestic. The neighborhood then was pleasant and safe, Brown recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 However pleasant, discrimination did exist. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of businesses -- Carnation Ice Cream on Wilshire Boulevard and the 
Brown Derby restaurant -- did not serve African Americans. "We said, 'That's 
not so important, we'll just go to another place,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A turning point was the murder of a friend who had gone to Mississippi to 
demonstrate against segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "That changed the focus of my life," Brown said. "I realized I need to take 
advantage of the opportunities that were offered to me." 
</P>
<P>
 She started college and met her husband, James, during her freshman year, in 
1959. They dropped out of school to start a family. Brown took her first 
banking position -- as a part-time teller -- to make money to furnish the 
couple's new home in Morningside Park. She gave up that job to stay home and 
bring up three daughters. During those 15 years, she also completed work for a 
college degree in finance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns, who now live in Laguna Niguel, have been married for almost 35 
years. James Brown, an assistant manager for a Lucky supermarket, speaks of his 
wife's determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a perfectionist, sincere, very giving," he said. "When she wants 
something accomplished, she wants it done the way she wants. But good fruits 
have come out of that attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 When she went back to work in 1973, Brown started at American Savings' Norwalk 
branch. She became a company vice president and branch manager, positions she 
held for more than 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when Antoci became chairman of American Savings, he created the 
community outreach department, partly in response to criticism of the bank's 
lending record in minority communities. He hired Brown as an outreach 
coordinator to keep the bank in touch with the African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Antoci describes Brown as one of his "superstars." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important in community outreach to empower your people to probe," he 
said. "JoEtta is out in the field all the time, keeping us informed of what the 
community's needs are." 
</P>

JAMES FLANIGAN: BIG MONEY MAKES A LONG-TERM BET ON NEW SOFTWARE FOR ELECTRONIC 
TEACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Predicting the future is easy. It's investing in it that's risky -- and making 
it work that's a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Big money is being thrown at creators of educational computer programs, in a 
long-term bet on electronic teaching and a shrewd assessment of human nature in 
the short run. 
</P>
<P>
 British publisher Pearson paid $462 million in March for Software Toolworks, 
which has systems that teach piano and typing, among other programs. Video game 
producer Electronic Arts paid $400 million in February to acquire Broderbund 
Software, creator of the Carmen Sandiego character featured on public 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Deals are flying. Paramount Communications last month pledged $50 million to a 
product development venture with Davidson & Associates, a company founded by a 
schoolteacher who created the popular Math Blaster instructional program. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson, which trades on Nasdaq at about $22 a share, sports a sky-high 
price-earnings ratio of 62; another software producer, Learning Co., developer 
of the preschool Reader Rabbit program, trades at 32 times earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The prices seem overripe for companies that form only a small fraction of the 
$4.5-billion educational publishing industry. In fact, major textbook 
publishers such as Houghton Mifflin, Harcourt Brace and McGraw Hill are having 
a mediocre year, because the next cycle of school purchasing programs in many 
states won't kick in until 1995, explains analyst Peter Appert of Alex Brown & 
Sons. 
</P>
<P>
 So why the excitement now? Parenthood and pride. A baby boomlet continuing 
from the 1980s guarantees rising school-age populations into the next century. 
And parents eager to give their offspring every advantage are making learning 
software a hot ticket. "It's a market driven by guilt," says analyst Keith 
Benjamin of Robertson, Stephens & Co., a San Francisco investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In past generations, sets of encyclopedias answered such urges; now it's 
Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia on computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The market is already sizable. There are roughly 30 million home computers in 
the United States, perhaps 6 million of them with advanced CD-ROM equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 And visions of an expansive future drive today's deals. "They're looking five 
years out to the day when centralized software will be beamed into the schools 
on closed cable networks," says John G. Taylor, a Portland, Ore.-based analyst 
for the investment firm L.H. Alton & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But fulfilling such visions requires progress: Educational software must prove 
it can really teach youngsters in new and better ways, not merely make learning 
more entertaining. Critics note that so far computers in schools have not 
lifted test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Progress is evolutionary, but I do believe it's going to come faster than 
most people think," says Janice Davidson, president of Davidson & Associates in 
Torrance. Her company today markets 20 of its own software programs and 
distributes 1,200 others to dealers and schools through a subsidiary; its sales 
last year totaled $58.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson started the company 12 years ago with $6,000 from funds she and her 
husband were saving to send their three children to college. Then 38, with 16 
years of experience in teaching, Davidson had created a speed reading program 
for college-bound youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 When she couldn't find a publisher for the program, she set up her own company 
and next created Math Blaster, which uses space adventures to teach arithmetic. 
A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down. 
</P>
<P>
 But she sees computers as central to education, not merely accessories. 
"Computers work because they allow children to learn at their own pace," says 
Davidson. "They are patient and interactive and do not frustrate children. So 
they make successful learners right from the beginning, and that can be very 
important in life." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a powerful perspective. Computers are doing for individuals today what 
books began to do in the 15th Century: greatly expanding the capacity for 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
 And computers are not isolating. "Children of different social groups and 
races work easily together on projects. Computers facilitate communication," 
Davidson says. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology is evolving; new programs demand more thought and logic. "They 
impart skills students will need to work in the Information Age," says 
Davidson, who has a doctorate in American literature from the University of 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these advances are occurring not in academic centers or government 
laboratories but in a rough-and-tumble marketplace, where competition is 
intense. Producing innovative software is essential, of course, but broader 
capabilities are needed as well. One reason software firms are selling out in 
the current merger wave is to gain size and capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 It was to help on the business side that Robert Davidson -- an engineer and 
lawyer with an MBA, and Jan's husband -- left Parsons Corp. in 1989 to join the 
family company. Since then, Davidson's has acquired, among others, Educational 
Resources of Chicago, the largest seller of software to schools, and 
Learningways Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., firm with capabilities in on-line 
transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 And it has made the deal with Paramount, under which Davidson will be able to 
add 200 people and develop advanced programs, some aimed at college-level 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The educational software "business is going to boom," says Bob Davidson, an 
easy prediction for a business already growing 40% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Such growth attracts competition. Book publishers, including Davidson's 
partner Paramount, already have budding operations in software; giant Microsoft 
is turning out educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But competition is part of a good business, and small companies can do very 
well indeed. Davidson & Associates, founded on $6,000 from family savings, is 
now worth more than $360 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Investing in the future is invigorating. Making it work can be incredibly 
rewarding.

CLINTON'S ECONOMIC ORDEAL: PROMISES DOOMED BY MATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As they shifted gears from running a presidential campaign to running the 
country in the early days of 1993, Bill Clinton and his senior economic 
advisers confronted two major challenges: crafting a coherent economic program 
that could get through Congress, yet keeping faith with the many promises 
Clinton had made during his frantic race for the White House.  
</P>
<P>
 There was just one big problem. The numbers in "Putting People First," the 
celebrated Clinton campaign bible that helped power the Arkansas governor to 
the White House in 1992, simply didn't compute. Living up to Clinton's campaign 
promises would be like squaring a circle.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of Clinton's senior aides had known that for months. The evidence 
that Clinton was promising more than he could deliver had become painfully 
clear to Clinton's aides as early as May, 1992 -- even before the George Bush 
campaign revved up its full-throated attack accusing Clinton of basing his 
campaign agenda on faulty arithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting People First" was not Clinton's first attempt to craft an economic 
plan for his campaign. Early on, he and his advisers, especially campaign 
manager James Carville, had sensed the public's hunger for substantive answers 
from the presidential candidates, especially on the domestic issues of the 
economy, jobs and health care that President Bush had largely ignored. So the 
first Clinton economic agenda was unveiled during the New Hampshire primary 
campaign, allowing him to claim he was the man with a plan.  
</P>
<P>
 The New Hampshire plan was fine, as far as it went. Developed largely by 
economic policy aide Rob Shapiro, it hit upon many of the major themes that 
would later dominate Clinton's general election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was really just a manifesto, not a budget; it did little more than 
attach Clinton's name to ideas that had been espoused for years by the 
Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist think tank Clinton had helped raise 
from the ashes of the party's defeats in the 1980s. For example, it proposed 
two middle-class tax cuts: a 10% across-the-board reduction for the middle 
class and a dependent tax credit that would have saved average-income families 
$480 for each child. 
</P>
<P>
 But the New Hampshire plan didn't make any attempt to balance the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it wasn't until Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination that his 
aides first dared, even internally, to add up the costs of the promises he had 
made during the primaries. Shapiro ran the numbers in late May and for a brief 
time thought he had made the math work. But, to his horror, he found he had 
accidentally double-counted anticipated savings from military cuts proposed by 
the Bush Administration. The real numbers were frightening. Cumulatively, 
Clinton had promised tax cuts and new spending that would exceed by $100 
billion the tax hikes and spending cuts that were supposed to offset their 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Clinton trailing in the polls in late May and early June and 
scrambling to avoid the humiliation of a third-place finish -- behind both Bush 
and Ross Perot -- the campaign staff was prepared to take risks. Prodded by 
both Carville and Clinton's key political adviser, George Stephanopoulos, 
campaign advisers developed and published "Putting People First" in less than a 
month. That allowed Clinton to unveil an economic plan by the time Perot 
announced his candidacy in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, "Putting People First" backed away from some of Clinton's most 
ambitious promises during the primaries. Instead of two tax cuts for the middle 
class, Clinton would offer just one.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet some of the document's budgetary assumptions were still highly suspect. It 
called for cutting the deficit in half in four years, but specified only one 
program for elimination: a subsidy paid to beekeepers that cost a mere $16 
million a year. Clinton had refused to endorse further spending cuts proposed 
by his advisers because he didn't have time to check them out with Democratic 
leaders from the affected states. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also suggested that $45 billion could be raised over five years by 
enforcing existing tax laws on foreign corporations, even though no tax expert 
in the country believed that tougher enforcement could raise more than $4 
billion. Above all, the plan relied on $91.7 billion from higher taxes on the 
rich, combined with rapid economic growth to satisfy Clinton's promise to halve 
the deficit, finance a $60-billion tax cut and underwrite $220 billion in new 
"public investments."  
</P>
<P>
 It was Clinton's version of the Reagan-era "magic asterisk." The deficit would 
shrink, the campaign said, because better times lay ahead.  
</P>
<P>
 The numbers problem grew worse as the campaign dragged on. In developing a 
platform, planners relied heavily on the official economic forecast issued by 
the Congressional Budget Office in January, 1992. But in August, just as the 
general election campaign was gearing up, a CBO revision rendered obsolete 
virtually all the campaign's calculations. The projected deficit for fiscal 
1996, for example, was raised to $254 billion from $178 billion; the estimated 
1997 shortfall went to $290 billion from $226 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's promise to chop the deficit in half while cutting taxes for most 
Americans was no longer within even shouting distance of reality.  
</P>
<P>
 His campaign plan was consciously designed to be a mirror image of 
Reaganomics, a bold attempt to reverse 12 years of Republican policies. But, 
like the Reaganauts before them, Clinton and his team were so anxious to start 
a revolution that they chose to overlook the harsh truths of federal budgeting. 
It was as if Clinton's campaign advisers were the descendants of David 
Stockman, the budget director who acknowledged only in hindsight that 
Reaganomics was a sham. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Clinton campaign was silent about the CBO revisions until after the 
election. Luckily for Clinton, the media largely ignored the changes too, and 
the Republicans weren't about to make a big issue of the fact that the deficit 
was getting worse on Bush's watch.  
</P>
<P>
 That enabled Clinton -- now President-elect -- to profess to reporters in 
December, 1992, that he was stunned by the new deficit projections emanating 
from the Bush Administration. In a Wall Street Journal interview, he said the 
deficit appeared much worse than it had when he assembled his economic plan 
earlier in the year. In background interviews, aides expressed outrage that 
Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, had used his power to keep the widening 
deficit figures secret until after the election.  
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton was surprised by the new numbers, it was only because he was 
emerging from the cocoon of the campaign and finally focusing on what his most 
senior aides already knew -- not because he was confronted with genuinely new 
information. The fact was, Darman's new deficit projections were strikingly 
similar to the CBO's August estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many in the Clinton Administration point to their April, 1993, 
re-estimate of Darman's work -- which predicted that the deficit for 1997 was 
on course to hit $346.3 billion unless Clinton's economic plan was approved by 
Congress -- to prove that Darman had been misleading them all along. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration's forecast -- clearly designed to make the final 
Bush-Darman report look as bad as possible -- was at least as disingenuous as 
any budget ploy Darman had pulled.  
</P>
<P>
 For his final deficit forecast, Darman assumed that limits on "discretionary" 
spending (the budget for the Pentagon and most civilian government operations, 
but excluding entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security) would 
continue through fiscal 1998. Under the 1990 budget agreement, discretionary 
spending was capped until 1995, but Darman calculated that Congress would 
extend the limits and freeze discretionary spending. His final budget kept 
total discretionary spending frozen at $539.1 billion from 1995 through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's budget director, former Rep. Leon E. Panetta of California, said 
there was no basis for Darman's assumption. In his new budget, Panetta simply 
forecast that the cap on discretionary spending would be lifted after 1995. 
When the Administration unveiled the outlines of its economic plan in February, 
the deficit forecast reached that $346.3-billion range. 
</P>
<P>
 No one in the Administration really expected Congress to allow unfettered 
discretionary spending. Indeed, within weeks of the release of Panetta's new 
numbers, Congress vindicated Darman's assumptions. In the budget resolution 
that would provide the framework for the Clinton economic plan, Congress and 
the Administration agreed not only to extend the legal spending caps beyond 
1995, but to impose just the sort of freeze Darman had used in his estimates. 
Discretionary spending would be held at $547 billion after 1995, just $8 
billion more than Darman's last projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Were Clinton and his advisers less than forthcoming when they blamed Bush and 
Darman for their woes? Ask Administration officials today and many will insist 
there was genuine surprise. Others smile and philosophize, not for attribution, 
about the nature of campaign rhetoric and the difficulty of defining truth 
within a political context. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some senior advisers, including Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and 
Panetta, readily concede they were not surprised at all by the deficit 
forecasts. Neither were key members of the Clinton campaign staff. Economic 
policy director Gene Sperling, Shapiro and others discussed the CBO revisions 
soon after they were released in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no surprise," one adviser said. "You just can't stop a campaign and 
suddenly revise your platform. Bush didn't do it; Perot didn't do it. And what 
would Bush have said if we suddenly had said, 'Wait a minute, we need to update 
"Putting People First? " ' He would have said, 'Look, I told you their numbers 
were wrong, and now they are admitting it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yet behind closed doors, the campaign staff was, in fact, updating the fiscal 
projections; a pre-transition team headed by Ira Magaziner began the work in 
August, 1992. "We knew the deficit was getting worse, and we expected Darman to 
try to show some surprises in the deficit, and we tried to take those into 
account," said one participant. Clinton knew about the work, but in the rush to 
the Nov. 3 election, he apparently never received a full briefing on the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the transition that the timing appeared right to remake the 
Clinton economic program into one better showing the new President's 
willingness to give deficit reduction a much higher priority than anyone 
outside his inner circle could have imagined.  
</P>
<P>
 Through most of 1992, Clinton privately had hated his campaign proposal of a 
broad-based, middle-class tax cut. He was sure it had cost him the New 
Hampshire primary, where rival Paul Tsongas had labeled him "pander bear" for 
offering sugarcoated economic prescriptions that ignored the deficit. Clinton's 
liberal advisers -- notably Robert Reich, now labor secretary -- also disliked 
the tax cut, believing it would soak up scarce resources that could better be 
spent on domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 What the liberals didn't foresee was the about-face of the post-election 
transition. In place of a tax cut would come a proposal for a $71.5-billion 
energy tax that would land squarely on the middle class.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet the success of Clinton and his key advisers at transforming his agenda 
into one that emphasized deficit reduction quickly got out of control, as 
Congress pushed the new President further than he had ever wanted.  
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton spoke of the need to bear pain and sacrifice to cut the deficit, 
miffed moderates and conservatives in Congress noted that the first major piece 
of legislation he had sent was a short-term stimulus plan larded with 
government pork. And, while his subsequent deficit-reduction package included 
plenty of real tax increases, it was noticeably light on genuine spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his tough-sounding rhetoric, Clinton was facing hard choices. That 
became clear when his first formal budget proposal, issued in April, did not 
comply with Congress' five-year spending caps -- restrictions Clinton had 
promised to meet just two months earlier. What's more, Clinton's program barely 
addressed the surging expense of entitlement programs, the real culprits behind 
the deficits of recent years.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics began to observe that the Administration's deficit-reduction plan 
looked a lot like the infamous 1990 budget agreement, which failed to control 
the deficit because it ignored spiraling entitlement spending. Another failure 
by Washington to curb the deficit -- this time on the Democrats' watch -- could 
kill the party's credibility on economic policy and unhinge the bond markets, 
where Clinton was counting on support for his plan to produce lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 So Congress won drastic changes in the Clinton plan. His energy tax was 
abandoned in favor of a more modest gasoline tax and deeper cuts in Medicare 
and other entitlement programs. Federal spending would fall sharply, despite 
the potential risks to the nation's economy.  
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, in the second half of 1993, things clearly broke Clinton's way. 
Interest rates fell and the economic recovery finally gained traction. The 
creation of new jobs was running at double the monthly pace in the last year of 
the Bush Administration. Both the CBO and the White House issued more upbeat 
deficit forecasts in early 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 But in February, 1994, as the economy seemed solid and Bill Clinton finally 
felt he could focus on health care and welfare reforms, the Federal Reserve 
Board yanked him back to earth by raising interest rates for the first time in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 For an American President, Clinton was learning, the economy is one headache 
that never seems to go away.

EYE IN THE SKY; TECHNOLOGY: MILITARY SATELLITE NAVIGATION SYSTEM POISED FOR 
COMMERCIAL BOOM. CALIFORNIA COULD WIN BIG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon is awash in obsolete nuclear bombs, mothballed battleships and 
surplus military bases, but out of the scrap heaps left by the Cold War has 
come a technology with a promising payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Defense Department laid plans in the 1970s for its Global Positioning 
System, a network of 24 satellites that broadcasts navigation signals to users 
on Earth, it was intended to help soldiers fight anywhere, from jungles to 
deserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, though, commercial interests saw a potentially lucrative 
concept that could revolutionize industries such as land surveying, trucking, 
environmental protection and farming. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology, now poised to leap into virtually every facet of the American 
economy, is expected to create a $5-billion to $10-billion industry by the end 
of this decade and more than 100,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 With a special receiver that taps the satellite signals, civilian users can 
determine their position by latitude and longitude within 100 meters (328 feet) 
anywhere in the world. Once as big as a file cabinet, the receivers are now the 
size of a paperback book and still shrinking. Consumer models, used by 
wilderness backpackers, cost as little as $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Some visionaries anticipate the day when virtually everything that moves in 
U.S. society -- every shipping container, aircraft, car, truck, train, bus, 
farm tractor and bulldozer -- will contain a microchip that will track and, in 
many cases, report its location. Massive computer systems, they say, will tie 
together the movement of assets in the economy, providing a sophisticated 
information system for the status and location of goods. 
</P>
<P>
 California has quietly come to dominate the new field, much as it did the 
personal computer industry in the early 1980s. A third of the world's GPS 
equipment manufacturers, including the dominant firms in the industry, are in 
California, according to recent industry surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming California can hold its position, it stands to gain a major share of 
the new jobs. And while the state is desperate for growth, the benefits of the 
GPS industry have gone largely unheralded, in part because the defense industry 
bust has overshadowed GPS. 
</P>
<P>
 Such new firms as Magellan Systems in San Dimas, Trimble Navigation and 
Ashtech in Sunnyvale and ESRI in Redlands dominate the commercial business and 
are growing at 20% to 40% annually. Meanwhile, the California operations of 
Rockwell International and Magnavox are top players in the defense market. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government set the stage for this commercial growth merely by 
guaranteeing civilian access. In one of his lesser-known but farsighted 
decisions, President Ronald Reagan decreed in 1983 that the system would be 
free to the public, rejecting bureaucratic calls for a cumbersome toll system. 
</P>
<P>
 The navigation system is among a handful of advanced military technologies -- 
ranging from spy satellites to plastic composite materials -- that hold out 
potential for commercial development. Yet, whereas defense conversion in 
general remains uncertain, GPS is clearly the best example of military 
technology moving from the battlefield to the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communications satellites were the first great success in space, but GPS is 
going to dwarf that," said Albert Wheelon, a former Hughes Aircraft chairman 
and an early pioneer in commercial space. "GPS is going to pervade everything 
we do." 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite navigation system was expected to have civilian applications, 
but the market has turned upward dramatically in the last twoyears as costs 
have declined, according to Stephen Colwell, president of a consulting firm in 
Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
 By later this year, a satellite receiver may be boiled down to just three 
computer chips costing about $100 per set; eventually, the price will drop 
below $50, Colwell said. At that point, GPS would be inserted into a lot of 
other electronic gear, such as cellular telephones that could instantly alert 
police to an individual's location in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a million deals going on," Colwell said. "It is seldom you see a 
new technology coming on so rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, use of the system is expanding quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Computerized maps are being used to track the spread of disease, pollution and 
crime, based on data collected from GPS systems. Hamburger chains pore over 
these kinds of computer-generated maps to determine the best sites for new 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Interstate truckers use the system to keep tabs of their road taxes. 
Commercial fishermen use the system to return to fertile fishing holes. It has 
led to important advances in the study of earthquakes, allowing geologists to 
measure in inches how far temblors move land masses. Cities use the satellite 
system to dispatch emergency vehicles and track the location of passenger 
buses. Railroads are finally able to figure out where their trains are. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every month, every week, there is somebody who comes up with a unique new way 
to use this," said Jules McNeff, the Pentagon's key technical and policy expert 
on GPS. "Its uses will be limited only by people's imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Orbiting 11,000 miles above Earth, the 24 satellites are the heart of the 
system. They constantly broadcast signals that allow a ground receiver to 
calculate its distance from each satellite, based on the precise time it takes 
the signal to travel from space to Earth. Each satellite carries four atomic 
clocks -- so accurate that they lose only one second every 160,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 By capturing signals from at least three satellites, a receiver's software can 
determine which point on Earth is the exact distance from the satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 The military reserves for itself encrypted signals that provide an accuracy of 
10 meters, within about 30 feet. Commercial users get a signal with random 
errors purposely created to reduce the accuracy to 100 meters -- a technique 
intended to deny foreign adversaries use of the system for precision guidance. 
But 100-meter accuracy is just fine for many civil applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The navigation system, for example, is coming to the rescue of motorists who 
get lost. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors was the first Big Three auto maker to introduce a vehicle 
navigation system, which includes a computer-generated voice that tells drivers 
the route to any destination in the United States. Compact discs will contain 
maps of every U.S. city, displayed on a dashboard screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good proportion of our society can't read maps at all, so they have to find 
their way by landmarks and verbal instructions," said Bill Spreitzer, GM's 
technical director for intelligent vehicle systems. "Studies have shown that 
20% of the time, people drive further than they need to." 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan Systems signed a deal last year to supply three Japanese auto makers 
with the electronic guts for a navigation system. The contract is expected to 
double the firm's size in the next few years and create 750 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan has moved to successively larger facilities in Southern California 
three times in the four years since it began producing commercial receivers. 
Sales of the privately held firm this year are expected to top $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Automobile navigation alone will dwarf the military market in size," said 
Magellan President Randy Hoffman. "The commercial uses of GPS will far outstrip 
the military uses." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry will also tap the system to enhance productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts see the day, for example, when a computerized design for a highway 
could be directly fed into earth-moving machinery controlled by the navigation 
system. A receiver on the blade of a plow could be used to precisely grade the 
roadbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of inefficiencies in society, and a lot of them can be 
resolved by answering the question, 'Where is it?' " said Charlie Trimble, 
president of Trimble Navigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility crews, for example, climb up the wrong power pole 10% of the time, a 
mistake that will be eliminated as poles are indexed by GPS location, Trimble 
said. Recently, his firm introduced floating navigation receivers that can be 
dropped on petroleum spills to precisely track the spread of oil contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Trimble Navigation led the GPS market in 1993 with sales of $150 million, 
specializing in highly accurate electronic systems used by land surveyors -- 
devices that have replaced Japanese, German and Swiss optical survey 
instruments, Trimble said. The firm expects sales growth of 50% to 60% 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, software for computerized maps that use GPS data is becoming a huge 
market. Software created by ESRI, for example, is used by oil firms to create 
detailed geologic maps for exploration and by railroads for monitoring track 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1993 sales of $120 million, ESRI holds 70% of the world market for such 
software, known as geographic information systems. The firm's computerized maps 
were widely used to track the incidence of aftershocks following the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the start, we saw that geographic information could link together many 
different functions in our society," said Jack Dangermond, ESRI's president and 
sole owner. "We are just beginning to understand how we can use this." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, airlines can use the system to fly more direct routes and save fuel. 
United Airlines recently estimated that it will save more than $500 million 
annually by relying on satellite navigation in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the Federal Aviation Administration began allowing airlines to 
use GPS to navigate, but the agency will require aircraft to have a backup 
navigation system until 1996, said Dick Arnold, the FAA's director for 
navigation systems.  
</P>
<P>
 Navigation has been a crucial military technology for centuries, making 
possible the spread of early empires, European settlement of the Western 
Hemisphere and sophisticated warfare in the 20th Century. GPS is the ultimate 
extension of that concept. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeff, the Pentagon expert, said the system will eventually be inserted into 
every type of weapon -- jet fighters, missiles, tanks, ships and precision 
ordnance. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the 1991 Persian Gulf War, many military officers did not trust the 
untestedtechnology, but the system was crucial to the U.S. Army's success in 
outflanking Iraqi forces in the barren desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave them the ability to operate in bad weather, at night, coordinate 
movements and deliver weapons through smoke and haze," McNeff said. "Commanders 
couldn't get their hands on them fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Magellan shipped 3,000 of its commercial receivers to U.S. and 
coalition forces that were short of the military versions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell leads the military market. The firm -- with electronics plants in 
Newbury Park and Newport Beach, Texas and Iowa -- plans to build 50,000 
receivers this year and expects sales to grow 25% annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Explosive future growth in GPS applications will result largely from clever 
efforts to enhance the system's basic capability. Commercial users have 
discovered that they can vastly improve accuracy by using ground stations as 
additional reference points to the satellite signal, yielding accuracy of one 
meter and, potentially, a few millimeters. 
</P>
<P>
 Differential Corrections in Cupertino, Calif., is installing ground stations 
for the more accurate systems in 70 U.S. cities and has begun shipments of 
special receivers that customers will need, according to owner Ronald Haley, a 
former Trimble executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher accuracy application -- known as differential GPS -- will allow 
airlines to use the system to perform precision landing approaches in poor 
visibility. The FAA has authorized initial tests of such a system. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping keep track of people is also clearly in the system's future. 
Authorities could follow parolees around with GPS, though one limitation is 
that the system does not work inside buildings or underground. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may someday want to hang one around your kid's neck before he goes off to 
school," said Lanny Ross, president of Rockwell International's 
telecommunications group, a major producer of the systems for both military and 
commercial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although GPS technology used to track individuals may someday raise concerns 
about personal privacy, the issue will be something for future generations to 
ponder, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think somewhere beyond the year 2050, this will be embedded in you and your 
location will be known at all times," Ross suggested. "I can imagine a set of 
social conditions where I would want people to know where I am at all times -- 
if I lived in Colombia or Somalia." Where 911 Meets 2001 
</P>
<P>
 Global Positioning System satellites circling 11,000 miles above the Earth (1) 
broadcast signals to an ambulance, allowing the driver to determine his or her 
location (2). The locations of all ambulances in the system are constantly 
being transmitted to a dispatch center (3). The center routes the closest 
available vehicle to each emergency call and directs the ambulance to the 
appropriate health facility (4). Such systems, developed by Trimble Navigation 
of Sunnyvale, Calif., are in use by fire departments and ambulance services in 
California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The Global Reach of GPS 
</P>
<P>
 * The Global Positioning System already is used for navigation by aircraft, 
boats and motor vehicles. Land surveyors are rapidly trading in their German, 
Swiss and Japanese optical instruments for GPS devices. Truckers use the system 
to tabulate state road taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eventually, experts say, just about everything that moves -- trucks, trains, 
shipping containers, bulldozers, laptop computers -- will contain GPS chips 
tied into massive information systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * The major players in GPS are located in California: Trimble Navigation, 
Magellan Systems, Ashtech, Rockwell International and Magnavox. GPS also is 
fostering growth in related industries, such as the software that generates 
computerized maps -- a market in which ESRI of Redlands is the worldwide 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 * The GPS industry is growing at an estimated 20% to 40% annually and is 
expected to hit $5 billion to $10 billion in sales by the end of the decade, 
creating as many as 100,000 new jobs. Experts say the industry will eclipse 
communications satellites in the commercial use of space. 
</P>
<P>
 * The GPS system, which includes 24 satellites and a ground control center, 
was put in place by the Defense Department. The system provides commercial 
users their position on Earth within 128 feet. Military users get a more 
accurate signal, which is used to guide missiles, navigate aircraft and control 
ground troops.

VIEW FROM WASHINGTON / JAMES RISEN; WHITEWATER AFFAIR RAISES THE SPECTRE OF 
HYPOCRISY FOR CLINTONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since Whitewater became a serious problem for the White House, the 
President and First Lady have claimed not to understand just how and why this 
sordid little affair turned into a full-fledged scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 One big reason, of course, is the still-unanswered question of whether any 
crime was committed. A special prosecutor is investigating that one. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whitewater has also been kept alive as news because it raises the specter 
of political hypocrisy on the part of the Clintons. With each disclosure, it 
becomes more clear that the family's private financial dealings could hardly 
conflict more sharply with the anti-greed, anti-1980s rhetoric of the public 
Bill and Hillary Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Whitewater would not resonate so forcefully if both the Clintons had 
not consistently hammered home the message that the 1980s were a time when dark 
forces of avarice were let loose by the failed policies of Reaganomics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1980s were about acquiring -- acquiring wealth, power, privilege," 
Hillary Rodham Clinton said last year. "The 1980s ushered in a Gilded Age of 
greed and selfishness, of irresponsibility and excess and of neglect," added 
her husband. Candidate Bill Clinton frequently criticized the hollow "paper" 
economy of leveraged buyouts and Wall Street deal-making. He said he wanted to 
put America on track for more legitimate, sustainable economic growth.  
</P>
<P>
 If there was one theme that ran through many of the Clintons' past personal 
investments, it was that they were symptomatic of those times the Clintons have 
publicly railed against: They were paper deals, often facilitated by insiders, 
and were based on who the Clintons knew -- not what they knew about personal 
investing: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Clintons got started in the Whitewater real estate deal through James 
McDougal, a friend and onetime aide to Bill Clinton when he was Arkansas 
governor. Whitewater was a 50-50 joint venture between the Clintons and Jim and 
Susan McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Bill Clinton was just beginning his rapid ascent in politics -- before 
he and Hillary had much money -- the Clintons were able to finance their 
ambitious Ozark Mountains resort project by taking out loans of more than 
$200,000 from a small Arkansas bank with no collateral. Their signatures 
sufficed.  
</P>
<P>
 * Later, when Hillary Clinton wanted to pay off a $30,000 Whitewater loan from 
a McDougal-controlled bank, she turned to a tiny bank on the other side of 
Arkansas that was owned by the state banking commissioner her husband had 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons and McDougals proved to be rather hard-hearted landlords. More 
than half the buyers of Whitewater lots lost their land back to the company 
after the Clintons and McDougals foreclosed because of missed payments, the 
Washington Post reported recently. 
</P>
<P>
 They included Clyde Soapes Jr., a Texas grain elevator operator who hoped to 
build a cottage at Whitewater but lost his land when he became critically ill 
with diabetes -- even though he had already made 35 payments, covering most of 
the purchase price, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was perfectly legal, Whitewater was adhering to a sharp business 
policy the locals call "poor man's real estate financing." In return for 
receiving loose approval terms for their land purchases, buyers did not receive 
deeds to their lots until their final payments were made. That allowed the 
Clintons and McDougals to sell several pieces of land more than once.  
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater was just one of a dizzying array of investments and private deals 
in which the Clintons became involved. Unlike the typical upper-middle-class 
couple, they developed a penchant for exotic investments they heard about 
through their influential friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton's commodities trading is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 She quickly turned $1,000 into nearly $100,000 in the highly volatile cattle 
futures market, guided in her trades by James Blair, general counsel for Tyson 
Foods, a giant, state-regulated poultry producer. What's more, Mrs. Clinton's 
first commodities broker allegedly allocated winning trades to favored clients 
during the time she was investing through him. In a legalistic response to 
questions about whether she gained from such allocations, she has said there is 
"no evidence" that she received preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton invested again in commodities futures in 1979 and 1980, got 
into a Colorado oil drilling partnership as a tax shelter, invested in a South 
African diamond mine while apartheid was still in full force, and set up a 
small investing partnership of colleagues at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock 
-- with Vincent Foster Jr. and Webster Hubbell, who both came to Washington to 
work in the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 She also joined a limited partnership -- made up of partners in her law firm 
-- that took advantage of the tax laws to turn the firm's building into a tax 
shelter. And, while she has said she found commodities trading so stressful 
that she pulled out for good in 1980, income tax records show that in 1987, she 
was trading as much as $150,000 in a single day in stock index futures. 
</P>
<P>
 Money magazine, taking the Clintons to task for Whitewater and Hillary's 
commodities trading, says in its May issue that the Clintons' "principal 
investments in the late 1970s were in real estate development and in the 
under-regulated commodity markets -- investments of the 
it's-not-what-you-know-but-who-you-know variety." The magazine warned readers 
against trying to follow the Clintons' lead: "Unless you are a governor's wife, 
stick with bonds or the stocks of growing enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
 One result of the revelations about the Clintons' finances may be that they 
will find it harder to attack the rich and the business community for opposing 
higher taxes or health care reform. In fact, Mrs. Clinton already seems to have 
been put on the defensive. In her remarkable April 22 news conference on 
Whitewater, she said she and her husband had never attacked the idea of making 
money per se. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I don't think you'll ever find anything that my husband or I said 
that in any way condemns the importance of making good investments and saving, 
or that in any way undermines what is the heart and soul of the American 
economy -- which is risk taking and investing in the future," she told 
reporters. "What I think we were saying is that, like anything else, that can 
be taken to excess." 
</P>
<P>
 The political problem she and the President are facing is this: Excess is in 
the eye of the beholder.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: SMALL CLAIMS OFTEN IS THE REAL 'PEOPLE'S 
COURT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you have a sticky dispute that involves a relatively small amount of money, 
small claims court is a fast and efficient way to settle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most cases are decided within three months, experts note. And most 
litigants emerge satisfied -- regardless of whether they win or lose. A survey 
conducted by the National Center for State Courts found that more than 
three-quarters of the small claims litigants felt the process was fair. And 61% 
were satisfied with the court's decision, even though 50% of those surveyed had 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small claims court is a miracle -- it works," says Ralph Warner, author of 
"Everybody's Guide to Small Claims Court" and publisher of Nolo Press in 
Oakland. "It is the only window in the court system where the average person 
can get access and justice." 
</P>
<P>
 What is small claims court and what makes it so appealing? 
</P>
<P>
 Small claims courts are usually divisions of state or municipal court systems 
that agree to hear fairly small financial disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Common types of cases heard in these courts include disputes between landlords 
and tenants over security deposits and customers' disputes with dry cleaners, 
car mechanics and appliance repair people. 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum size of small claims actions is determined by both states and 
counties. In California, you can sue for as much as $5,000; elsewhere, limits 
range from $1,000 to $15,000. The appeal of these courts boils down to three 
things: They're swift, inexpensive and fairly simple. 
</P>
<P>
 In most states, small claims cases are heard within two months after papers 
are filed. In other civil courts, you may have to wait between two and four 
years to have your case heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs can file their cases on their own, without the help of an attorney. 
Court costs boil down to filing fees that generally range between $5 and $20. 
</P>
<P>
 If you need help filing, some courts -- such as those operating in California 
-- offer small claims advisers who can assist you with the paperwork and give 
tips on what information and documentation you should have when you go to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little ceremony involved in these cases once they're heard. 
Individuals simply stand at opposing podiums in front of a judge, state what 
happened and how much money they believe is owed them -- or why they think 
they're not obligated to pay. A judgment is usually rendered on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the very swiftness that makes this process appealing also creates risks 
for those who are unprepared in court. You are expected to appear with all the 
information and documentation -- receipts, invoices, photographs, etc. -- 
necessary to prove your case. If you don't, you're likely to lose. And in many 
states, your ability to appeal a small claims judgment is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody says you owe them money and you don't bring in the canceled 
checks that prove you've paid it, you're going to lose," says John A. Goerdt, 
senior staff attorney with the National Center for State Courts in 
Williamsburg, Va. Small Claims Tips 
</P>
<P>
 What are the rules in California's small claims courts? Here are some key 
points excerpted from "Everybody's Guide to Small Claims Court" by Ralph Warner 
of Nolo Press: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dollar limit: $5,000, and a plaintiff cannot file claims of more than $2,500 
more than twice a year; $1,500 limit for suits involving surety companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Attorneys: Not allowed, except when representing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appeals: Allowed for defendant (or plaintiff who loses a counterclaim) 
within 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Note: Interpreters and small claims advisers may be available.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: FILING BY COMPUTER SPEEDS REFUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I am waiting for my tax refund from the government. Is there any way to 
know how long it will take the Internal Revenue Service to process my return 
and mail my check? A.N.R . 
</P>
<P>
 A. In general, you can expect to wait up to eight weeks after filing to 
receive your refund. (Three weeks is average if you filed your return 
electronically.) 
</P>
<P>
 You can find out if the IRS has received your return and where it is in the 
review process by calling the agency's toll-free, touch-tone number: (800) 
829-4477. 
</P>
<P>
 Have a copy of your return on hand. You will be asked to punch in your Social 
Security number as well as the exact amount of the refund you believe is owed 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 You may wonder why you get your refund faster if you file electronically. The 
answer is that electronic returns -- that is, returns filed via computer and 
modem -- are easier for the IRS to process, so the agency is trying to 
encourage this new form of transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 You should know, however, that the IRS does not provide the personal computer 
software needed to generate these forms, but has allowed a handful of private 
companies to advertise their products as "IRS accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 The programs are sold in software stores for about $30 to $100. All of them 
generate the special forms taxpayers most often need, in addition to the 
standard Form 1040. 
</P>
<P>
 Also be aware that only accountants and tax preparers with the special filing 
software can file your return electronically. So you can expect to have to pay 
a professional $25 to $35 to file the return you prepared on your personal 
computer in order to get a quicker refund. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do your own taxes, you may decide you are better off pocketing this 
money and waiting the extra month or so for the refund. But if you want that 
money right now, electronic filing may be just the thing for you. 
</P>
<P>
 For further information about Form 1040PC filings, taxpayers can call the IRS 
at (800) 829-4477. The code for an audio explanation of 1040PC is 106; the code 
for information on electronic filing is 112. For written information, call 
(800) 829-3676 and ask for Publication 1673. Law Requires Prompt Posting on 
Pensions 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I recently learned that my company has been delaying the recording of my 
contributions to my 401(k) plan. What is the law? Is there any way I can file a 
complaint about how my employer is handling these accounts? -- T.G . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Section 2510.3-102 of the Department of Labor regulations requires 
employers to credit employee contributions to pension plans on the "earliest 
day" those deductions can be "reasonably segregated from the employer's general 
assets." 
</P>
<P>
 The regulation further stipulates that this period must not exceed 90 days 
from the time the money is withheld from the employee's paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the intent of the regulation is to ensure that employees are 
credited as soon as possible with any interest their pension contributions 
earn, and to keep employers from taking unfair advantage of their employees by 
keeping a portion of those interest-earning contributions for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers who suspect that their 401(k) or other pension accounts are being 
mishandled by their employers should complain directly to the Department of 
Labor's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, workers can write to David Ganz, area director of the 
Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, 790 E. Colorado Blvd., Suite 514, 
Pasadena, CA 91101. 
</P>
<P>
 Be advised: This office is set up to investigate only potential abuses. It 
cannot handle benefits disputes or other pension issues. Luck Can Trap One in a 
High Bracket 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I cannot believe what my accountant made me do. Because of a onetime fluke 
-- my wife and I won $171,000 in a contest -- our combined income for 1993 was 
over $200,000. I paid estimated taxes on the winnings, but my accountant told 
us that we lost some of our mortgage interest deductions as well as our 
personal exemptions. The result is a total state and federal tax bill of 
$74,000! I can't believe that because of a once-in-a-lifetime win, I am 
suddenly lumped in the same tax bracket as the truly rich. Do I have any 
recourse? -- R.S . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Realistically speaking, no. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new tax law, married taxpayers filing jointly with an adjusted gross 
income of more than $108,450 lose 3% of most of their itemized deductions on 
the amount exceeding that limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, you can give up 80% of your itemized deductions affected by the 
limits. These include state and local taxes, mortgage interest, charitable 
gifts, moving expenses and miscellaneous deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, married taxpayers filing jointly with an adjusted gross income 
of more than $162,700 lose 2% of their personal exemption deductions for every 
$2,500 their adjusted gross income exceeds that limit. The deduction is wiped 
out if your income exceeds $285,200. You have no legal recourse.

 NOTE: A recent column on reporting stock sales to the IRS may have confused 
some readers. Let me elaborate. Most 1099 forms are not filed with a tax return 
and should be kept with a taxpayer's records. These include forms 1099-B, 
1099DIV, 1099-G, 1099-INT, 1099-MISC and 1099-OID. However, where income tax 
has been withheld from the payment and the taxpayer receives a 1099-R form, it 
must be filed with the tax return.

BRIEFCASE: RETAIL AND RESTAURANTS; IT WAS AN UP AND DOWN WEEK FOR CARL KARCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Greg Johnson, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For burger baron Carl N. Karcher, the past week was bittersweet. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Karcher was in New York to celebrate Carl Karcher Enterprises' 
switch to the New York Stock Exchange from the Nasdaq market. "It was a 
historical moment for me," said Karcher, founder of the Carl's Jr. fast-food 
chain. "And to think, we bought the first hot-dog cart just about 50 years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher had breakfast on Monday with NYSE Chairman William Donaldson and then 
purchased the first 100 shares of Karcher Enterprises shares to trade on the 
exchange. Karcher Enterprises' shares are now trading under the symbol CKR. The 
stock had traded as CARL on Nasdaq. Though Karcher Enterprises shares fell by 
12.5 cents on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 54 points. "We 
brought up the whole market," Karcher said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher returned to Anaheim Tuesday, and on Wednesday he attended funeral 
services for former President Richard Nixon in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl and his wife, Margaret, met Richard and Pat Nixon during the 1940s, when 
Nixon was campaigning for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Karcher, 
who was establishing himself as a restaurateur, knew the Nixon family as the 
owners of restaurants in Whittier and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "His brother, Don, ran (the Whittier restaurant) and their mother worked 
there," Karcher said of Nixon. "We went there to eat several times. It was a 
family-type restaurant with good food." 
</P>
<P>
 The Karcher and Nixon families' mutual interests extended to politics. "I 
always admired him for the fact that he took a strong position against 
communism," Karcher said. "It's amazing what's happened in the world from back 
then to now." 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher occasionally visited with the Nixons at their "Western White House" in 
San Clemente. Once, Karcher brought along two priests from Orange County who 
gave Nixon some artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was time to leave, the priests put on their coats -- which were 
adorned with "I Voted for Nixon" buttons. "The President, he loved that," 
Karcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher last saw the former President at the Nixon Library on Jan. 20 during a 
25th anniversary celebration of Nixon's presidential inauguration. "I had my 
picture taken with him, and he autographed some things," Karcher said. "And he 
said, as he always did, to keep the flag (at Carl Karcher Enterprises' Anaheim 
headquarters) flying."

 El Pollo Loco acts: Ray Perry, chief operating officer of Irvine-based El 
Pollo Loco, thinks his restaurant chain will benefit from parent corporation 
Flagstar Cos. Inc.'s decision to sell its Canteen food and vending operations 
to Compass Group PLC. The sale, announced on Wednesday, "will allow Flagstar to 
reduce its debt and provide capital for growth, be it new restaurant growth or 
remodeling of restaurants," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry is betting that some of the additional capital to be available at 
Spartanburg, S.C.-based Flagstar will flow through to El Pollo Loco. "Flagstar 
was never comfortable with the contract feeding and vending side of the 
business," Perry said. "The company has good leaders on the restaurant side, 
and this will let them concentrate on what they're best at."

 Here's to Mom: Mervyn's and the Salvation Army will celebrate Mother's Day by 
giving 30 deserving mothers in Orange County $100 each to spend on a Mervyn's 
shopping spree. 
</P>
<P>
 "These moms really represent the true meaning of Mother's Day," said Dolores 
Barrett, director of social services for the Salvation Army in Santa Ana. "All 
. . . were selected because of their dedication to their families' well-being 
and their commitment to improving their lives, despite difficult 
circumstances."

 System Controls Inc.: The Anaheim manufacturer of electronic energy-management 
systems posted a profit of $370,378, or 9 cents a share, for its latest 
quarter.That contrasted with earnings of $84,274, or 3 cents a share, for the 
period a year earlier. Revenue for the third quarter, which ended March 31, 
more than doubled to $1.6 million from $592,079. The company attributed the

$706,888, or 17 cents a share, from $119,223, or 4 cents a share, for the

 SUPERMARKET SWEEPS: Legal secretary Elizabeth Anderson of Orange was grocery 
shopping with her twins when another shopper cooed that they were adorable. The 
woman insisted Anderson call the agent for her own twins. Result: The Anderson 
twins, Katie and Leslie, now 3, both appear as the AIDS child in tonight's 
Hallmark Hall of Fame "A Place for Annie," (Channel 7 at 9) about an AIDS baby. 
. . . It was filmed when they were 2. The agent, Marlene Peroutka, calls it "a 
real tear-jerker."

 HAVE A FREE RIDE: Every month is national something, and today brings National 
Bicycle Safety Month. Cmdr. Michael Blair of the local California Highway 
Patrol office says both youngsters and adults should ride with helmets. He's 
got the stats to back up his concern: 130 bicycle fatalities in the state last 
year, and 13,600 injuries. . . . "These are far too many victims for an 
activity that adults associate with health and fitness, and children consider 
fun and safe," Blair says.

 ADD PEP: There's a reason Sunshine Morrow, 19, had to work twice as hard to 
make Golden West College's pep squad for football and basketball games -- she 
cannot hear, which means extra effort picking up the music cues. "It's 
important to let people know that deaf people can do anything," she says. . . . 
Actually, all who made the squad are lucky. Next year's squad was axed in a 
budget crunch. But after hearing some disappointment, President Philip Westin 
vows he'll find the money somewhere to keep it going.

 DOWN THE ROAD: Daihatsu America in Los Alamitos wants you to know more about 
Japan than just its cars. The Japanese-based truck importer on Monday will 
donate 50 two-volume sets of "Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia" to schools in 
Brea and Los Alamitos, for use in world culture and Japanese language programs. 
. . . They're much needed, says Masako White, who teaches Japanese at Brea 
Olinda High School: "It is difficult for my students to find research materials 
on Japan."

SUPPORTERS SERVE TO PROTECT THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENT; PORT HUENEME: A BARBECUE 
BENEFITS CAMPAIGN FOR TAX MEASURE TO PAY FOR AN INDEPENDENT FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Port Hueneme residents peddled hot dogs and potato salad Saturday afternoon as 
part of a grass-roots effort to save the city's financially strapped Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 While police officers and locals gobbled hamburgers and baked beans, 
organizers netted about $350 to add to the $15,000 campaign purse to support a 
June ballot measure that would raise taxes to keep the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the food we're here for," homeowner Rick Boscarino said while 
devouring a burger at the Veterans of Foreign Wars post. "We don't want to lose 
our Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 If two-thirds of the city's voters approve the $500,000 property-tax measure, 
homeowners would pay an extra $56 a year in property taxes, apartment owners 
$47 per unit and commercial property owners 2.5 cents per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Boscarino, who owns two condominiums in Port Hueneme, said he would gladly 
accept a tax increase to keep local policing.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely worth it," he said. "There's too much crime." 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure fails, Port Hueneme could be forced to contract with the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department or Oxnard police, said Mayor Pro Tem Jim 
Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably won't have any choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the Oxnard Police Department offered to help the financially 
burdened city by hiring most of its officers and providing law enforcement for 
the Port Hueneme area. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents fear that an outside department can't provide the same services 
their 19-member law enforcement agency does. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the tax measure say Port Hueneme officers are quick to respond 
to medical emergencies and are familiar with the people in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing against the county, but they can't cover (the community) the same 
way," said resident Jim Taylor.  
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Klopfstein, who was raised in Port Hueneme, said she's fighting to save 
the department after officers helped save her husband's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband at 43 had a heart attack," she said. "It was massive. My first 
response was from Hueneme police. He absolutely would not be alive right now if 
it weren't for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme ran into financial troubles when the state began squeezing tax 
dollars from counties and cities, Daniels said. Over the past two years, the 
city has been forced to lay off a dozen employees and close its cultural center 
due to budget cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is strapped for money, so they steal from the cities and counties, 
and we have to scramble," said Sgt. Ted Snyder, one of many local officers 
attending the barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said he was grateful to the citizens for pulling together to try to 
save the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really gratifying that they support the work we've been putting in," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hueneme Police Chief John Hopkins agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people came on right away, as soon as there was a threat of leaving," 
he said. "It's been incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the tax measure hope to raise about $20,000 for posters, 
mailers, T-shirts, postage and other advertising costs associated with their 
election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, organizers plan to mail about 5,000 flyers to Port Hueneme 
residents urging their support. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to convince two out of every three voters that it is in their 
interest to have a local police department," City Manager John R. (Dick) 
Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who came to Saturday's barbecue were optimistic that they can rally 
enough backing to pass the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen any letter yet that's been against it," Daniels said. "We have 
one of the best police departments there is."

DOUBLE VISION; EL RIO AS UTOPIA OR A COMMUNITY BESIEGED BY DECAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Traffic on the Ventura Freeway whips past Louie Rocha's El Rio home at 
afrantic pace, creating a constant roar that pierces the thick cinder-block 
walls. Yet he tunes out the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 To Rocha, his house in this tiny community is still the peaceful haven he 
built for his family 49 years ago. He insists the water from neighborhood wells 
is still pure, despite occasional warnings to the contrary from health 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 He says El Rio's streets are still safe, though members of one of the county's 
most active gangs patrol the neighborhood at night with their guns and spray 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
 While the signs of decay have besieged the area, it is still seen by Rocha and 
many others here as an everyman's Utopia -- a place where a plot of ground can 
be turned into a dream built of clapboard and stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got out of the service, I just wanted a piece of land to call my own," 
said Rocha, 71, who bought a half-acre on Cortez Street for $4,700 in 1945. "My 
wife and I raised seven kids here. They all turned out good. I attribute that 
to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 El Rio boosts a population of 6,419 -- with Latinos accounting for 64.3% and 
whites making up 30.8% -- on fewer than 10 square blocks wedged between 
Vineyard and Rose avenues, north of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Once considered a country haven, the community is now nearly surrounded by 
commercial development. Half of El Rio lies in the shadow of the Ventura 
Freeway while the eastern portion borders Oxnard's new auto mall. 
</P>
<P>
 But some symbols of urbanization are nonexistent here. There is no sewer 
system; residents depend on septic tanks as they have for decades. There are no 
fancy restaurants and grocery stores, only modest markets and hamburger and 
taco stands along a small commercial strip. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no sidewalks or street lights -- residents would rather muddle 
through in darkness than pay for such a luxury, which many people cannot 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 1990 U. S. Census, the median income per household is $35,991 
-- nearly $10,000 below the county's median. Also, 12.4% of El Rio's population 
lives below the poverty level, almost double the county's rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all the problems in this little community, many parents who have spent 
their lives here hope their children and grandchildren will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the residences may be weather-beaten and cracked, they are passed 
from one generation to the next. The census found extraordinary stability in El 
Rio. Sixty-one percent of the current population lived in the same residence in 
1985, far higher than the county's rate of 45%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my turn now to raise my children here," said Rebecca Dominguez, whose 
grandfather moved to El Rio in 1910. "I hope to have my grandchildren here. We 
have a closeness in this community I don't believe exists in city life. We all 
have something to be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 The community was founded in the late 1800s by Simon Cohn, a merchant who set 
up a general store where the Ventura Freeway's northbound exit ramp at Vineyard 
Avenue is now situated. Originally, the community was called New Jerusalem 
because of Cohn's Jewish heritage, but it was later renamed El Rio because of 
its proximity to the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 Once flush with fields of lima beans and sugar beets, the area eventually gave 
way to development, with early settlers carving out large plots to raise 
chickens and grow vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, there was a push for independence that, even today, drives the 
area's politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be left alone," said Rocha, El Rio's rebel rouser and unofficial 
mayor. "We don't have street sweepers and all that other stuff, and we don't 
want them. If we want the streets clean, the old ladies and the old men get out 
with their push-brooms and clean our streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we can get along without all those city conveniences because we can 
do it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 While other unincorporated areas of the county turned to nearby cities to 
supply their water and educate their children, El Rio went its own way. 
</P>
<P>
 El Rio may not have sidewalks, but it has its own water companies, six of 
them, in fact. And while the community finds it too expensive to pay for 
sewers, it has its own school district, which operates four elementary schools 
and a junior high in El Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever rumors arise that Oxnard might annex the tiny community, residents 
pepper county officials with petitions to fight the move, saying the city would 
only raise their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People figure that it has been working fine with the way it is, so why not 
just stick with it," said Ernest J. Almanza, 58, who has served on El Rio's 
school board for nearly 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are other quirky things about El Rio. Within the core of the 
community, more than a dozen churches beckon the faithful, though some of the 
structures are now vacant because of a lack of worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although cable television was hooked up in El Rio years ago, giant television 
antennas still tower over rooftops, standing by just in case modern technology 
fails. 
</P>
<P>
 On the street corners, residents set up makeshift fruit stands: Four avocados 
for a dollar, two persimmons for 25 cents. In the mornings, residents awaken to 
sounds of crowing roosters and freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Dominguez could afford to move elsewhere with her three children, ages 
10, 13 and 15. At age 38, she has a good job as a paralegal in Ventura. Yet she 
prefers to remain in El Rio, living just blocks away from the house where she 
grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is so tightknit," Dominguez said. "Even if you are not related, 
you feel like you are related. The old ones pass on and the second or third 
generation comes in. No one misses a step. It just goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger McDonald, pastor of the First Baptist Church of El Rio, moved to the 
area five years ago, impressed by the community's spirit. These days, however, 
McDonald says he is bothered by El Rio's tendency to fight progress. 
</P>

 "People resist becoming a part of Oxnard and I see that as being a bad thing 
for us," McDonald said. "It makes us look like a poor community. I don't like 
the fact that we are considered 'Little El Rio' over here. I would much rather 
be considered North Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 Another troubling aspect of life in El Rio, residents say, is gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, members of El Rio's gang gather at a boarded-up house on Balboa 
Street. Their activities have become so notorious that residents have nicknamed 
the avenue "Trouble Street." Weekend shootings and stabbings are common. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, sheriff's deputies said they were called to Balboa Street to break 
up a fight. They found one of the local gang members stabbed in the chest but 
not mortally wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman, who asked not to be named, said she avoids going out after dark 
because she is afraid of the young thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared," said the woman, a resident of Balboa Street. "After the sun goes 
down, I don't go out for any reason. They just come here to do trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten days ago, a gang from La Colonia (in Oxnard) came over to fight. I heard 
17 gunshots. Aye, ye, ye. Too much trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Thomas, 82, has lived in El Rio for more than 20 years. Now she wishes 
she could move and leave behind the noise and the local ruffians. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many problems here," she said. "The neighborhood is not what it 
used to be . . . I made a mistake not to get away." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn, who represents the area, says he is trying to take 
steps to help clean up the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Using money raised from Proposition 172, the half-cent sales tax initiative 
approved by voters in November, the Sheriff's Department recently stepped up 
its night patrol of the area. Flynn also said he has plans under way to set up 
a storefront substation on Cortez Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Flynn has started an effort to raise money to build a gym and activity 
center for area youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to paint it as a crime area," Flynn said. "But the youth need a 
lot of attention. They have not had a lot of supervised activities. We want to 
get them more involved in healthier activities. We think we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet gangs are only one of El Rio's woes. 
</P>
<P>
 During the worst of the drought, nitrate levels in the community's water 
supply have exceeded normal limits, prompting state health inspectors to force 
residents to drink bottled water until the water became safe again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell Preston, manager of the county's water resources department, said he 
believes it is just a matter of time before nitrate levels become so high that 
El Rio must permanently shut down its neighborhood wells. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has their own little well and their own little water company," 
Preston said. "They have their own ideas about the way things should be done 
and they want their independence. Maybe they are a little shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now they have plenty of water in their wells because its raining. But 
that's not going to always be the case. They don't want to join Oxnard, but 
they might not have any choice when their wells run dry." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha becomes angry when he hears outsiders talk about El Rio's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we go again," Rocha said. "Our water is so good, I can drink it day and 
night and it's perfect. You go to Oxnard and the water is lousy. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for the gangs, we used to have problems here. But we quieted those kids up 
long, long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful to live in El Rio. . . . It's so peaceful here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ida Grajeda, 83, who has lived across the street from Rocha since 1947, knows 
the community has its problems. But, because of her age, she said it's easy for 
her to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I go somewhere else, I won't know who my neighbors are," she said. "I've 
got good neighbors here." El Rio at a Glance

VOTE FOR NEW BANDSTAND IN PARK IS MUSIC TO HER EARS; OJAI: MOVE TO REPLACE 
GAZEBO IS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR SARA BEEBY. SHE STILL MUST RAISE $50,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since her visit to the quaint Cape Cod town of Chatham, Mass., four years ago, 
Sara Beeby has dreamed of bringing the ambience of Chatham's summer evening 
concerts to Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 She formed the Ojai Band in 1991 and has campaigned ever since for a large 
bandstand in Libbey Park to replace the small gazebo, where the band has played 
in cramped quarters for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after months of haggling with the Ojai City Council, Beeby has permission 
to build her dream. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city leaders have complained that the new bandstand will be only the 
latest man-made structure in the small downtown park, consuming yet another 
chunk of its ever-dwindling green space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you can end up with all building and very little park," City 
Councilman James Loebl said in a recent interview.  
</P>
<P>
 Beeby said the new 593-square-foot bandstand will be tasteful and will 
complement the city's rustic atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be very quiet, and very well done, and very Ojai," she said. 
"It will be artistically and aesthetically a source of pride for our 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The bandstand, which was narrowly approved by the council last week, will 
become the most recent in a series of new structures built in the 13-acre park. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid controversy in 1991, the city allowed an 800-square-foot wooden 
multipurpose building to be built near the park's tennis courts to serve as an 
administration center for the Ojai Valley Tennis Tournament and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, council members authorized a new and larger children's playground 
to be built near the park's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern over Libbey Park's diminishing green space led the City Council to 
update the park's master plan in 1992, City Manager Andrew Belknap said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The multipurpose building was the genesis," he said. "About that time, the 
city was wondering if it wasn't appropriate to update it, try to strike a 
balance between all the competing uses." 
</P>
<P>
 It was at that time that Beeby started rallying for a new bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be a compromise," she said. "All green space wouldn't attract 
people. I do think there should be a limit, but keeping attractive things in 
the park draws people." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steve Olsen agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the need to keep open space in Libbey Park," he said. "But I 
think we should use the park to accommodate the people of Ojai." 
</P>
<P>
 And the band has been popular among Ojai residents, who have packed the park 
by the hundreds during the summer for the free Wednesday night concerts, 
spreading their blankets and lawn chairs under the sprawling oak trees to hear 
Sousa marches and Glenn Miller favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the new bandstand say the Ojai Band could just as easily play in 
the nearby Libbey Bowl, home of the Ojai Music Festival and Bowlful of Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beeby said the bowl is unsuitable for the 32-member musical group. "A band 
of our sort just fits in a bandstand. It's a coziness. Children can dance and 
feel very close to the musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Loebl remains unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it gives many people pleasure and is a fine thing for the community, 
(the bandstand) is not desirable or necessary," he said during Tuesday's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Beeby still needs to raise about $50,000 to build the bandstand, and is 
negotiating with a local service group for the funding, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes to have the new facility constructed by this summer, but said it is 
unlikely that it will be completed by the band's first concert July 6.

ONCE QUIET EDUCATION ELECTION IS NOW A RACE; SCHOOLS: COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT 
OCCUPIES A NONPARTISAN OFFICE, BUT THIS YEAR'S CONTEST, UNLIKE PAST YEARS, IS 
DEVELOPING POLITICAL OVERTONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until six weeks ago, the June 7 election for the Ventura County superintendent 
of schools was shaping up to be the same as every other race for the job over 
the past 50 years: uncontested and mostly unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Charles Weis began months ago to gather signatures and garner 
contributions for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one was running against him and it appeared Weis, who was appointed to 
the job last year, would win the election without a contest, just as his 
predecessors have done since at least the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on the last possible date for candidates to file, Dan Flynn, principal 
of the county's schools for juvenile offenders, decided to run for his boss's 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the election for county superintendent is turning into a high-profile 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The county superintendent's office, an arm of the state Department of 
Education, provides advice, equipment and instructional materials to teachers 
and administrators in the county's 20 local school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The county superintendent also directly runs 13 schools for special education 
students and youths who are in trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a nonpartisan office and, supposedly, a nonpartisan election. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn is a registered Republican, Weis a registered Democrat, and the race 
is developing political overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn has attracted the support of some of the county's Republican leaders: 
Rep. Elton Gallegly and state Sen. Cathie Wright, both of Simi Valley, and 
Assemblyman Nao Takasugi of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn spoke recently at a Republican women's forum and is scheduled to appear 
at the next meeting of the local branch of the Christian Coalition, an 
organization run by televangelist Pat Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 And many of his proposals are aligned with conservative causes. 
</P>
<P>
 He agrees with conservative groups who have called for an immediate halt to 
the new California Learning Assessment System exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he opposed last year's Proposition 174 school-voucher initiative as 
fiscally unfeasible, Flynn said he favors some sort of tuition tax credits to 
families with children in private school. He sends four of his six young 
children to a private parochial school in Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 And he echoes conservatives who criticize the public education system for 
putting too much money into administration and too little into classrooms. 
Flynn said that if elected he will ask the county school board for a 15% cut in 
the superintendent's $112,000 annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The position does not warrant that salary, period," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he would not spare cuts elsewhere in the county superintendent's 
380-employee office. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn would slash the office's $28.5-million annual budget by one-quarter, 
eliminating staff members in departments that serve local school districts and 
replacing them with contracted independent consultants. Also, Flynn said he 
could save by having some of the county's larger school districts provide 
services to small school districts that now come from the county 
superintendent's office. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal, Flynn said, is to funnel money back into the classroom, though Weis 
said any savings from the county superintendent's office would go back to the 
state for dispersal among all of California's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old Flynn downplays his Republican ties, pointing out that he 
served as an aide to his brother, a former Democratic state legislator in New 
Jersey, and that he was himself a registered Democrat until a couple of years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his supporters, conservative political consultant Steve Frank, agreed 
that it's not an issue of political partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Weis' values versus the values of Flynn," Frank said. "Flynn is more 
parent- and student-oriented and Weis is more oriented to the department of 
education and their systems." 
</P>
<P>
 The support for Flynn is a measure of "the frustration of the community with 
the education system," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn and Weis have both spent most of their careers in the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn and his supporters emphasize that most of Flynn's 17 years in public 
education have been spent as a classroom teacher or principal, while Weis has 
worked mainly as an administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck has been a career administrator," Flynn said. "I've been in a classroom 
and on-site." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn began as a teacher in New Jersey in 1974. He moved to the Conejo Valley 
in 1981 when he took a teaching position with the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education, where he worked in various jobs until he became principal of Ventura 
County's schools for juvenile offenders in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has won praise for his performance as principal. 
</P>
<P>
 County school board member Juanita Sanchez-Valdez said she is not endorsing 
anyone in the race, but is impressed by some of the programs Flynn has launched 
for the troubled youths under his tutelage. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn started a science fair at his schools because students in the juvenile 
court system are not allowed to participate in the county science fair. And he 
also reorganized schedules at the schools to give the students less independent 
study time and more hours under the guidance of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had this affinity to deal with the downtrodden and the underdog," 
Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Flynn, Weis has never worked as a classroom teacher, except as an 
undergraduate teaching assistant while he was at UCLA. He served four years in 
the late 1980s as a principal of two schools in the Fillmore Unified School 
District, but spent the other 16 years of his career as either an administrator 
or educational consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 He left Fillmore in 1990 when county Supt. James F. Cowan appointed Weis as 
his assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not only the 43-year-old Weis' lack of teaching experience that 
leads to criticism that he is a bureaucrat out of touch with children and 
parents. It's also the way Weis became county superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three years after Weis joined the county superintendent's office, 
Cowan decided to retire and recommended that the county school board appoint 
Weis to finish the rest of Cowan's term. 
</P>
<P>
 The move ignited a protest from the Latino Coalition for Fair Representation, 
which argued that the board should open the appointment process to allow 
Latinos to apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Weis got the job, the protests focused attention on the historic lack 
of competition for the county superintendent's position. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan held the job for 24 years and ran unopposed in all of his five 
elections. And like Weis, Cowan did not have to run for the job in the first 
place. He was appointed at the recommendation of his predecessor, Dean E. 
Triggs, who resigned in the middle of his term in 1969 because of illness, his 
widow, Jewel Triggs, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggs had held the position for 25 years. And he had always run unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern goes back further. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggs first got the job in 1944 when he was appointed to fill the unexpired 
term of W. C. (Kirk) Cobb, who left office to take a position in Sacramento, 
Jewel Triggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 County election records for prior years were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 But the knowledge that the superintendent's office has not had a contested 
race since at least 1942 has galvanized Flynn and his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hand it off like a baton in a relay race," political consultant Steve 
Frank said. "What I would call them is hand-me-down office-holders." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Weis' supporters said they are glad there is a candidate running against 
him, opening up the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Ruiz, a retired union leader and former Ventura Unified School 
District board member, was spokesman for the Latino coalition that opposed 
Weis' appointment last January. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ruiz said, he is happy there is a contested election. But he supports 
Weis for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck is doing a good job," Ruiz said. "He's visible to us and accessible." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz is a member of the Tri-Counties Labor Council, a coalition of labor 
organizations that has endorsed Weis. The local branch of the California 
Teachers Assn. has also thrown its support behind the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to receiving support from school board members around the county, 
Weis has endorsements from 16 of the county's 19 school district 
superintendents, business leaders, various City Council members such as 
Charlotte Craven of Camarillo, Ventura County Treasurer Hal Pittman and county 
Supervisor Susan K. Lacey. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis said he has not sought partisan support. Lacey, a Democrat, said she was 
unaware of Weis' political affiliation. Rather, she said she has been impressed 
by his accomplishments in education, including helping to launch a county 
commission to coordinate private and public children's services. "He's a team 
player, he has a positive attitude. He looks for ways to solve problems and 
that's what we need." 
</P>
<P>
 She also praised Weis for his leadership in developing Casa Pacifica, the 
Camarillo home for abused and neglected children scheduled to open later this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Weis, he rejects the accusation by Flynn supporters that he is a staid 
bureaucrat who is slavish to the state Department of Education's mandates to 
local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see myself as part of the old guard," he said. "I'm not the typical 
status quo administrator." 
</P>
<P>
 Weis counters that he is adamantly opposed to centralized control of schools 
and firmly favors local governance. 
</P>
<P>
 He supports the concept of the California Learning Assessment System exams, 
but believes counties and local school districts should be responsible for 
administering their own versions of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The state, he said, should get out of the testing business and instead only 
monitor how local school districts assess their students. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Flynn, Weis opposes school vouchers. But he and Flynn differ on their 
proposals for the county superintendent's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis said he believes his salary, which is set by the county school board, 
fairly reflects the position's level of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 And he criticized Flynn's proposal to slash 25% from the office's budget. Such 
a cut would ultimately cost local districts more money than it would save, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any money that the county superintendent's office would save by cutting 
programs would go back to the state, which disperses the funds among 
California's roughly 1,000 school districts, Weis said. 
</P>
<P>
 But local Ventura County school districts would have to foot the bill 
themselves for services such as curriculum support that were no longer offered 
by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 On some issues, however, Weis and Flynn agree. 
</P>
<P>
 They both emphasize school safety, proposing that all local school districts 
form committees of parents, community members and young people to suggest ways, 
such as requiring student uniforms, to boost campus security in their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 And both are risking substantial amounts of their own money to win the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis is pouring in $20,000 of his own money and expects to spend $40,000. 
Flynn is investing $15,000 from his own pockets and his campaign workers say 
they will at least match whatever Weis spends. Profile of Dan Flynn

PANEL WEIGHS CITY RISK IN CO-PRESENTING SHOWS; THOUSAND OAKS: THEATER 
COMMISSIONERS WILL CONSIDER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT'S FINANCIAL ROLE IN WOOING BIG 
NAMES TO CIVIC ARTS PLAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After three decades of perfectly conventional behavior, the city of Thousand 
Oaks may soon leap into show biz. 
</P>
<P>
 The glittery world of Hollywood and Broadway may seem impossibly distant from 
the city bureaucracy's daily routine. After all, how do operatic trills and 
choreographed frills fit in with the mundane chores of paving roads and 
treating sewage? 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Civic Arts Plaza's grand opening just six months away, theater 
boosters think Thousand Oaks is ready for the big time. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's seven theater commissioners will consider Monday whether Thousand 
Oaks should co-present special attractions in the Civic Arts Plaza, from choral 
concerts to dance performances to contemporary plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition involves some financial risk. But proponents, including most 
commissioners and council members, say co-presenting will help the city woo big 
names to the 1,800-seat auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's well worthwhile," theater commissioner Virginia Davis concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 To co-present a show, Thousand Oaks must first negotiate a deal with talent 
promoters, who have talked about bringing in acts such as magician David 
Copperfield's and actor Hal Holbrook's "Mark Twain Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Other possible shows include the Vienna Choir Boys, folk singer Judy Collins 
and the American Indian Dance Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 For any of those gigs, Thousand Oaks would put up one-third to one-half of the 
performance budget, and the promoter would pay the rest. The city's stake would 
consist mainly of in-kind contributions: free use of the auditorium, free use 
of the stage crews, and free advertising in local papers. 
</P>
<P>
 After the performances, the city and promoter would split the box-office 
profits -- or losses. 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The total value of the city's contributions could easily top $10,000 per 
performance. To break even, the city would have to sell about half of the 
auditorium seats at ticket prices ranging from $15 to $30. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagging sales could push the city's theater budget into the red. Hit shows, 
however, could rake in a hefty profit. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, that's an attractive gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not a tremendous risk -- we're basically putting up an empty 
house," said commissioner Harry Selvin, a former actor. "And not only is it a 
low enough risk, we also have an opportunity to get way more revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the potential profits, co-presenting allows the city to "be more 
proactive and really get things going," theater Director Tom Mitze said. 
Instead of operating the theater solely as a rental facility, the city could 
actively recruit top performers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last fall approved the concept of co-presenting, but did not 
review the issue in detail. After Monday's vote, theater commissioners will 
present the council with a formal recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at Monday's meeting, the commissioners will discuss new guidelines to 
evaluate which performers should be allowed to stage shows in the Civic Arts 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed policy calls for theater director Mitze to review all potential 
shows "to ensure the safety of the paying audience and public at large and the 
preservation of property of individuals and the Civic Arts Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's programming committee had originally called for an outright 
ban on rap and heavy metal music, but withdrew the proposal after some rock 'n' 
roll fans complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting a blanket ban, the revised guidelines recommend that each 
performance be considered "on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the auditorium is set up as an elegant concert hall, with carpeted 
aisles and plush seats, several commissioners said they suspect few rock stars 
would be interested in performing there. And they emphasized that they do not 
want to host shows that could draw rowdy, unruly crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we want anything that would need added security," commissioner 
Davis said. "That's not what this facility was built for."

COWBOYS PROVIDE THE SPILLS AND THRILLS

 More than 3,000 people crowded into the rodeo arena at Conejo Valley Days on 
Saturday, where bucking bulls and rope-twirling cowboys brought a true Western 
flavor to the area's annual country-Western festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The rodeo and a morning parade down Thousand Oaks Boulevard highlighted the 
fourth day of the five-day Conejo Valley Days carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 At the rodeo, about 60 professional cowboys took their licks in events such as 
bareback bronc riding, steer wrestling, team roping and bull riding as overflow 
crowds cheered and jeered during every second of every ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in this area love the rodeo because it brings out in them the sense of 
their Western heritage," said Alan Guggenheim, chairman of the rodeo event. 
"These are horse people and ranch people in the Conejo Valley, so they can 
appreciate the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the spectators came dressed in full Western gear, sporting ten-gallon 
hats, boots and blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even knew a lot about rodeos. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real good showing for a rodeo," said Matthew Weeks, 21, of Simi 
Valley. "They've got good animals that know how to buck." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can ride them, then this is a bust," he said, noting that few of the 
riders, ropers and wrestlers were able to gain control of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 In several cases after the chute burst open and the bull stormed into the 
arena, the cowboys were thrown to the ground almost immediately. That might be 
the norm for most rodeos, but some area residents said they had hoped to see 
the rides last a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to see them really ride those bulls," spectator Lisa Thorrilson said. 
"This year they didn't quite live up to how things went last year. It wasn't 
quite as exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 But most on hand left the show smiling, happy to have seen the animals, the 
clowns and a local horseback drill team, the Conejo Riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really is a crowd-pleaser," said Jeff Casey, a member of the Rotary Club 
sponsoring the event. "You could see it just by looking at the kids' faces." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Saturday, hundreds of people lined Thousand Oaks Boulevard under 
overcast skies to watch Conejo Valley Days parade participants march, gallop, 
drive and float their way down Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Onlookers applauded local marching bands, sang along with musical performers 
on floats, and cheered area firefighters who six months ago fought a ferocious 
wildfire just a few miles from the parade route. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not staged, it's not produced and it's a little bit hokey, but it is a 
bunch of people having a whole lot of fun," Thousand Oaks resident Dianna 
Campbell said. "It's nice to have a hometown parade." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, such as longtime Thousand Oaks residents Joe and Lilly Mendolla, the 
parade is a can't-miss event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've sat at the same spot every year since 1968," said Joe Mendolla, who 
this year brought his 2-year-old granddaughter, Megan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love everything about it -- the horses, the floats and seeing all the 
important people," Joe Mendolla said. "This really brings the whole community 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, found the parade a tad mundane. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got parades just like this where I'm from," said Wolfgang Horster of 
Stuttgart, Germany, who was visiting a friend in Thousand Oaks and stopped 
briefly to check out the parade. "You've seen one, you've seen them all." 
</P>
<P>
 But most parade-goers appeared delighted with this year's effort, despite the 
fact that it was slightly smaller than previous years' parades. 
</P>
<P>
 People cheered loudly for a cyclist on an old-fashioned bike, for a cadre of 
Vietnam War veterans and for a man who carefully traversed the parade route 
standing atop two horses that walked side-by-side. 
</P>
<P>
 Other entrants danced to country-Western music on the flatbeds of trucks, 
while local politicians chose the luxury of classic cars to make their way down 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only problem with being in the parade is that you don't get to see it," 
Thousand Oaks Mayor Elois Zeanah said. "But it's such a great day for the city. 
I just love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Days organizers said they hoped the parade would increase 
interest in the carnival, which had faltering attendance its first two nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a key day," said Gary Heathcote, chairman of the Conejo Valley 
Chamber of Commerce, which stages the carnival. "We're looking for the parade 
to bring everyone out so we can make up for the first two days." 
</P>
<P>
 While the attendance numbers from Saturday were not available, the park was 
full and even in the late afternoon cars lined up for about a mile to enter the 
venue at the Moorpark Freeway and Janss Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's attendance figures showed considerable increases from the previous 
two days, with 9,257 people taking in the event. That was up from 7,577 people 
on the third day of the 1993 festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the last day of the festival. Conejo Valley Days Events All events 
held at Conejo Creek Park, Moorpark Freeway and Janss Road, unless otherwise 
noted. Carnival admission is $5 adults, $3 senior citizens and students, $2 
children 6 to 12 and free for children under 6.

 A Ventura man was shot in the foot shortly before 3 a.m. Saturday after 
getting in a fight outside an apartment building at 11 E. Simpson St., Ventura 
police officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Padilla, 38, was fighting with an unidentified man when two other men 
came out of the apartment building, officers said.One of them began shooting at 
Padilla, who suffered a gunshot wound to the foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla fled the area. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour later, Ventura police were notified of a gunshot victim at 
Ventura County Medical Center. Officers interviewed Padilla at the hospital but

<P>
 Authorities are looking for suspects in a drive-by shooting against a Ventura 
medical laboratory, the Ventura Police Department said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen late-shift workers were on duty at the Mayo Medical Laboratory 
in the 1800 block of Palma Drive about 11:45 p.m. Friday, but no one was 
injured when several shots were fired into the rear of the building.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said the shooting was apparently one of a series of similar incidents 
against the company that are under investigation, but the Ventura Police 
Department spokesman would give no further details. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from Mayo Medical Laboratory would not comment on the 
shootings Saturday. SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than one-third of Ventura businesses hired new employees last year, and 
just over a quarter say they intend to make more hires this year, according to 
a survey of local businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 The survey, conducted by the city and released last week, included 76 
businesses of varying size around Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 About two-thirds of the businesses surveyed have been in Ventura for 10 years 
or more. If they had the choice to relocate today, 57% of business owners 
surveyed said they would stay in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 However, nearly one-third of the business owners said they do not find the 
city responsive enough to their problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two percent of respondents told surveyors that if the city wanted to 
improve Ventura's business climate, it needs to work harder at being 
responsive. CONSTANCE SOMMER

BEILENSON RANKS HIGH IN TAX-FUNDED MAIL; POLITICS: WOODLAND HILLS DEMOCRAT 
SPENT $166,439 ON NEWSLETTERS TO CONSTITUENTS IN '93. GOP'S GALLEGLY SPENT 
$100,649. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In contrast to some of his colleagues, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson prides 
himself on refusing to exploit taxpayer-financed newsletters for political 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet last year the Woodland Hills Democrat spent $166,439 on his publicly 
funded mail--and ranked 11th highest in the House on his cost per household. 
This was a marked increase for Beilenson during his first year representing a 
new, politically competitive district. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson employs Craig Miller, his longtime campaign manager, part time on 
his congressional payroll to oversee production and distribution of his 
franked, or publicly funded, mail. This has raised questions about whether the 
mail is being used to bolster the lawmaker's political prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, whose 24th District includes most of Thousand Oaks, wasn't the only 
Ventura County lawmaker who ranked relatively high in mail costs in 1993. Rep. 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who represents the rest of the county, spent 
$100,649 and his cost per address was the 94th highest figure among the 435 
lawmakers in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have consistently stayed well below what has been budgeted by the House," 
said Gallegly, who is also representing a newly drawn district. "I do feel, as 
a representative, you have the responsibility to communicate with the people 
you serve, keeping them up on issues that affect them from a health standpoint, 
education standpoint, tax standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly took some heat in 1992, an election year, for twice sending publicly 
funded mail to residents of his new district--who would cast votes for or 
against him in November of that year--before he began representing them. The 
practice was legal but controversial. Gallegly subsequently vowed not to do it 
again and supported a proposed ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsletters, generally featuring photographs of lawmakers and extolling their 
accomplishments or at least expressing their concerns, are a target of some 
critics of congressional spending and those who see incumbents granting 
themselves electoral advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "House members mailed millions and millions of newsletters, cards and letters 
during 1993, most of it self-promoting propaganda sent to citizens who never 
asked for it," said David Keating, president of the National Taxpayers Union 
Foundation, a nonpartisan, anti-government spending group based in Washington 
that publishes an annual study of mailing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said this characterization does not apply to his mailings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take seriously that part of my job which I think involves educating and 
informing constituents about what's going on in Washington," Beilenson said. 
"The use of the frank is really the only way I have that I can carry out my 
responsibilities of staying in touch with constituents and being accountable to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Each House member is given an annual limit for mail costs based on the number 
of households in his district. This figure is then multiplied by 67 cents per 
address. The totals reflect only postage costs, and do not include salaries for 
aides who write the mailings, purchase and manage constituent mailing lists and 
oversee computer operations, printing and handling. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson was only $1,261 short of his ceiling of $167,700. Gallegly was 
$39,323 under his maximum of $139,972. Unspent funds revert to the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, lawmakers can transfer up to $25,000 from their office 
accounts--which is used to pay salaries and other operational costs--for 
publicly funded mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate has stricter spending limits. In most states, the Senate formula 
caps costs at about 15 cents per address for mass-mailing postage. The National 
Taxpayers Union Foundation found that 297 House members exceeded the 
per-household Senate maximum.  
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who spent nearly 67 cents per address, surpassed the Senate ceiling 
by an estimated $115,927. Gallegly, who spent 48 cents per household, topped it 
by about $58,507. 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost for all House members was nearly 32 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, whose 23rd District takes in all of Ventura County except most of 
Thousand Oaks and includes Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County, said he has 
refrained from sending a newsletter this year because it is an election year. 
He is not expected to face a strong challenge. In any case, he said the 
potential political benefits of the mailings hold little appeal for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a person has very little or no name identification and he wants to become 
better known in a district, that's certainly a plus," the four-term lawmaker 
said. "That does not appear to be a problem in my district." 
</P>
<P>
 There are restrictions on how far lawmakers can go with their newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
 All the mailings must be approved by a congressional franking commission. Each 
must comply with rules that limit the number and size of photographs of the 
lawmaker, the number of times his or her name may appear and the use of party 
labels and partisan references. All mailings must be postmarked at least 60 
days prior to a primary or general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson sent three districtwide mailings in 1993. He also sent hundreds of 
thousands of postcards alerting residents to a series of 16 to 18 regional town 
meetings where he presented his views on current issues and answered questions 
from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was Beilenson's first representing the Republican-leaning 24th 
District that extends from Sherman Oaks to Malibu in Los Angeles County and 
takes in most of Thousand Oaks in Ventura County. He had previously represented 
a Democratic district divided between the Westside and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he spent more last year, at least in part, because he is 
representing half the district's residents for the first time. He had spent 
$147,253 on postage in 1992, or 47 cents per address, which ranked him 103rd in 
the House. His 1991 total was $88,791. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he held more town meetings than usual to introduce himself to 
new constituents and inform them of his availability. He said any political 
benefit was merely a byproduct of performing the job he was sent to Congress to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "You stay as close to people you were elected to represent and try to be as 
accountable to them as you can possibly be," he said. "If there are some 
political advantages to that, I think that's all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson recalled that he has supported mailing reforms and avoided common 
practices that he regards as franking abuses. He sends his newsletters to all 
households in the district and does not mail different pieces tailored to 
specific groups, such as seniors or physicians--a practice that is common in 
election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Gallegly, he did not mail to those who were outside his current 
district but inside his new one when he sought reelection in 1992. He includes 
only a single masthead photo of himself in each mailing and does not generally 
trumpet his own activities or achievements. Rather, he says his mailings are 
meant to be educational, substantive and even provocative. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's mailings included a questionnaire on reducing the federal deficit 
and another reporting the results. The second mailing included a long message 
from Beilenson making the case for the controversial Clinton budget plan, which 
the lawmaker backed and Republicans opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress took an important step toward restoring the fiscal soundness of 
government by approving the budget bill containing most of President Clinton's 
economic program," Beilenson wrote. He said he included this even though it 
might offend some Republican recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 A third newsletter focused on reforming the nation's health-care system. 
Again, Beilenson emphasized the benefits of the Clinton plan, without endorsing 
the President's proposal. He said last week that he sought to give Clinton 
credit for focusing on the need for change although he would like to see a more 
gradualist approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's campaign manager, Miller, who is based in Los Angeles, has been a 
part-time aide on Beilenson's staff for 11 years. He has also run each of the 
lawmaker's reelection campaigns since 1982. He is a partner in a firm that 
organizes AIDS fund-raising events nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation called Miller's dual roles 
as campaign manager and congressional aide "incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly looks very suspicious to have a campaign manager playing a major 
role in managing your franked mailings," Keating said. "There's got to be a 
temptation to use tax-funded postages to help his boss's reelection 
effort--even if you don't control the message, by making sure that every last 
dollar you could spend is spent." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson vehemently rejected such a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't 'manage' them," he said. "That's totally wrong. If Craig weren't 
there, there would be exactly as many mailings, they would have the exact same 
content as they do and someone else would have to be paid to get them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller affirmed that his contribution to the mailings is strictly technical: 
handling the logistics of town hall meetings and working with graphic artists, 
printers, mail houses and the Postal Service to make sure the pieces have the 
right look and are delivered in a timely manner. He said he also serves as an 
adviser on AIDS issues. 
</P>
<P>
 He compared his twin roles to that of top Washington aides to many House 
members who take a leave of absence at election time to run the lawmaker's 
campaign. Even if he played a more substantial role in Beilenson's 
congressional operation, Miller emphasized, "there would be absolutely nothing 
wrong" with that. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gallegly's case, his former press secretary, John Frith, helped prepare his 
newsletters. Frith took an unpaid, monthlong leave of absence before the 1992 
general election to work on Gallegly's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly's spending on mail was up as well. He invested $59,667 in 1992, or 21 
cents per address, which ranked 271 in the House. However, in 1991 he had spent 
$171,007. He emphasized that his total went down in the election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said that his increase for 1993 was due, at least in part, to a 
significantly higher volume of mail from constituents in his new district. He 
said his first priority is to respond to incoming mail within five days. 
</P>
<P>
 But the postage cost for replying to unsolicited mail is usually a small 
percentage of lawmakers' totals. In Gallegly's case, it was an an estimated 
$11,002, or 11%, of his spending on non-mass mailing postage, the National 
Taxpayers Union Foundation found. This accounted for an estimated $13,188, or 
8%, of Beilenson's spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly sent out two districtwide newsletters in 1993 and two more narrowly 
targeted mailings. His newsletters are more conventional than Beilenson's. Each 
has three photographs of Gallegly, doing such things as meeting with Border 
Patrol officers to discuss illegal immigration or with Ventura County students 
on the Capitol steps. 
</P>
<P>
 They also include pieces with such headlines as: "Gallegly works to aid 
economy" and "Gallegly launches district outreach program." One item touted his 
97% voting record. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he sent a letter to 32,373 senior citizens in April, 1993, 
assuring them that "I have renewed my commitment to protect your Social 
Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I continue to oppose the plans of the Administration and the congressional 
majority to raise taxes on seniors earning as little as $25,000 a year," 
Gallegly wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent another letter to 12,320 veterans about his effort to bar Iraqis who 
were captured during the Persian Gulf War from being resettled in the United 
States. "This program is a testament to a hapless and foolhardy State 
Department," Gallegly wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly also sent out a questionnaire. In contrast to Beilenson, he asked 
pointed questions such as the following regarding President Clinton's economic 
program: 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you support the President's economic plan, which features large tax 
increases, major defense cuts and a net increase in domestic spending?" A total 
of 76% of respondents said no; 15% said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the questionnaires, including professional pollsters, say that the 
self-selecting, unrepresentative and small percentage of respondents is not a 
scientifically valid sample. Moreover, lawmakers sometimes use loaded terms to 
ask questions that appear designed to produce answers that concur with their 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson and Gallegly said they find that respondents overwhelmingly agree 
with their stands. Beilenson, who asks constituents to make tax and spending 
choices reflecting how they would cut the budget deficit, says he finds this 
reinforcement reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may well be that the great majority of us do a good job of representing 
the feelings of people back there," he said. "At least those who took the time 
to answer the questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said the questionnaire serves another purpose: It tells him that his 
constituents want at least as many publicly funded newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked: "Do newsletters such as this assist you in understanding current 
issues before Congress?" 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 85% of the respondents answered yes; 9% said no. '93 MAIL COSTS FOR

FALLING OAK TREE INJURES 4 PEOPLE; OJAI: TWO CHILDREN AND TWO ADULTS ARE HURT 
WHEN TREE COLLAPSES OVER GROUP LISTENING TO NATURE TALK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Two adults and two children suffered minor injuries Saturday afternoon when a 
large oak tree fell on a group of about 35 children and adults listening to a 
nature talk at a campground north of Ojai, a Ventura County Fire Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 students from Juanamaria Elementary School in Ventura and about 15 
adults were on the field trip to Murietta Campground near Matilija Canyon Road, 
Ventura County Fire Capt. Norm Plott said.  
</P>
<P>
 The group spent the morning exploring the area after hiking a mile into the 
campground, said Robert Lurie, who was on the field trip with his two sons. 
About noon, the group gathered in a circle under an old oak tree for a picnic 
and a talk by a local naturalist, Lurie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was freak thing," he said. "It was crazy that it happened right when we 
were sitting there. There was no wind and no warning. We just heard this 
snapping sound, just like the sound when they cut down those big redwoods. We 
didn't even have much of a chance to get out from under it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie said he helped move victims from under the collapsed tree before running 
to a telephone about two miles away.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like every possible rescue vehicle responded," he said. "There was 
the Fire Department, search and rescue, ambulances and a helicopter." 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County Sheriff's Department helicopter was used to carry out the 
injured from the campground about a mile from the road, Plott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also had to cut a landing pad in order to reach the victims," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plott said two of the victims were dropped off at the road by the helicopter 
for transport by ambulance to Ojai Valley Hospital, and the other two were 
flown to Ventura County Medical Center for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Smith, 39, of Ventura, who was taken to the hospital by helicopter, was 
treated for a broken ankle and released, a hospital spokeswoman said. He was 
accompanied by a man who was treated for minor cuts and bruises and released, 
the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine Crumpler, 29, of Oxnard and Raelene Soto, 9, of Ventura were both 
treated at Ojai Valley Hospital and released, a hospital spokeswoman said.

POST-EARTHQUAKE PATIENCE WEARS THIN AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Cal State Northridge overcame the ravages of the January earthquake to 
begin its spring semester only two weeks late, the institution operated as the 
epitome of single-minded devotion to its chief goal: survival. Despite 
tremendous obstacles and primitive conditions, hardly a hint of complaint or 
dissent could be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, the university is struggling into the final month of the 
school year on a campus that continues to operate mostly out of temporary 
trailers squeezed in between still-closed buildings. And the quake's trauma has 
begun to take a more visible toll on CSUN's nearly 28,000 students, faculty and 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 As the quake's initial sense of crisis has been supplanted by the day-to-day 
complications of life on a fractured campus, the once-united university has 
been splintered by frustrations and disputes. Even CSUN President Blenda J. 
Wilson, hailed as a hero for spearheading the reopening, has come under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging over the institution, as well, is a sense of anxiety about the future. 
Teachers and administrators fear enrollments could plummet next fall if 
students forsake a campus that may take three to five years to fully regain its 
pre-earthquake condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very difficult time for everybody," said Wilson. "I think 
we've just exhausted our capacity in some instances to do everything well." 
</P>
<P>
 The campus, she said, must perform a juggling act -- working to establish 
temporary facilities for the short term while repairing and rebuilding the 
permanent campus for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and others add that their frustration grows as their desire for 
normalcy outstrips the pace of the recovery. Off campus, freeways are being 
repaired and businesses are reopening, but the scope of CSUN's problems has it 
lagging. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first month was the easy part. Getting back up and going, even though it 
required seven-day weeks and a great deal of hard work, the task was fairly 
obvious," said university spokesman Bruce Erickson. "But once you get into a 
long, drawn-out process of difficulty, frustration takes its toll." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, some on campus, particularly faculty members, also are blaming the 
flare-ups on the Wilson administration, which they say has been dictatorial and 
uncommunicative after the quake. The same headstrong approach Wilson used to 
help reopen the campus now has many chafing, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the sore spots: 
</P>
<P>
 * Faculty leaders have accused Wilson and her administrators of cutting them 
out of the decision-making process in the wake of the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
saying flagging faculty morale threatens to undermine the recovery process. 
Wilson has been conciliatory, but also complained that faculty committees have 
not been able to keep up with day-to-day decision-making demands. 
</P>
<P>
 * The student government last week passed a resolution with complaints of 
"widespread confusion among students as to the severity of damage to individual 
buildings" and the expected time frames for their reopening. The student 
leaders asked administrators to provide them monthly updates and to better 
publicize information in the campus newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 * The task of trying to repair buildings has caused an angry rift between the 
academic and facility operations of the campus. Faculty members and others say 
repair crews rode roughshod over their office belongings, arriving without 
warning, damaging materials and then leaving rooms unlocked and vulnerable to 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wilson has ordered CSUN to plan for a 4% budget cut for the coming school 
year, although other Cal State campuses have been asked to trim only 2.6%. 
Faculty members say classes will be cut. Wilson aides say she wants to shift 
money among campus programs, and have a cushion for earthquake repairs and 
other looming expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although Wilson promised time-and-a-half "emergency pay" to CSUN support 
workers called in to help prepare for the reopening of the campus, four labor 
groups have warned of a lawsuit because their estimated 750 employees have yet 
to get their bonuses. The pay has been stalled by a dispute between the groups 
and the university over other university-sought concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Students complain they sorely miss the university's only library, both for 
its books and its study space, which is now in short supply. Some students say 
it is harder to learn in classes held in trailers or tentlike domes, and that 
professors are giving easier assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Relations have been strained with residents who live nearby. After the 
quake, the city of Los Angeles, at the university's request, relaxed normal 
restrictions on parking in residential areas near CSUN, although that exemption 
ended last week. Residents also complain about gawkers who stream by to see the 
collapsed parking structure on Zelzah Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the minor, but annoying, irritants: Most keys to the new 
trailers have not worked. Wilson recalled how she kept sending electronic 
computer messages only to discover her colleagues couldn't receive them. It's 
also become apparent to anyone with a thirst that many of the campus drinking 
fountains are inside quake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problems stem from the greatest loss due to natural disaster of any U.S. 
university, up to an estimated $350 million. Although the only collapse on 
campus was the 2,500-space parking structure, most of the university's major 
buildings were initially closed due to damage. And operations shifted to more 
than 400 imported trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorena Knepper, CSUN's director of government relations, said 25% of the 
trailers should be removed by this fall and the rest by a year later. All but 
seven major buildings -- the library, Fine Arts, Science 1 and 2, the computer 
center, Administration and Engineering -- are due to reopen by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for that to happen, state voters in June must pass a ballot measure 
to provide the state's required 10% matching share for federal earthquake 
repair funds. And, Provost Louanne Kennedy said, less-damaged buildings would 
have to be emptied for repairs this summer despite summer classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early days surrounding the Feb. 14 reopening, Wilson was hailed as a 
hero both on and off campus for leading the return at a time when some feared 
the campus might be closed for the semester. That reputation still stands off 
campus although it has dimmed at CSUN. "The heroine of the earthquake has clay 
feet," quipped political science Chairman Eugene Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty Senate President Louise Lewis, an art history professor who has been 
vocal in praising Wilson, still lauds her early performance but said faculty 
members must now take a greater role in making decisions. Tension among faculty 
members has risen to the point that they will vote soon on whether to remove 
administrators as members of the Faculty Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're at war, no one objects to having a general. But after a while in 
the academy, we're not accustomed to marching to a general's orders," said 
Jerry Luedders, chairman of the campus music department and of a faculty 
committee that recently issued a report complaining about what it called the 
"top down" mode of running the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another group of business faculty members wrote recently: "While we are 
painfully aware that the last thing that any of us wants to hear during this 
period of extreme stress is criticism, the purpose of this university is to 
educate students and, unfortunately, that goal seems to be getting lost in a 
sea of misdirected energies, miscommunications, angry words, bruised egos and 
finger-pointing." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, Wilson said presidents of other universities that 
have suffered natural disasters have counseled her to prepare for such 
emotional swings. "This is not a peculiar reaction of our community," she said, 
acknowledging the recent discord on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent letter to faculty members, she wrote, "I accept personal 
responsibility for the institution's responsibility to provide a suitable 
working environment for our employees and engage faculty in the decisions that 
affect them. That I have not been successful in doing so recently is evident in 
the comments and concerns that faculty and staff have expressed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson, in the interview, rejected criticism that she has failed to 
consult with the faculty, saying she has done so regularly with deans and 
department leaders. And Wilson said she couldn't say whether CSUN's internal 
communications after the quake have been inadequate as many claim. She said the 
campus has done more in that area than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the students, Fabio Escobar, newly elected student body president, said 
many are spending less time on campus, because of the closed library and 
because many of their former eating and meeting locations also remain closed. 
Students seem to be studying less, and many professors have canceled 
research-intensive assignments such as term papers, he and other students said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long semester. People learn to adjust rather quickly. But 
eventually it wears thin, and it's worn thin," Escobar said. "In the beginning, 
people were more willing to forgive transgressions because it was an emergency 
situation. Now they're not so willing." 
</P>
<P>
 With the parking structure gone and some on-campus lots now occupied by 
villages of trailer classrooms, using remote, improvised parking lots has been 
a constant frustration. And just finding faculty members for help has become a 
struggle, Escobar said, because most still don't have their own offices or 
telephones in communal faculty office trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first couple days were exciting. CNN was here, students were having to 
use maps to find their classes. But after three or four days, it definitely 
wore off," concurred Steve Kozak, a senior and the managing editor of the Daily 
Sundial campus newspaper. Kozak and Editor Paul Bond said they have struggled 
all year to get information from university officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bond summed up the spring, saying, "It's exciting, but don't expect to get a 
good education here until next semester." And Kozak said the campus "is just 
filled with students packed into trailers who have no sense of what's happening 
with their university." Because of the semester's turmoil, both said they have 
had to delay their planned graduations. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's graduating class of bachelor's and master's degree students in June may 
be one of the largest ever -- more than 5,211 students have filed for 
graduation and typically 70% of those filing actually complete their 
requirements by the semester's end. But that is little cause for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The enrollment from last spring already fell 6.6% this semester to 24,813, the 
lowest spring enrollment since 1974, records show. For the fall, some campus 
officials fear a major enrollment drop because of the combination of the large 
graduating class and the assumption that many CSUN students may use their 
summer break to find campuses elsewhere. As a result, CSUN officials said they 
are not making a formal enrollment projection for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the problems on campus, though, one student senator insisted he will 
be back in the fall. "It's not so bad. I'm graduating in June and I'm staying 
on at this university for my master's," said Tadzio Garcia, a senior music 
major. "We just have to get used to not having everything we had before." Quake

CITY COUNCIL VOTES FOR HOMELESS SHELTER; ORDINANCE: SANTA MONICA'S APPROVAL OF 
100-BED FACILITY COMPLIES WITH COURT RULING. LAW BANNING AGGRESSIVE PANHANDLING 
IS ENACTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council once again tried to legislate away the city's 
homeless problems by voting for a new 100-person homeless shelter that will 
allow the city to legally remove people from the parks at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also enacted a law banning aggressive panhandling and removed 
loopholes from the park closure law that allowed people to remain in the parks 
while they were asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 A final decision on the location of the shelter will be made this week. 
However, the staff has recommended city-owned property at 505 Olympic Blvd., 
formerly a trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary shelter, proposed by Councilman Paul Rosenstein, will cost 
$390,000 to set up and $365,000 a year to operate. It will be run by the 
Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein proposed the shelter to comply with a recent state Court of Appeal 
ruling that people cannot be removed from public parks unless they are offered 
a place to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The new shelter would bring the number of city-funded shelter beds to 150. 
There are also 276 privately funded shelter beds in the area. Recent counts 
found between 91 and 133 people sleeping in the city's parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Asha Greenberg and Robert T. Holbrook, who brought about the 
round of legislation by demanding stricter policies, voted against the shelter 
because the council declined to pay for it from the social service budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The city spends $1.3 million yearly on homeless services, and Greenberg and 
Holbrook have been pushing to direct funding away from emergency services in 
favor of programs working on long-term solutions to homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg said the plethora of emergency services makes Santa Monica a magnet 
for homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Judy Abdo defended the effectiveness of the social service agencies, 
saying they are held to high standards of accountability. "To think (the money) 
is being squandered or wasted is wrong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Santa Monica's homeless community and their advocates were out in 
force at the council meeting last week, pleading with the panel to take a 
humane stance, not a punitive one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought for this country, why can't I live in it?" asked James Cole, a 
resident of Santa Monica for 26 years who was dispossessed when the city bought 
and closed the trailer park where he lived. "Why has my dignity been taken away 
from me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Ruiall, a panhandler, asked not to be stereotyped as aggressive. "Most 
of us are polite," he said. "You go to work . . . This is work for us until we 
get a permanent home." 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeless speakers complained of police harassment, citing an incident in 
which, they alleged, a police officer stomped on food brought to them at City 
Hall. Officials said the allegations would be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel managers and some residents, however, said they were fed up with 
homeless problems and the council's record of dealing with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has grappled for years with the problems but has had little 
success. Critics charge the council has been particularly attentive in election 
season; three seats are up in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Sedillos, who represents a public safety group, Save Our City, chided the 
council for conducting its "fourth annual masquerade as champions of public 
safety . . . The people of Santa Monica are really tired of being jerked 
around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel managers came armed with tales of lost tourism and convention business. 
Rich Casale, of Loew's Santa Monica Beach Hotel, read from a series of letters 
in which groups chose other area hotels over Santa Monica because of public 
safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "A nice hotel in an unacceptable location," stated one letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they voted for the new law banning aggressive panhandling, Holbrook and 
Greenberg said it didn't go far enough.

A GROWING CONCERN IN PROTECTING HILLSIDES; LANDSCAPING: AS A RESULT OF LAST 
YEAR'S DISASTROUS FIRES, AREA HOMEOWNERS SHOW RENEWED INTEREST IN USING 
FLAME-RETARDANT PLANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With planting season here, local nurseries are offering the following words of 
wisdom for homeowners in wildfire-prone areas: 
</P>
<P>
 Pittosporum, dietes, lantanas, Myoporum parvifolium -- botanical names for a 
few of the fire-retardant plant species available at nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big, hot subject right now," said Wendy Persson of Persson's Nursery. 
"Every day, somebody calls or comes in asking us for a list of fire-retardant 
plants." 
</P>
<P>
 The nursery, which lies right below the hills where the Altadena fire blazed, 
is getting a lot of business from householders planning fire-resistant gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Persson's list includes oleander, jasmine and yucca. She said she had noticed 
that some of the burned areas included untouched patches of ice plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice plant isn't as popular as rye grass at the Altadena Nursery, said employee 
Duane Higuchi. The nursery ran out of the fast-growing rye grass, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He considers ice plant a good anti-flame plant, "like a big, wet sponge." 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul Rippens, the L.A. County Fire Department's chief of forestry, has 
reservations about the heavy succulent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like ice plant," he said, warning that residents have to be careful 
of varieties whose leaves grow too large, pulling down the soil on hillsides 
and causing mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be careful on steep slopes," he said. Altadena gets alluvial sand 
from mountain runoff as well as decomposed granite and rock, imparting some 
instability to the soil. Therefore, vegetation with deep roots -- such as oak, 
ivy and rye grass -- are among the best choices for keeping the soil stable, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller-leaved ice plant varieties such as Delosperma alba and red apple get 
better reviews, but they are by no means the only options suggested by fire 
officials and nursery owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Teller of Dawson Landscaping, which he said has received about 100 calls 
for advice on planting for fires, recommends fescue, rye grass and California 
poppy for fire-retardant and soil-erosion planting. Some people rely on 
hydroseeding -- aerial spraying of a mixture of seeds that sprout on the 
hillsides -- or netting to stabilize steep slopes while the vegetation grows, 
he said.

BRIDAL SHOP OWNERS DENOUNCE CRIME RUMORS AS RACIST; TEMPLE CITY: TALK THAT 
BUSINESSES ARE FRONTS FOR MONEY LAUNDERING AND PROSTITUTION ANGERS THE 
COMMUNITY'S GROWING ASIAN POPULATION.

<P>
 No one knows how the rumor got started. 
</P>
<P>
 Been around a few years now, Temple City residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 We asked the authorities to investigate, the city manager confirms. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing to it, the cops conclude. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet it persists, casting suspicion on a group of hard-working people who 
have gone from bewilderment to anger as the topic refuses to die. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumor that hangs over Temple City goes like this: The city's nine bridal 
shops are fronts for illegal activity, including prostitution and money 
laundering. Why else would there be so many within a square mile of each other? 
How else could they stay in business? What else could bring all that traffic of 
young men and women some evenings, when bridal shops are traditionally closed? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and another thing: All the shops are owned by Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors swirl within a background of changing demographics: The 
historically white community has seen its Asian population swell in the last 
decade to more than 20% of its 31,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridal shops even took on political overtones earlier this month when City 
Council candidate Joe Walker, 33, a crime analyst with the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, distributed flyers that proclaimed: "Stop Bridal Shops. 
Investigate these businesses that are plaguing our city." 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Americans accused Walker of racism; he said he merely worried that the 
bridal shops -- which do a large business in rentals and services -- generate 
little sales tax. He later apologized for the "discomfort and grief" caused by 
the word plague. He lost the April 12 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, civic leaders said his platform struck a chord, giving public 
voice to a private concern that has long gnawed at the innards of some 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a minority who resent the Asians moving into our city, and perhaps 
for them bridal shops have become the symbol . . . of those demographic 
changes," said Thomas Breazeal, a Temple City councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Breazeal said he finds the rumors about the bridal shops "abhorrent, 
repugnant, unconscionable. I don't know if I can adequately find words to 
describe my emotional feelings for someone who introduces racism into an 
election." 
</P>
<P>
 But step inside Pie 'n Burger, a 1950s-style coffee shop on Las Tunas Drive 
that is a remnant of Americana amid a thicket of signs advertising Asian 
businesses, and you meet the type of folks who took Walker's slogans to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's dope going out the back door and prostitution in the front," 
asserted Norman B. Stachler, a former Temple City businessman, when asked about 
the bridal shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Stachler, who raised his family in Temple City and later moved to Arcadia, 
said of Asian immigrants: 
</P>
<P>
 "They're buying us out of our community, our city, our own golf courses. This 
goddamned town is ruined. It's another Monterey Park. All the homeowners are 
moving out." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons at several other tables echoed Stachler's remarks. A man who 
identified himself only as Bob said the United States should prohibit 
immigrants from buying property until they become citizens. The man, whose 
parents emigrated from Yugoslavia, accused Temple City of being too lenient 
with Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people are pretty shrewd," he said. "The way they work, you don't even 
know what they're doing in (the bridal shops)." 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors are so pervasive that at least one bridal shop owner found herself 
fending off would-be johns. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian Viado, a Filipino Amerycan who owns Veekee's Bridal Shop on Las Tunas 
Drive, said three or four men have called wanting to hire prostitutes. A car 
full of young men once pulled up to her store in the middle of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are the whores?" they asked as customers gaped in astonishment. "We're 
looking for whores." 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got the wrong place," Viado told them. Her store of six years is 
exactly what it appears, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they will investigate; we're not hiding anything," Viado said, waving 
her arm to encompass the floor-length wedding dresses, prom gowns, jewelry, 
slippers and veils that adorn the boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridal-shop owners said the suspicions about them illustrate an ignorance of 
Asia and its customs, where entire city shopping districts are often devoted to 
one type of business. In Taipei, Taiwan, they said, there is one street lined 
with 30 or more bridal shops where customers can compare prices and styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want a one-stop shopping street; that's one of our biggest selling 
points," said Peter Zhang of Top Bo Bridal shop, which opened in a shopping 
mall on Las Tunas Drive six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from fearing that other shops would pose too much competition, Top Bo was 
drawn to Las Tunas specifically because of the plethora of shops, Zhang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Wang, 40, and her husband Daniel, 46, own Lucy's Bridal, an elegant Las 
Tunas shop that features elaborate Marie Antoinette-like dresses trimmed with 
black lace. The Wangs studied photography in Japan, then ran a bridal shop in 
Taiwan for 15 years before moving to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing we know is the bridal business and the photography business, 
so that's what we did to make a life," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials said they are bewildered as to where the rumors 
started. The only link they can muster is that Temple City residents might be 
confusing bridal shops with a beauty shop that was closed down last year for 
prostitution. The Jai Alai Salon's business license was revoked by the city 
attorney after the city and police received numerous calls alleging illegal 
activity there.

NEW PLAN FOR LAX AREA SEEMS READY TO LIFT OFF; BUSINESS: THE LARGEST LANDLORD 
IN WESTCHESTER IS PLANNING A $20-MILLION SHOPPING PLAZA. IT WOULD BE THE AREA'S 
FIRST MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN 30 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades, Westchester boosters have pondered what to do with their fading 
downtown business district just north of Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 30 years after the last major redevelopment there, the district's biggest 
landlord, Howard Drollinger, has proposed a long-awaited shot in the arm: an 
expanded grocery store, some office and retail space, and lots of free parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers question whether the $20-million project, a Spanish 
Colonial-style shopping plaza on Sepulveda Boulevard, is ambitious enough to 
spur a downtown renaissance, as Drollinger predicts it will. But at the very 
least, it promises to shake up architecturally a struggling commercial strip 
long criticized as dowdy and theme-less. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the total opposite of any building that has been there before," 
Westchester/LAX Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Donald Savoie said. 
Drollinger estimates that the village will produce $60 million to $80 million 
in annual sales and generate more than 200 short-term construction jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Westchester was once a thriving shopping area, but airport expansion 
in the mid-1960s gobbled up nearly 3,000 homes in the area, costing the 
district much of its customer base. 
</P>
<P>
 Left behind was a suddenly remote and outdated downtown of low-rise buildings 
whose main entrances opened onto empty sidewalks on Sepulveda Boulevard. 
Parking was -- and remains -- mostly around back. 
</P>
<P>
 That style is in sharp contrast to Drollinger's plan, which features a 
landscaped, 50,000-square-foot parking lot opening directly onto the west side 
of Sepulveda Boulevard just south of La Tijera Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon entering the lot, visitors would find a 46,000-square-foot Ralph's 
Supermarket -- nearly twice the size of the current store -- marked by a clock 
tower. There also would be 45,000 square feet of remodeled retail and office 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, according to H. B. Drollinger Co., is to create a village 
atmosphere. "It's going to be a big visual change, so that's going to create 
some interest," Savoie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Bob Smith, president of the Westchester Vitalization Corp., a nonprofit 
planning group in Westchester: "It may give some of the other property owners 
reason to develop their property." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were more guarded in their assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ruhlen, also of the Westchester Vitalization Corp., termed the plaza "a 
nice project" for local residents, but one not likely to lure outsiders heading 
to or from LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a glorified strip mall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes Westchester, 
questioned whether the plaza would serve as "a catalyst for significant new 
development," but nonetheless she termed Drollinger's investment in his 
property "very encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 "The significant breakthrough is that this time he really seems to have a 
project," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the owner of almost half of Westchester's downtown, Drollinger has come 
under periodic fire for failing to lead it out of the dumps, perhaps with a 
development that would somehow capitalize on its proximity to LAX and the 
millions of visitors the airport attracts each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Drollinger has blamed the impasse on various factors beyond his control, 
including a sluggish economy, government red tape and uncertainties about plans 
for vacant airport-owned land nearby. His company recently scrapped a somewhat 
more ambitious plan for the site that would have mixed retail space with 300 
residential units, out of concern, said Drollinger Vice President Thomas 
Corley, that it was "overly ambitious." 
</P>
<P>
 But company officials say the delays are behind them. They are busily 
procuring various city permits and approvals, and they hope to finish 
construction by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major commitment to the area," Corley said. "It will bring a lot of 
shoppers back into the area."

THE KEY TO PICKING A BEST SELLER; THE CRITICAL FIRST STEP TO SUCCESSFUL SELLING 
IS SELECTING THE RIGHT REAL ESTATE AGENT. HERE ARE THE ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS TO 
ASK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN JAMES MARTIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Distributed by Universal Press 
Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're selling your house. Through the sales manager of a local realty firm, 
you hear about Lorraine. She's "hungry for your business," the manager says. 
Lorraine comes over with a thick loose-leaf book full of slick charts and 
starts flipping pages for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Your temptation is to make a quick decision and hire her. After all, she's 
forceful, engaging and talks a good game. But wait, real estate experts say. 
The decision on whom you hire to market your home can be crucial. Before you 
pick Lorraine, you should pose some key questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trust everybody, but cut the cards," counsels Norman D. Flynn, a past 
president of the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 750,000 real estate agents involved in the profession 
throughout the United States, most communities have an abundance of choices. 
Certainly, some agents have marketing skills superior to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are five questions to help you find the right agent: 
</P>
<P>
 1. What is your marketing plan for my particular property? 
</P>
<P>
 There's more to selling a home than putting it on the Multiple Listing 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Most properties call for a carefully orchestrated marketing program that 
covers newspaper ads and direct mail, at the minimum. The agent should also 
have a plan to tell other agents in your vicinity about your home -- whether 
through mailings, phone calls or "brokers' opens" that bring other agents in to 
see the place. Often it's such networking that produces sales. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not enough for an agent to speak vaguely about a marketing plan. You need 
quantitative promises. (For example, the agent should tell you when and where 
your ads will run.) 
</P>
<P>
 And you need the marketing plan in writing, says Flynn, a real estate 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 2. How often will you promise to call or write me with feedback? 
</P>
<P>
 A good agent should contact the homeowner at least once every week or two. He 
should not only call when sales activity is robust and encouraging, but also 
when prospects are few and their reactions are negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's equally important to call during periods when nothing is cooking as when 
there's a lot cooking," Flynn says. The absence of buyers could, for instance, 
signal that your house is priced too high and needs to be discounted. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Could I have a list of your satisfied clients as references? 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn suggests you ask for at least three to four customers whose homes the 
agent has sold. And these should be the owners of the same sort of property as 
yours. The fact is that many agents specialize -- perhaps in new homes, 
high-end properties or condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some agents who are very good at selling condos and others who 
wouldn't know how to sell a condo if it were the last stick and twig on the 
planet," Flynn says. 
</P>
<P>
 4. What is your track record for real estate sales? 
</P>
<P>
 In real estate -- as much as any other field -- a small percentage of sales 
people do most of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 David Knox, a home sales specialist who does seminars and videotapes, 
estimates that the top 8% of U.S. agents sell 90% of all homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Years of experience in the field is not always the best measure of success. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to know about both tenure and production. If the agent has been in 
the field for one year and sold $2 million in property, that's good. But if 
he's been working for three years and sold $1 million a year, that's not real 
good," Knox says. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides dollar volume sold, another smart area of inquiry relates to the 
percentage of listings an agent sells before his listing agreement with the 
owner expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, agents sell just 30% to 60% of their listings before they expire, 
Knox notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want an agent who sells 85% to 90% of his listings," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other key standards of performance too. You might ask the agent what 
percentage of the asking price, on average, he has received for the homes he's 
sold during the last six- to 12-month period. And you can ask him the average 
number of days his listed homes stayed on the market before they sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Do these measures sound obscure? They shouldn't be for a sharp agent. A good 
one continually tracks his own work by computer and should be more impressed 
than angry when you ask for the numbers, Knox says. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Why should I pick you over all the other agents? 
</P>
<P>
 There are several wrong answers to this question, Flynn says. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent shouldn't reply by bad-mouthing the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 His chief claim shouldn't be that his commissions are cheap, since an agent 
with a higher commission could save you money by selling your house faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor should the agent contend he should be selected because he'll price your 
house higher than other agents you're considering. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, it's the open market that will finally decide what your house 
fetches, not the listing price set for the property. Indeed, a house priced too 
high will often languish on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The right answer to the question, "Why should I pick you?" is an articulate 
summary of the agent's past experience plus the marketing plan for your home. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen well, because your fortune and housing plans can be at stake in the 
choice of an agent, Flynn cautions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should look at any candidate with a somewhat jaundiced eye," he says.

HOT PROPERTY: ARNOLDS SEEK MORE SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 ROSEANNE and TOM ARNOLD, whose roller-coaster marriage made headlines last 
month when she filed for divorce and then dropped the proceedings in the same 
week, are in escrow to buy a $3-million house next door to their Brentwood 
home, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Their offer on the house was accepted in a probate-court hearing in early 
April, before she filed for divorce. They are expected to take possession of 
the home in June. 
</P>
<P>
 They are buying the house, described as "a very pretty, two-story 
traditional," to expand their living compound, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they are going to tear it down," a source said, referring to 
the house that the Arnolds are buying. "To make their existing estate bigger, 
all they have to do is gate their new property and use the house for guests or 
as offices," another source added. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Arnold has said that he uses a Westside condo, where his wife claimed in 
legal papers that he moved to six months ago, as an office or a writer's 
retreat. Arnold, 38, was a comedy writer when the couple was married in 1990. 
Now he is co-executive producer with his wife, 41, of her top-rated "Roseanne" 
ABC comedy series and "Tom," his struggling CBS sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arnolds have wanted larger quarters for some time, sources say. Their 
current home, which they bought as newlyweds for about $3.5 million, has four 
bedrooms, a guest house, tennis court and pool, with no room for add-ons. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple considered selling their home at $4 million to buy a larger one but 
then the house next door came on the market, and so they decided to buy it and 
keep their existing residence, sources say. Built in the 1930s, the house they 
are buying has five bedrooms and 5 1/2 baths plus a sun room with a balcony 
overlooking a large back yard with manicured grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The home had been owned by the late Armen Bagdasarian, widow of songwriter 
Ross S. Bagdasarian Sr., whose 1958 recording of "The Chipmunk Song" sold 4 
million copies in seven weeks. The senior Bagdasarian died in 1972. Since then, 
his son, Ross Jr., has written, produced and played the voices of the chipmunk 
characters Alvin, Theodore and Simon. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the original members of the rock band Chicago, trombonist JAMES PANKOW, 
has put his Malibu home on the market at $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pankow, 46, has owned the home since 1975. He decided to sell it, because he 
is on the road a lot and is "scaling down to a smaller residence," said listing 
broker Jack Pritchett of Pritchett Realty in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, on five acres, has four bedrooms, a sound studio, a party room, two 
guest houses, a sauna, waterfall, stream, organic garden, tennis court and 
horse facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor ALAN THICKE, who is probably best known for his role as psychiatrist Dr. 
Jason Seaver in the ABC sitcom "Growing Pains" (1985-1992), has put his 
Hollywood Hills pied-a-terre on the market at $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Thicke, 46, has been living primarily in a Toluca Lake home with his two 
teen-age sons, but he has owned the Hollywood home for five years. During that 
time, he refurbished and redecorated it in Santa Fe style at an estimated cost 
of more than $600,000, and he had it on the market a couple of times, most 
recently in 1992 at about $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Thicke, who is getting married in August at his Santa Barbara ranch, just 
leased out the home but is intent on selling it, sources say. The home, which 
has city views and a pool, has been described as "a bachelor" or "couple" 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoda Paramore of Fred Sands' Hollywood Hills office has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Oriole outfielder BRADY ANDERSON, a former UC Irvine standout, has 
purchased a 5,000-square-foot mountain retreat at Lake Tahoe for $1.3 million, 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, which was built in 1987 and was just remodeled, is on an acre at 
Incline Village with a view of the lake "and the privacy he was looking for," 
said selling broker Doug Irvine of Rancon Real Estate in Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up there looking for a house for him to buy, and we had exhausted the 
list of ones for sale," said Irvine, who played college ball with the 
30-year-old Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair continued to drive around and look at houses that appealed to the 
ballplayer until Irvine said, "This is the last one." It was cold, and Irvine 
was tired of walking around in the snow.

THE VALUE OF A PROFESSIONAL HOME INSPECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES CAREY and MORRIS CAREY, FOR AP NEWSFEATURES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thinking of buying a home? If so, you'd be wise to have it professionally 
inspected before making a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 A home inspection, unlike a termite inspection or a city-mandated building 
inspection, addresses the overall condition of a home and reports on the 
various repairs that need to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 A complete home inspection includes a visual examination of the house from top 
to bottom. The inspector examines the heating system, the central air 
conditioning system, the interior plumbing and electrical systems, the roof and 
visible insulation, walls, ceilings, floors, windows and doors, the foundation 
and basement or crawl space. 
</P>
<P>
 A home inspection is most often performed when a property is being sold or 
transferred. Usually, it is the buyer who enlists the services of the 
professional home inspector to determine exactly what kind of home he or she is 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the majority of home inspections are requested by the buyer, 
sometimes the seller will hire his own home inspector to find areas in need of 
repair. Or, the seller may hire a home inspector at the same time as the buyer 
to verify the validity of the buyer's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people have their homes inspected after living in them for a period of 
time. They do this as a means of identifying developing problems, and obtaining 
information on preventive measures that might preclude future repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 You most assuredly should have any home that you are considering buying 
professionally inspected. Aside from revealing needed repairs, the home 
inspection is an excellent opportunity for you to learn more about the workings 
of the home. Tagging along with the inspector can be a real learning process. 
Be certain before engaging one, that he or she permits this. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a qualified inspector isn't difficult when you know what to look for 
-- and look out for. Since there are no federal or state laws that regulate the 
home inspection industry, anyone can call himself an inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 The most qualified home inspectors are those with years of building experience 
such as general building contractors, architects or engineers. They possess an 
understanding of the various aspects of construction and are most likely to 
offer the most comprehensive and legitimate report. 
</P>
<P>
 An inspector who is certified by the International Conference of Building 
Officials (ICBO) and/or a member of the American Society of Home Inspectors 
(ASHI) offers an added level of assurance of being well qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 ASHI, a nonprofit voluntary professional association, has developed formal 
inspection guidelines and a professional code of ethics. Members of ASHI are 
independent professionals who operate their own inspection services from coast 
to coast. ASHI can be contacted at (800) 743-ASHI. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to find a qualified home inspector is through referrals from 
friends, neighbors and realtors. Whatever the method of selection, always 
insist on references from previous clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Most home inspection reports will not include specific repair methods or 
information about projects that require the services of an individual with 
specific expertise, such as a soils engineer or structural engineer. Don't 
expect too much from the inspector. Even the most qualified inspector will be 
limited in providing certain technical information. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuke an inspector who offers to perform the repairs himself, or who 
recommends someone who can. This is a conflict of interest. The inspector 
should be completely neutral, only making recommendations on needed repairs, 
not for someone to make them. 
</P>
<P>
 Determine the type of report that will be issued. There are two basic ones 
that most home inspectors offer -- the checklist and the narrative. The 
checklist report is simple and offers the little detail. It briefly summarizes 
the condition of the home in a very general way. The narrative report, on the 
other hand, compiles the information in a much more thorough and comprehensive 
fashion. We think the narrative report is your best bet. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even they will vary from firm to firm, so ask to see a sample report. 
It should be written in easy-to-understand non-technical language. 
</P>
<P>
 According to ASHI, the average cost nationally for a home inspection is $250. 
Inspection cost can vary dramatically for a variety of reasons: the size of the 
home, the part of the country in which it is located, age, features, special 
structures and the type of report issued. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the money invested in a professional home inspection can save a 
buyer in many ways. What to Look for in a Home Inspector 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Best inspectors are architects, contractors and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Experience: Length of time inspecting; residential inspecting. 
</P>
<P>
 Client references: Names and numbers of previous clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflict of interest: Beware if inspector offers to do repairs or has some 
other vested interests.

 Sales of new and existing homes in Southern California jumped by more than 23% 
in the first quarter of 1994 compared to the same period last year, TRW REDI 
Property Data has reported. Orange County posted the strongest gain, 38%, 
followed by Riverside and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures are a further sign that the Southland housing market is beginning 
to recover from the four-year slump, TRW REDI analyst Nima Nattagh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new-home market has also shown significant improvement, Nattagh said. In 
the first quarter, 6,271 new homes were sold throughout Southern California--up 
16.5% from a year ago. All counties in the region showed healthy increases in 
new-home sales, with the exception of Los Angeles County, where sales were down 
by 14.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales prices remained flat in most areas of the region, Nattagh said. San 
Diego prices increased by slightly more than 4%. Southland Home Sales

YOUR MORTGAGE; DELINQUENT BORROWERS OFFERED HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Distributed by the Washington Post 
Writers Group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of financially stressed homeowners who are seriously delinquent on 
their home mortgages and unable to refinance could be in for good news: 
</P>
<P>
 They may be able to modify the terms of their existing mortgage, cut their 
monthly payments and avoid the trauma of foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new program unwrapped earlier this year by the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac), qualifying delinquent borrowers across the 
country will get a fresh shot at keeping their homes. Freddie Mac is one of the 
two largest investors in American home loans, and buys billions of dollars of 
new mortgages annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The new initiative works like this: Say you lost your job in mid-1993 after 
years of steady employment and excellent credit. You recently managed to find a 
new job, but at significantly lower pay. Squeezed by bills that never stop, 
you've fallen behind on virtually all your installment debts -- and are now 
four months delinquent on your home loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under typical circumstances, your lender -- or the mortgage company servicing 
your loan -- would be banging on the door with dire warnings about your 
impending foreclosure. But if your mortgage happened to be owned in whole or 
part by Freddie Mac, and your situation qualified under the new program, you 
could literally rewrite your loan and stop the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 You might be able to drop your interest rate from its current level by two, 
three or more percentage points. You might be able to roll up the interest 
payments you've missed and lump them onto your principal debt -- extending the 
term of the overall mortgage for a short period. 
</P>
<P>
 The specific details of the modification would be up to you and your mortgage 
servicer to work out. But the bottom line would be the same: You'd continue to 
own and live in your home, and your payments would better fit your current 
financial circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard D. Bryan, the Freddie Mac executive vice president overseeing the new 
program, says the idea is "to offer a new tool" to consumers whose delinquent 
payments not only expose them to foreclosure, but rule out their qualifying for 
any form of refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the tragedy for large numbers of families facing income squeezes, 
according to Bryan, is that refinancing their mortgages by two or three 
percentage points would solve part of their problem through lower monthly 
payments. But almost no lender will refinance a borrower who's missed three, 
four or more months of mortgage payments. Why lend new money to people who 
don't make monthly payments? 
</P>
<P>
 Freddie Mac's new program won't provide refinancing either, but instead will 
recast some of the basic terms of a consumer's existing, delinquent loan. Bryan 
emphasizes that it won't be for everyone experiencing financial problems. For 
starters, you've got to fit the following mold: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Your loan has to be a conventional (non-FHA or VA) first mortgage at least 
1 year old that's owned or contained in a mortgage security backed by Freddie 
Mac. The best way to find out is to contact your mortgage servicer -- the 
company to which you send (or used to send) your monthly payment -- and ask. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You have to be seriously delinquent -- 120 days behind or more. If you're 
90 days delinquent, your loan servicer might contact you to propose the new 
modification plan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Your mortgage has to have a loan-to-value (LTV) of 80% or more. That means 
your equity stake in the home has to be less than 20%. Bryan explained that if 
you have a bigger equity cushion, you may be able to qualify for a regular 
refinancing. The new program, by contrast, is restricted to the worst-hit of 
the walking wounded -- those cut off from refinancing relief. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You have to have some income -- enough, in fact, that your monthly debts 
are no higher than 42% of your stable monthly income. You may not be involved 
in bankruptcy proceedings at any stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Once your loan servicer agrees that you might qualify, you can expect the 
modification process to take 30 to 45 days. During this time the servicer will 
run a fresh credit check on you, do a title search on the property and get 
either a standard real estate appraisal or what's called a "BPO" -- a realty 
broker's "price opinion" on what the house is worth in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of these services will have to be borne by you -- not rolled into the 
revised loan amount or terms -- or paid for by the mortgage insurance company 
covering your loan. Private mortgage insurers "are very enthusiastic" about 
Freddie Mac's program, according to Bryan, even if it costs them a little money 
to assist with the modification process. Far better to pay a few hundred 
dollars for title and appraisal work, he said, than to pay out thousands on a 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of mortgage rate might you expect as a participant in the program? 
Say your current delinquent loan is at 10% interest and you qualify on all key 
criteria. You could walk away with an 8.125% restructured, 30-year loan. Sure 
that's about a percentage point higher than a borrower with a squeaky-clean 
credit history could get. 
</P>
<P>
 But by definition, you're no longer squeaky-clean. Compare it realistically 
with your other alternatives.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be tempted to cut long stems on early roses. Leave as much leaf area 
as possible to help produce a strong well developed bush. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's safe to set out seedlings of tomatoes, eggplant and peppers and to sow 
seeds of squash, beans, corn, etc. Remember to mulch!

CONDO Q & A: OWNER OF QUAKE-DAMAGED UNIT UNSURE ABOUT STAYING OR WALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Hickenbottom is a past president of 
the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), 
a national nonprofit research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My condominium association has levied a special assessment of $4,000 
to cover the cost of repairing earthquake damage to the common areas. I also 
must pay for damage inside my condominium unit. My unit has depreciated in 
value so that I now owe more on my mortgage that the unit is worth. It seems 
unwise to put more money into repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 I love my unit and the location is near my work. I don't really want to move. 
However, because of the financial situation, I have been advised by some 
friends to simply walk away from the unit and default on my loan and 
association assessment payments. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Walking away will have a dire, long-term affect on your credit rating 
and it won't win you any friends in your association. If the bank forecloses on 
your unit, the bank generally is not required to pay the unpaid special 
assessment. The burden of your regular assessments that remain unpaid until the 
bank foreclosure and the special assessment will have to be shared by the other 
owners in the long run. There may be a way for you to get some financial 
assistance so that you can stay in the unit that you love. Contact the Small 
Business Administration to see if refinancing is a possibility. You may be able 
to refinance your mortgage loan at the unit's current appraised value and 
obtain the assistance that you need for the special assessment and the damage 
to your unit.  
</P>
<P>
 Application to the SBA must be filed by May 15, 1994. The phone number is 
(800) 488-5323. How Can Board Hire Management Firm? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We live in a 36-unit condominium association. If all of the officers want 
to resign from the board of directors, can they hire a management company to 
take over the management of the association? Do all of the owners have the 
right to vote on hiring a management company? How does the voting take place? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The board cannot stop functioning. The association must have directors who 
are responsible for making decisions and setting policies even if a management 
company is hired. 
</P>
<P>
 You can find out if the board has the authority to hire a management company 
by reading your association's declaration of covenants, conditions and 
restrictions to make the decision without a vote of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cost of hiring management would increase the annual budget more than 
20%, then approval of the owners would be required. The board can call a 
special meeting of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 A quorum of more than 50% must attend the meeting. The budget increase must be 
approved by a majority of the voters who are in attendance at the meeting. Who 
Should Be Hired to Update Bylaws? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in a small homeowner association. Some of the owners would like to 
update the association's declaration and bylaws; however, there is no money in 
the budget for this purpose. Can we keep the cost down by hiring a paralegal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The board should adopt a budget that adequately covers legal expenses for 
the association. There are proper procedures that must be followed or you may 
find that the revised documents are unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, revision of the legal documents should only be done by an 
attorney who specializes in community association law. A community association 
manager or consultant would be able to assist you with the preliminary stages 
of the project but the attorney should review all of the documents and approve 
or write the sections that are being revised. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney will advise you about the approval procedure for amended or 
revised documents and handle the recordation with the county.

 Q: Is a condo a risky investment? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Based on appreciation, condominiums in the Los Angeles area have actually 
been a better investment than single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the fourth quarter of 1993, the median price paid for a single-family 
house in Los Angeles fell 3.7% from $181,000 to $176,000, according to La 
Jolla-based Dataquick Information Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same period, condo prices crept up 1.8% from a median price of 
$141,000 to $144,000. In some markets, condos even appreciated more. Dataquick 
statistics show that the median price paid for a condo in Los Angeles County 
appreciated 3.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "condos never had the run-up in values in the late 1980s like 
single-family homes did but they never really lost value either," said 
Dataquick analyst John Karevoll. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate writer William H. Pivar, author of "Real Estate Investing From A 
to Z" (1993, Probus Publishing Co., Chicago, Ill.), writes that while buyers 
typically prefer a single-family home, a condo is often a compromise dictated 
by cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The condominium community has worked hard in the last few years to overcome 
image problems that were brought on by disputes and lawsuits among condo owners 
and the developers. Now associations are becoming more sophisticated about 
property management and are taking steps to prevent legal problems.

FIVE KEYS TO GOOD HOME INSPECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN JAMES MARTIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Distributed by Universal Press 
Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the 26-year-old couple picked out the townhouse with the deep back yard, 
they knew they'd have to draw down their savings account to make the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 So when their realty agent suggested they spend $250 to have the property 
checked over by a home inspector, they took several deep sighs before accepting 
her advice. 
</P>
<P>
 But the thorough inspection more than paid for itself after the inspector 
found 17 items that needed correction and the sellers agreed to foot the $3,500 
bill for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good inspection is absolutely worth the cost," said Chris Cali, the listing 
agent for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when a home inspection doesn't yield an immediate financial reward -- as 
it did with the young couple -- it can be worth the expense, real estate 
specialists say. At the least, an inspection should reveal safety hazards and 
instruct the new owners on upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 "An inspection is the only chance people get at a verbal manual to the house," 
said Cali, who sells homes through the Re/Max Realty chain. 
</P>
<P>
 If problems are found, the home inspector's report can empower the buyers with 
a tool for negotiation. And if the problems prove serious, it can give them an 
escape hatch from their contract before it's too late. (Be sure to make any 
purchase offer contingent on your acceptance of a home inspection.) 
</P>
<P>
 But all home inspections are not created equal. Here are five keys to getting 
a top-flight inspection: 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 1: Exercise caution in selecting a home inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 A few inspectors have no real professional claim to the title. One way to 
navigate the field is to select an inspector affiliated with the American 
Society of Home Inspectors, based in Arlington Heights, Ill. To affiliate with 
ASHI requires that an inspector prove he can do the job, Cali said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a designation that shows he takes his occupation seriously," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most home buyers find an inspector through their real estate office. But a few 
agents, fearful of a deal falling apart, would rather you picked a "soft touch" 
inspector than one who is more rigorous, said D. R. Grempler, co-owner of 20 
offices in the Coldwell Banker chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realtors very often are disappointed to see the best home inspectors in town 
show up at the scene," Grempler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Good inspectors are often seasoned individuals who have been in the field 10 
years or longer, said J. D. Grewell, an ASHI inspector who owns his own firm. 
Among other things, experience teaches an inspector which local neighborhoods 
have solid construction and which do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is: Are you the inspector's first customer, his 250th or his 
1,500th?" Grewell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Referrals from friends, relatives and colleagues are probably your best source 
of good names. Ask your associates whether the inspectors they hired caught 
problems in their properties before they moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 2: Don't scrimp on what you pay for home inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an old saying that "only rich people can afford cheap furniture." 
Likewise, those with a tight budget can't risk buying a house laden with 
undiscovered defects -- such as a bad roof or heating system -- which they must 
pay to resolve later. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 3: Don't use a friend of acquaintance as your home inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times people shortchange themselves by thinking they can use a friend 
for an inspector," said Gene Gallagher, the broker-owner of an office in the 
ERA chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if your friend or relative is skilled in the art of home analysis, he is 
likely to be less objective than a neutral third party who is a professional in 
the field, Gallagher insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 4: Make sure you're at the house when the inspector comes and that 
you're given a written report right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Being there during the inspection should give you a fuller understanding of 
the inspector's findings than will a phone call from your agent later. 
</P>
<P>
 These days most home buyers give themselves an out from a contract on the 
basis of a home inspector's findings. But this out is typically good for only 
five to 10 days after the contract is signed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's during this window of time that you can make best use of your inspector's 
written report as a negotiating tool. After your contingency expires, it's 
usually too late to opt out or get the sellers' help to remedy a home's 
problems, Grewell points out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 5: Keep the findings of your home inspector in context. 
</P>
<P>
 In an occasional instance, a home inspector comes up with alarming results 
that warrant an anxiety attack. It's right to be concerned if the house has 
major electrical, plumbing, heating or air conditioning problems or if it is 
structurally unsound. 
</P>
<P>
 But in most cases, like that of the young couple, the inspector comes up with 
lesser issues. In this instance, for example, the 17 items on the inspector's 
list included broken kitchen faucets and loose shingles on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 It's distressing to find out that the house you've so carefully selected is 
imperfect. Often, inspectors see tears in the eyes of their clients. But common 
sense should tell you that all homes, like all people, have flaws, said Chris 
Cali, the RE/MAX agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember that there is no perfect house and many situations are solvable," 
she says.

VEGETABLE GARDENS DON'T NEED A LOT OF SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vegetable gardens don't need lots of space to produce a bountiful harvest.All 
you need is an area that gets about six hours of sun and a sturdy container to 
fill. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost any kind of vegetable can be grown in a container -- tomatoes, 
cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, carrots, sting beans and more. Even hanging 
baskets or wire baskets are a viable option. Cherry tomatoes, lettuce and herbs 
will do well in baskets. So even if you don't have loads of space, fresh 
vegetables are still possible.

MATERIAL GAINS; DOWNTOWN'S FASHION INSTITUTE PLACES 2,000 STUDENTS A YEAR IN 
JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MICHAEL LEW IS AN UP-AND-COMING fashion designer who has won accolades for his 
contemporary men's and women's clothing lines, which are sold at specialty 
stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But he likes to emphasize that he is a California designer, born and raised in 
Southern California, trained in Los Angeles and committed to staying here. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to know California has a (fashion) identity," said Lew, 27, a 
graduate of the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, based Downtown. 
"For some reason, we don't get the credit." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Los Angeles is now the top apparel market in the country, having 
surpassed New York in terms of annual retail sales, said Tonian Hohberg, 
founder and president of the institute, an accredited private college with an 
annual enrollment of 3,000. Hohberg points to the success of such major 
California-based manufacturers as Levi Strauss and Guess? and cites an April, 
1993, article in Apparel Industry Magazine that reported that the state's 
fashion-apparel industry has seen employment increase by more than 22,000 jobs 
since 1978, even as national apparel employment figures have declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Hohberg said that the institute -- which is celebrating its 25th anniversary 
-- and graduates such as Lew and his wife, Doris Tong, are integral parts of 
the L.A. fashion industry's past and future economic successes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, we're placing close to 2,000 students in full-time jobs" in the 
fashion industry, Hohberg said. "We're a big part of L.A.'s future. There's a 
magic to the city. It's certainly a city of tomorrow, and not of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 The large number of ethnic minorities and international students at the 
institute may also be key to the institute and the fashion industry's future 
success. The school has been a magnet for Asian students and, to a lesser 
extent, Latino students, even though Hohberg said the school does not actively 
recruit in foreign countries or in local minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of the students are minorities, Hohberg said, with more than 400 
students coming from 39 countries, a fact she attributes in part to Asia's 
reverence of the California fashion industry and closer ties being forged among 
Pacific Rim countries. Despite Los Angeles' image problems triggered by reports 
of crime, "Asia is still so excited about California," Hohberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 AND HOHBERG HERSELF REMAINS EXCITED AND optimistic about Los Angeles as a 
place to do business and run a school. The fact that the institute finally 
moved out of rented buildings three years ago and into a new $35-million 
building at Grand Avenue and 9th Street is a symbol of her commitment to and 
faith in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our industry is growing like crazy, and I really believe in Downtown L.A.," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Hohberg saw promise in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 26-year-old graduate of a merchandising college in her home state of 
Ohio, Hohberg in 1969 sought to open a fashion and merchandising college that 
truly prepared students for the apparel industry. She considered several 
locations -- New York, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta as well as Los Angeles -- 
but was won over by the interest, support and commitment of industry leaders 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in two Downtown classrooms with a handful of merchandising students, the 
institute today has three other campuses -- in San Francisco, Costa Mesa and 
San Diego -- in addition to the main campus at 919 S. Grand Ave., near the 
garment district and close to manufacturing firms. Students from all over the 
world work toward two-year associate of arts degrees in fashion design, 
interior design, apparel manufacturing management, cosmetics and fragrance 
merchandising, merchandise marketing, textile design, and visual 
presentation-space design. 
</P>
<P>
 A few students are selected each year from the graduating class for a 
third-year, advanced-study program in fashion design, interior design and 
theater costume. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is run like any other college, with general studies, night classes 
and even English as a Second Language courses. Tuition is comparable to that of 
other local private schools, and scholarships are available. 
</P>
<P>
 But what makes the institute different is the emphasis on hands-on vocational 
training in addition to academics. Students are encouraged from their first day 
of study to find part-time jobs in the industry. The school's placement office 
works diligently to help undergraduates, graduates and alumni find industry 
work, Hohberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials estimate that 96% of their 18,000 alumni work in the 
industry, most of them in Los Angeles and other parts of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Lew and Tong, who run their business, Imaginary Concepts, out of a 
studio near Little Tokyo, the school boasts a number of major alumni success 
stories. For example, Karen Kane's 14-year-old namesake clothing firm, based in 
the city of Vernon, today grosses $80 million annually. Marlene Stewart 
designed costumes for "Falling Down," "JFK," "Terminator II" and other movies. 
And Joyce Johnson designed Levi's Dockers for Men. 
</P>
<P>
 Hohberg also hires working industry professionals -- designers, pattern makers 
and the like -- to teach and keep students updated on trends and information. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lew: "You're not being taught by a dinosaur. We always had young, 
exciting teachers . . . in touch with current times. They taught me to be . . . 
way out there, very avant garde. 
</P>
<P>
 "During one project, one teacher told me, 'Mike, this looks like so-and-so. 
Pull into yourself and delve into your own identity.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The faculty also stresses learning the industry's technical aspects like no 
other fashion school, said Lew, who looked into several East Coast fashion 
colleges before deciding on the institute. "Someone has to teach you how to 
pattern. . . . They taught us to be business people and creative people." 
</P>
<P>
 Creativity is epitomized in the works of third-year students, who show off 
their creations to industry professionals and school supporters at an annual 
debut fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's 16 third-year stars, whose debut show was part of the institute's 
April 14 silver anniversary celebration, included Patricia Chan, a 21-year-old 
native of Hong Kong who lives in Chino Hills; Huyentran Pham, a 36-year-old 
native of Vietnam who resides in Orange with her three daughters; Karen Lee, a 
30-year-old native of Korea who lives in Irvine, and Yeng Thao, a 21-year-old 
Laotian who grew up in Fresno and now lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan won a scholarship from Bischoff, a Swiss company renowned for its rich 
lace. She incorporated the lace appliques in formal and wedding gowns of black 
and white that provide two looks -- and personalities -- in a single outfit 
through detachable full skirts that can be worn over shorter cocktail dresses 
and camisoles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, winner of a scholarship from designer Bob Mackie, also exhibited a split 
personality of sorts with her designs: plush, almost floppy overcoats and 
trousers in herringbone and dark hues, and sexy miniskirts and form-fitting 
vests in brown leather with zipper details. 
</P>
<P>
 Thao's evening-wear creations, almost dreamlike, evoke images of the Middle 
East. Using metallic trims, silk chiffon and other flowing fabrics in bright 
orange, green and purple, Thao fashioned halters and billowing skirts and 
jackets with long, flared sleeves, which were influenced, he said, by the 
costumes of traditional Chinese opera. 
</P>
<P>
 And Pham took the traditional clothing of her native country -- the ubiquitous 
ao dais worn by Vietnamese women -- and gussied them up with rich silk fabrics, 
lining and French lace at the neck and on the sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashioned as formal wear, Pham's ao dais are also much more comfortable than 
the traditional versions because of raglan sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to make the ao dai more high fashion," she said.

BUS RIDERS BRACING FOR MTA'S BUDGET CUTBACKS; TRANSPORTATION: FACED WITH A 
$126-MILLION DEFICIT, THE AGENCY IS WEIGHING OPTIONS THAT INCLUDE RAISING FARES 
AND ELIMINATING SOME LINES AND SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Six days a week, Blanca Iniguez boards two buses for a journey of about two 
hours from her South-Central residence to Santa Monica, where she is a maid in 
the home of a Westside doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 For Iniguez and tens of thousands of other Central Los Angeles residents, the 
bus system is a transportation lifeline. Unable to afford a car, they depend on 
the buses for everything from shuttling to work to going to the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 "With no buses, I would not be able to survive," said Iniguez, a Mexican 
immigrant who takes home about $550 a month for cleaning, cooking and washing 
clothes at the doctor's residence. 
</P>
<P>
 But she and other central city residents, who make up about half of the 
four-county bus system's 1.2 million daily riders, could be drastically 
affected by proposed fare hikes and cutbacks in service. Faced with a 
$126-million deficit, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is considering 
a variety of options to make up the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The options include raising bus fares from $1.10 to $1.50, canceling weekend 
service on more than 120 lines, reducing weekday service by 25% on selected 
routes, eliminating 55 school lines and ending late-night service on selected 
lines between 1 and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody in the agency, including the board of directors, hates to 
do it, but we have to do something to try to correct the (budget) situation," 
said MTA spokesman Rick Jager. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA, which recently conducted 14 public hearings citywide, is preparing a 
staff report with recommendations for the agency's board of directors, which is 
expected to make a decision by July 1, the beginning of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jager said the MTA is trying to spread the cutbacks around. By July, the 
agency will eliminate 515 administrative positions and cut in half the number 
of outside service contracts for a savings of more than $55.5 million, he said. 
The overall MTA budget for the current fiscal year is $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But MTA critics say the current proposals will still adversely affect bus 
riders, especially in bus-dependent Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, as buses and cars whizzed by, about 25 Echo Park 
residents protested the proposed fare hikes and service cutbacks at Sunset 
Boulevard near Echo Park Avenue. The demonstrators were members of Grupo Latino 
de Echo Park, a community organization that has been critical of bus service in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been riding the buses for 10 years. We need better service, not higher 
fares," said Gloria Hernandez, who uses the bus to get to her security guard 
job in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said she lost her last job because her bus was late on three 
occasions. "When (buses) don't show up, we have to wait another half hour. Our 
bosses get mad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said group president Barbara Gonzalez: "Most of the people who ride buses are 
low-income. They make $4.25 an hour. If you have five kids and a husband, how 
can you pay more for the bus?" 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 MTA survey indicated that 62% of bus riders earn less than $15,000 a 
year. Latinos comprised 47% of the riders, African Americans 23%, whites 19%, 
Asians 9% and Native Americans 1%, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 Others charge the agency is subsidizing more glamorous rail lines at the 
expense of the bus system, even though the buses carry about 20 times as many 
daily passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current fiscal year, according to MTA figures, $681 million is being 
spent for operating and upgrading the buses, compared with $938.6 million to 
operate and build new rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (MTA) board is saving money by way of bus service cuts," said Martin 
Hernandez, a transportation organizer with the Labor/Community Watch Dog, an 
advocacy group. "It's practically criminal what they're doing." Proposed 
Changes in Bus Service 
</P>
<P>
 Central City residents, who make up about half of the four-county MTA bus 
system's 1.2 million daily riders, could be drastically affected by proposed 
fare hikes and cutbacks in service. Here are some of those proposed changes:  
</P>
<P>
 * Cancellation of service between 1 and 5 a.m. on MTA bus lines 10, 18, 
28/83/84, 38, 76, 92, 105, 111, 180, 424 and 446. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduction or cancellation of service on lines 114 and 130. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancellation of lines 56, 410, 457 and 497, which largely parallel Metro 
Blue Line and Metrolink rail service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancellation of holiday service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancellation, modification or transfer of portions of 60 lines to municipal 
transit operators. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancellation of all school-related service, affecting 55 lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancellation or reassignment to another operator of 18 peak-hour express 
lines: 402, 406, 407, 410, 412, 418, 426, 427, 429, 442, 443, 457, 466, 489, 
497 and 576. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancellation or reassignment to another operator of the following lightly 
used lines: daily service on lines 56, 168, 202 and 250; Saturday service on 
lines 209, 225/226 and 254; Sunday service on lines 107, 124, 161, 167, 236 and 
245. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rerouting of 24 Downtown lines and restructuring of service on the El Monte 
Busway and the future Harbor Freeway Transitway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduction of service frequency on selected lines by 25%, and reductions in 
train service frequency.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; PASTOR SEARCHES FOR MISSING ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under cloudy skies last week, Pastor M. Andrew Robinson-Gaither began his walk 
through another local swap meet. For nearly two weeks, he has been hunting for 
five artworks taken from Faith United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I've called some of the art stores and described to them what was 
missing," said Robinson-Gaither, who began his search after reporting the 
artworks missing April 13 to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated the works are worth about $2,200. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is now inactive, said Sgt. Michael Kwan of the Lennox sheriff's 
station. Kwan said a lack of evidence has stalled further investigation, but he 
acknowledged that investigators failed to gather fingerprints at the church. 
</P>
<P>
 The art disappeared April 12 from the building next to the chapel. 
Robinson-Gaither said he realized that the art was missing about 11 a.m. when 
he looked up to find that an African image of Christ, matted in a gold-leaf 
frame, was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked around and said, 'Oh my God,' and then I noticed two other (works) 
in the hall were missing. Then I went to the big window and noticed it was 
missing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five artworks, including a print of Cornell Barnes' "Famous Faces," 
represent more than a material loss to Robinson-Gaither. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been going through a transition for the past five years of trying to 
make our church art reflect our congregation," said the pastor of the church at 
1713 W. 108th St., whose congregation of 200 is predominantly African American. 
"The art represents our Afrocentric thrust here. It represents our 
understanding that our liberation is grounded in our understanding that our 
liberator, Jesus Christ, looked like us." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson-Gaither said that in addition to alerting merchants of the theft, he 
has been working to get the word out to the community. Several calls were made 
to KJLH-FM 102.3 during a Saturday morning public affairs program. 
</P>
<P>
 "A caller getting off the topic happened to mention the art was taken and how 
awful it was. And that prompted someone else to call who said how awful it 
was," said Jacquie Stephens, the station's director of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Robinson-Gaither: "Many of us are kind of shattered because we open our 
building to all people out of our belief that this building belongs to the 
community. And that someone knowing of our openness would take this art . . . 
they took all the signature art." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; BANK PRAISED FOR OPENING AREA OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Community leaders last week heralded the opening of a Coast Federal Bank home 
loan office in the historic Dunbar Hotel, noting that it is the first major 
lending institution to locate in the area in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key thing here is that Coast Federal Bank has made a commitment to come 
into the area, and we have a community here with dire banking needs," said 
Anthony Scott, executive director of the Dunbar Economic Development Corp., 
which helped coordinate the move. "This is the first major bank to come and 
build on Central Avenue in decades." 
</P>
<P>
 The small, unassuming office at 4223 S. Central Ave. will begin taking 
applications this week. It will provide home loans for moderate- to low-income 
residents in South-Central, where the average home price is about $100,000. 
Bank officials said one lender's program will allow buyers to purchase a home 
with just a 5% down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the grand opening, community leaders and city officials said they hoped the 
loan office will help pave the way for other banks to come into South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people will be watching to see what happens with this 
branch," said Paul Hudson, president of Broadway Federal Savings & Loan Assn., 
a South-Central bank. "If Coast does well here, it'll do away with the idea 
that you can't make money in South-Central." 
</P>
<P>
 Misperceptions and concern over default rates have long kept lenders at bay, 
Hudson said, because some lending institutions believe they are taking a higher 
risk on loans in areas such as South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those stereotypes are inaccurate and have led to people saying, 'Let's 
stay out,' " Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Hunt, president of Coast Federal Bank, agreed, adding that lenders suffer 
greater losses in more affluent areas where homes are more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The type of loans made in these areas tend to perform better, and the default 
rates are much lower. It's nowhere near what it is in affluent areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, bank officials and community leaders said, they will focus on getting 
the message out and inviting residents to stop by the office.

 The state attorney general's office is trying to bar a woman and her grandson 
from operating a room-and-board center, alleging the two are operating an adult 
day-care center without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly five months, State Deputy Atty.Tammy Chung has been seeking a 
preliminary injunction against Geneva Church and Mark Gory, arguing the clients 
at Ephesians Haven require supervised care. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the state Department of Social Services revoked Church's license 
at the Sharon Lynn Guest Home at 12040 S. Broadway, citing numerous violations 
including the lack of hot water. More than half of the 11 clients were moved to 
the Ephesians Haven at 1925 Hobart St., a room-and-board facility operated by 
Gory. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Chung again went before Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne seeking an 
injunction, but Wayne postponed the hearing after defense attorneys argued they 
needed more time to prepare their case. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung said she has additional testimony from doctors who have treated former 
clients of the Sharon Lynn Guest Home who are now at the Hobart Street 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, Geneva Church got a declaration from a medical doctor who made a 
general statement that (the clients) are capable of independent living," said 
Chung. "So this time, we've got the medical opinion to contradict what the 
other doctor said." 
</P>
<P>
 The case is expected to go before Wayne on May 17. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 The Buffalo Soldiers helped settle the West with little notice, but the U.S. 
Postal Service is hoping a new stamp commemorating them will bring recognition 
to the little-known black cavalry unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the Postal Service issued a 29-cent stamp depicting four African 
American soldiers on horseback.The stamp pays tribute to the 9th and 10th 
Cavalry created in the late 1860s, which served in California, Texas and the 
Western territories. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stamp will help tell the story everywhere," said Larry Dozier, a 
spokesman for the Postal Service. "There are so many people who have never 
heard of the (Buffalo Soldiers)." 
</P>
<P>
 The stamp premiered in Los Angeles at the California Afro-American Museum -- a 
day after it was officially unveiled April 22 in Dallas during the 
Afro-American League United for Success national convention.  
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service will issue 185 million of the stamps. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; 4 CANDIDATES TO FILE VOTER FRAUD 
CHARGES

<P>
 Four candidates who lost the race for two seats in the municipal election last 
month intend to challenge the balloting, alleging that the newly elected 
council members used intimidation, bribery and other illegal tactics in their 
campaigns, their attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Peter Wallin said he will represent former incumbents Rosa Hernandez 
and Josefina Macias and challengers Hugo Escalera and Maria Victoria Martinez 
in a complaint against newly elected council members Maria S. Chacon and Ramiro 
Morales to be filed with the County Clerk by May 16. Any challenge to an 
election must be filed within 30 days of its certification. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I've heard there was a concentrated effort on the part of (Chacon 
and Morales') No-Rezoning Committee to electioneer, which is against the law, 
and to carry ballots from voters, and such practices should invalidate those 
ballots," said Wallin, who in 1992 resigned as Bell Gardens' longtime city 
attorney after the No-Rezoning Committee organized a successful campaign to 
oust four white council members. He now practices with the Santa Monica-based 
firm Wallin, Kress, Reisman, Price & Pettit. 
</P>
<P>
 The four candidates have alleged that the No-Rezoning Committee bullied voters 
and engaged in other heavy-handed tactics, ranging from falsifying absentee 
ballots to illegally registering non-citizens and encouraging them to vote with 
absentee ballots. The new council members denied all charges of voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something we're making up because we're sore losers," Martinez said. 
"Other people are seeing it too." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are collecting more information to turn over to the Los Angeles 
County district attorney, Escalera said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are telling us that 'No-Rezoning was there when we voted, they told us 
what holes to punch, they gave us a stamp, then took the ballot with them and 
said thank you very much,' " he said. "If we let it go it will happen every 
election. . . . The problem is a lot people don't want to talk. They're 
afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Chacon vehemently denied the allegations, which dogged her throughout the 
campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 "Those are lies," Chacon said. "We ran a clean campaign and I feel sorry for 
the people who are throwing those allegations because it's hurting our Hispanic 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Chacon admitted to providing voters with stamps to mail their 
absentee ballots. Caren Daniels-Meade, a spokeswoman for the secretary of 
state's office, said handing out stamps is a violation of the Election Code, 
but is rarely prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels-Meade said other allegations had "been brought to our attention, but 
we haven't directly begun an investigation." Reports of illegal registration or 
harassment of voters can be made by calling (800) 345-VOTE, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the candidates are to win the election challenge, they must prove that any 
illegally cast vote affected the outcome of the election, officials said. 
No-Rezoning Committee candidates won the April 12 race by a margin of more than 
2 to 1, relying heavily on more than 900 absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 It is "highly unlikely" that any voter fraud is widespread enough to affect 
the outcome of such a landslide, said Wendell Patterson, manager of voter 
records for the County Registrar. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office would not confirm whether the allegations are 
being investigated. MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; SEX RISKS STRESSED IN STUDENT PROGRAM

<TEXT>
<P>
 At South Gate High, where an average of one girl each school day reports 
pregnancy and losing one's virginity on prom night is not uncommon, student 
leaders decided their peers needed a crash course on abstinence and safer sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The leadership group produced "Face the Facts -- It Could Be You," an hourlong 
multimedia brushup on pregnancy, AIDS and other consequences that sexually 
active teens face, and presented it to 800 students two days before this year's 
prom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows what goes on that night," said Ezequiel Navarro, 18. "A lot 
of people think about having fun but they see it in the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to reach teens in a language they would listen to, "Face the Facts" 
featured a humorous but pointed theater presentation, rap music and a clip from 
the film "Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the student audience hooted during the message-laden comedy sketch, 
many slouched in their seats and looked away while a Planned Parenthood 
representative told them that getting pregnant would probably mean putting 
their dreams on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, about 72% of all high school seniors have had sexual intercourse, 
according to statistics from Planned Parenthood. In Los Angeles County, a 
teen-ager gives birth every 7 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate High documented 121 pregnancies between July, 1993, and April of 
this year, said school nurse Wilma Wilson.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's real shocking because we have the highest attendance rate in the 
district and the lowest dropout rate, but we have 150 girls pregnant," said 
Cindy Rosales, 17, senior class vice president. "I have five friends here at 
school who are pregnant and one who had her baby yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Audience members agreed that "Face the Facts" was an effective way to get the 
message across: There is no such thing as safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "School classes on health and sex education don't get it across as well," said 
Navarro. "Nobody pays attention because they're so boring. . . . Everybody 
feels it won't happen to them. (This program) makes you realize it can happen 
and you should be careful." 
</P>
<P>
 High schools should provide more programs to educate students on teen 
pregnancy, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases in the same way junior 
high schools stress awareness of drug and alcohol abuse, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just ignorance," said Rosie Ayala, 18, one of the organizers. "We need 
to change it to awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala, who is student body vice president, doubted the program would deter 
some of her classmates from having unsafe sex on prom night. But, she added, 
surely students would now think about more than romance at the annual dance: 
"They'll have (the program) in mind. 'It Could Be You.' " MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; STUDENTS GET LESSON FROM BALLET TROUPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some fidgeted, some giggled, some sat silent with anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
 All eyes were fixed, in wide-eyed awe, on the stage at the majestic Orpheum 
Theatre as the heavy curtain lifted. There, eight ballet dancers stood poised, 
clad in leotards and smiling at the audience of several hundred elementary 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
 A roar of ooohs and aaaahs erupted from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 And so began a recent ballet lecture and demonstration provided to local 
children by the Joffrey II Dancers, the training troupe of the Joffrey Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to educate and expose inner-city youths to the ballet, the New 
York-based Joffrey II and the local Golden State Minority Foundation, a 
nonprofit minority-support organization, held a week of performance-lectures at 
the Orpheum Theatre on Broadway for 5,000 students from 18 schools throughout 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 During the half-hour sessions, Joffrey II artistic director Jeremy Blanton 
explained ballet steps, classroom exercises and techniques to the audience as 
the 15- to 23-year-old members of the company demonstrated. "Dancers never 
finish their training," Blanton told the audience. "They never finish going to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton stressed the grueling hours dancers spend on exercises and rehearsals. 
He and the dancers -- four women and four men -- then conducted an impromptu 
class, with the artistic director calling out steps and positions such as the 
plie (a knee bend) , pas de deux (partner moves), arabesque (balancing on one 
leg as the other is extended back) and one-foot pirouette twirls, which 
elicited a "Whoa!" from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you hear me saying funny words, that's because it's in French, because the 
ballet began in the courts of Louis XIV in France," Blanton explained. Audience 
members were later heard trying to imitate Blanton as he called out steps in a 
melodic chant. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight dancers performed excerpts from various ballets and, finally, the 
company answered questions from the audience, including, "Is it hard to lift 
the girl?" and "Does it hurt?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The children are very responsive and attentive," said Blanton. "Hopefully, 
the children of today are the audience of tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The outreach program also provides the apprentice dancers a positive 
performance experience. "Their reactions are so sincere," said Tara Lee, 18, a 
Connecticut teen who joined the troupe in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think they're going to be laughing at you because they're so young, but 
they're really interested," said Amy Smith, 19, of Atlanta, who joined the 
troupe in January. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15-year-old Sean Stewart, the youngest troupe member, the importance of 
the outreach program is clear; he became hooked on dance when he first saw a 
performance at age 10. Before that, "I said, 'Dance is for girls,' " said 
Stewart, a Northern California native. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, all the boys and girls in teacher Ruth Hirose's second-grade class at 
Manchester Avenue Elementary School in South-Central were particularly 
impressed by the male dancers' performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was exciting when the boy lifted the girl up with his hands and 
the boy turned around," said Cristian Carrillo, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were strong," said Deibe Chavez, also 8. "I wish I could be one of 
them." IRIS YOKOI

 Michael Javier figures that whether you refer to it as arte, mei shu or 
bijutsu , art is a universal means of expression that brings together people of 
different backgrounds, ethnicities and ages. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of art as expression is natural for immigrants who bring not only a 
"wealth of culture" from their native lands but also poignant personal tales of 
leaving their homes and trying to fit into a new country, Javier said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Javier, an artist who teaches English as a Second Language at Evans 
Community Adult School, 717 N. Figueroa St., occasionally incorporates a 
drawing or painting session into his ESL classes and often takes his immigrant 
students on field trips to art galleries and museums. By doing so, Javier said 
he has learned how newcomers have been limited in their expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his students have told him after first visits to the Museum of 
Contemporary Art that "I didn't know I was allowed to be in this part of town," 
he said. And Evans itself offers no art classes in its course offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 So Javier is on a passionate, one-man quest to get an art program established 
at Evans, which annually draws 15,000 immigrants seeking to learn English and 
other skills to fit into American society. Javier wants to begin an 
extracurricular art class and open a student gallery on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really absurd that the Los Angeles Unified School District has 
this school -- the largest adult school in the country -- and there's nothing 
here (for art students)," said Javier, who has taught at the school for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel art breaks down barriers. It's my hope that by exposing them to 
art and giving them art expression . . . they'll become more familiar with the 
country where they have chosen to live (and) feel more comfortable expressing 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans' only art class -- a basic, comprehensive fine-arts course -- was 
scrapped in 1988 because of budget constraints. Javier said the school district 
has told him it still cannot afford to include art in the school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier has therefore proposed an extracurricular art class that will be 
offered throughout the day so students can drop by between regular classes for 
instruction in sketching, painting, photography, mixed media and other arts. 
"Like an open studio workshop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wants to establish a student gallery in the lobby of the school's main 
building at Sunset Boulevard and Figueroa Street. Javier has already turned the 
lobby's bare walls into a makeshift display area for paintings created by his 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The major challenge is money, which he needs to buy materials such as paint, 
brushes, paper, cameras and film for the classes and frames and hardware for 
the gallery. He estimates the cost at $10,000 to $20,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one class of 50 students and just to do a painting activity, I spent 
more than $100 on brushes, paint and paper," Javier said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has raised about $1,000 by holding small-scale art sales of posters, 
paintings and frames donated by colleagues or found at secondhand stores.  
</P>
<P>
 He continues to seek other grants, funding sources and donors. He has drafted 
a list of materials and a donation form. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans school officials, while supportive of Javier's desires, cannot offer 
much financial assistance, said Principal Francis Marsala, who said an art 
program would benefit the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art . . . is good for the soul," Marsala said. "The Chinese have a saying 
that if you have two cents, buy a loaf of bread with one and a flower with the 
other." IRIS YOKOI

 It didn't matter if they bogeyed or birdied, the real winners weren't even on 
the course that day. 
</P>
<P>
 A record 140 players teed off in the sixth annual Andy Vargas Scholarship Golf 
Tournament and raised $10,000 for the graduates of Glen Alta Elementary School 
in Montecito Heights. The money will go to the school's alumni who earn their 
high school diplomas and are accepted to a vocational school, community college 
or university. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like a dream come true," Vargas said, as he opened the tournament 
amid sunny skies and good humor April 22 at the Montebello Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, who lives in Monterey Park, has long been a supporter of Eastside 
schools and charitable causes. He adopted Glen Alta, at 3410 Sierra St., 
through the Los Angeles Unified School District's Adopt-a-School program in 
1985 and established the scholarship fund with proceeds from the recycling of 
aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, Vargas won the $5.28-million grand prize in California's 
Super Lotto game, enabling him to donate more money to the fund, starting with 
$20,000 from his first check. Additional funds have been raised through his 
annual golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, scholarship money will be awarded to 10 Lincoln High School 
graduates who attended Glen Alta, said Vera Padilla, Lincoln career adviser and 
work experience coordinator. Last year, the first time Vargas handed out 
scholarships, 17 former Glen Alta students were recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 15 other students from Glen Alta who would have been in this year's 
Lincoln graduating class, she said, but they dropped out because of pregnancy 
or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does help," Padilla said of the scholarship. "But what happens to those 
that it doesn't help? There really isn't a lot of mentoring for them. They're 
in limbo when they get into junior high and high school. They're lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarships are awarded according to the schools that students attend. 
Those who plan to attend community college or a trade school will receive $500; 
those going to a California State school will receive $750; and students who 
plan to attend a University of California institution receive $1,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Glen Alta Principal James A. Allen, explaining that grades are not considered 
in the selection process, said, "We try to promote productive adults." MARY

<P>
 For the third time this year in the area, gunmen posed as police officers to 
gain entry to a home, where they robbed a family of money, jewelry and a TV 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the four Latino men showed a star-shaped badge after ringing the 
doorbell last week at a Lincoln Heights home and said they had a search 
warrant.When they were let in, the gunmen ordered the occupants -- a man, a 
woman and a man who lives in the rear of the house -- to the ground and covered 
them with a blanket, said Los Angeles Police Department Detective John Vach. 
They then handcuffed them and ransacked the house. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured, but the men got away with about $2,000 worth of 
merchandise and cash, Vach said. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department's Hollenbeck Division received reports of similar 
robberies in January and March within a mile of the home where the April 24 
robbery occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims said the robbers had Cuban or South American accents and spoke 
both English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspect was described as 50 to 60 years old, about 6 feet tall with short, 
curly gray hair and green eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The second suspect is 40 to 45, with tight, curly black hair, and the third 
gunman was described as 5 feet, 3 inches tall in his late 20s. Vach did not 
have a description of the fourth suspect. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; CREDIT HELP OFFERED FOR HOME BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little-known free service to help potential home buyers get their credit and 
records in order and apply for home loans marks its 17th year with a renewed 
emphasis on helping to stabilize inner-city neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Home Loan Counseling Center, a private nonprofit organization, is funded 
by 18 savings and loan institutions mandated under the federal Community 
Reinvestment Acts of the 1970s. Banks and real estate agents had been 
abandoning these areas, and residents had suffered the effects of redlining, 
said Gloria Ancira, the center's director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody speaks up for these areas," Ancira said. "We need to have a lot of 
representation. We need seminars and services. And we need a lot of education." 
</P>
<P>
 The center's main office (3982 S. Figueroa St.) and the Lincoln Heights office 
(163 S. Avenue 24) last year served 6,277 people, helping the vast majority of 
them to straighten out their credit and to prevent defaults and foreclosures. 
Eleven of the center's clients last year were approved for $1.3 million in home 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem for first-time home buyers is bad credit, said Ancira, who 
works with a staff of four. People often do not realize the impact that paying 
their bills on time has on their chances of securing a home loan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria and Jose Leon bought their house in 1989 but needed help in refinancing 
because their payments were higher than their office-cleaning jobs could 
support. They received help and now pay $300 less per month. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us it was difficult because we didn't know anything about the process," 
said Maria Leon. "They helped us with the transactions and now it's a little 
better for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ancira sees the service she provides as helping neighborhoods and the families 
that live there because once parents learn good credit habits, they will pass 
that on to their children. The opposite -- bad credit habits -- also get passed 
down and can create a domino effect in neighborhoods, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She often finds herself speaking up for applicants who have been turned down 
for not having green cards or who have a few blemishes on their credit report. 
</P>
<P>
 She sets up seminars in neighborhoods and schools to inform people of the 
process of buying a house: the down payment, closing costs and supplemental tax 
that arrives 12 to 18 months later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mission is to encourage home ownership and retention by providing 
counseling and educational seminars," she said. "Anywhere that you see a lot of 
renting going on, the neighborhood deteriorates. If we want to preserve the 
neighborhoods, we have to do this."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: LEIMERT PARK; SCHOLARSHIPS FROM LIQUOR FIRMS DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives of a malt liquor manufacturer and a retail liquor association 
are funding scholarships for central Los Angeles students, but few in the 
community are toasting their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a buyout," said Celestine Palmer, a Crenshaw resident and president of 
the Dorsey Crenshaw Youth Action League, a political action group. "I am glad 
they're giving something back to the community that supports them, but I almost 
resent it. I would rather they give money to advertisements against drinking 
than this." 
</P>
<P>
 But those in the liquor business maintain that the scholarships are simply a 
goodwill gesture to the population that best supports them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week at the Regency West club in Leimert Park, Olde English 800 hosted a 
reception for the California Package Store and Tavern Owners Assn., a group of 
more than 250 black business owners in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 For four years, the group has awarded scholarships to students at many public 
and private high schools, including Jefferson, Fremont, Crenshaw, Dorsey, St. 
Bernard's, Venice, Inglewood and Lynwood. Thanks to contributions from Olde 
English totaling more than $18,000 and other funds from grocery, beverage and 
tobacco industries, 42 students received between $1,000 and $1,250 each for 
college and trade school expenses. Four of the recipients are Crenshaw and 
Dorsey seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarships were distributed in the Los Angeles area on the basis of Olde 
English's regional sales volume, said Bernard Tarver, the company's West Coast 
brand manager. He said that his parent company, Milwaukee-based Pabst Brewing 
Co., has received virtually no negative feedback from the community that often 
receives the lion's share of the association's scholarships, South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to send out the message to other corporations that if they're 
profiting from a certain community, they have a moral obligation to give back 
to it," Tarver said. "I've always been committed to returning dollars to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as far as selling alcohol goes, the important thing is that the sales are 
moderated and regulated properly." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver also pointed out that the association's scholarships usually don't go 
to A students, but to academically average students who are making efforts to 
improve themselves and their community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraging students who otherwise wouldn't get encouragement," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Colquitt, president of the organization's scholarship committee, said that 
the program ensures that liquor companies don't "just pick the fruit and run." 
</P>
<P>
 "We practically insist that they give back. They're making money. They have to 
do something," Colquitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Crenshaw High Principal Yvonne Noble, the benefit of such encouragement 
pales in comparison to the societal harm done by the consumption of malt 
liquor. by black youths. 
</P>
<P>
 When the announcement of the scholarships came across her desk, Noble said she 
quietly put it aside rather than inform the school's college adviser. "It's 
definitely a double-edged sword," she said. "Too many kids drink, and too many 
are thrown out of school for that reason. It is difficult to ignore the money. 
. . . I admit it puts me at odds with myself. It's a great marketing 
technique." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassandra Clark, a Southwest Los Angeles parent who has supported community 
efforts to limit alcohol sales and the number of liquor stores in 
South-Central, was less ambivalent: "Malt liquor is not a recreational 
beverage, it's a drug. The liquor industry should be putting that money into 
alcohol-abuse programs rather than giving it to kids. It's sending the message, 
'Take our money, buy our product.' Not all money is good money." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-CITY; SWAP MEET FOES VOW MORE PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wilshire Area Community Coalition and other neighborhood groups vow to 
continue to demonstrate every weekend outside the Midtown Shopping Center in an 
effort to replace the swap meet there with a more upscale department store. 
</P>
<P>
 The swap meet sits in a shopping center that will soon include an Alpha-Beta 
supermarket and a Sav-On Drugs store in addition to new retail shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Jim Young, who holds a long-term lease for the center, plans to 
remodel the 40-vendor swap meet, improve its layout and appearance, and rename 
it Midtown Shops. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marie Gaines, president of the neighborhood coalition, said that many 
residents around the shopping center in the 4700 block of West Pico Boulevard 
feel that a Target or WalMart store would be better suited to their 
middle-class community. "We want a store with quality merchandise that serves 
the entire community," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 At community meetings and hearings, Young has said that department store 
chains have told him that the site is too small. Moreover, Young said he must 
honor the existing lease agreements with the swap meet vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Nate Holden, who talked to about 30 demonstrators on April 23, 
said that because the swap meet, which has been open for several years, has 
permits the city can do little about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could try to work out a deal to get it out of there, but anything we do 
would have to be with the concurrence of the property owner and the vendors," 
said the 10th District councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by demonstrators for advice, Holden said, "Just keep doing what you're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines said her group has collected more than 1,000 signatures on a petition 
urging Young, the city and RLA, formerly Rebuild LA, to "aggressively recruit a 
recognized anchor store to open a store in place of the swap meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Roderick Sykes, who lives in nearby St. Elmo Village, said neighbors are tired 
of "swap meets, liquor stores and auto shops totally dominating our community. 
When does it stop? Someone has to have the guts to say, 'No more.' " JAKE

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; KBLA'S 'VOICES' TRIES TO CUT THE STATIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For two hours on Sunday nights, the city's dissonant chorus of multiethnic 
voices can tune in to a radio talk show designed to put everyone on the same 
wavelength. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, everyone. This is Clara Young and welcome once again to 'Voices of Los 
Angeles.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With that introduction, Young, the host and producer, launches into the topic 
of the week. Sometimes it's heavy -- domestic violence, teen pregnancy, gangs, 
interracial relationships -- and sometimes it covers lighter fare like sports 
or ethnic comedians. 
</P>
<P>
 She began the show about seven months ago to "help each of us understand each 
other and to encourage people to come forth and talk about problems as well as 
their pride in their cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 For Young, a 33-year-old bilingual journalist who has worked for KCOP-TV 
Channel 13, the Korea Times, KSCI-TV Channel 18 and as a production manager for 
NBC Sports' 1988 Summer Olympics coverage, "Voices of Los Angeles" is a labor 
of love for which she receives minimal remuneration. "I call it my hobby," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcast from 9-11 p.m. in English on KBLA-AM 1580, Young's show has 
attracted an audience eager to hear minorities on the air or curious about 
perspectives different from their own. 
</P>
<P>
 KBLA leases most of its airtime to Radio Korea for Korean-language 
programming, but Young has carved out an English-language niche with her Sunday 
night show and her "Korean-American Hour," which airs at 6 a.m. Saturdays and 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter show provides a forum for young Korean Americans -- cultural 
hybrids shaped by often competing influences and pressures -- to talk about 
problems and experiences their parents may have trouble comprehending. Young, 
who was born in Seoul, Korea, moved to the United States with her family when 
she was 9. 
</P>
<P>
 She casts a wider net Sundays, in search of topics, guests and callers 
spanning the city's spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people want more information because they are really wondering what 
other ethnic groups are like," Young said. "We make jokes about the stereotypes 
that always come up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get the average person's perspective because most people say that 
so-called community leaders don't speak for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Listeners tell Young that the show often reveals similarities between people 
of different backgrounds. "People will be listening to someone talk and they'll 
go, 'Huh. That's interesting. I didn't know that about Koreans or African 
Americans.' And maybe next time they'll be more open-minded," she said. JAKE

COVER STORY; ECONOMIC RUSSIAN ROULETTE; GETTING INSURANCE IN CENTRAL LOS 
ANGELES IS EVEN TOUGHER SINCE THE RIOTS. AS MANY AS HALF THE BUSINESSES IN THE 
AREA MAY BE WITHOUT POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SHOULD A MAJOR FIRE OR OTHER CALAMITY BEFALL HIS Boyle Heights auto parts 
store, Arturo Velazquez would see 21 years of work go down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last June, his business was insured for several years by a 
Caribbean-based company that was one of about 10 firms illegally selling 
policies in California. The bogus companies were exposed in the aftermath of 
the riots, when more than 100 business owners wound up with worthless claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Velazquez says, several insurance carriers have refused to cover 
him, saying that the stoves of a small diner next to his store at 1st and St. 
Louis streets create an excessive fire risk. Those companies willing to provide 
fire and liability coverage have quoted annual premiums of about $3,000, nearly 
twice his old rate and far more than the 65-year-old entrepreneur can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to hope that nothing happens," Velazquez says, "or else you're 
out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Obtaining insurance -- whether for automobile, home or business -- has for 
years been an iffy proposition in Central Los Angeles. Today, two years after 
the riots left a swath of destruction across the central city, commercial 
insurance has become even more difficult to purchase. As many as half of the 
businesses in the area may be uninsured, based on surveys of area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Two insurance carriers active in selling commercial policies in the inner city 
went out of business because of riot-related claims, and other firms that 
historically have been skittish about writing policies in the area are even 
more so now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely, the industry has become a lot more leery," said Javier Rodriguez, 
an independent South Gate insurance agent who has been selling policies on the 
Eastside and in southeast Los Angeles County since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists and brokers say the lack of commercial insurance can stifle 
business growth and retard economic development. For instance, even those 
businesses that can get insurance in Central Los Angeles face premium costs 15% 
to 30% above that charged in more affluent parts of the city, creating little 
incentive for them to move to or open new branches in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of carriers in Central Los Angeles has fostered veritable insurance 
monopolies for the area, contributing to inflated premiums, critics of the 
industry say. Further exacerbating the problem, they say, is that the void left 
by the departure of many legitimate insurance carriers has frequently been 
filled by unlicensed agents and companies that knowingly sell bogus policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall problem, according to state officials and insurance watchdog 
groups, is the result of years of redlining, the practice by which companies 
refuse to sell policies in poor or predominantly minority areas. Carriers 
redline by declining to write policies and refusing to contract with minority 
independent agents in certain ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that the insurance industry blatantly discriminates against the 
inner city," state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said last month at a 
California Department of Insurance public hearing on redlining in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance industry representatives contend that the problem is not redlining 
but affordability. Because low-income neighborhoods often have higher crime 
rates and other risks, they say, premiums are more expensive and beyond the 
reach of many residents and business owners.  
</P>
<P>
 "Redlining may indeed exist. But if it does, it is to a limited extent and is 
far overshadowed by the affordability issue," said Richard Wiebe, the 
Sacramento-based spokesman for the American Insurance Assn., which represents 
270 carriers nationwide. "I have yet to hear anyone at any public hearing say 
they could not obtain insurance" because of redlining. 
</P>
<P>
 George Bivins, a board member of the Black Business Assn. and an independent 
agent who has been selling insurance for 25 years in the central city, said 
that some insurance carriers redline Central Los Angeles by not allowing their 
policies to be sold by independent agents in the area at any price. 
Affordability is an issue, he said, because it is a direct result of redlining. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He added that independent agents sometimes take the brunt of criticism for 
high costs. "We just have to try to explain to them that the rates are 
established by the company and not us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bivins says that when he worked for Farmers in the late 1970s and early '80s, 
the carrier told him that he could not have his office in Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told my office had to be in Playa del Rey," Bivins told lawmakers at 
the recent hearing on redlining. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Farmers, which along with other agencies has been openly 
criticized by state officials for allegedly discriminatory practices, denied 
Bivins' assertion. "I cannot believe that is true," said Farmers spokesman John 
Millen, adding that brokers are independent contractors and can locate 
anywhere. "They can set up their office where they want to. They go where they 
can make money." 
</P>
<P>
 Redlining is difficult to prove because the state mandates few disclosure 
requirements for insurance companies. But under new state insurance regulations 
proposed by Garamendi that become effective this month, carriers will be 
required to file annual reports detailing the ethnic and racial breakdown of 
their customers, the number of policies they decline to write in specific areas 
and language skills of their agents, among other information. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major milestone in the fight against redlining," said Bob Gnaizda, 
general counsel for the Greenlining Coalition, an alliance of minority and 
consumer organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other measures -- a state bill sponsored by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles) and federal legislation by Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II 
(D-Massachusetts), both of whom attended the Insurance Department's hearings 
last month in Exposition Park -- would require similar disclosures by the 
insurance industry to determine the extent of redlining. 
</P>
<P>
 For small-business owners such as Velazquez, the issue is more than a 
philosophical debate over redlining versus affordability. Unable to obtain 
comprehensive coverage for whatever reason, they liken each workday to a game 
of economic Russian Roulette, where any unforeseen tragedy could spell the end 
for them and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a neighborhood store. We don't make that much," says Velazquez, who 
along with his 21 years in business has about $80,000 invested in his 
Mechanical Auto Parts store, which he operates with his wife, Eva. "We can't 
afford to pay too much for insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 He has been uninsured since his broker informed him almost a year ago that he 
was no longer covered and would have to switch insurance companies and pay 
twice the annual amount of his previous policy, or about $3,000. He said the 
broker did not explain why he would have to obtain new insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 His former policy was with Pacific Fire & Marine Insurance, a Caribbean-based 
carrier that had been writing policies in the area without a license. The 
California Department of Insurance last year declared the firm ineligible to do 
business in the state. The department has no data on whether policyholders were 
able to collect losses from Pacific Fire & Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 Velazquez was unaware that the company was illegally operating in the state 
until it was pointed out in a recent interview.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be damned!" he exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he paid a $1,668 annual premium for several years, Velazquez counts 
himself lucky because he never suffered insurance losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Many others were not so fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, 110 small-business owners -- most of them Korean Americans -- 
filed a lawsuit against about 50 insurance firms, wholesale brokers and agents 
who allegedly reneged on about $15 million in unpaid claims after the 1992 
riots. The lawsuit is pending in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the merchants is Young Ki Kim, 47, who saw a business worth about 
$400,000 go up in flames when his liquor store at 95th and Figueroa streets 
burned to the ground the first night of the unrest. Kim had assumed that his 
annual $1,000 premium covered him for up to $550,000 in liability and fire 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 His insurance carrier was First Assurance & Casualty Co. Ltd. of the Turks and 
Caicos Islands, a small British colony in the West Indies. The firm was 
declared insolvent last year and ruled ineligible to do business in the state 
by the Department of Insurance. The lawsuit claims that the carrier is 
responsible for about $7 million in unpaid claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim says the company was recommended to him by friends who also owned 
businesses. When he found out that he had been duped, Kim said, he approached 
his broker. "He told me, 'I did my best.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kim has a bachelor's degree in agriculture and dreams of owning a farm far 
away from the crowded neighborhoods of the central city. In the meantime, he 
has started a new business with the help of a $200,000 disaster loan from the 
U.S. Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, from behind thick, bullet-resistant glass, Kim operates a small gas 
station and convenience store in a neighborhood just south of Koreatown. He 
purchased a $3,000 annual fire and liability policy from Twin City Fire & 
Insurance Co. He found out about the carrier from a list provided the 
Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 No areawide analysis has been conducted to determine how many Central Los 
Angeles businesses are uninsured. But consumer groups say two narrower surveys 
conducted after the riots offer a fairly accurate picture of the overall 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Insurance interviewed 1,859 business owners who suffered 
riot losses. Of those, 890 -- or 48% -- said they had no insurance. Another 
survey conducted by the Wilshire district-based Korean-American Grocers Assn. 
found that about half of its 3,300 members had no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many other riot victims, the Villa family had insurance for its 
South-Central flower shop, which was looted and burned the first night of the 
violence. But family members say their insurance carrier, Allstate, canceled 
their policy after it paid them the $14,000 for which they were insured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not fair," said Maricela Villa, who operates the business near 
Manchester Avenue and Main Street with her husband, Luis. "This is not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate spokesman Al Orendorff said the insurance company was unable to 
locate records indicating whether the Villas' policy was dropped. He said the 
carrier would be willing to write a new policy for the Villas or anyone else in 
South-Central provided they do not constitute an excessive risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that we take our urban business customers lightly is not true," 
Orendorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maricela Villa said that when the shop reopened last year, the family was 
unable to obtain insurance from a major carrier and had to take out a policy 
with the California Fair Plan, usually the insurer of last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Plan was started as part of nationwide insurance program after the 
urban unrest of the late 1960s. In California, the plan is funded by about 280 
insurance companies doing business in the state, each of which contributes to 
the independent program based on the respective percentage of their market 
penetration. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Fair Plan provides fire and vandalism coverage, brokers say its 
plans are not as comprehensive as those offered by private carriers and are 
generally purchased by people who cannot find any other insurance. But many 
business owners interviewed said they were unaware that the Fair Plan exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair Plan General Manager Stuart Wilkinson says it spends about $50,000 
annually on marketing for billboards, media announcements and brochures in 
Spanish, English and Korean. "I think the problem is that people don't pay a 
lot of attention to insurance ads," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local brokers say the Villas' experience illustrates how commercial coverage 
has become more difficult to obtain in the aftermath of the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten worse," Bivins said. "As a broker, I don't have problems finding 
customers. I have a problem finding (insurance) companies." Bivins sells a 
number of policies for Crusader Insurance Co., a primary insurer of small 
businesses in the central city. 
</P>
<P>
 Two companies that had insured many Central Los Angeles businesses are no 
longer writing new policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Western International Insurance Co., which was swamped by $22.4 million in 
riot claims, was declared insolvent in August, 1992. And just last month, Aim 
Insurance Co. was taken over by state regulators because its assets were below 
the $2.1 million required to sell insurance in California. Aim is paying claims 
but is not writing new policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline of smaller insurance companies has heightened already heated 
attacks against larger firms that allegedly do little or no business in 
underserved communities. Garamendi is especially critical of Farmers Insurance 
and State Farm Insurance, which he says have failed to establish offices in 
South-Central and other inner-city areas despite being two of the industry's 
largest carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you live in the inner city, some of the biggest of these companies might 
as well have their offices on Mars," he said. "It happens to be blatant 
discrimination that's going on with State Farm and Farmers." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of both insurance companies dispute Garamendi's discrimination 
charges and add that their offices and agents are listed in the telephone book, 
which makes them accessible to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers spokesman Millen said the firm is the largest insurer of businesses 
statewide, including inner-city areas. The company sustained $50 million in 
losses after the riots -- more than any other insurer, Millen said. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Garamendi's charges "completely untrue." State Farm spokesman 
William Sirola agreed, calling Garamendi's allegations "absolutely, totally 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 He said State Farm is very active in the central city, citing the more than 
$30 million that the company suffered in riot-related losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony at the insurance hearing, State Farm representatives said the 
company has an agent within 3.6 miles of every resident in Central Los Angeles.

SPRING IS MILLER TIME AT LACC; BASKETBALL: THE CUBS' 27-6 SEASON IS CREDITED TO 
COACH MIKE MILLER, 30, WHO HAS STRESSED FUNDAMENTALS TO ACHIEVE AN 80% CAREER 
WIN RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If basketball coaches were given nicknames like players are, Mike Miller might 
be known as King Midas. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has the uncanny ability to improve anything within his grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 First Cathedral High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ribet Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 And over the past two years, Miller has applied the Midas touch to Los Angeles 
City College. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is nothing magical about his approach to success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I build my basketball philosophy around defense and fundamentals," Miller 
said. "If a team does these two things well, it is going to be in every game 
and thus have a chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 In six years as a head coach, he has amassed a 143-37 record, winning almost 
80% of his games. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Miller guided the Cubs to a 27-6 regular season and a third-round 
appearance in the State Junior College Playoffs, the furthest the school has 
advanced in more than 30 years. LACC lost to Chaffey College, 82-80, at 
Chaffey. The Cubs also made appearances in four cable-televised games, another 
school first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard work is the basis of our program at LACC," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 His players agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Miller) can be rough at times, but he is a winner," said former LACC point 
guard Raheem Muhammad, who will play at UC Irvine next fall. "He knows what it 
takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
 And Midas also knows how to make sure the wealth is spread among his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad is one of three -- Mike Dorsey and Marty Cotwright are the others -- 
who received scholarships from Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played hard and as a team at all times," said Dorsey, who will attend Cal 
State Northridge. "There were better teams (than us), but execution separated 
us. Playing at LACC made me stronger, improved my all-around game and made me 
more familiar with the college game." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly enough, Muhammad, Dorsey and Cotwright, who will attend the 
University of New Mexico, all failed to make the 1993-94 All Southern 
California Athletic Conference Basketball Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Markee Brown, Saipele Tuialii and Derek Higgins were the three LACC 
representatives -- and the only freshmen -- to make the all-conference team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have one superstar on our team, but six or seven guys that can 
contribute," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 30, began his coaching career as an apprentice at La Canada High 
School, then moved to a frosh-soph position at Blair High School in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved on to Cathedral High, where the Phantoms were 43-11 under him from 
1987-89, the most successful two-year period in the school's 65-year history. 
Cathedral won two consecutive Santa Fe League Championships and went to the 
Southern Section Final Four both years. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ribet Academy, in Glassell Park, Miller's teams captured two consecutive 
Southern Section Championships and a Division V State Championship. The 
Fighting Frogs were 58-5 during Miller's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 What did Miller learn in the transition from high school to community college? 
</P>
<P>
 "The athletes are better and need more (creative) freedom," he said. "The 
level of intensity is a lot higher, and the talent is more balanced." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller attended Glendale Community College and then Cal State L.A., graduating 
with a bachelor's degree in English. He received a master's in education from 
Azusa Pacific University and is working on a doctorate in education. 
</P>
<P>
 His obsession with learning is reflected by his team's 2.82 cumulative 
grade-point average. In fact, the Cubs are up for the state junior colleges' 
National Academic Award. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no Ds or Fs on our team, which is incredible because kids often go to 
junior college because of poor grades," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The junior college level is about preparing guys to go Division I and 
Division II -- not just to win."

BELL PITCHER SUSPENDED OVER GRADES; BASEBALL: THE RULING ON SENIOR YAMEL 
DELGADO MAY LEAD TO A FORFEITURE OF THE GAMES IN WHICH HE PLAYED. THE EAGLE 
STAFF HAS APPEALED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the start of the 1993-94 high school baseball season, Bell's pitching 
staff appeared invincible. But now the Untouchables, as they have been called, 
have become quite vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagle pitching staff was dealt a serious blow when senior Yamel Delgado 
was placed on academic suspension April 18 for failing to meet the 2.0 
grade-point average required to compete in high school athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Before transferring from Huntington Park at the beginning of this school year, 
Delgado was carrying seven classes. However, a normal high school load at Bell 
consists of only six. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado's seventh class at Huntington Park last school year was work 
experience, an elective taken for extra credit. When Bell calculated Delgado's 
GPA using six classes, his average came out to a C, which would make him 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Los Angeles Unified School District's Senior High School 
Division, which handles matters of academic eligibility, required that the 
seventh class be used in determining Delgado's GPA. This placed his average 
below a C. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell (14-3, 8-1) now may be forced to forfeit the games in which Delgado 
played. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are appealing the class because it was an optional way of getting credit," 
Bell athletic director Sue Kamiyama said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Fiege, City Section Athletic Commissioner, said the administrators in 
the Senior High School Division made the correct decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any class taken for credit and shows on the computer must be used in 
determining GPA," she said. "The (work experience) class showed up on the 
report card and was taken for credit. Therefore, it must be used to determine 
eligibility." 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on Bell's appeal is expected Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If not allowed to return, Delgado would be the second pitcher to be suspended 
from the team this season. Senior Manuel Armenderiz was suspended for 
administrative disciplinary actions a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenderiz and Delgado were both 2-0 with a 0.00 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Coach Henry Santiago declined to comment.

Q & A; RAMS' SHAW ON WHY TEAM IS PUTTING CITY ON NOTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Rams management will formally notify the city of Anaheim that the 
team is giving 15 months' notice of its intention to terminate its Anaheim 
Stadium lease. While the action can be rescinded, its intent is to give the 
National Football League franchise the option of exploring opportunities in 
other cities hungry for pro football, such as Baltimore, St. Louis and Memphis, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Vice President John Shaw has been the Rams' point man in the effort 
to make the best deal possible for Georgia Frontiere, the team's owner and 
president. On Thursday night, he talked with Times staff writer T. J. Simers 
about the significance of Tuesday and what might lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What do you make of this action on May 3? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I see it as a legal maneuver that grants to the football team an additional 
option to improve its economic condition, whether it be in Anaheim, the 
Southern California area or another city. It doesn't mean we're going to leave 
Anaheim. The notice that we're going to be serving to the city can be revoked 
any time in the next 15 months and, in a way, it's really creating for us the 
opportunity to be a free agent, to use a football term. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. When do you expect this whole thing being resolved? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I have no timetable. We're not going to do anything quickly. We're just 
going to explore. We gave the city of Anaheim a four-month period of 
exclusivity (from the Jan. 6 announcement of the intent to invoke the escape 
clause). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Did the city do anything with that period of time? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Did you expect the city to do anything with that time? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I wasn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you understand the frustration of some city officials who contend the 
Rams have done nothing to indicate just what they want? That you aren't being 
specific? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I think the city was very creative when it had to move the team from the 
Los Angeles Coliseum (for the 1980 season). It's my understanding they were 
very creative when they moved the team to the city of Anaheim. I feel, given 
the same type of situation, they could be creative enough to keep the team 
right now. So I really don't understand the frustrations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I think the city knows the type of proposals we are receiving from other 
cities. And I think several members of the City Council have made it clear they 
have no interest in having the taxpayers subsidize a football team. We're 
sensitive to that point of view. If that is the view of the city, we respect it 
and appreciate it. I'm not sure, with that view, they could compete with some 
of the other cities that are using state and local money to deliver to a 
potential football tenant a brand-new football facility, a state-of-the-art, 
single-purpose facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, when we negotiated the buyout clause, the city at that time told us 
it didn't have any money to address some of the issues that we felt at that 
time were important. They found a way to purchase a couple of acres of land and 
build a new facility (The Pond of Anaheim) for two tenants, two potential 
tenants that weren't even identified at the time, in basketball and hockey. 
Also at the time, when we negotiated the escape clause, the city view was $30 
million would be a prohibitive price for a club (to pay) to move out of the 
city. I think the present view would be that it wouldn't be prohibitive. I 
think it is also the city's view, and they have told us this on a number of 
occasions, that they will be able to attract other tenants. And so if that's 
the attitude that they're going to have, they might be successful in bringing 
another NFL team to Southern California. I think it would be difficult for that 
to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is there a leading candidate in the race to get the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No, there's been strong interest from several cities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you believe the Rams will move? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It would be purely conjectural for me to answer that, and I don't think 
it's fair to do that. It's a decision that will be made by ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Have you already made a recommendation to Georgia Frontiere on whether to 
move or not? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Absolutely not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about the team's lame-duck status and its impact on fans? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I think "lame duck" is an inaccurate term because we have not announced our 
intention to move. We have only announced our notice to terminate our lease. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is there any leader, in your estimation, in Anaheim who can step forward 
and make this work to keep the Rams here? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I think the mayor of Anaheim (Tom Daly) has been very aggressive in trying 
to find some alternatives for us. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do team officials believe the city will be able to put together a package 
that will keep the Rams in Anaheim? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We're hopeful that they can. If they're competitive with other cities, we 
would look at the package. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do team officials think the city has neglected the Rams' demands on the 
stadium lease and practice facility? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We haven't made any demands on the stadium lease. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. A better word might be concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 A. As it relates to the stadium lease, we have no concerns or demands. As it 
relates to the practice facility, we had an oral commitment from the city to 
expend $7 million to either contribute to a new facility or improve the 
existing facility, which is antiquated (the city denies such a commitment). The 
practice facility, though, is only a sub-issue to the larger issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Have city officials broken promises? 
</P>
<P>
 A. As it relates to the training facility, they have broken a promise. . . . 
As it relates to the stadium lease, I feel they haven't broken any promises, 
and have lived up to the lease. One of the lease terms provides us the 
opportunity to leave on 15 months' notice by paying a substantial amount of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You don't really have any (other) concerns about the stadium lease? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The lease is what it is. I feel we negotiated an escape clause, which we 
gave a certain amount of consideration. We feel the stadium is economically 
obsolete. We haven't made any demands of the city; we just feel in order to 
compete in this era of free-agency, we have to find a way to increase our 
stadium revenue. The escape clause gives us the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. When you say Anaheim Stadium is economically obsolete, aren't you in effect 
ruling out Anaheim? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Ruling out is too strong. I think there's a way -- with some creative 
thinking -- to make Anaheim a viable candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Can Anaheim Stadium be a viable candidate to house the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 A. That's something the city is really going to have to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Just how different is Anaheim Stadium from some of the state-of-the-art 
facilities you have mentioned, and what have been presented to you? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I think there's a huge economic difference in some of the newer facilities 
and our present arrangement in Anaheim. In the newer facilities, there is a 
large amount of money made in luxury boxes and premium seating. There's no 
premium seating in Anaheim, and our luxury boxes are the lowest-priced in the 
league, and we have a hard time selling them out. Plus, the advertising 
revenues from the stadiums, the concessions and parking in the newer facilities 
are a much greater financial arrangement to the team than our present situation 
in Anaheim. So newer facilities provide much greater opportunities for stadium 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. But the Rams aren't losing money, are they? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The Rams are not losing money. Last year, the Rams did not lose money. This 
year, the Rams project a substantial loss. The salary cap has increased our 
payroll by about $5 million, our radio rights are now the lowest in the league, 
around $500,000 -- down from $2.5 million last year. And the network contract 
-- even though it had a higher per-year average than the last contract, the 
actual television revenues this first year will be less than what we made last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. The city says the team would be doing better financially if it put a 
quality team on the field. Do Rams share any blame in the situation? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Obviously, the Rams have some responsibility with the lack of the team's 
performance. Fortunately for the fans of Southern California, they have the 
luxury to support winning teams because there are plenty of opportunities to 
support winning teams. Yes, we share some of the responsibility, but the burden 
of constantly of putting a winner on the field to be economically competitive 
is a large burden in view of the fact several other cities support teams that 
don't win. 
</P>
<P>
 Most sports franchises go through winning and losing cycles. The Rams had a 
winning cycle in the '80s where they were in the conference championship game 
twice, the playoffs six or seven times, and even in that era of winning we fell 
far short of selling out our stadium. We averaged 57,000 in a stadium that 
seats approximately 70,000. The Raiders were a very competitive playoff team 
last year, and they had either the second- or third-lowest attendance in the 
National Football League. Whatever the factors that drive the economy in the 
Southern California market -- possibly, it's a recession -- the teams that are 
winning are having a hard time filling their stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do team officials feel that the fans have supported or abandoned the team? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We feel that we have a number of Ram fans, and that unfortunately because 
of either the team's performance or the economic recession that we're in right 
now in Southern California, the number of our (season ticket holders) has 
decreased dramatically. Even without the potential of moving, our season ticket 
base has decreased 40% over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is there any way the team can be financially successful in Anaheim? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Given a stadium that's competitive with the newer facilities around the 
National Football League, I believe the team could be financially successful in 
Anaheim.

COLOSIO ASSASSINATION PROBE STALLS, BUT RUMORS FLOURISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA and JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a Mexican political mural of old, the official account of the 
assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio presents a 
dramatic picture of a group of conspirators surrounding and killing Colosio at 
a campaign rally here. 
</P>
<P>
 That version does not go beyond the surface, however: Authorities have not 
said anything about the motives and masterminds behind the crime, and the 
evidence they have made public consists mainly of indistinct videotapes. Nearly 
six weeks after the murder of the man who had been expected to become the 
country's next president, Mexicans are confronting a host of questions -- and 
tantalizing theories. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to mounting public suspicion of a high-level conspiracy, President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed an independent commission of five 
distinguished citizens, including government critics, to assist the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country wants to know the truth," he said. "At the same time, it is 
necessary to avoid a climate of suspicions, one against another. Any 
investigation is difficult -- it takes time -- but we cannot allow this to 
create a climate of doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Although four of the Tijuana-based security guards hired for the political 
rally at which Colosio was shot were initially charged with aiding the accused 
gunman, Mario Aburto Martinez, the investigation by a special prosecutor has 
apparently bogged down. QUESTIONS ABOUT EVIDENCE 
</P>
<P>
 A judge dropped charges against a politically connected former police 
commander who organized the security force, but upheld homicide charges against 
the other accused. However, even the case against them looks weak so far, 
according to government officials, lawyers and other observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had more proof, they would have shown it," a Mexican official said. 
"They can't go back. But they can't go forward either." 
</P>
<P>
 This view predominates among those who believe Aburto acted alone. Officials 
of the Mexican attorney general's office are not convinced by the case advanced 
by special prosecutor Miguel Montes Garcia, according to sources familiar with 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, many Mexicans believe that Aburto was a pawn in a plot linked to 
a power struggle within Colosio's own Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). 
Aburto's personality and his mysterious conduct, as well as the many unresolved 
questions -- among them, was there a second gunman? -- feed theories that 
Aburto was in league with others, say political commentators and many ordinary 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the investigation fault the special prosecutor for operating out of 
Mexico City, 1,000 miles from the crime scene. The secretive inquiry seems 
curiously passive at times, they say. Mexican and U.S. reporters in Tijuana 
have been surprised to find that friends and acquaintances of Aburto whom they 
have interviewed have yet to be questioned by police. FOCUS OF INVESTIGATION 
</P>
<P>
 When investigators arrested the alleged accomplices in early April, the probe 
focused on the 45-member crowd-control unit at the rally. The so-called Grupo 
Tucan consisted mainly of former police officers, some of whom had been 
dismissed for corruption after serving in the scandal-battered administration 
of former Gov. Xicotencatl Leyva Mortera, a stalwart of the PRI's Old Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects' profiles, particularly that of security chief Jose Rivapalacio, 
point in the direction of the ruling party's authoritarian hard-liners, who 
seek to block the political reforms that Salinas promotes and Colosio promised 
to advance. Speculation centers on them as the authors of the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivapalacio belongs to the PRI governing council in Tijuana. Before leaving 
the state judicial police in 1989, sources say, he was chief homicide 
investigator. He reportedly amassed wealth and power -- a co-worker described 
him as the "unofficial commander" of the police force. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego police say they suspect him of ordering an unsolved attempted murder 
north of the border in 1987, in which an assailant stabbed Rivapalacio's 
ex-wife 17 times and shot her companion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's sharp and he's slick," said the former co-worker, a veteran Baja 
detective. "Of all the suspects, he's the only one I could see being involved 
in something as big as the assassination." SECURITY CHIEF'S DENIAL 
</P>
<P>
 Rivapalacio has denied involvement in the assassination and the assault on his 
ex-wife. He held a news conference last week in which he provided detailed 
information about the case against him, saying he knew it would collapse. He 
said he cooperated with investigators to "prove my innocence. I was tempted to 
flee. I was afraid. But I overcame my fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivapalacio stopped short of asserting the innocence of the other suspects, 
whom he invited into the volunteer security force. But he painted a benign 
picture of his contact with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although still under investigation, Rivapalacio said, "I remain confident in 
the legal system." 
</P>
<P>
 The special prosecutor's office appealed the judge's decision to drop charges 
against Rivapalacio. It was also criticized by federal legislator Fernando 
Gomez Mont, a member of the new presidential commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "There can be indications that a person is guilty, but the judge lets him go 
because he was not close by," said Gomez, the liaison to the federal probe for 
the governor of Baja California state. "This is a problem all over the world. I 
think there was plenty of evidence against him, but the judge did not agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities did not attribute a role to Rivapalacio except to allege that he 
added names of the accused accomplices to the rally's security list. They are 
Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, a former city policeman; Vicente Mayoral 
Valenzuela, a retired state homicide detective, and Mayoral's son Rodolfo, a 
truck driver. OFFICIAL ACCOUNT 
</P>
<P>
 The official account details how these suspects allegedly obstructed and 
distracted Colosio's federal bodyguards while clearing a path through a crowd 
for the gunman, who shot the candidate twice at point-blank range. 
</P>
<P>
 Photos and videos show Aburto talking to the suspected accomplices during the 
rally, authorities say, but they have released little further proof of a 
conspiracy. An exception is the statement of a 16-year-old girlfriend of 
Aburto, who says the accused assassin exchanged greetings with a man she 
identified as Sanchez in a park a few days earlier. The girlfriend also told 
interrogators that Aburto said he was a paid member of a political group that 
opposed Colosio's candidacy, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 But some law enforcement sources question the credibility of this witness, 
noting that she had known Aburto for only about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 A Tijuana lawyers association declared last week that it will assist the 
Mayorals' defense. Authorities are violating the law by trying the suspects in 
Mexico City federal court instead of state court in Tijuana, where the crime 
occurred, the lawyers said. The Mayorals should be released for lack of 
evidence, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel of Baja said recently that new 
circumstantial evidence has fortified the special prosecutor's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each day it becomes clearer that there was indeed coordination, although 
there is not yet powerful evidence," Ruffo told reporters. "Little details are 
accumulating, and everything points in the same direction." A SECOND GUNMAN? 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo also suggested that, despite early official assertions that Aburto was 
the only gunman, the possibility of a second gunman has not been discarded. He 
said doubts endure because police found only one bullet at the shooting scene 
and because shots fired in rapid succession hit the candidate in the right side 
of the head and the left side of the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the initial explanation that Colosio's body spun counterclockwise 
after the first shot, Ruffo said investigators have to look further into the 
recovery of the bullet and the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, authorities continue scrutinizing Jorge Antonio Sanchez Ortega, 
an agent of the Interior Ministry whom city police officers arrested as he ran 
from the scene with a bloodstained shirt. A test found gunpowder residue on 
Sanchez's hands, and the reason for his presence at the campaign rally has not 
been determined. He was released for lack of evidence, but Ruffo said: "It is 
not clear to us that he was not involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, however, has not been identified near Colosio in any of the photos 
and videotapes. Federal investigators have not recently commented on his status 
or that of two other men who were identified as suspects through videos. 
</P>
<P>
 The current scenario implies that powerful political forces were behind the 
crime. The special prosecutor has not offered a theory about how and why the 
remaining accused accomplices -- a trio of PRI minions, including two aging, 
infirm ex-cops -- decided to commit Mexico's most explosive assassination in 
decades. THE ACCUSED'S VERSION 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto insinuated in a confession made immediately after the shooting that he 
had confederates. Gaps in the case do not preclude the possibility that he was 
indeed the agent of others, induced by political fanaticism, economic incentive 
or both. According to a Mexican official, the accused assassin told 
interrogators, "If you knew who else was involved, you'd be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Aburto has insisted that he was not helped by the other 
three men now being held as suspects, who say they assisted in capturing the 
gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are still looking into questions about the introverted 
23-year-old factory worker: Why did he tell friends and relatives about 
political meetings with older people and professionals? Why did he talk about 
connections to "armed groups"? What did he mean when he showed a relative a 
pistol and said he would soon take part in a prosperous deal? 
</P>
<P>
 Sundry details of the case have emerged. In a trunk stuffed with documents and 
other family possessions, Tijuana city police found a book on Marxism and three 
photos of young men, believed to be Aburto family members, posing with 
automatic weapons, said Jose Federico Benitez Lopez, the city's police chief, 
during a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Benitez was assassinated Thursday night in an ambush on a busy highway. 
Because he had shared information with the press that raised doubts about the 
official version of the Colosio case, his murder increased suspicion of a 
conspiracy. But it is not yet clear whether his slaying was related to the 
Colosio case or to border drug wars. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, two witnesses have told The Times that last year they overheard 
periodic phone calls to California from Tijuana in which Aburto and his brother 
discussed smuggling guns into Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Aburto's father says that one suspect, the elder Mayoral, befriended 
his son and brought him to shadowy political meetings, authorities have not 
publicly confirmed the friendship or Aburto's political activity. AN OBSCURE 
ORGANIZATION 
</P>
<P>
 An obscure Tijuana political organization has drawn interest because its 
headquarters in a downtown doctor's office is in a building that matches the 
description of a building where a witness told police that Aburto attended 
meetings. Known as the Party of the American Union, the group calls for the 
violent overthrow of the PRI-controlled government and the annexation of Mexico 
by the United States, according to its founder, plastic surgeon Ernesto 
Messina. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Messina called the accused assassin a "hero and a patriot" 
for rising up against the PRI "dictatorship." Although Messina denied knowing 
Aburto, he said it is possible that Aburto attended meetings of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the party's political manifesto includes a reference to the Aztec 
warrior figure of the "Eagle Knight," a symbol that apparently obsessed Aburto. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a possible connection to the gunman, authorities picked up Messina for 
questioning more than a week after he was first interviewed by reporters. 
Investigators searched Messina's office and home. But he was released without 
further official comment. LONE GUNMAN THEORY 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of hard facts, the lone gunman theory has also gained new 
momentum. The semi-coherent ramblings in a journal attributed to Aburto foster 
an image of fanaticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's authentic, we are talking about a delirious, crazy guy," a Mexican 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The journal proclaims that Aburto's words will echo around the world. The 
writer espouses political reform, protection of marine life and better public 
transportation. He describes a kind of mythic encounter he had as a child with 
an aged revolutionary in the countryside; the old man christened him an Eagle 
Knight dedicated to fighting poverty and oppression "in the name of the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Benitez, the assassinated police chief, had expressed doubt that the 
writings were Aburto's original thoughts. Noting the contrast between the 
arduous scrawl strewn with misspellings and the comparatively sophisticated 
concepts and vocabulary, the chief said the document could be a calculated 
attempt to paint Aburto as the classic deranged assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The education of someone who writes this does not correspond to the education 
of someone who writes like this," Benitez said. "It looks to me as if it were 
dictated." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not it is authentic, the journal hints at apocalyptic retaliation 
against the system. It concludes: "The rulers who do not respond to the people 
with true justice and democracy will pay the consequences."

U.S. DELAYS TRADE SANCTIONS ON CHINA; DIPLOMACY: ADMINISTRATION GIVES BEIJING 
60 DAYS TO ADDRESS PIRACY OF FILMS, MUSIC AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE. AIM IS TO 
AVOID COMPLICATING HUMAN RIGHTS DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration backed away Saturday from citing China for pirating 
American movies, music and computer software after top officials decided in a 
flurry of meetings and phone calls that launching a new trade action could 
complicate already touchy relations with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a very delicate time in terms of our engagement with China," U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "My thinking about China was affected by the fact that the period between now 
and June 3 is critical for the relations between our two countries," he added, 
referring to the upcoming deadline on a separate matter: the U.S. renewal of 
Beijing's preferential trade status, a decision that will hinge on China's 
human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 On the piracy issue, instead of acting now against China, Kantor said, the 
Administration will give the Beijing government at least 60 days before 
starting the process of imposing trade sanctions. The announcement came only 
hours before a midnight Saturday deadline set by Congress for listing countries 
that have violated U.S. copyright laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to China, Kantor identified Argentina and India as leading 
violators of American copyrights and intellectual property rights. But he 
delayed action against these two countries too, primarily on grounds that they 
appear to be making progress in addressing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The justification for delaying action against China was based not on signs of 
progress, but on the sensitivity of U.S. relations with the world's most 
populous country. 
</P>
<P>
 American film, software and music industry trade groups have complained that 
China's commercial piracy of their wares costs them hundreds of millions of 
dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. investigators have identified a series of factories in Shenzhen, a 
Chinese "special economic zone" alongside Hong Kong, that churn out millions of 
copies of compact discs and laser discs featuring such American stars as 
Madonna and Whitney Houston. The pirated copies are sold not just in China but 
in Hong Kong and many other Asian capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry representatives reacted sharply to the Administration's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 China "has made little or no effort to take its immense piracy problem 
seriously," said Eric H. Smith, executive director of the International 
Intellectual Property Alliance, representing the recording and computer 
software industries. "This is a mere postponement of the inevitable, and we 
fear it will send the wrong signal -- that the U.S. statutory deadlines remain 
flexible." 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor noted that one objective of the delay is to keep the piracy issue 
separate from the more fundamental question of whether the United States should 
renew China's trade privileges. "We looked at the broader picture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under U.S. law, the President must decide by June 3 whether to extend China's 
most-favored-nation (MFN) trade benefits, under which Chinese goods are 
exported to this country with the same low tariff rates enjoyed by almost all 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Clinton signed an executive order calling upon China to make 
"overall significant progress" on human rights issues before its benefits are 
renewed. China has reacted furiously to the order, saying it will never tailor 
its domestic policies in response to pressure from another nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor also announced a two-month postponement of any U.S. trade action 
against Japan for discriminating against American medical and 
telecommunications equipment in its government procurement practices. He cited 
the current political situation in Tokyo, where Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is 
organizing a new government. "Obviously, he (Hata) has been somewhat 
distracted, as we all know," Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision on Japan was not as surprising as the one on China. As late as 
midmorning Saturday, several U.S. officials believed a decision had already 
been reached to go ahead with the new piracy action against Beijing. But Kantor 
later announced that the Administration had decided upon a postponement during 
a series of morning conference calls among top-level officials. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the piracy question had been fully reviewed "at the highest levels" of 
the Administration. "The President is fully aware of and was obviously involved 
in the decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The postponement is an indication of how the continuing U.S. dispute with 
China over human rights issues and MFN benefits is beginning to affect other 
policy areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is apparently taking extra steps to avoid additional 
conflicts with China because of the fear that the human rights dispute alone 
could jeopardize ties with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this spring, the United States ducked an environmental policy conflict 
with Beijing over the sale in China of rhinoceros horn, a common pharmaceutical 
and supposed aphrodisiac. In the end, the United States decided to retaliate 
against Taiwan for selling rhinoceros horn, but not against China. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked later to explain the distinction that was made, one U.S. environmental 
official responded, "1.08 billion people" -- a reference to the fact that China 
has a population of 1.1 billion while Taiwan has only 20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Under U.S. law, the trade representative has the power to cite "priority 
foreign countries" for violating American copyrights and other intellectual 
property rights. If this occurs, the United States must launch an immediate 
investigation and start the process of deciding whether there should be 
retaliation against that country's exports to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have repeatedly complained that China has laws against piracy 
on the books but is not enforcing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a Chinese vice premier reportedly picked up the phone from Beijing 
to call authorities in south China's Guangdong province. Within hours, police 
in that province staged a series of raids against factories producing pirated 
goods.

ANAHEIM IN DANGER OF LOSING GAME; PRO SPORTS: RAMS' SUITORS OFFER DEALS LIKE 
THE ONE THAT LURED TEAM HERE. CITY SAYS IT WANTS TO COMPETE BUT CAN'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen years ago, the city of Anaheim lured the Los Angeles Rams to Orange 
County with promises of more money, a better stadium and tens of thousands of 
adoring fans. With the team coming off a Super Bowl appearance, plus a long 
tradition of solid support in Southern California, both sides were riding high 
and full of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after four consecutive losing seasons and with attendance sagging, the 
relationship between the Rams and Anaheim is crumbling. And on Tuesday, the 
National Football League team will take the first formal step toward possibly 
leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, they're out of here," said Councilman Irv Pickler, 
who for some time says he has seen irreconcilable differences. "Let them go." 
</P>
<P>
 Led by a determined team executive, the Rams have fought with city officials 
over issues big and small, and owner Georgia Frontiere recently told The Times 
that leaving Anaheim is indeed an option. City officials reply equivocally, 
saying they love the Rams, but not at any price. 
</P>
<P>
 So Tuesday, the Rams will activate an escape clause in their Anaheim Stadium 
lease that allows them to leave town in 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ironic twist that has come to typify big-time sports, cities such as 
Baltimore, St. Louis and Memphis, Tenn., will offer the Rams the same sort of 
enticements that lured them to Orange County. And Anaheim, where grand dreams 
miraculously seem to come true, faces the competition with a wavering will and 
a reluctance to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't end up in a free-for-all bidding war with entire states and expect 
to come out a winner for the taxpayers," City Atty. Jack L. White said. "I 
think if we keep the Rams, we're going to have to consummate a marriage with 
the county and state and bring their economic forces into play." 
</P>
<P>
 Many factors contribute to a professional sports organization's desire to 
move. Team and city officials agree that the main motivation for the Rams is 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the stadium is economically obsolete," said Rams Executive Vice 
President John Shaw. ". . . In order to compete in this era of free agency, we 
have to find a way to increase our stadium revenue. The escape clause gives us 
the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Economics aside, team and city officials acknowledge that the Rams at times 
have been dissatisfied in Anaheim, and Tuesday's notice culminates years of 
discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it was to be expected," Councilman Bob D. Simpson said of the threat 
to move. "The handwriting has been on the wall for some time now." 
</P>
<P>
 The discord between the Rams and city has resulted in lawsuits and several 
threats by the team to leave. As recently as two weeks ago, the Rams were 
facing eviction from their practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 On-the-field performance and fan support have soured as well. The team has won 
only 19 of 64 games in the past four seasons. Attendance was fourth-lowest in 
the National Football League last year, and season ticket sales are down 13% 
from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 An April 23 rally at Anaheim Stadium, organized to show how much the Rams' 
fans loved them, drew 200 to 250 die-hards. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite losing seasons and the apparent drop in popularity, most city 
officials say Anaheim still wants to keep the team. Mayor Tom Daly says he is 
"optimistic" that something can be done. But the question is whether the city 
can muster a financial package enticing enough to compete with offers elsewhere 
and satisfy the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Rams, this week's action is a strategic move that the times both allow 
and demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL recently awarded expansion franchises to Charlotte, N.C., and 
Jacksonville, Fla., and while the selections disappointed a number of other 
cities that had been willing to pay dearly for pro football, a window of 
opportunity opened for existing franchises trying to improve their situations. 
</P>
<P>
 For a team such as the Rams, which has had a $5-million increase in player 
payroll, a $2-million loss in radio rights revenue and a 40% drop in attendance 
over the last three years, the financial boon being offered is hard to resist. 
</P>
<P>
 Say goodby to Anaheim? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a way, with some creative thinking, to make Anaheim a viable 
candidate," Shaw said. " . . . The city was very creative when it had to move 
the team from the Los Angeles Coliseum. . . . I feel, given the same type of 
situation, they could be creative enough to keep the team right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But to do so, Shaw suggested, Anaheim's only solution might be to build a 
state-of-the-art, football-only stadium or substantially renovate the existing 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 The likelihood of that, however, is considered remote for a city that is 
facing a $9-million budget deficit next year and could be stretched further by 
financial commitments for a proposed $3-billion expansion of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be diligent in our efforts to keep the Rams, but there are 
limits," City Manager James D. Ruth said. "It was never intended for the city 
to subsidize the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's motivation to keep the team will not be so much financial as to 
maintain civic pride and prestige. Local businesses certainly benefit from the 
Rams' presence, but Ruth said the city, which earned about $2.9 million in 
revenue from the team in 1993, just about breaks even after expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "From an economic standpoint, I don't think (the Rams leaving) is a loss," 
Ruth said. "If it is, it's very minimal." 
</P>
<P>
 Most city officials say they want the Rams to stay and are willing to try and 
sweeten the team's lease. But they also complain that they are unable to 
compete with the financial packages being cobbled together in other cities, 
counties and states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a totally different economic climate today than it was when they first 
came here," Anaheim Councilman Simpson said. "There's a different approach in 
getting, keeping and luring teams. There are communities willing to throw 
millions of dollars at teams. We just can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have listened to such offers but say they have declined to enter 
specific negotiations before Tuesday. They point to the four months that have 
passed since they first indicated they would invoke the escape clause in their 
lease, giving Anaheim a chance to woo the team without competition. Even if 
Anaheim had made an offer, though, the Rams signaled they had every intention 
of declaring the franchise a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage for a move was set in 1990 after years of deteriorating relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city granted the Rams the right to build office buildings on 68 acres of 
the stadium parking lot as part of the original 1979 agreement that brought the 
team to Anaheim. When the Rams were ready to break ground on the project in 
1983, the baseball California Angels sued to halt the development, complaining 
that it would eliminate parking, inconvenience fans and diminish the value of 
their own lease. 
</P>
<P>
 That lawsuit continues to languish in the courts, blocking any parking lot 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Shaw indicated (six years ago) that the Rams could leave at any time 
with impunity . . . because of the failure of the city to deliver on the 
parking lot development," City Atty. White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city officials did not believe the Rams' threat would stand up in 
court, they were concerned nonetheless. If the team did win and move, it would 
leave the city with no way to pay off debts on more than $30 million in stadium 
improvements that were made to lure the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Already irritated with one unfulfilled promise, the Rams became further 
rankled when the city purchased land across from the stadium for the 
development of the Anaheim Arena, now known as The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city told us they didn't have any money to address some of the issues 
that we felt were important at the time," Shaw said. "But they found a way to 
purchase a couple acres of land to build a new facility for two tenants, two 
potential tenants that weren't even identified at the time in basketball and 
hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams attempted to block the arena, prompting the city to reopen 
negotiations on the stadium lease. The Rams' escape clause was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to put to rest the (parking lot) issue," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 A tentative deal was worked out in 1990: The Rams agreed to no longer insist 
on their real estate development rights; the city granted the escape clause, 
allowing the Rams to leave with 15 months' notice as long as they paid off the 
remaining stadium expansion debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our general feeling was that if they wanted to leave they would find some way 
to leave," Ruth said. "This way we covered our financial exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 When city officials approved the escape clause, they knew the team might leave 
but didn't think it would ever come to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they started asking for things like a 15-month escape clause, an antenna 
should have gone up," said Simpson, who was involved in the initial 
negotiations as city manager but resigned that office before they were 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw believed that the city was shortsighted and now thinks it's fooling 
itself if it expects to land another professional football franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time when we negotiated the escape clause, the city view was that $30 
million would be a prohibitive price for a club to move out of the city," Shaw 
said. "I think the present view would be that it wouldn't be prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials defend the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we knew then what we know today, I still think it was the right thing to 
do," White said. "The entire stadium debt will be paid for." 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to city officials, the Rams recognize that Anaheim may do 
nothing to keep them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several members of the City Council have made it clear they have no interest 
in having the taxpayers subsidize a football team," Shaw said. "We're sensitive 
to that point of view. . . . I'm not sure with that view they could compete 
with some of the other cities that are using state and local money to deliver 
to a potential football tenant a brand-new facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore, the leading candidate to lure away the Rams, for example, would 
build a $160-million, 72,000-seat stadium with bonds backed by special 
lotteries and stadium revenue. It would include 108 sky boxes and 7,500 club 
seats. All revenues from tickets, sky boxes, club seats, parking and 
concessions would go to the team, which would pay only $1 rent per game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams pay 60 cents per admission, not to exceed $400,000 a year, to rent 
Anaheim Stadium, and share in half of the parking and concession revenues. The 
team also gives up 20% of luxury box revenue and 7.5% of ticket revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The team made a profit of about $3.5 million last year, but Shaw said this 
year the team projects a substantial loss. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the Rams would be more profitable if they put a winning 
team on the field. Shaw, while acknowledging the team's recent poor play, says 
the burden of winning every year to remain economically sound in a saturated 
sports market is unfair and that teams in other cities are supported, win or 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw will spend the next few months sifting through offers with a goal of 
making a final decision by mid-February, when the team will be required to 
notify the league of any intention to play elsewhere in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 One strategy being contemplated is to sell 40% of the team to an aggressive 
leader such as Baltimore Oriole CEO Peter Angelos, who would spearhead the 
Rams' move and deflect criticism from Frontiere, who is sensitive to negative 
media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams intend to follow NFL guidelines if they elect to move and will seek 
approval from three-fourths of the league ownership. In fact, the Rams used a 
recent lease dispute with Anaheim over their practice facility to demonstrate 
to other NFL owners that they had serious difficulties operating here. 
</P>
<P>
 There has also been talk about a corporation such as the Walt Disney Co. 
stepping in and buying the Rams to keep them here. Disney has made overtures, 
but Shaw said league rules that prohibit corporate ownership aren't likely to 
be changed before the Rams decide whether to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing will happen without Frontiere's approval and, to date, she has 
disavowed any interest in selling her team or part of it. She also has 
expressed an aversion to extended litigation, which contributed to the Rams' 
sudden capitulation last month to Anaheim when it was threatened with eviction 
from its practice site. 
</P>
<P>
 The team reserves the right to revoke its termination notice and remain here, 
but it will lose the $2 million it must post on Tuesday in order to exercise 
its escape clause. 
</P>
<P>
 If recent negotiations over the Rams' lease for their practice facility are 
any indication, the prospect of retaining the team does not look good. It took 
the city about nine months, an eviction threat and several financial 
concessions to resolve that dispute. When it was over, the Rams, still 
dissatisfied with the lease, said they deserved a more modern practice 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Pickler, who opposed the agreement, said he hopes the city doesn't 
continue making concessions just to keep the Rams. But subsidies, it appears, 
are what the Rams are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Daly, for one, has been trying to find ways to accommodate the Rams 
while protecting the city's bank account. He has met with county and business 
leaders to solicit support. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly also has proposed joining with private investors to build a massive 
retail center and possibly a new football stadium as a way of enticing the team 
to stay. But Daly's proposals have found little enthusiasm on a council that 
remains divided on how to keep the Rams.

to find out." Rams Coverage

FEDERAL CRIME BILL SWELLS WITH A SPENDING BONANZA; POLITICS: BECAUSE SO MANY 
PROGRAMS ARE BEING ATTACHED, THE WHITE HOUSE MAY HIKE FUNDING TO $30 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Who says crime doesn't pay? 
</P>
<P>
 For mayors, police departments, state correctional authorities, and proponents 
of a vast array of social programs, the federal crime bill now moving toward 
final congressional approval is shaping up as a once-in-a-lifetime bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the high-wattage debates over the death penalty and life imprisonment 
for three-time felons, the crime bill has swelled into President Clinton's 
largest new domestic spending initiative -- and it might not be finished 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the banner of fighting crime, the Administration is shaping a bill that 
represents either the largest federal effort ever to supplement local law 
enforcement, a vast expansion of social programs or a revival of revenue 
sharing for the cities by another name. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the biggest domestic buildup of any law I can think of," 
said Steven Moore, director of fiscal studies at the libertarian Cato 
Institute. "This has become spectacularly expensive. It just seems like a 
Christmas tree that people are hanging things on." 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals and conservatives have attached so many programs to the crime bill 
that the Administration is privately discussing the possibility of increasing 
the funding for the final legislation to nearly $30 billion over five years, 
rather than risk disappointing either side. 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers expected the final funding level to come in near the $22.3 
billion approved by the Senate last fall, considerably lower than the $28 
billion endorsed by the House earlier this month. That was because only the 
Senate managed to identify a funding source for the new spending. 
</P>
<P>
 But, one senior official said, the Administration now fears that insisting on 
the lower figure in the House-Senate conference committee could fracture the 
bill's fragile legislative coalition, pitting liberal advocates of prevention 
programs against conservatives who prefer to pour the money into prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the official said, the Administration is considering enlarging the 
pie by guaranteeing the crime package an additional year of funds from the 
revenue source the Senate established last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate allocated to the crime legislation all the savings for the next 
five years from a 252,000-person reduction in the federal work force 
recommended by the Administration. Over five years, those reductions are 
expected to produce the $22.3 billion the Senate bill would spend. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan the Administration is now considering also would direct to the crime 
bill most of the savings expected from the sixth year of personnel reductions. 
That could produce as much as $8 billion in additional funding -- enough to 
cover both the House and Senate priorities if the spending also is stretched 
out to six years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), who pushed 
for a larger bill at a recent strategy session with Clinton, said that 
sweetening the pot is the only way to meet the minimal demands of the left and 
right in the legislative struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are going to get up to that $27- to $29-billion range (required to 
keep the coalition together), the only way to fund it is to go to that sixth 
year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others involved in the crime debate see in the rising price tag a refusal by 
the Administration and Congress to choose between competing interests. "It 
sounds like just another cop-out . . . to avoid making hard choices," said Beth 
Carter, national coordinator of the Campaign for an Effective Crime Policy, a 
coalition of law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill's insatiable growth, she said, "is clearly at the expense of 
other priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Even one senior White House official said that while the additional money 
"might be helpful" in passing the final legislation, "the obvious question is, 
do we need all that money for crime? It is sort of analogous to last year. Last 
year you couldn't cut the budget enough. This year you can't spend enough on 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill's unique status stands out more clearly against the decisions 
Clinton made last week on welfare reform. At the same time officials were 
contemplating coughing up billions of dollars more for crime, Clinton approved 
a bare-bones welfare package that will spend just $9.5 billion over the next 
five years. In the final pinch, plans to expand child-care assistance for the 
working poor were cut by about $2 billion -- prompting loud protests from 
liberals inside and outside the government. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that comparison suggests that social priorities are being flattened by 
an election-year stampede to crack down on criminals, the actual ideological 
calculus is muddier. That's because the crime bill -- for all the attention 
devoted to its money for building prisons and hiring police officers -- is 
certain to include billions of dollars in new social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation clearly specifies some of those programs. Both the House and 
Senate bills, for instance, provide hundreds of millions of dollars to expand 
drug treatment for prisoners, improve safety in schools, and form "midnight 
basketball" leagues for young people who might otherwise spend their evenings 
less innocently. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill, in particular, goes further to establish huge, somewhat 
loosely defined grant programs that critics see as a new form of general aid to 
cities hidden under the cloak of fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a total absurdity," Moore said. "All the urban programs that the Reagan 
era got rid of, this is just resurrecting them under a different guise." 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the House bill are three separate funding pools of more than $1 
billion each to help cities finance social programs they believe might reduce 
crime, as well as a half-billion-dollar job-training initiative for 
disadvantaged youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Under one of these plans, 15 cities would divide $1.5 billion to create "model 
intensive prevention zones" that would target new spending on anything from 
"alternative activities and programs for youth" to improving public 
transportation and street lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the House approved $2 billion in aid to cities with high 
unemployment or a high concentration of poverty, an estimated 20,000 localities 
in all. With this money -- which would be guaranteed by formula, not 
distributed through grants -- cities can fund education, health and job 
programs, as long as they are "related to crime prevention," said Rep. John 
Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), who sponsored the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to that, the bill would establish a $1.3-billion "Ounce of 
Prevention Fund" that would provide cities with yet more grants for social 
programs aimed at deterring crime -- such as keeping schools open into the 
evening in troubled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 And in addition to that , the bill promises $525 million to fund job-training 
initiatives in distressed areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This laundry list suggests to me that Congress doesn't have any good ideas 
about how to prevent crime either," said James Q. Wilson, a law enforcement 
expert at the UCLA School of Management. "It seems to me another example of 
Congress throwing money at a problem and hoping some will stick." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledge that creating so many separate and 
potentially overlapping prevention programs may not make sense; privately, some 
even agree that the Conyers plan is revenue sharing by another name, and 
question its relevance to fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But for both political and policy reasons, the Administration is committed to 
protecting the full $9 billion the House allocated to prevention. On policy 
grounds, the Administration believes the money will permit large-scale tests of 
existing experiments aimed at providing young people with an array of 
alternatives to crime, said Peter Edelman, the counselor in the Health and 
Human Services Department and co-chairman of an Administration task force on 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Administration is convinced that House liberals will abandon the 
legislation if the prevention funds are cut, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's top priority for the legislation is fulfilling his campaign promise 
to hire 100,000 new police officers; that adds another $9 billion to the bottom 
line. The Administration also supports several billion dollars in assorted 
spending included in both bills, such as money to establish a police corps 
similar to the national service program, and funds to hire more FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the White House and congressional Democratic leaders are committed to 
including sufficient spending on prison construction to ensure that Republicans 
can't paint the final package as soft on criminals, officials say. Biden's 
estimate on that tab: at least $6 billion for prisons (compared with $3 billion 
in the Senate bill and more than $13 billion in the House legislation), plus 
another $3 billion for military-style boot camps. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be enough to satisfy all the partisans in the crime debate, but the 
prospect of pouring so much money into these new spending programs distresses 
Congress' small band of deficit hawks. They see in this spending escalation the 
prototypical legislative bidding war that last year's pay-as-you-go budget 
rules were intended to eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government is broke, and we now have a crime bill totaling $20 
(billion) to $30 billion," said Rep. Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.). "There is no 
focus here. It is amazing the ideas that found themselves into the crime bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Biden countered: "Tim is wrong that the buying off is buying off for a 
political need. There is a legitimate need for these programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other fiscal hawks, Penny is skeptical that the full personnel cuts 
expected to fund the crime bill will ever materialize. Last week, the House 
passed legislation exempting the Department of Veterans Affairs health program 
from the proposed personnel cutbacks, "which makes me worry we don't have the 
guts to stick to our schedule," Penny said. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, many say Congress will have to cut other programs to fund its 
crime initiatives, or scale back the expansive promises now being carved into 
law. "One of the problems of running the price tag on this bill up so high," 
Penny said, "is we are promising way more than we can deliver."

CLINTON ISSUES APPEAL TO RWANDAN FACTIONS; AFRICA: PRESIDENT CALLS FOR END TO 
ETHNIC WARFARE AND OFFERS HELP IN ANY NEGOTIATIONS. REBELS SEAL THE BORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 President Clinton appealed Saturday to leaders of Rwanda's rival sides to halt 
their ethnic warfare, promising U.S. participation in any negotiations aimed at 
ending the continuing slaughter of civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Saturday, Rwandan rebels sealed the border, stranding tens of thousands 
of people desperate to escape the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "On behalf of all of the American people, I call on the Rwandan army and the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front to agree to an immediate cease-fire and return to 
negotiations aimed at a lasting peace in their country," the President said in 
a special radio address. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I reaffirm the American commitment to participate in renewed 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the mass killing of Rwandans has "shocked and appalled" the world 
community and "touched the hearts" of all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100,000 Rwandans are believed to have been slain over the last three 
weeks, with some estimates running as high as 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's appeal came as warfare continued between Rwanda's warring Hutu 
and Tutsi groups and a mass migration of refugees to neighboring Tanzania was 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the border was closed, about 250,000 men, women and children managed to 
cross into neighboring countries in a 24-hour period. They lugged sacks of 
food, mattresses and cooking utensils, the Associated Press reported. U.N. 
officials said it was the most rapid exodus they had ever witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said members of both groups were among the refugees. Most are 
believed to be Tutsi, who are afraid of being massacred by militias or Hutu-run 
government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief workers at a makeshift refugee camp in Tanzania said they were already 
in desperate need of water. They said food supplies would last only four or 
five days. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp is a simple open space 10 miles from the Rwandan border, and the tens 
of thousands who had already arrived lacked any shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 30 to 40 U.N. workers and staff members from the Tanzanian 
Red Cross, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the humanitarian 
group Doctors Without Borders on hand to care for the throng. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are sick, some are wounded, some are near starvation," a senior aid 
official told the Reuters news agency. "They are still arriving. They will 
require massive international aid in the next few weeks to keep them alive." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials reported sporadic mortar exchanges between mostly Tutsi rebels 
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front and forces of the Hutu-dominated government in 
Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said police and militia 
gunned down 300 mainly Tutsi civilians from a crowd of 5,000 trying to escape 
from a sports stadium in the southwest town of Cyangugu on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It said it had reports that 40 to 50 people were butchered there each night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting in Rwanda erupted after President Juvenal Habyarimana and the leader 
of neighboring Burundi -- both Hutus -- were killed in a plane crash in Kigali 
on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Habyarimana's presidential guard, some regular army troops and youth militias 
formed by Hutu-dominated political parties began killing government ministers 
and Tutsi and Hutu supporters of a plan to share power with the Tutsi in a 
proposed government. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bloodletting showing few signs of abating, U.N. Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked the Security Council on Friday to reconsider its 
decision to withdraw all but a token contingent of U.N. forces from the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Salim Ahmed Salim, the secretary general of the Organization of 
African Unity, condemned the Security Council's inaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Security Council must recognize it is the responsibility of the 
international community to end the large-scale killings and genocide being 
perpetrated in Rwanda," Salim said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his radio address, Clinton applauded "the efforts of regional leaders 
actively engaged in the quest for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 He called on the leaders of Rwanda "to recognize their common bond of humanity 
and to reject the senseless and criminal violence that continues to plague 
their country." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 
White House hoped the taped message would be "pumped into Rwanda" to send a 
strong signal to those responsible for the bloodshed.

TOWN REVIVES AS REOPENED RIVER DRAWS ANGLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bearing cash and spreading joy, anglers returned to this beleaguered town 
Saturday for the first time since a disastrous 1991 pesticide spill killed more 
than 1 million fish and devastated the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprisingly rapid comeback, the Upper Sacramento River ecosystem has 
recovered well enough to support a population of native and hatchery trout, 
drawing anglers from all over Northern California and giving motel owners the 
first chance in ages to use their "No Vacancy" signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it. This is great," said Charles Davis, an unemployed tree pruner from 
Dunsmuir shortly before he caught three rainbow trout. "This is going to help 
this town tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunsmuir has struggled to survive since July, 1991, when a Southern Pacific 
train derailed and dumped 19,000 gallons of the pesticide metam sodium into the 
river just north of town. The spill killed virtually everything in the river 
for 40 miles downstream and sent a cloud of toxic fumes through Dunsmuir that 
sickened some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a state study found that more environmental damage was sustained 
than thought -- including the discovery that many more fish died than 
biologists first believed. Scientists also say three previously undiscovered 
species of small snail were rendered extinct by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the railroad has agreed to pay $40 million to the state and $14.5 
million to spill victims, many town residents remain embittered by the 
disaster. They worry that the poison may cause lingering health problems. They 
fear that their businesses may not survive. And they are angry over what they 
perceive as a lack of fair compensation from Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last 2 1/2 years have been a very difficult period of time for community 
life in Dunsmuir," City Manager Alan Harvey said. "We are looking forward to 
this season as a rebirth, a new beginning, a chance to enjoy what the Upper 
Sacramento can mean for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the river is still many years from complete recovery, the state 
Department of Fish and Game concluded that reopening the waterway to limited 
fishing would not seriously hamper the continued revival of the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of the season, most anglers headed to a six-mile stretch of 
river where about 2,000 hatchery trout had been planted earlier in the week. 
They were allowed to catch and keep up to five fish a day -- planters or native 
rainbow trout. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the rest of the damaged river, anglers were permitted to fish for prized 
native trout, but were required to throw back anything they caught. Anglers 
along the entire 40 miles of river were required to use barbless hooks to 
reduce the risk of injury to native fish that escaped or were released. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the restrictions, anglers who have long favored the area heralded the 
reopening of the river, which draws the casual fisherman because of the easy 
access and fly fishers because of the native trout. Local proprietors estimated 
that hundreds of fishers showed up for the reopening Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be wonderful for the town," said 74-year-old Ed Hiatt of Woodland, 
who has been coming here to fish since the 1920s. "They practically died 
without the tourism." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Fish and Game expects to plant about 27,000 hatchery fish in 
the river this season. Most of them are not as hardy as the native trout and 
will be caught by anglers or perish during the winter. The hatchery fish are 
unlikely to dilute the genetic stock of native trout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased that less than three years after the accident, things are 
getting back much nearer to normal than they have been," Southern Pacific 
spokesman Mike Furtney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The native trout appear to be making a strong comeback, as survivors have 
moved in from tributary streams and the river above the spill site. Fish and 
Game biologists estimate there are now about 1,250 natives per mile and predict 
that will quadruple to 5,000 per mile in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the spill, biologists estimate that the river contained more than 
300,000 trout -- about 7,500 per mile -- along with more than 750,000 riffle 
sculpin and other kinds of fish. Until the recent completion of a detailed fish 
count that included tallying frozen fish carcasses, officials had pegged the 
fish kill at hundreds of thousands. The scientists now say their estimate of 
more than 1 million fish killed is conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also found that the spill took a heavy toll on terrestrial species, 
killing 30% of the birds and mammals near the river, 4,000 giant salamanders 
and hundreds of mature trees. The three species of snails discovered extinct 
were among 27 kinds of mollusks now known to have inhabited the river before 
the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were three species previously unknown to science that were destroyed," 
said Fish and Game biologist Mark Stopher, who headed the damage assessment 
team. "They don't even have names. We found them from the shells left in the 
river." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the trout, species such as mollusks, sculpin and crayfish are making a 
slow comeback largely because they are less mobile. Part of the settlement 
money may be spent to transplant these species from other rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Cantrell used to enjoy fishing in the river a few blocks from his home, 
but now, at age 46, he said he is totally disabled from exposure to the 
pesticide cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 The former energy consultant said he also has lost much of his lung function, 
has had four operations to repair intestinal damage and cannot remain out of 
bed for more than a few hours a day. His son, Mark, 17, also suffered lung 
damage from the fumes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people very bitter about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Health Services conducted a door-to-door survey nine 
months after the spill and found that people exposed to the poison reported a 
higher incidence of mood changes, vision changes and diarrhea than people who 
were out of town at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But state medical experts said they could not determine whether the metam 
sodium has caused long-term health effects. The state is not attempting to 
monitor victims of the spill and has no record of how many people were affected 
or how many remain ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "For investigators to determine that a particular exposure in a complex 
environment is responsible is a very hard thing to do," said Rick Kreutzer of 
the Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easier, perhaps, to see the social effects of the disaster. Former Mayor 
Virginia Barham was recalled by the town's voters, along with two City Council 
members, amid charges that they were insensitive to victims of the spill. The 
former city manager, who had suggested that some residents were falsely 
claiming to be ill so they could collect from Southern Pacific, resigned after 
the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, many of the 3,000 people who filed claims against the railroad are 
concerned that the $14.5-million settlement will fall far short of paying for 
their actual damages. Once attorneys' fees and legal costs are deducted, the 
settlement works out to about $3,000 a person. 
</P>
<P>
 "They paid the state more than they paid us, which means the fish are worth 
more than the community's health," said Cantrell, the ailing energy consultant. 
"First we were victimized by Southern Pacific and now by the court system."

S. AFRICANS START COUNTING VOTES ROUND THE CLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All across this anxious nation, inside town halls, auditoriums and school 
lunchrooms, election officials Saturday began the tedious task of counting by 
hand the millions of paper ballots that will usher in South Africa's first 
democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
 The process, which the African National Congress predicted will give it an 
"overwhelming victory," started slowly in the nearly 900 counting centers. But 
by nightfall, the count of votes cast by an estimated 23 million South Africans 
in national and provincial elections was well under way in most areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Early returns, representing 8% of the vote, showed the ANC with 53% of the 
vote and current President Frederik W. de Klerk's National Party with 34%. 
Those results were too early to be of much significance, though the election is 
expected to be won handily by Nelson Mandela's ANC, with the National Party 
finishing a distant second. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote counting will continue around the clock until a final result is 
announced, perhaps by Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africans on Saturday expressed their clear delight with the voting 
itself, which was surprisingly orderly and peaceful. But, as the returns came 
in, many began to worry about whether the losing parties will willingly abide 
by the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the news was mostly good. International election observers, political 
leaders and the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) pronounced the voting 
free and fair. And police said the past week had marked one of the quietest in 
South African history, with even ordinary crime plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seldom in the annals of human history has such a fundamental transformation 
been accomplished in such a relatively peaceful manner," said a statement 
issued by observers from the Commonwealth, the grouping of former British 
colonies that the new democratic South Africa is expected to quickly rejoin. 
"Despite organizational problems, the voting was a success and the people were 
able to participate freely." 
</P>
<P>
 Counting at some centers Saturday was delayed for hours because of 
difficulties in reconciling the number of marked ballots with the number that 
had been distributed to polling stations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johann Kriegler, chairman of the IEC and the man responsible for formally 
declaring the results free and fair, ordered his workers late Saturday to skip 
that cumbersome reconciliation process, if necessary, and "speed up the 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Kriegler said he was urging counting officers: "Don't try the impossible. Get 
on with the count. People are entitled to know what the results are." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood Saturday was upbeat at the Sandown Town Hall, near Johannesburg, 
where election officials under the watchful eye of party officers counted 
ballots from 12 polling stations in the white suburbs as well as the black 
township of Alexandra. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no panic here at all," said Ron Mudge, one of the National Party's 
agents. "Everyone is doing a good job, and all the parties are very friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 A count of the first two polling stations in Alexandra, one of the thousands 
of places where blacks voted for the first time in their country's history, 
gave the ANC more than 90% of the vote. Election officials said they were 
pleasantly surprised by the small number of ballots that had to be disqualified 
for being wrongly marked. And they credited the electoral commission's voter 
education campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been wonderful, tremendous," said Willem Hefer, one of the ANC officers 
at the Sandown Town Hall. "We're very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that the sheer size of the task, involving more than 50 counters 
working in 12-hour shifts, is daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked on every white election since 1958, but those were absolute 
play-play compared to now," Hefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The counting process was peaceful across most of the nation, though hitches 
were reported in a few areas, primarily in rural regions where the three 
scheduled days of voting had been extended to a fourth day on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief pay strike by some IEC workers delayed vote counting in one office in 
the former Transkei homeland. The process also got off to a slow start in the 
Durban City Hall, where officials blamed disorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside a large vote-counting center in Soweto, a fight broke out between 
political party representatives when a car filled with blank ballot papers 
showed up. But the brawl was broken up by police, and election officials blamed 
the incident on a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africans closely followed the election returns on two TV channels of the 
state-owned national broadcasting company, which delivered results and 
commentary in English, Afrikaans and four African languages. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC campaign workers danced and celebrated at a downtown Johannesburg hotel. 
ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa predicted a sweeping victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident in our hearts that the people of this country have voted for 
the ANC in overwhelming numbers," he said. "The ANC is poised to achieve 
overwhelming victory." 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk, surrounded by his supporters at the National Party offices, said he 
felt "buoyant." And he welcomed some early returns that showed his party with 
strong support in the Western Cape province, where the National Party hopes to 
defeat the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of South Africa's 3 million mixed-race Colored citizens live in that 
region, and their fear of a black-controlled government has made them an 
important support base for the National Party. 
</P>
<P>
 But the winner of the election will almost certainly be the ANC, making 
Mandela the new president and giving the party the opportunity to pick one of 
the new executive vice presidents. The only question is whether the ANC will 
achieve the 67% of parliamentary seats required to write and approve a new, 
permanent constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Party will probably finish second, with enough votes to make De 
Klerk an executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was the National Party that brutally imposed apartheid in 1948, De 
Klerk, facing growing international isolation and an economic recession, began 
to reverse its system in 1990. The "new" National Party opened its membership 
rolls to all races and has courted voters who share its worries about the ANC 
and especially about members of the Communist Party in the ANC hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for third place is primarily among three of the 18 parties on the 
national ballot. One is Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, 
which had demanded autonomy for the country's Zulus, the nation's largest 
ethnic group. The second is the Freedom Front, a splinter party of right-wing 
whites who want an autonomous white homeland. And the third is the radical 
black Pan-Africanist Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Any party winning at least 5% of the vote will be able to claim a seat in the 
new president's Cabinet. That provision in the interim constitution was 
originally designed to protect parties emerging from these elections with small 
though significant support. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk has said repeatedly that he will abide by the decision of the 
electorate. But other parties have expressed some reservations and complained 
about irregularities in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi's agreement a week before the elections to allow his Inkatha party 
to participate in the voting went some way toward heading off fears of a blood 
bath following the elections. Fighting between Inkatha and ANC supporters in 
Natal province has killed thousands in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Saturday, Buthelezi expressed concern about the slow vote count in some 
regions of Natal, saying it raised concerns of "hanky-panky." Although he said 
he will respect the results if the voting is declared free and fair, Buthelezi 
added that his supporters might become angry if they feel cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 If voting irregularities turn out to be widespread, he said, "there are going 
to be very serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, the man many credited with pressuring 
Inkatha into participating in the elections, issued a nationally televised 
appeal Saturday to Zulus and other South Africans to "turn their backs against 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Zwelithini said the Zulu nation "still has a very long and hard road to 
travel. By voting, we have just taken the first step toward our destiny."

COLUMN ONE; SUDDEN DEATH ON THE STREETS; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION 
IN HIT-AND-RUN CASES. THIS MOST RANDOM OF CRIMES LEAVES VICTIMS' FAMILIES IN 
SHOCK AND POLICE FRUSTRATED BY ELUSIVE SUSPECTS AND CLUES.

<P>
 On the grounds of a majestic home in Hancock Park, the traces of the epidemic 
are subtle. 
</P>
<P>
 Patches of dirt stand out as scabs in what had been a lovely corner garden. 
Littering the ground are shards of glass, an automobile headlight and, wrapped 
in cellophane, a wilting bouquet. A hit-and-run driver killed Marcy Lewis in a 
horrific flash right here. 
</P>
<P>
 On a barren sidewalk in Harbor City, outlining a vacant corner lot claimed by 
weeds, votive candles burn for Porfiria Lopez. A hit-and-run driver struck her 
in the street, but most of her body came to rest on this corner, where a 
homemade shrine marks the grief of strangers and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither case has been solved. The women died within an hour of each other on 
the same March evening in a region where such deaths are routine: Southern 
California leads the nation in hit-and-run accidents -- fatal and otherwise. 
And Los Angeles by far leads the state. 
</P>
<P>
 With its large population and dependence on the automobile, Los Angeles simply 
has more drivers on the road. It also has more who are likely to be involved in 
hit-and-runs: people who are driving without a license, without insurance or in 
an unregistered vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 When they hit something -- or someone -- their first impulse often is to flee. 
Police believe that this is particularly true of some illegal immigrants, whose 
fear of government officials outweighs what they might not understand as their 
obligation to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in general, many hit-and-run drivers are drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims defy typecasting. All ages, races and classes have been struck -- 
in cars, on bicycles and on foot. And the fleeing driver often gets away, 
stealing from victims' families even the sad satisfaction of justice done. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, survivors make pilgrimages to the site where their loved one fell, in 
search of information or, failing that, a sense of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want to do is get this murderer," Marcy Lewis' mother-in-law, Pat 
Lewis, pleads to no one and everyone at once. She cannot look at the garden, 
with its grisly reminders, for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the driver of a white '78 Chevy van raced through a stop sign at 
about 70 m.p.h. and crashed into the new Infiniti that was carrying Marcy Lewis 
and her husband, Simon, home to Sherman Oaks. Lewis, 27, a Music Center 
publicist, never had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband of less than five months, an independent film producer who at 36 
is the youngest of the Lewis sons, is still hospitalized with a fragile hold on 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver escaped by running away. The van's last registered owner cannot be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lewises, who immigrated to Los Angeles 17 years ago from London, are 
offering a reward for information leading to prosecution. Donations have pushed 
the total above $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say their suspect could have fled the country. More than a month after 
the accident, they say they have nothing; not even the crackpots have called 
with clues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the anonymity of what happened here," says Simon's brother Jonathan. 
"For me, that is what makes it so heinous. This person came out of the blue and 
went back into the blue. It's like a professional hit." 
</P>
<P>
 "They act like God, these people!" says his mother, near tears. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, half of the 51,627 surface street accidents reported to the Los 
Angeles Police Department were hit-and-runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Such cases are among the most difficult to solve. There is no motive. 
Witnesses see different things in the blur of a passing vehicle, or the glow of 
taillights, or perhaps nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
 License plates may have expired. Registration records can be a dead end; 
fictitious names can be used. Police say suspects often slip across the border 
into Mexico or beyond. Then another case comes along. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, there are so many hit-and-runs that police routinely ignore 
less serious ones involving only property damage. If they investigated them 
all, they say, they would do nothing else. The department does not keep records 
on how many are solved, but a rough accounting from the commanders of LAPD's 
four traffic divisions shows that in about half of the fatal cases -- the ones 
given the most attention -- suspects are eventually found. 
</P>
<P>
 The hit-and-run problem is exacerbated by what people in and outside the 
government describe as an insidious and deadly cycle in California. As 
legislators pass more laws to keep irresponsible drivers off the road, the 
truly irresponsible seem to flout them even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some measures -- such as automatic license suspensions for one drunk 
driving arrest -- are credited with saving thousands of lives, there is often 
fallout, too. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, before an owner can register a vehicle, he must pay outstanding 
traffic or parking fines. So instead of coming clean, the owner -- especially a 
poor one -- may decide not to register the vehicle. Then, he cannot insure it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he does register his vehicle, getting insurance after a drunk driving 
arrest is tough. An existing policy may be canceled or rates may skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Motor Vehicles estimates that 150,000 convicted drunk 
drivers each year do not even try to get their licenses back -- or maintain an 
insurance policy -- but drive nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one knows how many regularly drive without a license, the DMV 
estimates the number at 10% of the state's drivers, or about 2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 This includes many of the 41,815 Californians who had their licenses revoked 
last year, and the 1.2 million others whose licenses were suspended. The 
primary reasons were driving without insurance and driving while drunk. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Normandie Avenue in Harbor City is four lanes wide, bordered by housing 
projects, graffiti-scrawled walls, a church and a market where the homeboys 
like to hang. Cars heading down the hill fly toward Pacific Coast Highway. 
Hardly anybody in the neighborhood knows that the speed limit is 35. Laws get 
broken here all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same evening that the Lewises were driving through Hancock Park, 
Porfiria Lopez, 62, and her neighbor, Esther Alvarado, were walking along 
Normandie toward their church, the Iglesia Apostolica de la Fe Cristo Jesus. 
They were right on time to make the 6:30 service, with Bibles and hymn books in 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The women, friends for 14 years, crossed Normandie halfway and waited for the 
westbound traffic to pass. As they stood in the street, Lopez remarked to 
Alvarado about one car that seemed to be traveling particularly fast. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same instant, Alvarado heard a thud, turned around, and screamed. 
Lopez's body was flying through the air, disintegrating from the impact of the 
speeding car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a bullet that passed by," Alvarado says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the Fire Department hosed down the area, Lopez's relatives found 
bits of her flesh the next day. Her ankle and foot were recovered more than a 
block away. Her blood stains the street still. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car that killed her -- a silver color, investigators believe 
-- never slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing," Los Angeles police Detective Bob Platt says. "Sometimes I 
just go walk around the neighborhood, hoping somebody will come up to me, tell 
me something that they saw that will lead me someplace." 
</P>
<P>
 And Platt notes with irony that barring some gross vehicular violation -- such 
as driving while drunk -- the driver might not have been charged with a 
criminal offense if he had stopped. He says Lopez may have contributed to her 
death by jaywalking -- although her relatives point out that the closest 
crosswalk is blocks away. Fleeing the scene of an accident, however, is a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But like the vast majority of hit-and-run cases -- which usually draw little 
attention from the public and the media -- there is no reward offered for 
information in the death of Lopez, a mother of two and grandmother of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family is left with only a faint hope that somebody will come forward with 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours after Lopez was killed, the small shrine was erected on the 
corner. The neighborhood people say it was the homeboys who built the cross. 
Lopez didn't like the gangs, but she was a friend to all. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her family -- her husband, sister, nieces and nephews -- have lived on 
these desolate blocks for nearly 30 years. 
</P>

 "Black people, white people, people of all different races have been bringing 
flowers and cards," says her nephew, Eddie Torres. "They knew her as a nice 
lady. Everybody respected her. My homeboys would be doing something wrong, and 
my aunt would come out and tell them to stop. And they would." 
</P>
<P>
 Says her 64-year-old sister, Petra Lopez, through tears, "We were like one 
person. We were always together. She was so accepting of her life. She was so 
good. She always saw the good in everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's death tears at Detective Platt too. Like her relatives, he cannot 
erase the ignoble image of her body torn into bits. But soon, he says, the case 
will likely go into "never-never land." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will always be open, but it's not going to be solved without the citizens' 
help," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it depends on whether the person who did this has a conscience. If it was 
a kid, a gangbanger type, that's doubtful. The average citizen would have 
stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 If Platt does make an arrest in the case, he says, the likely charge would be 
felony hit-and-run, tacked on to the original violation: misdemeanor 
manslaughter -- what traffic cops describe as a "ticket with a body." 
</P>

<P>
 Police and Highway Patrol officers say that if you work hit-and-runs long 
enough, you notice certain themes. Drivers most likely to be involved in such 
accidents feel they have something to lose by stopping, or they don't 
understand the laws of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Bill Whittacker, officer in charge of the LAPD's South Traffic 
Division, says an internal audit of January arrests showed that 65% of his 
division's felony traffic suspects were in the country illegally. He says the 
department was able to determine the suspects' immigration status based on 
questions asked during booking. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Litsinger, the department's chief traffic detective in Central Division, 
says "easily 75%" of felony traffic suspects in his area are undocumented 
immigrants. Estimates from traffic investigators in the LAPD's other two 
divisions are not quite as high. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants do not necessarily get involved in more accidents than 
other drivers, but officers believe that some are less likely to stop -- 
particularly those from places such as Mexico and Central America, where 
traffic laws can be onerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, DMV officials worry that the new law requiring drivers to show proof 
of legal residency before they can be issued a driver's license may encourage 
more unskilled -- and unlicensed -- drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the fear factor is a big part in all this," says Sgt. Julio Nunez, 
assistant watch commander of the LAPD's South Traffic Division. "Many of the 
individuals believe the laws are the same as where they came from. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mexico, if you don't have insurance, or money for the hospital or repairs, 
they can arrest you and put you in jail. Secondly, because we wear a law 
enforcement uniform, they think we are tied in with immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez has applied for a federal grant to fund a program he hopes will 
alleviate some of the problem by providing public service announcements in 
Spanish, explaining traffic laws and warning of the dangers of driving while 
drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they have a fear of police and because they have a lack of 
understanding, there is a greater likelihood that Spanish-speaking individuals 
will be hit-and-run drivers," Nunez says. 
</P>
<P>
 But other police and Highway Patrol officers say that education efforts, while 
laudable, are at best long-term. And they say even good detective work becomes 
almost meaningless when suspects flee across the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Avila Vegahas evaded Anaheim police for nearly three years. They say 
his car jumped a curb and pinned 16-year-old Jose Viramontes against a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Viramontes lost his left leg. He spent almost a year in the hospital and never 
was able to return to high school. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as the evening of the accident, police said they believed Avila was 
already in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like him to pay for what he did," Viramontes says. "But I don't think 
he's going to come back around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Police in the San Fernando Valley tell a similar tale about Enrique Garcia 
Robles. They say he killed Gayle Gozar, 19, when he ran a red light and smashed 
his Chevy Blazer into a Nissan Sentra driven by Gozar's friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tank versus a tin can, basically," says Detective Jim Mann, who 
investigated the case three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were about a second behind him the whole time," says Mann of the police 
efforts to track Garcia down. "Then he crossed into Mexico and disappeared." 
</P>

<P>
 Despite long odds, investigators sometimes get lucky. Juan Ramon Martinez, 25, 
has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of Kellie Rae Wilson, a 
single mother of a 4-year-old boy, as she rode her red bicycle in Azusa Canyon 
on a sunny afternoon in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The state says Martinez's weapon was his car, a 1959 Dodge Royal. The officers 
involved in the case look upon his arrest as a victory, a case of a big-time 
hit-and-run driver who did not get away. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Duffy, a public defender in Pomona, will not talk about his client other 
than to say that he is very remorseful. "He wants the family to know that he 
wished it had never happened," Duffy says. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and the Highway Patrol say Martinez hit Wilson as she was pedaling 
up a canyon hill on California 39. The force of the impact shattered the 
windshield of Martinez's car, and threw Wilson down an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson died within an hour. She was 30, a horticulturist and an assistant 
manager at a Santa Monica bike shop. Her leg was severed and the left side of 
her body was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver never stopped, passing one of Wilson's friends a little farther 
down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, it was pure happenstance that put Martinez behind bars. He has 
pleaded not guilty and, unable to make $1 million bail, awaits a preliminary 
hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 18 miles from the spot where Martinez allegedly hit Wilson, Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies crested a hill and saw his car in the opposing lane. 
Although they had no report of the hit-and-run, the deputies noticed the 
Dodge's shattered windshield and said that just as they were about to pull 
Martinez over, his car drifted toward them. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the law enforcement account, when Martinez refused to stop, the 
deputies pursued him at speeds as high as 85 m.p.h. Witnesses said the chase 
ended when Martinez hit a bus stop sign -- and a second bicyclist -- as he was 
turning right. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say he got out of the car, ran and jumped a fence. A plainclothes 
police officer joined the chase, captured Martinez and held him for the 
deputies to arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests showed that Martinez's blood alcohol level met the legal definition of 
drunk, prosecutor Kathy Cady says. Because Martinez has a drunk-driving 
conviction, she adds, the filing of the second-degree murder charge is apt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only thing that's left in terms of making a difference," says 
Wilson's boyfriend, cinematographer Jonathan Rho. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister, Kim Glasscock of Nashville, Tenn., says she plans to attend 
Martinez's trial to make a statement about the damage caused by a hit-and-run 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am going to put up the fight that Kellie would have wanted to put this guy 
behind bars," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This person had complete control as to whether or not this accident would 
happen. I guess that makes the anger more intense. And there is nothing we can 
do." Dangerous Driving

DESEGREGATION CALLED PERIL TO BLACK COLLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC HARRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a black Mississippian named Jake Ayers sued the state over its dual 
system of higher education in 1975, all he wanted was for his children to be 
able to attend a historically black college and get an education equal to that 
available at white schools. 
</P>
<P>
 As his widow, Lillie Ayers, tells it, the suit brought results: "A day or two 
later, or it might have been the same day he filed the lawsuit, the governor 
announced that all black colleges would now be universities," she said. "They 
did nothing else -- just gave them that name and left them the way they were." 
</P>
<P>
 And on Saturday, state and national civil rights leaders led a protest march 
of 15,000 people through the rain to the state Capitol. They contend that in 
the almost two decades since the lawsuit was filed, not much else has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi's three black public universities remain overwhelmingly black -- 
just as the state's five other universities are overwhelmingly white. The 
state's policies and practices -- from the allocation of funds to the quality 
of construction on black campuses to the creation and distribution of academic 
programs -- all ensure that black people get inferior educations, critics of 
the system maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 After the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 criticized the state's failure to 
eliminate vestiges of segregation in its universities, Mississippi came up with 
a plan to address Ayers' complaints. But many black Mississippians consider the 
proposed remedy worse than the problem it purported to correct: The state 
proposed to eliminate segregation by closing black universities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plan that alarmed supporters of black colleges across the nation, 
Mississippi proposed closing one black school and merging another with a white 
university, in effect leaving the state with one black school. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a revised settlement plan that the black plaintiffs also rejected, one 
black school and one white school would be closed, and predominantly black 
Jackson State University would be given more money and enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Justice Department, in supporting the plaintiffs, advanced an 
alternative proposal that many whites here consider equally outrageous: 
strengthening black colleges (and making them more attractive to whites) by 
moving prestigious programs away from white schools to black ones. Under this 
plan, no school would be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The two widely divergent visions of the future of higher education will face 
off May 9 in a federal courtroom in Oxford, home of Ole Miss, the University of 
Mississippi, which was the desegregation battleground where James Meredith 
needed armed guards to enroll as the first black student in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "You kill our schools, you kill our communities," said Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., 
executive director of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, 
which supports improving the black schools rather than closing them. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other civil rights leaders say they worry that a Mississippi precedent 
of closing schools could lead to the widespread elimination of black 
institutions that nurtured and developed African Americans during the decades 
when black people had no other means of securing a higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we allow state-supported, historically black colleges and universities to 
be dismantled in Mississippi, it will set the stage for them to be dismantled 
in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, the Carolinas, Virginia and throughout the 
nation," Chavis said at press conference before the march. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative plan, involving switching academic programs from white schools 
to black schools, is strongly opposed by many whites, however, who see it as 
gutting the white institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the plan, which would switch the University of Mississippi's 
medical school to Jackson State, Ole Miss Chancellor Gerald Turner told the 
Jackson Clarion-Ledger newspaper: "It would certainly strip the university of 
much of what it is nationally renowned for." And questions remain about whether 
whites would attend mainly black institutions, even if academic programs were 
switched. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks fighting for continued survival of the historically black schools 
contend that they are just asking for equal funding and treatment and are not 
championing a form of separate but equal education. White students always were 
welcomed at the black schools but chose not to attend, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though blacks were the ones discriminated against, the state College 
Board's proposal would "punish" black plaintiffs for bringing the lawsuit, said 
Aaron Henry, president emeritus of the Mississippi chapter of the NAACP and 
another speaker at the march. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis said the impact of the Mississippi case might prove to be of greater 
importance to African Americans than was Brown vs. the Board of Education of 
Topeka, Kan., the landmark case that led to the desegregation of public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis and William F. Gibson, chairman of the NAACP's board of directors, said 
all of the resources of the organization are behind black plaintiffs in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 college students from throughout the South were bused into Jackson 
for the protest march. They were joined by thousands of chanting, singing 
Mississippi residents in a three-mile walk from Jackson State to the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 The mostly black crowd stopped for a prayer outside the governor's mansion 
before moving on for a rally on the grounds of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchers carried banners reading, "It's about equity in education" and "Save 
H.B.C.U." (historically black colleges and universities). 
</P>
<P>
 "They should not take away the only thing that we've got," said Andre Smith, a 
student at Jackson State Learning Center who participated in the march. 
"Education is the most important thing to get us out of poverty and the 
conditions we are in." 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest plan proposed by the College Board before negotiations broke 
down last month, the board proposed closing predominantly black Mississippi 
Valley State University, and also the predominantly white Mississippi 
University for Women, which would merge with another white school. The plan 
also would provide $20 million for Jackson State to acquire property and 
bolster its endowment. The state would also consider allowing Jackson State to 
operate a law school. 
</P>
<P>
 It is just one of a number of plans presented to U.S. District Judge Neal 
Biggers Jr., who ultimately will decide on a remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Justice Department plan would make Jackson State a dominant force 
in Mississippi education, giving it new schools of medicine, law and 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jake Ayers, a civil rights activist who had helped desegregate public 
schools in the state, filed his lawsuit in 1975, he had grown disenchanted with 
integration, his widow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned that being mixed with the white folk didn't work," said Lillie 
Ayers. When the public schools were desegregated, nearly all of the white 
students fled to private schools, she said. Suddenly, black students found 
themselves in schools with mostly white teachers, many of whom did not relate 
to the students as well as did the black teachers who had taught them under 
segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband's goal was not further integration of the state's colleges, but 
equity, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents show that the state's three black collegess receive less 
per-pupil funding than white schools. Further, black and white schools 
duplicate many programs. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, three white universities opened centers in Jackson with curricula 
similar to Jackson State's. The suit contends they were opened so white 
students in Jackson could attend college without having to attend a black 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of fiscal inequity is also provided in court documents: In 1970, 
the state's two land grant universities received $4.5 million in federal funds 
under one program. Mississippi State University, the predominantly white 
school, received $4.3 million while Alcorn State University, the black school, 
received $127,000, or 2.8%, of the funds. In addition, Alcorn did not receive 
funds under other federal programs that provided money to Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Supreme Court, in its first ruling to address desegregation in public 
colleges, sent the Ayers case back to a lower court in 1992, it said that it 
wasn't enough for states merely to adopt race-neutral policies. It specifically 
named four areas that needed to be addressed: admissions policy, duplication of 
programs, the number of campuses needed in the state and the mission of each 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis contended Saturday that remedies in each of those areas come down to 
equity in funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic to witness the dismantlement of apartheid in South Africa and 
here in the United States, in the Southland of Mississippi, it appears the 
state wants to erect a new form of apartheid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't tolerate it in South Africa, and we won't tolerate it in 
Mississippi."

QUESTIONS CLOUD LOAN DEFAULT IN STATE PROGRAM; FINANCES: CAL-MORTGAGE LOST 
NEARLY $5 MILLION. OFFICIALS ALLEGE FRAUD, BUT KEY PLAYERS DENY WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When a new Beverly Hills company sought a loan guarantee from the state, its 
goal seemed laudable: to expand residential care services in poor neighborhoods 
of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, though, did not meet the state's financial requirements, and one 
of its facilities had a history of serious health and safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the state's Cal-Mortgage program granted $17 million in loan guarantees 
to Community Adult Care Centers of America Inc. four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that money has benefited the poor, and nothing has been built. 
</P>
<P>
 The company defaulted on nearly $5 million in loans and, the state alleges in 
a lawsuit, misappropriated more than $1 million of that sum in a kickback 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate state investigation into activities at CACCOA's two facilities led 
to the indictments of two of the company's business associates on Medi-Cal 
fraud, forgery and tax evasion charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Key players in the loan deal have denied wrongdoing and blamed each other for 
the project's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Cal-Mortgage, a respected financial aid program for nonprofit health 
care providers, get drawn into this tangle -- the first losing transaction in 
its 25-year history? 
</P>
<P>
 A three-month Times examination found that the program was loosely run, 
leaving it vulnerable to manipulation by private business interests, despite 
obvious financial risks for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Also coloring the deal were procedural irregularities, some of which have 
spawned allegations of political influence-peddling and attempted bribery, as 
well as a lawsuit and an investigation by the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a bad deal," said former Cal-Mortgage official Richard A. 
McManus. 
</P>
<P>
 The CACCOA troubles emerge as Cal-Mortgage is struggling to recover from a 
$167-million loan default by Triad Healthcare Inc. of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-Mortgage has played a pivotal role in health facility construction in 
California, enabling health care companies to qualify for low-interest loans 
that they could not obtain without the backing of the state treasury. But the 
program has been temporarily shut down by the Triad default last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 A legislative inquiry into Triad is focusing on possible conflicts of interest 
as well as departures from customary procedures that helped the company obtain 
a Cal-Mortgage guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar procedural irregularities show up in the CACCOA transaction, records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Both deals were accelerated by Larry G. Meeks in his final months as director 
of Cal-Mortgage's parent agency, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks also approved them over the objections of staff analysts who considered 
them unsound investments, according to records and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks -- an appointee of former Gov. George Deukmejian who was replaced in the 
$97,428-a-year job in 1991 -- said in an interview that he gave special 
treatment to CACCOA because its chairman, Howard L. Winkler of Los Angeles, was 
a Deukmejian appointee in another arm of Meeks' agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing this person was close to the governor's office because he was an 
appointee and so forth, I was always very attentive . . . to make sure his 
complaints were responded to," Meeks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler tried to bribe Meeks with about $2,000 and a prostitute while the loan 
guarantee application was under review, state investigators alleged in an 
affidavit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court last year. No criminal charges 
have resulted because the attorney general's office was unable to find 
corroborating evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler declined to comment, but through his attorney, he denied the bribery 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The affidavit alleged that CACCOA obtained the loan guarantee because of those 
bribe offers and "the influence of CACCOA's board chairman, Howard Winkler, who 
was on the board of a governmental unit within that same (state) agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks also told The Times about the alleged bribery attempts, one of which 
occurred during a visit to Winkler's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks said the CACCOA chairman put an undetermined amount of folded bills in 
the breast pocket of his suit. "I was freaked out," Meeks said. "I took it out 
and flung it on his desk and said: 'Don't you ever do that again.' " He said 
Winkler apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 On another trip to Los Angeles, Meeks said, he was staying in a hotel when 
Winkler telephoned to say he was sending over a "high-class call girl" to keep 
him company. Meeks said he angrily told Winkler to "call her off." 
</P>
<P>
 The former state official said he reported the alleged bribery attempts to the 
agency's counsel and was not influenced by them. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's counsel, John Rosskopf, said in an interview that Meeks never 
told him about the prostitute but did say that Winkler had offered him $2,000 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks said he approved the CACCOA application solely because he believed that 
the project would benefit the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a good project," said Meeks, 50, who is now retired on a 
medical disability. "I was intrigued by the concept of it: adult day care. The 
people behind it, I personally did not care for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler's attorney, Harold Greenberg of Los Angeles, said his client did not 
try to bribe Meeks. Greenberg said Winkler did offer Meeks a gift of 
collector's coins -- valued at about $100 -- but that it occurred after 
CACCOA's application was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg said Meeks refused the coins, which Meeks confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators searched the homes of Meeks and Winkler a year ago and 
seized bank records and other documents. Deputy Atty. Gen. Mark Geiger said 
they failed to find corroborating evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks' successor, Dr. David Werdegar, said the transaction should have been 
killed immediately if a bribe was offered. "It defies imagination," he said. 
"If I were offered a bribe . . . everything would come to a screeching halt." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 CACCOA sought a Cal-Mortgage-insured loan in 1990 to finance improvements and 
additions to the former Walnut Convalescent Hospital, a skilled nursing home in 
Long Beach, and to Hope House, a board and care home for recovering substance 
abusers, mentally ill homeless people and ex-felons in Los Angeles' Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 The facilities were owned by Los Angeles businessmen Michael Rosenberg and 
James Salamon, who under CACCOA's proposal would run the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Salamon was banned from managing Hope House or any other board 
and care home in California. He agreed to the ban -- until 1996 -- after the 
state Department of Social Services moved to revoke his license. 
</P>
<P>
 State inspectors found the facility filthy, vermin-infested and unsafe with 
"numerous exposed electrical wires." They also found that residents were poorly 
supervised. Records show that two residents hung themselves in their bedrooms 
in the late 1980s and one of the deaths was not discovered for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This had been a problem facility for a long time," said Lisa K. Hightower, 
senior staff attorney for the Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks said he was unaware of Hope House's citations. He said Cal-Mortgage did 
not routinely check with other state agencies for disciplinary actions against 
applicants. "We never had this problem before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other reasons to deny CACCOA's application, according to 
Cal-Mortgage staff and members of the program's advisory loan committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The application was incomplete, and financial documentation was so inadequate 
that the loan committee twice refused to vote on the CACCOA proposal. After 
what officials said was an unprecedented third review, it was approved with 
stringent conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were just too many unanswered questions," said Dale Flournoy, the staff 
analyst assigned to CACCOA. "I'd say: 'Show me the plans.' . . . I never saw 
final approved architectural plans with specifications." 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member committee voted to recommend approval, but attached 10 
conditions to remedy the application's deficiencies. Four committee members 
interviewed by The Times said they expected that CACCOA would be unable to meet 
the conditions and that the project would die. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conditions should have killed it," said McManus, the former loan 
committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Meeks did not enforce the conditions, although he had endorsed them in 
writing. Records show that he signed final closing documents for the loan 
guarantee in December, even though six conditions were unmet and the company 
had not met a separate requirement to put up 10% of the project cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks said in an interview that he was unaware that the conditions had not 
been met because his staff had not informed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-Mortgage records, however, show that Flournoy, the project officer, wrote 
several memos to Meeks alerting him to CACCOA's noncompliance; the last one was 
three days before the closing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (Meeks) what was wrong with it over and over," Flournoy said. "It made 
no difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks said his approval was based solely on the merit of the project, although 
he acknowledged that CACCOA's application got special handling. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the application was filed, Meeks met privately with Winkler to tell him 
what was required to obtain a state loan guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he extended the help largely because of Winkler's claims of political 
pull and his ties to the agency as a member of its minority educational 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks later scheduled a special meeting of the loan committee solely to hear 
CACCOA's application, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks said he also made an unusual number of inquiries about the progress of 
CACCOA's application. The reason, he said, was that Winkler had complained that 
the application was being held up because of anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nature of the charges was intimidating," said Meeks, who is African 
American. "Here I am black, and I am having these charges made. . . . and I am 
supposed to be very sensitive to this sort of discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler, through his attorney, denied making allegations of anti-Semitism. His 
attorney, Greenberg, said his client sometimes does drop names of political 
officeholders. Winkler's resume lists memberships in several Republican 
organizations, and records show he contributed more than $5,000 to Republican 
candidates in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 While CACCOA's application was wending its way through Cal-Mortgage's review 
process, Department of Social Services investigators were assembling evidence 
of financial irregularities at Hope House that they turned over to the attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, Salamon and Rosenberg were indicted on 15 criminal charges, 
including Medi-Cal fraud, grand theft, lying to state licensing authorities, 
workers' compensation insurance fraud, and failure to pay unemployment 
insurance taxes. They have pleaded not guilty, according to the attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg and Salamon declined through their attorneys to comment on the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the criminal charges deals directly with CACCOA or with the 
participation of Salamon and Rosenberg in CACCOA's Cal-Mortgage transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cal-Mortgage officials now assert in a civil suit against CACCOA, Winkler, 
Rosenberg, Salamon and others that CACCOA was a "mere shell and sham" created 
to defraud the state and obtain money for "personal use." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some site preparation was done, the state's lawsuit asserts that 
CACCOA officials did not improve the two facilities, nor did they construct the 
promised additions. Hope House in Koreatown has since gone into receivership 
and has been shut down because of fire-safety problems. The Long Beach nursing 
home is under new management. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that more than $1 million in loan proceeds paid to 
architects, consultants and contractors hired by CACCOA were kicked back to 
Rosenberg, Salamon, Winkler and other officers of CACCOA. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Cal-Mortgage officials authorized a $336,400 payment for services 
rendered by a firm called Comprehensive Consulting Services. The suit alleges 
that the owner and CACCOA board member Robert Armstrong kept $21,400 and then 
wrote checks to several other people, including one to Winkler for $238,000, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining money was distributed to four religious organizations, 
including, the suit alleges, $50,000 to Congregation Mogen Abraham in Los 
Angeles, whose leader, Rabbi Abraham Low, was convicted last month in U.S. 
District Court of conspiracy to launder drug money. 
</P>
<P>
 Low declined through his attorney to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong and his attorney could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong formally denied the allegations in court documents filed in 1992. He 
has since turned over a memo that he wrote in 1990, detailing the distribution 
of the money, according to the state's attorney, Jeffrey Belote. The memo, 
which The Times has obtained, also alleged that Winkler had directed him to 
write the checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Salamon, Rosenberg and Winkler, through their attorneys, declined interview 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in answers filed with the court, they denied the allegations of civil 
fraud and blamed each other for any misrepresentations or misappropriations of 
loan proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg said he relied on the opinion of experts in consenting to the deal 
and denied that he knowingly submitted false invoices to Cal-Mortgage. He 
alleged that Winkler was "the main power to arrange the loan" because of a 
"special relationship" with Meeks. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he was unaware that Salamon had been barred by the state from 
managing residential-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Salamon acknowledged the state's claim that CACCOA was a "sham," but alleged 
that Winkler, Rosenberg and several others created it. He also alleged that 
these associates took money from CACCOA's bank accounts for their "personal 
use." 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, Winkler said the project could have succeeded if the state 
had not halted it and seized the loan proceeds. Therefore, he said, the state 
is responsible for the losses. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials declared CACCOA in default of its Cal-Mortgage-guaranteed loan 
in March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had failed to make timely payments on the loan, and Cal-Mortgage 
officials had uncovered evidence that some work paid with the loan proceeds had 
not been performed, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 By declaring a default, the state was able to hold back $12 million in 
authorized loan proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly $5 million was already spent. To pay back the lender, state 
officials were forced to make up the deficit out of Cal-Mortgage reserve funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The program took another hit a year later when Triad Healthcare defaulted on a 
$167-million loan it used to buy two San Fernando Valley hospitals -- Sherman 
Oaks Hospital and Health Center in Sherman Oaks and West Valley Hospital and 
Health Center in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of that default exceeds Cal-Mortgage's reserves, leaving California 
taxpayers potentially liable for the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans to Triad and CACCOA were brokered by a member of Cal-Mortgage's 
advisory loan committee, Vincent F. Forte, a vice president of the investment 
banking firm of Goldman Sachs & Co. The firm earned $2.4 million in commissions 
from the Triad deal and $350,000 from CACCOA's. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Cal-Mortgage policy did not prohibit loan committee members from 
representing applicants, and Forte abstained from both votes. He and his firm 
maintain that his actions were legal and ethical. 
</P>
<P>
 But state Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), who held hearings after a 
Times report on Triad's Cal-Mortgage transaction, has introduced legislation 
that would bar state employees and appointees from representing clients before 
their agencies. The law would also bar them from holding positions in applicant 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-Mortgage has taken steps of its own to safeguard the program from deals 
such as Triad and CACCOA. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants cannot get hearings before the loan committee unless Cal-Mortgage 
staff analysts recommend their projects and certify that the applications are 
complete. In the Triad and CACCOA cases, staff analysts recommended against 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the director no longer has the power to make unilateral decisions that 
run counter to recommendations of staff and the loan committee. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cal-Mortgage now requires the staff to run background checks on license 
holders and facilities applying for loan guarantees to ensure that disciplinary 
actions by other state agencies are not overlooked, according to Werdegar.

BREAST CANCER PATIENTS' FILES TO BE AUDITED; RESEARCH: NCI AUDITORS ARE 
INVESTIGATING ONE CASE WHERE A WOMAN WHO HAD DIED WAS REPORTED AS ALIVE. ALSO, 
SOME OF THE FOUNDATION'S SUBJECTS WERE POSSIBLY ENROLLED WITHOUT MEETING 
REQUIREMENTS.

<P>
 A Los Angeles doctor has asked the National Cancer Institute to audit patient 
records at the research foundation he directs, after the discovery of 
discrepancies in data submitted to a major breast cancer study group that is 
under fire for scientific misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the potential discrepancies under investigation at the Memorial Cancer 
Research Foundation of Southern California is one case in which a woman who had 
died after open-heart surgery apparently was reported in study data as being 
alive. NCI investigators are also looking into the possibility that some of the 
study subjects were enrolled without meeting eligibility requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of NCI auditors was dispatched to Los Angeles on Friday to review 
records at the foundation, which participated in the same series of studies 
marred by news that a Canadian researcher had falsified data. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure further clouds the reputation of the most prominent breast 
cancer research group in the country, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and 
Bowel Project. The project produced a landmark study finding that lumpectomy, 
in which only the cancerous tumor is removed, is as safe and effective as 
mastectomy, in which the entire breast is removed. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's director, Dr. David Plotkin, confirmed through a spokesman 
Saturday that flaws have surfaced in some of the data that his foundation 
submitted to studies conducted by the national project. 
</P>
<P>
 Plotkin contacted the NCI on Thursday to request an audit of the records of 
all 310 women who have participated in the study through his foundation since 
1976, said spokesman Larry Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believes in the verity of his work," Weinberg said. "That's not to say 
that there won't be anomalies or errors." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the flaws that have surfaced, Weinberg said, Plotkin "is confident 
that the results are correct. He is certain that there is no fraud or 
deliberate problems, and certain that there is no malfeasance." 
</P>
<P>
 An NCI official said Saturday that although the full extent of the Los Angeles 
deficiencies are not known, he does not believe the situation is as serious as 
earlier allegations that a Canadian researcher falsified data. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael Friedman, associate director for cancer therapy evaluation 
programs at the NCI, said regarding the question of whether fraud was 
committed: "I think until our investigation is complete, we can't say anything. 
But the investigator (Plotkin) asked for us to examine the records. That's 
completely different than what happened in Canada, where the investigator 
certainly didn't welcome our investigation. That suggests to me that the 
investigator, at least in his own mind, was not worried about covering up 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbergdid confirm that the foundation had reported a woman was alive in 
March, 1993, when she had died after open-heart surgery in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistake occurred because the woman had changed doctors, and when the 
foundation called her former physician to collect once-a-year information, 
someone in the doctor's office informed the foundation that she had transferred 
to another doctor and that there was no reason to believe she was not well, 
Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her death would have been discovered in due course as part of the foundation's 
regular investigations, Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that "there is a written, signed consent form" to participate in 
the study for all women involved. In some cases, however, women gave oral 
consent before breast surgery and did not sign consent forms until afterward, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg criticized a story appearing today in the Chicago Tribune, which 
reports that the newspaper found discrepancies in the records of some patients' 
records it had examined. The Tribune had reviewed the foundation's records of 
18 women who were involved in a now-controversial 1985 study involving the 
merits of lumpectomy, Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 NCI's Friedman said that a separate 1990 audit of the Los Angeles foundation, 
conducted by the NSABP, had turned up discrepancies involving five women, but 
neither Plotkin nor the NCI had been informed of the audit's results until 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Those patients were not part of the 1985 lumpectomy trial, Friedman and 
Weinberg said, but NCI is including them in its audit. 
</P>
<P>
 The discrepancies pinpointed in the 1990 audit included a patient whose chart 
was lacking an operative report; a patient whose chart was missing a 
preoperative history and evaluation, and another patient who had three estrogen 
receptor values listed for her cancer. Breast cancer is driven in part by 
estrogen, and tumors are assigned receptor values.

ON CALIFORNIA: THE LION AND THE JOGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Piecing it all together later, the trackers concluded that the mountain lion 
must have watched Barbara Schoener from above, behind a cover of rock and 
brush. Maybe she had startled the lion from a morning nap. Maybe it was sick 
with rabies, or simply hungry. For whatever reason, it did something mountain 
lions rarely do. It dropped down to the trail and fell in behind the jogger. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoener, a fit 40-year-old, weighed 120 pounds. The lion weighed more. It 
closed, fast and quiet, from a distance of 20 feet. The first blow knocked 
Schoener down a steep slope. Footprints indicate she took two long strides 
before she fell. The lion pounced. Somehow, Schoener picked herself up and 
scrambled downhill another 25 feet. The lion pounced again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defensive wounds on Barbara's forearms and hands," El Dorado County sheriff's 
investigators reported later, "make it apparent she did struggle with the 
lion." Any one of two wounds, one to the neck, the other to the skull, could 
have been lethal. The lion dragged what it didn't eat 100 yards away, covering 
the remains with leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 This was early last Sunday morning. Sometime later that night -- again, from a 
reading of the tracks -- the lion returned to its cache. By then, however, the 
body had been discovered and taken away by helicopter. By then, the lion was 
the one being hunted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This little town is located near Auburn, about an hour from Sacramento. It is 
named after the Rev. Aaron Cool, who traveled the hills on horseback during the 
Gold Rush, preaching to miners in saloons. To judge by the proliferation of 
real estate storefronts and billboards here, the population boom rumbling 
through the Sierra foothills -- as restless Californians take flight from city 
and suburb alike -- has not bypassed Cool. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 people reside here, most of them migrants from Los Angeles and 
San Francisco who live within a 900-home gated community called Auburn Lake 
Trails. The attractions are obvious. The development is well-kept, the lots 
large, the prices modest by city standards. Deer roam the streets. The woods 
are a short walk in any direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on Schoener -- believed to be the first killing of a Californian by 
a mountain lion in this century -- occurred among a network of winding trails 
that borders the community. Schoener, a marathon runner and mother of two, 
lived 30 miles away, but she came often to train on the trails. For the Auburn 
Lake residents, her death has been cause for healthy reflection. "Somebody got 
killed and eaten," said Fred Jones, a free-lance nature writer who lives close 
to the attack site. "This is serious business." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to suggest, however, a general panic. Schoolchildren have been 
advised to avoid the trails and stick together. Pets have been taken in nights. 
Everyone's a bit more cautious, but no one is packing for L.A. As the manager 
of the property owners association put it: "They'd rather take precautions 
against a possible mountain lion attack, than take precautions against a 
possible drive-by shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This attitude might serve the residents well, but it doesn't resolve some of 
the stickier questions raised by the attack. Since the killing, teams of 
hunters and dogs have picked slowly through the hills. The operation, run by 
the state Department of Fish and Game, is intended to track down the mountain 
lion and kill it. So far the hunt has come up empty. In the meantime, though, 
the public's calls to Fish and Game have been running about 60-40 against 
killing the cat. 
</P>
<P>
 "One gentleman," a state biologist recalled, "volunteered to lead the mountain 
lion out of the area. People think of these animals as soft, cuddly things; 
they are efficient killers." A sheriff's investigator said he's received 
demands that the cat be trapped and relocated. "The answer to that one," he 
said, "is to say: Fine, can I put it in your back yard?" 
</P>
<P>
 Differing explanations for the attack rattle through the community. Some see 
it as a total aberration, the work of a rogue animal. Others blame a statewide 
proposition that banned mountain lion hunts, causing the unmanaged population 
to more than double. Still others point to newcomers who treat deer almost like 
pets; as deer move closer seeking handouts, mountain lions follow, seeking 
deer. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there are those who subscribe to the laws of probability. The real 
estate boom made such a tragedy inevitable. With more people in the hills, and 
more mountain lions, more encounters were bound to happen. This theory seems to 
have logic on its side. It also is the most fatalistic. For lions always will 
behave as lions, and developers as developers. And there seems to be no 
outrunning either species.

POLITICIANS TAKE AIM AT INMATES' RIGHTS; CORRECTIONS: ANTI-CRIME FERVOR MAY 
DOOM THE STATUTE SIGNED BY REAGAN. IT ALLOWS CONJUGAL VISITS AND LETS PRISONERS 
WEAR THEIR HAIR AT ANY LENGTH. BUT SOME SAY FEDERAL CONSTITUTION WILL STILL 
ALLOW MANY OF THE FREEDOMS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the floor of the upper house, a senator launches into a harangue about 
Charles Manson profiting off his murderous crimes by selling song lyrics and 
demands repeal of the statute that would allow such an outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 As he campaigns for office, an assemblyman lambastes Manson follower Tex 
Watson, charging that the same statute gave Watson the right to conjugal visits 
with his wife, during which he fathered three children while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the politicians' ire is the "inmates bill of rights," a statute 
dating back to Ronald Reagan's tenure as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year when baseball analogies are used as answers to crime, the inmates 
bill of rights is a hanging curve -- and politicians are slamming it up and 
down the state. It has become the stuff of sound bites, headlines and talk 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gov. Pete Wilson's support, lawmakers are working to rid the state penal 
code of a law they say allows imprisoned child molesters, rapists and murderers 
to receive hard-core pornography, wear their hair as they choose, and sue over 
such slights as food that is too high in cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers for prisoners, and some state lawyers, have doubts that the 
statute's repeal will end many of the most often cited abuses. Court decisions 
in recent decades have affirmed that many prisoners' rights are protected by 
the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons behind the impending demise of the inmates bill of rights are 
many, some tied to the campaign season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, seeking reelection on an anti-crime platform, has made the statute's 
repeal a priority. Two bills to do away with the statute are being carried by 
Assemblyman Dean Andal (R-Stockton) and state Sen. Robert Presley 
(D-Riverside). They are running against each other for a State Board of 
Equalization seat. 
</P>
<P>
 But the movement to gut the statute goes beyond electioneering. The prison 
guards union, an aggressive and well-financed lobby in Sacramento, is 
supporting the repeal effort, as are crime victims groups. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prison population grows beyond 120,000 inmates, California Department 
of Corrections officials say it is more costly to provide benefits required by 
the bill of rights, such as the right of mentally ill prisoners to have court 
hearings before they are forced to take antipsychotic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Corrections attorney Pam Smith-Steward also fears that in time, 
courts could interpret the statute so broadly that the 7,000 prisoners who work 
for the Prison Industry Authority making blue jeans, furniture, license plates 
and other products could receive minimum wage of $4.25. As it is, they make an 
average of 55 cents an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Buried 586 pages deep in the California Penal Code, the inmates bill of rights 
is brief, only 52 words. In a single paragraph, it says that a person sentenced 
to prison arrives with the same rights as everyone else. Any narrowing of 
rights must be directly related to the prison's safe operation, and be the 
least restrictive alternative possible. 
</P>
<P>
 A companion statute lists prisoners' specific rights, among them, the right to 
marry, make wills, correspond confidentially with lawyers, own property and 
receive publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Prisoner rights lawyers say most of the rights listed in the statutes are 
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. But state lawyers say court rulings have 
forced California to give prisoners far more than is required by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (California) law says we may only restrict inmate rights if we can show a 
security link," Smith-Steward said. "It isn't right. It's insidious." 
</P>
<P>
 Although California is the only state with an inmates bill of rights, many 
states give prisoners rights beyond what is required by the U.S. Constitution. 
New York allows conjugal visits. Oregon pays prison workers minimum wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The origins of the inmates bill of rights date to Reagan's first term as 
governor. Red Nelson, then the nail-hard warden of San Quentin, recalls 
approaching Reagan at a reception early in 1967. As they chatted, Reagan asked 
Nelson what he thought of one of the issues of the day: Should inmates be 
granted overnight visits with their spouses? 
</P>
<P>
 It was an innovative concept. Some prison officials believed that the program 
would end homosexuality in prisons, and serve as a reward for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a horrendous idea," Nelson said, and he recalls telling the 
governor so. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan did not take Nelson's counsel. In 1968, he authorized conjugal visits 
as an experiment at one prison, and allowed prison officials to expand the 
policy systemwide in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in a period where people thought they're not bad boys," Nelson said. 
"That was the style. There was no stopping it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, state Sen. Alan Sieroty, a liberal from Los Angeles' Westside, teamed 
up with the Friends Committee on Legislation, a Quaker lobbying organization, 
and proposed the legislation that first came to be known as the inmates bill of 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Wilson, an assemblyman from San Diego, voted for it. So did George 
Deukmejian, then a state senator from Long Beach. Reagan signed it into law. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, politically active lawyers were attacking every aspect of the 
prison system, from restrictions on what inmates could read to indeterminate 
sentencing, which resulted in terms of up to life for even minor crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was a time of political and racial unrest inside the prisons. George 
Jackson, serving time for robbery, published "Soledad Brother" and emerged as a 
leader of the Black Panthers, and a hero of leftist reformers and 
revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Accused of killing a prison guard at Soledad, Jackson was moved to the highest 
security block in the prison system, the Adjustment Center at San Quentin. In a 
visit, a gun was smuggled to Jackson in August, 1971, setting off the worst 
riot in California prison history. Jackson was shot to death, and three 
officers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. became governor in 1974, he brought with him 
some of the lawyers who had been suing the prisons. Sieroty and the Quakers saw 
a chance to expand the inmates bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitudes were so much different in those days," said Sieroty, who 
retired from the Legislature in 1982. "There was a feeling that prison reform 
was a worthwhile thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brown was skeptical of Sieroty's bill, an aide to the then-governor 
recalled that Corrections Department chief Ray Procunier urged Brown to support 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "His argument was that this would calm things down in the prison system," said 
the former aide. The bill was signed into law in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Sieroty is upset that his work is threatened. He called the statute 
even more important now, given that the inmate population has sextupled since 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pornography was not the reason we wrote the bill," Sieroty said. "The issues 
were much broader than that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections has been trying to weaken the statute since at 
least 1987, with no success. This year, however, the Legislature's attitude 
changed dramatically after the kidnap-murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas and 
arrest of parolee Richard Allen Davis for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime quickly rose to the top of the California political agenda and, since 
the start of the year, the Legislature has been approving anti-crime bills at a 
frenetic pace. The inmates bill of rights has became a symbol for the 
"coddling" criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Presley, the Legislature's top expert on prisons, introduced a 
bill to abolish the bill of rights. He said the costs of operating the prisons 
can be cut if the statute is repealed. His bill cleared the Senate 
overwhelmingly this month, and is awaiting Assembly action. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Assembly, Andal introduced an identical bill, with Wilson's backing. 
Andal and Assemblyman Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento) reworked the bill to have 
California adopt the federal standard governing prisons. The bill passed the 
Assembly 60-0 Thursday and goes to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal standard, wardens can impose restrictions if they are 
"reasonably" related to some prison-related interest. The current statute says 
any regulations must be the least restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who represent prisoners in civil rights claims say the federal 
standard is toothless. But even under the federal standard, many rights in the 
inmates bill of rights -- to marry, maintain bank accounts, file lawsuits, 
correspond confidentially with lawyers -- will be protected, said San Francisco 
attorney William B. Turner, an expert on prison law. 
</P>
<P>
 With or without the state statute, Turner added, wardens will not be able to 
stop most pornography and racist material from getting into the prisons. That, 
too, is protected by federal constitutional law. 
</P>
<P>
 As the California law now reads, prisoners can receive almost anything the 
Postal Service will deliver -- short of writings about gambling, bomb making or 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 There likely will be lawsuits if the prisons try to significantly restrict 
pornography from reaching prisoners. Whether the state would win in court is 
unclear. Its track record has not been great. 
</P>
<P>
 A man, imprisoned for second-degree murder for killing his 6-month-old 
daughter, received sadomasochistic photos of adult women. When prison officials 
seized the pictures, he sued in 1992, and a federal judge urged state lawyers 
to settle the case. They did, giving back some photos and paying the prisoner 
$1,200 for pictures officials had destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is doubt among lawyers, including some who work for the state, that 
other often-cited abuses can be stopped. Sen. Charles Calderon (D-Whittier) is 
pushing a bill aimed at stopping prisoners such as Manson from profiting from 
their crimes. Similar laws have been struck down by federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison authorities do not expect immediate sweeping changes if the statute is 
repealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson would eliminate conjugal visits for sex offenders and those serving 
life terms, but prison authorities say the program helps promote better conduct 
by other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison system permits 25,000 conjugal visits a year at a cost to the state 
of $3 million. As recently as last year, the Department of Corrections defended 
conjugal visits, saying in a memo to Andal that "family visitation is a 
valuable tool for inmate management" and a "proven rehabilitative program." 
</P>
<P>
 All this is not to say there would not be changes. Prisons would regain 
broader rights to control inmates' hair or beard length. Authorities also may 
regain some powers lost as a result of court rulings interpreting the statute. 
</P>
<P>
 One that bothers officials came in 1986, when a court of appeal held that the 
inmates bill of rights gave mentally ill prisoners the right to demand a court 
hearing before they could be forced to take antipsychotic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has lost only 17 of the 494 court hearings since 1990. But there are 
court and prison costs, and corrections officials say less expensive 
administrative hearings should suffice in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the prisons, where small slights often loom large, there is talk about the 
legislative effort to repeal the bill of rights. Hyperbolic flyers are 
circulating urging inmates to tell their families and friends to call lawmakers 
and voice their opposition to its repeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are in danger of losing all your rights," a flyer warns. Without the 
statute, the flyers say, prisoners will lose the right to marry, own property, 
make wills, sue, get visits, or correspond confidentially with lawyers -- 
though no politician is suggesting repealing such rights. 
</P>
<P>
 At the prison at San Luis Obispo, Charles Thompson, serving a sentence for 
second-degree murder from San Bernardino County, said tensions already are 
high. There could be "some uprising," he said, but quickly added: "I certainly 
don't advocate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, a jailhouse lawyer, believes that although the Department of 
Corrections may initially take away rights, prisoners will end up winning them 
back in federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Prisons spokeswoman Christine May said she doubts that there will be reaction 
inside the prisons if the statute is repealed. "Obviously, we are prepared for 
a disturbance on any subject," she said. "We don't anticipate any 
disturbances." Inmates Bill of Rights 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators have proposed repealing the following laws that spell out the 
rights of inmates in state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Penal Code Section 2600, the inmates bill of rights, says: 
</P>
<P>
 "A person sentenced to imprisonment in a state prison may, during any such 
period of confinement, be deprived of such rights, and only such rights, as is 
necessary in order to provide for the reasonable security of the institution in 
which he is confined and for the reasonable protection of the public." 
</P>
<P>
 * Penal Code Section 2601, a companion statute, says prisoners retain the 
following specific rights: 
</P>
<P>
 * To inherit, own, sell or convey property, including written and artistic 
material produced while in prison, although the Department of Corrections may 
prohibit sales made for business purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 * To write confidentially to any lawyer or public official, although prison 
officials may inspect incoming mail for contraband. 
</P>
<P>
 * To purchase, receive and read any and all legal materials, newspapers, 
periodicals and books which the Postal Service will deliver, except those that 
describe the manufacture of weapons or poison, or which describe sexual 
assaults upon a correctional employee. 
</P>
<P>
 * To have personal visits. 
</P>
<P>
 * To file lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 * To marry. 
</P>
<P>
 * To create a power of attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * To make a will. 
</P>
<P>
 * To have limited workers' compensation benefits.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; PRIMAL PROBLEMS; GETTING THE SUITORS OF KOKO, THE RENOWNED 
'TALKING' GORILLA, IN THE MOOD HAS BEEN DIFFICULT ENOUGH. NOW, A NEIGHBOR WANTS 
TO HARVEST SOME TREES, AND RESEARCHERS FEAR THAT THE NOISE WILL DISTURB THE 
APES' SEXUAL URGES EVEN MORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life ain't easy for a gorilla in the Golden State. Just ask Koko, the 
world-famous "talking" ape who lives in the Santa Cruz Mountains near Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, there's the weather. In Woodside, the climate is often foggy and 
cool -- a far cry from the steamy jungles of Africa. Then there are the 
ever-increasing intrusions of the urban world. Motorcycles, in particular, 
drive Koko bananas. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a new worry confronts the 22-year-old ape and her two beefy boyfriends at 
the Gorilla Foundation's forested compound here: Their next-door neighbor, a 
developer, wants to chop down a bunch of trees on his mountainous, 36-acre 
plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Koko's keepers fear that the chain saws, rumbling trucks and other noises of a 
logging operation would stress out the gorilla and her suitors, dashing 
long-held hopes that the apes will fall in love and reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environment has to be just right for courting to occur," said Francine 
(Penny) Patterson, the psychologist who taught Koko sign language and brought 
her international fame. "If there's any disturbance -- even if it's just UPS 
pulling up -- they get agitated, upset. The last thing on their minds is sex." 
</P>
<P>
 There is more at risk here, Patterson said, than a gorilla's chance for 
romance. The foundation has worked for 10 years to breed Koko, anxious to learn 
whether she will pass on her language skills to her young. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Koko has not been in the mood. But recently, she resumed her menstrual 
cycle after a 20-month break, suggesting that motherhood may indeed be in the 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Webster, the forester hired to log the site for developer Steve Pankowski, 
is all for scientific breakthroughs, and he has altered his proposal slightly 
as a gesture of goodwill. Still, he intends to stick with his tree-chopping 
plans. Prices for redwood and Douglas fir, he noted, are at record highs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've run into a lot of problems during my career," the veteran logger said 
the other day, "but never a gorilla." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Forestry has the final say in this odd affair, and its 
officials are downright befuddled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your initial reaction is to give a good chuckle -- 'Gorillas! Ha, ha!' " said 
Ron Pate, review team chief for the department's Coast-Cascade region. "But 
this matter is dead serious, and what to do is a real problem for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, officials may not approve a logging operation before 
considering its "significant impacts on adjacent uses," Pate said. If a problem 
exists or neighbors complain, measures such as restricted hours and buffer 
zones may be required. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, Pate said, "we're in uncharted territory. There aren't a lot of 
people with gorillas around California," so it is hard to get solid information 
on what is a threat to the apes and what is not. A hearing will be held in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 On one issue all parties agree: The logging will generate some significant 
noise. Because of the rough terrain, Webster must use cranes to hoist fallen 
trees up the slope and onto trucks. Safety laws require the crane operator to 
use a horn -- called a "tooter" -- to communicate with workers in the woods. 
The tooter's tune is piercing, Pate said, "something you can hear a mile away." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson and her principal colleague, biologist Ronald Cohn, say two months 
of such din will cause enormous anxiety in the apes -- anxiety that could be 
life-threatening. Gorillas, they say, have been known to die of stress-related 
causes such as heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's males -- Michael, 21, and Ndume, 12 -- seem especially 
sensitive about tree-related disturbances. When Caltrans crews trim branches 
along California 35, a few hundred feet from the gorillas' enclosures, Michael 
cries, shakes, refuses to eat and suffers bouts of diarrhea, Cohn said. This 
may relate to circumstances surrounding his capture in Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
 To support its position, the foundation cites a 1992 study that examined the 
effects of noise from a construction project on four gorillas at the San 
Francisco Zoo. The researchers found an increase in undesirable behavior, such 
as aggression, in the breeding male, and noticed a decrease in desirable 
behavior, including the sexual kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "This effect is particularly noteworthy in a species for whom captive 
propagation has been problematic," wrote the study's authors, Kenneth Gold and 
Jacqueline Ogden. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster does not know much about apes, but he has hired an animal behaviorist 
to help him out. He said his expert, UC Davis anthropologist Alexander 
Harcourt, told him that "gorillas, like many species, tend to be very adaptable 
to their environment." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you visit someone who lives near an airport, for example, you'll be 
holding your ears and unable to concentrate because of the noise," Webster 
said. "But the people who live there are used to it; they've adapted." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Harcourt told Webster that all gorillas, like all people, 
are different, and react to disturbances in different ways. Harcourt could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Koko, who weighs 290 pounds and stands nearly 5 feet, 4 inches tall, is 
probably the world's best-known gorilla. She has been featured twice on the 
cover of National Geographic and interviewed on television's "20/20" and other 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 She was born at the San Francisco Zoo in 1971. A year later, Patterson began 
teaching her American Sign Language as part of her graduate studies at Stanford 
University. Koko now knows about 700 signs and is the subject of the world's 
longest continuous interspecies communications study, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the widespread attention she has commanded, Koko's language abilities 
have been questioned in recent years by other primate experts, who say 
Patterson has exaggerated the gorilla's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the breeding effort, finding Koko a suitable mate has been tough. After 
all, sexy gorillas are not exactly falling off trees -- at least not in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael was her intended partner, but she regarded him as a brother and found 
his aggressive pursuit a turnoff. So Koko's handlers tried a 1990s approach -- 
video dating -- to pick a better match. Shown a series of apes on tape, Koko 
indicated that she wanted a second look at Ndume, then living at the Cincinnati 
Zoo. The silver back -- exiled by the zoo because of his tendency to hurl 
gorilla dung at people -- arrived almost two years ago, but the sparks have yet 
to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that logging is merely one more sign of encroaching civilization, 
Cohn and Patterson plan to move their apes to Maui. They have established a 
70-acre gorilla preserve on the island, but must raise $2 million more to 
complete the work.

POPE EXPECTED TO RECOVER FULLY FROM BROKEN LEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pleased with the initial stages of Pope John Paul II's recovery from an 
operation to repair a broken thighbone, doctors said Saturday that he should be 
able to resume a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 The 73-year-old Pope was resting comfortably without pain, fever or 
complications, papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro told reporters at a Vatican 
briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found him in good spirits, very positive," Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Pope hoped to record his traditional Sunday noontime message for 
transmission to pilgrims in St. Peter's Square today. 
</P>
<P>
 Emilio Tresalti, director of Gemelli Hospital, where surgeons replaced a piece 
of the femur from John Paul's right leg with a metal prosthesis, said the Pope 
passed a tranquil first night with excellent prospects for a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The pontiff will remain at the big Catholic hospital for two or three weeks, 
doctors say. He will need extensive therapy after that and will walk with a 
cane for a time, but should not have a limp once recovery is complete, his 
doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be certain things like skiing that he will not be able to do, but 
the majority of people don't have any problems resuming a normal life after 
this procedure," Tresalti said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul was still groggy Saturday morning, but ate a light breakfast and 
planned later to concelebrate Mass with one of his secretaries, Navarro said. 
The Pope also chatted with Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican secretary of 
state, according to the papal spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pope's absence, Sodano, effectively the Vatican's prime minister, is 
the senior official of the 950-million-member Roman Catholic Church, and 
Navarro said he will represent John Paul at upcoming meetings with visitors 
such as the president of Estonia and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The 
accident forced cancellation of a weekend papal visit to Sicily and a scheduled 
trip to Belgium later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican Curia will look after routine affairs of state, deferring 
important decisions until the Pope's return. As his recovery continues, John 
Paul will likely resume work in his hospital room.

INDICTMENT BID ROCKS EFFORT TO FORM ITALIAN GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Efforts to form a new government were thrown into turmoil Saturday after 
prosecutors asked for the indictments of a key ally of Prime Minister-designate 
Silvio Berlusconi and 36 others on kickback charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Berlusconi ally was Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, part of 
the three-party conservative coalition that won national elections in 
March.Northern League members are under consideration for key Cabinet posts. 
</P>
<P>
 The request also named some of the nation's best-known political figures: 
former premiers Bettino Craxi and Arnaldo Forlani, former Foreign Minister 
Gianni de Michelis and several former Cabinet ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the indictment request was scheduled for May 24. A magistrate 
must rule in favor of the indictment request for the case to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Parliament have immunity from prosecution unless it is lifted by 
Parliament at a court's request. Bossi is now a lawmaker. Craxi, Forlani and De 
Michelis are not. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment request is a spinoff of the six-month trial of financier Sergio 
Cusani, who was convicted on Thursday for his role in kickbacks for a large 
business merger in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Craxi and Forlani were among dozens who testified in the trial, which examined 
the merger and quick breakup of chemical giant Montedison and the state-owned 
ENI chemical group. 
</P>
<P>
 Many political and business leaders profited from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bossi is accused of receiving $125,000, and Craxi allegedly took $6.6 million 
in kickbacks linked to the deal.

CHRISTOPHER MEETS ASSAD TO DISCUSS ISRAELI PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with Syrian President Hafez Assad on 
Saturday to discuss Israeli proposals to break a deadlock in peace talks 
between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher delivered to Assad a proposal for Israel to withdraw in stages 
from the strategic Golan Heights and security plans to ensure that the area is 
not used for attacks on Israeli villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher also carried a list of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 They included U.S. allegations that Syria is looking the other way on drug 
trafficking in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and concern about increased 
counterfeiting of $100 bills in Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Christopher's list of issues were two perennial topics -- terrorism 
and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the nearly three-hour meeting were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 After midnight, Syria informed the U.S. delegation that Assad will give 
Christopher "some ideas" of his own late today. 
</P>
<P>

MILITARY WARNS OF 'TENSE, DETERIORATING' SITUATION IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb soldiers attacked U.N. peacekeepers in Gorazde, and U.N. military 
observers warned Saturday that the Muslim enclave was tense. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlighting the fragility of an agreement that averted NATO air strikes, U.N. 
officials said British soldiers fought a gun battle with Serbian troops Friday 
southeast of the town, a quarter of a mile inside Gorazde's 1.9-mile exclusion 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as three Serbs were killed. There were no British casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 A Danish tank squadron also reported a 90-minute exchange of shellfire with 
Serbian artillery near Tuzla, another Muslim enclave. No casualties were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. source said Serbian and Muslim soldiers clashed near an ammunition 
factory just outside Gorazde, which is crowded with 60,000 people, mainly 
Muslim refugees, but he did not give details. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations has said it is satisfied with Serbian compliance after NATO 
gave the Serbs two deadlines for withdrawing from Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 But a report from local U.N. aid workers said military observers were 
continuing to find military equipment "in violation of the NATO ultimatum." 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-man British U.N. patrol came under fire Friday afternoon while on 
patrol near Gorazde, said Cmdr. Eric Chaperon, a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo. 
They returned fire and tried to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaperon said Serbs followed the patrol and fired on it again before the 
British peacekeepers successfully withdrew while returning fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A British spokesman at the U.N. base in Vitez said it was being treated as an 
isolated incident. He said there was no request for air support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation has been characterized by the (military observers) as tense and 
deteriorating," a local U.N. report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Tuzla, northeast of Sarajevo, officials said seven Danish Leopard-type 
tanks came under heavy artillery attack late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tanks returned fire with at least 70 shells during a 90-minute exchange, 
said Maj. Carson Rasmussen, commander of the squadron. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile two dozen people wounded in the civil war were flown from Sarajevo 
to Brussels for urgent medical treatment. The wounded included Emira 
Dizdarevic, 9, who has a shell splinter lodged in her brain.

IN WEEKLY RADIO ADDRESS, CLINTON DEFENDS FOREIGN POLICY RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid growing criticism, President Clinton sought to depict his foreign policy 
as a success story Saturday by focusing on progress in South Africa and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of vigorous American engagement and leadership remains vital, not 
only in South Africa but around the globe," Clinton said in his weekly radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the Administration is facing other international threats -- 
including North Korea's nuclear program and state-sponsored terrorism from Iran 
and other countries -- with "steadiness and resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 The President's broad defense of his foreign policy, a rare subject for his 
weekly radio address, came amid growing criticism from those who say his 
Administration has been weak and wavering on international issues, particularly 
with regard to Bosnia and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 In his address, Clinton maintained that U.S. efforts in Bosnia have "clearly 
generated new progress toward peace." 
</P>
<P>
 He made no mention of Haiti, where the United States is seeking tougher 
economic sanctions after the failure of previous efforts to return ousted 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid reports that the White House is considering military intervention to 
restore Aristide to power, one Administration official added: "I don't think 
anyone is ruling in or out additional steps, including the use of force." 
</P>
<P>
 The unease over the Administration's actions on Haiti was evident as about 
1,000 demonstrators marched from Capitol Hill to the White House to protest 
Clinton's policy and urge stronger steps to return Aristide to power. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators chanted slogans and carried placards bearing such statements 
as "Clinton Keep Your Promises" and "Clinton Is a Liar." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting the spotlight on a more successful foreign policy matter, Clinton 
praised the courage of the South African people in their "great march to 
freedom" and the U.S. role "in helping them make the miracle happen." 
</P>
<P>
 He pledged to announce a substantial increase in U.S. aid to South Africa in 
the coming week "to help it navigate a new course for all of its people." 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, appearing on CNN's "Newsmaker Saturday," 
said the aid package will be "substantial" and will focus on such areas as 
business and infrastructure development, health care and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think it's a mistake to concentrate on aid. Real progress is going to 
be made through commerce, through trade, through investment," Brown said.

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES IN HAWAII END 12-DAY WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State and county government workers have accepted a new four-year contract, 
ending a 12-day walkout that left residents unable to receive hospital 
services, or obtain marriage or driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 16,000 workers from three bargaining units of the Hawaii Government 
Employees Assn. had walked picket lines before voting Friday to accept the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The unions represent 20,000 white-collar workers and supervisors, and 
professional and scientific workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers earlier rejected a contract offer that would have given them a 4% 
raise over two years. They wanted an 8% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief state negotiator James Yasuda said the base salary paid by the state and 
counties to professional and scientific workers would increase slightly more 
than 4% in the first two years of the contract, which is retroactive to July, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Total base pay for workers in the other two bargaining units will rise 
slightly more than 6% for the first two years of the deal, Yasuda said.

MILITARY-STYLE WOMEN'S SCHOOL PLAN APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has approved a plan that will keep women out of Virginia 
Military Institute but establish a similar, military-style program for them at 
the all-female Mary Baldwin College. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Jackson L. Kiser ruled late Friday that the proposed 
Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership must be operational by fall, 
1995.Mary Baldwin is a private college in Staunton, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department had sued VMI, claiming the exclusion of women at the 
state-supported school is discriminatory. An appeals court agreed, but gave the 
state the option of setting up a similar program for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the school would not include the 24-hour military atmosphere 
of VMI, which was established 155 years ago. There would be no Spartan barracks 
and no boot-camp-like indoctrination, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But women would be required to wear uniforms and participate in the Reserve 
Officer Training Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased with the decision," said Lt. Col. Michael Strickler, a 
spokesman for VMI. "It's a victory for single-sex education -- for both 
all-male and all-female schools."

LESSONS OF HOLOCAUST TO BE TAUGHT IN FLORIDA SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry Kay survived a concentration camp because the Nazis needed children to 
make weapons. Now, children of a more peaceful era will learn the lessons of 
his life and the lives of other Holocaust victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay was present Friday when Gov. Lawton Chiles signed into law a requirement 
that Florida pupils learn about the slaughter of Jews and others during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have dreamed of being here," the 64-year-old Kay said. "It's 
actions like today that give us the hope that the Holocaust will become a 
recognized part of history -- to help humanity earn its name." 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians, Jewish leaders and students attended the bill-signing ceremony at 
Miami Beach City Hall. Traditional Jewish prayers, songs and speeches reduced 
some people to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "The souls of those who perished in the Holocaust still cry out for justice -- 
not through retribution, but through education and enlightenment -- the truest 
enemies of tyranny and brutality," Chiles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires that the history of the Holocaust show the results of 
prejudice and the need to protect democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar laws have been passed in California, Illinois and Washington. Nevada, 
New Jersey, North Carolina and South Carolina have laws creating advisory 
councils on Holocaust education. 
</P>
<P>
 The new curriculum, which takes effect July 1, will be directed at the state's 
half-million high school students, but may also be used in middle schools, said 
Debi Gallay of the Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Rositta E. Kenigsberg, the executive vice president of the Holocaust 
Documentation and Education Center Inc., said education is the only way to keep 
alive the memory of the slaughter of 6 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as there is someone to tell the story, there is life," Kenigsberg 
said. "As long as there is someone to listen, there is hope."

U.S., MEXICO LAW OFFICERS ATTEND SLAIN CHIEF'S SERVICES; TIJUANA: PROBE INTO 
POLICE LEADER'S AMBUSH APPEARS TO FALTER. SIX SUSPECTS FREED. SEVENTH HELD ON 
OTHER CHARGES. 
</P>

<P>
 This violence-torn city Saturday mourned its fallen police chief, a newcomer 
to police work whose defiance of government corruption and organized crime may 
have led to his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Baja California officials and representatives of U.S. law enforcement 
attended services for Jose Federico Benitez Lopez, who was gunned down along 
with his bodyguard in a highway ambush Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were clean, honest and brave men," said Mayor Hector Osuna Jaime, who 
appointed Benitez, a 42-year-old lawyer and former factory administrator, to 
his youthful Cabinet with a mandate to reform and modernize the city police. 
"The society is tired of this horror story." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the investigation of the slaying seemed to founder Saturday. The 
state judicial police released six of the seven suspects arrested in a manhunt 
near the crime scene, citing lack of evidence. The seventh was being held on 
apparently unrelated fraud and weapons charges, according to a news release. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the suspects had been described earlier Saturday as paid enforcers 
working for the federal judicial police, according to a government official. 
Known in Mexico as aspirinas , such quasi-police officers are often involved in 
corruption and clandestine violence. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not yet clear whether the slaying was connected to drugs, Benitez's 
involvement in the probe of the murder of a presidential candidate here last 
month or a sweeping purge of corrupt city officers, Mexican and U.S. law 
enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need are less theories and more facts," said U.S. Atty. Alan Bersin 
of San Diego, who attended the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are examining several scenarios, sources said. One report 
indicates that the chief was slain because he had learned of drug-related 
misconduct by federal police officers, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another theory is that Benitez ran afoul of the ruthless Arellano cartel of 
Tijuana, which was involved in a shootout March 3 between federal agents and 
state police officers who were protecting a drug lord. The gun battle resulted 
in the creation of a joint task force by the Drug Enforcement Administration 
and the FBI that is working closely with Mexican authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tijuana police do not investigate drug crimes, which come under federal 
jurisdiction. But, under Benitez, a SWAT-like city unit known as the Grupo 
Tactico had cracked down on street-level trafficking. Benitez's combination of 
integrity, inexperience and aggressiveness -- he often personally supervised 
operations -- earned him numerous enemies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benitez was also outspoken about his doubts concerning the federal 
investigation of the March 23 assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the 
presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Benitez was 
scheduled to meet Monday with a Mexican congressional commission that is 
conducting a separate probe of the Colosio case. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the truth, the third spectacular eruption of violence here in the 
last two months has worsened a climate of fear and anarchy, according to Javier 
Gonzalez Monroy, a city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 At the funeral Mass on Saturday morning, tense security guards armed with 
AK-47 rifles hustled Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel, Mayor Osuna and other 
dignitaries into Our Lady of Guadalupe Church across from City Hall, where they 
joined about 800 other mourners. The eulogy was delivered by Father Ramon de la 
Cerda, who condemned the killers as "irrational, criminal people without heart" 
and said the mourners "who continue to live in this vale of tears must hope for 
a more peaceful, less conflictive life." 
</P>
<P>
 A subsequent outdoor ceremony was attended by dozens of officers from agencies 
on both sides of the border. Ramrod-straight officers ritualistically shouted 
"Present!" when a speaker called out the names of Benitez and the bodyguard, 
Ramon Alarid Cardenas.

ANAHEIM AND THE RAMS: FINAL PLAY?; OTHER CITIES PANT TO WIN TEAM OVER; MOVE: 
FOOTBALL-HUNGRY BALTIMORE, ST. LOUIS, MEMPHIS, SAN ANTONIO AND HARTFORD ARE THE 
HOTTEST CONTENDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tired of shelling out big bucks for that inferior product the Rams have 
fielded lately? Frustrated by four consecutive losing seasons and a string of 
questionable front-office moves? 
</P>
<P>
 The folks in Baltimore, St. Louis, Memphis, San Antonio and Hartford would 
love the company of your misery. Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled 
masses . . . your Los Angeles Rams. They'll take the wretched refuse of our 
teeming shore. 
</P>
<P>
 These football-hungry cities are making their pitches, and to Rams owner 
Georgia Frontiere and Executive Vice President John Shaw, they're like 
belt-high fastballs down the middle of the plate -- very enticing. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the cities is offering a more financially lucrative deal than the Rams 
have in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's also some fine print, such as potential legal hassles that could 
follow a move to Baltimore; the possibility of a messy stadium lease in St. 
Louis, and the reluctance of the other NFL owners to approve a third franchise 
in Texas or a fourth in the New England-New York area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, of course, could stay in Anaheim. They could sell out every game in 
1994, lease out every luxury suite for 10 years, negotiate a better stadium 
lease, win the next four Super Bowls, make gobs of money and live happily ever 
after in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they do decide to leave, their most likely destination is Baltimore, 
St. Louis or Memphis, Tenn., with San Antonio, Hartford, Conn. -- and, yes, Los 
Angeles -- considered long shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams played in the antiquated Coliseum for more than 30 years before 
moving to Anaheim, and there have been rumblings of Los Angeles putting 
together a new stadium deal to lure them back. But don't expect an offer from 
the government sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're welcome to come back, but I don't think you can spend your resources 
on a type of facility that, while it's not state-of-the-art, we already have," 
said John Ferraro, a Los Angeles city councilman. "To spend that kind of money 
when we have so many other problems . . . we could be condemned for even 
thinking of something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are several other cities, desperate for pro football, that have 
raised taxes or floated municipal bonds to fund stadium projects. An update of 
activity in five potential future homes of the Rams: BALTIMORE 
</P>
<P>
 Peter G. Angelos, majority owner of baseball's Baltimore Orioles, is now 
heading efforts to bring NFL football back to the city, taking over for the 
Baltimore Stadium Authority after it failed to win an expansion team in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has reportedly bid $200 million to buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and 
he recently acknowledged that Larry Lucchino, former president of the Orioles 
and a member of Angelos' NFL investment group, has met with Rams officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation that Frontiere might sell a minority interest in the Rams to 
Angelos was fueled during league meetings in March, when owners discussed a 
resolution that would allow them to own more than one major league team in the 
same city. 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsors of that resolution? The Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, however, said he made that proposal in 1993 and that it had nothing to 
do with Angelos. Owners aren't expected to vote on it for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer, meanwhile, has been under pressure from 
state General Assembly leaders, who threatened in February to allocate the $160 
million earmarked for a new stadium in Camden Yards to other state agencies 
unless he could secure a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators in Maryland's Washington, D.C., suburbs were also concerned that 
Schaefer's staunch refusal to endorse Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke's plans to 
build a new 78,000-seat stadium in Laurel, Md., just south of Baltimore, would 
drive away the Redskins, leaving Maryland with, possibly, no NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
 But in March, Schaefer struck a stadium compromise with lawmakers, welcoming a 
Redskins' move to Laurel in exchange for assurances that Baltimore's stadium 
financing would remain in place. Cooke, however, did not promise to support a 
Baltimore team. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be at least a year before Cooke receives the zoning approvals 
necessary to break ground in Laurel. The thinking in Maryland is that if Cooke 
begins construction, Baltimore's chances for an NFL team are slim. But if a 
team announces it's moving to Baltimore first, Cooke might have to stay in 
Washington or look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Many government and business leaders, including Angelos, believe Maryland can 
support two NFL teams. But Cooke does not and predicted the league would not 
allow two franchises so close. 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, the team that lays claim to Maryland first will likely avoid the 
legal battles that a second team would face if the NFL opposes a two-team 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke's stance also angered Maryland state Sen. John Pica (D-Baltimore), who 
predicted that groundbreaking for the Laurel stadium would be delayed by 
lawsuits and zoning requirements long enough for a team to move to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years will pass before one shovel will break ground for that stadium," Pica 
told the Baltimore Sun. "If Baltimore gets a team, we'll be playing football 
before they break ground, so Jack Kent Cooke has to decide whether he wants to 
build 14 miles away." ST. LOUIS 
</P>
<P>
 In this corner, weighing in with 65% of the new stadium's lease, is James 
Orthwein, former New England Patriots owner. And in this corner, with 30% of 
the lease, is Jerry Clinton, St. Louis beer distributor and aspiring NFL owner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the neutral corner is St. Louis County Executive George (Buzz) Westfall, 
who just wants to settle the darn mess and get on with the business of 
attracting an NFL team for the $258-million, 70,000-seat domed stadium under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem: Orthwein would give up his share of the lease for $1 but wants 
indemnification from future lawsuits. Clinton would give up his share but wants 
$8 million, in return for expenses from the failed expansion bid. 
</P>
<P>
 And Fran Murray, a Philadelphia entrepreneur who was part of the original 
expansion ownership group with Clinton, wants $1.9 million in expenses and has 
hinted at a possible lawsuit against Orthwein if he is not compensated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is a mess," said Mac Scott, Westfall's director of 
communications. "Every time we go around the corner, there's another set of 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding matters is the fact that Orthwein and Clinton are not exactly the 
best of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Westfall tried to settle the dispute in early April when he came up with a 
plan calling for Orthwein to transfer his share of the lease to Clinton, who 
would then convey the lease to FANS Inc. (Football At the New Stadium), a 
nonprofit entity consisting of Westfall and St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr. 
Clinton was offered $3.5 million in the deal but has not accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Westfall has a contingency plan. The new stadium lease dissolves in 1997, so 
if the issue is not resolved soon, he'll try to entice an NFL team to play in 
52,000-seat Busch Stadium until 1997, with the city paying the team to make up 
for lost revenue because of the reduced number of seats at Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a 52,000-seat stadium that was fine for football for 20 years, it may 
have to be fine for another three years," Scott said. "The problem is, what 
team is going to leave where they are now for a 52,000-seat stadium?" MEMPHIS 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper Rodgers, the former coach who played a major role in the city's 1993 
expansion effort, admits the chances of Memphis landing the Rams are slim. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I still think Ed McMahon is going to give me $10 million," he said. "I 
never give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is Steve Ehrhardt, an attorney and the president of Memphis Football 
Partners, who said he has had discussions with the Rams but would not 
elaborate. "Our efforts are very strong, and they are being done in a quiet 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrhardt was happy to rattle off all the reasons Memphis should be on top of 
NFL teams' relocation list, though. The Liberty Bowl lease is competitive with 
others being offered, and a Memphis team would be the only pro sports franchise 
in a five-state area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone does the investigation and sees the kinds of dollars they can 
make here, a team will be relocating within 18 months," Ehrhardt said. "When 
you have football, hockey, basketball or baseball teams in the same market, 
history shows that at one time or another, one of those teams is suffering. 
Here, you'd be No. 1 and dominate the market, period." SAN ANTONIO 
</P>
<P>
 B.J. (Red) McCombs, who owns 40 automobile franchises in south Texas and 
co-founded a $600-million broadcast company, is sure he can persuade the Rams 
to take a serious look at San Antonio. If he could only get past their 
secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 McCombs, former owner of the National Basketball Assn.'s San Antonio Spurs, 
said he hasn't been able to reach Shaw or Frontiere, but he hopes he and city 
officials will have more success now that the Rams are officially free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1.3 million people, San Antonio has the nation's 43rd-largest 
radio-television market, but McCombs said that when you add fast-growing Austin 
and its 700,000 people to the mix, it would move into the top 20. And the 
65,000-seat Alamodome has already been paid for, thanks to a half-cent sales 
tax that expired last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to get an NFL team here, because if anyone took a serious look 
at us, they'd come running," McCombs said. HARTFORD 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ganis, a national sports consultant with an office in Connecticut, has 
reportedly had conversations with the Rams and Raiders about relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Ganis nor Avice Meehan, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s press secretary, 
would comment or elaborate on those reports, but Ganis said he expects 
discussions to pick up this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you don't hear about negotiations doesn't mean they're not 
taking place," Ganis said. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for Robert Kraft's 11th-hour deal to buy the Patriots and keep them in 
Foxboro, Mass., Hartford might have snagged the Patriots in January with its 
offer of a $252-million stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not the best, it's one of the best proposals out there," Ganis said. 
"The market is very strong." What the Rams Have to Consider 
</P>
<P>
 What do other cities have to offer the Rams that Anaheim doesn't? Baltimore's 
deal might be the most lucrative, but all are attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 City: ANAHEIM 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium: A 69,008-seat facility with 113 luxury boxes. Renovated and expanded 
from approximately 43,000 seats before the Rams' arrival from the Los Angeles 
Coliseum in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deal: Rams pay rent of 60 cents per admission, not to exceed $400,000 per 
year. Rams also give city 7.5% of ticket revenue, 20% of luxury box revenue and 
about half of parking and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Good: Rams avoid litigation, which undoubtedly would accompany 
announcement of departure. Team maintains tradition dating back to 1946 and 
undoubtedly gets new, sweetened deal from city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad: Expensive new stadium might be only way to keep team. Shared tenancy 
with Angels, practice facility dispute and continuing lukewarm fan support 
complicate situation. 
</P>
<P>
 City: BALTIMORE 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium: A $160-million, 72,000-seat facility, with 108 sky boxes and 7,500 
club seats, next to Oriole Park at Camden Yards and paid for with bonds backed 
by lotteries and stadium revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deal: All revenues from tickets, sky boxes, club seats, parking and 
concessions go to the team, which would pay rent of $1 per game. Team would get 
Colts' renovated training facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Good: Projected team profits of $28 million by fourth year of operation. 
Strong fan interest demonstrated by Orioles' 1993 attendance (3,644,965), 
seventh-highest total in major league history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad: Interest in Colts waned in years before 1984 departure to 
Indianapolis. Redskins' intention to build new stadium in nearby Laurel, Md., 
could disrupt Baltimore's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 City: ST. LOUIS 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium: A $258-million, 70,000-seat domed stadium, paid for with state- and 
local government-backed bonds, will be completed in 1995 and will have 101 sky 
boxes and 6,550 club seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deal: All concession, in-house advertising, sky box and club seat revenue 
to team. Team would pay $250,000 per year but $75,000 in game-day expenses 
would be paid for. No training facility exists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Good: St. Louis (pop. 2.47 million) is the largest city without an NFL 
team, and it has the largest television market (18th) without a team. Would fit 
well in any NFL realignment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad: Conflicting ownership groups doomed 1993 expansion bid. Stadium lease 
problems could hinder relocation efforts. Has stigma of losing Cardinals to 
Phoenix in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 City: MEMPHIS 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium: The Liberty Bowl would undergo $60-million renovation, increasing 
capacity to 68,000 -- 102 sky boxes, 8,300 club seats. Financed by tax breaks, 
state and local assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deal: All revenue from sky boxes, concession and parking go to the team, 
which would pay $1 per seat per game in rent. City would fund construction of 
training facility/office complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Good: All sky boxes, club seats were leased for five to seven years during 
expansion try. Would be only pro franchise in five-state area of Tennessee, 
Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad: Even with renovations, stadium is antiquated compared to today's 
state-of-the-art facilities. Per-capita income of $13,590 was poorest of recent 
expansion candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 City: SAN ANTONIO 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium: The 65,000-seat Alamodome, which is expandable to 72,000 seats, 
includes 64 sky boxes and was completed last year. NBA's Spurs are current 
occupants of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deal: Team would pay no rent and receive parking revenue, a percentage of 
concessions revenue to be negotiated with the city, and revenue from half the 
sky boxes (Spurs control other half). 
</P>
<P>
 The Good: A Dallas Cowboys-Houston Oilers exhibition game in 1993 attracted a 
capacity crowd in football-mad state, and the Spurs are among the NBA's leaders 
in home attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad: City's bid for NFL expansion team in 1993 was one of the first 
eliminated. Team would be secondary tenant in stadium. NFL probably wouldn't 
want third team in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 City: HARTFORD 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium: State Legislature has authorized $252 million in general obligation 
bonds for construction of 70,000-seat, 140-sky box stadium and adjoining 
practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deal: Team would receive all revenue from concessions, parking, sky boxes, 
club seats and in-house advertising but would pay $4.9-million annual rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Good: Connecticut has the highest median household income of any state in 
the United States. Densely populated, with 9 million within a 75-mile radius of 
Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad: Nearby New York Jets, New York Giants and New England Patriots would 
likely oppose an NFL team moving to the state. Stadium rent is pretty steep.

ANAHEIM AND THE RAMS: FINAL PLAY?; BALTIMORE DEAL MAKER OUT TO SCORE NFL TEAM; 
PRO SPORTS: PETER G. ANGELOS HAS BEEN ANOINTED THE CITY'S POINT MAN TO LURE A 
FRANCHISE. RECENT SUCCESSES SUGGEST TO SOME THAT HE CAN PULL IT OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He could be the next owner of the Rams. Or the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Or, he 
could be the next governor of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, he could merely continue being Peter G. Angelos, managing partner 
of the Baltimore Orioles, head of his thriving Baltimore law firm, member of 
Loyola College's Board of Trustees and hometown hero to thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reception he's receiving is like a heroic Roman general returning to the 
homeland," Baltimore law school professor Francis Valle told the Baltimore Sun 
after Angelos' local group outbid several out-of-state investors to purchase 
the baseball Orioles for $173 million last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine how folks would feel if Angelos can lure an NFL team to Baltimore, 
which once prided itself on the Colts? They'd probably want to rename the city 
after him. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angelos, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has been commissioned by Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer to do 
what the Baltimore Stadium Authority failed to do in last year's NFL expansion 
race -- lure an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
 He has reportedly made a $200-million offer for the Buccaneers, and he has 
acknowledged that Larry Lucchino, a member of his NFL investment group, has met 
with Rams officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's gotten very involved (in the football effort)," said Hal Donofrio, a 
Baltimore advertising executive and close friend of Angelos. "He's very willing 
to be a major investor, a minor investor or no investor." 
</P>
<P>
 Rams owner Georgia Frontiere has said the Rams aren't for sale, but there has 
been speculation she might sell at least a minority interest in the team if the 
Rams move. And Angelos certainly is in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "His goal is to get a team for Baltimore, owned and controlled by 
Marylanders," Donofrio said. "Whether that can be done overnight or whether it 
takes 10 years, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos, 65, has been a prominent Baltimore resident for years. His law firm, 
in which he has no partners, has settled approximately $750 million in 
asbestos-related suits in the last decade, with more than 1,000 cases 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 But since his group purchased the Orioles from Eli S. Jacobs last summer, 
Angelos has become Baltimore's leading mover and shaker when it comes to 
sports. He has been a hands-on owner with the Orioles, taking a lead role in 
deciding which free-agent players to pursue last off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 He has endeared himself to fans with his plans for construction of a pavilion 
in Oriole Park at Camden Yards to be used exclusively by students who will be 
given free admission, and for providing greater access to the park for senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of Baltimore's City Council during the 1960s, the popular and 
personable Angelos has also been approached about running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just brilliant, a diplomat in a business suit," Donofrio said. "He's 
usually thinking three steps ahead of anyone he's talking with. He's a 
strategist." 
</P>
<P>
 Attracting an NFL team to Baltimore might be his most difficult task yet. The 
competition from cities such as St. Louis and Memphis is stiff, and Redskin 
owner Jack Kent Cooke plans to build a new stadium in Laurel, Md., only 15 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Angelos, Baltimoreans trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been working 18 hours a day since last February with his law firm and 
baseball, and he's dead serious about bringing an NFL team here," Donofrio 
said. "A lot of his friends think he could make a contribution to the state as 
governor, but he might be able to make a bigger contribution in the private 
sector."SPORTS FR

FIVE POTENTIAL GOP RIVALS SLAM CLINTON; POLITICS: SEEKING EARLY SOUTHERN 
REPUBLICAN SUPPORT, PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES IN '96 DENOUNCE PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN, 
DOMESTIC POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bidding for early Southern support in the 1996 campaign, five Republican 
presidential prospects denounced President Clinton this weekend for being too 
timid to assert U.S. influence abroad and too eager to extend the reach of the 
federal government at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential candidates aimed their Clinton critiques at a conclave of about 
600 party officials and grass-roots GOP workers from the 13 states of the Old 
Confederacy that make up the most solid part of the Republican presidential 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the political machinery in the region," said Alec Poitvint, chairman 
of the biannual Southern Republican Leadership Conference, which concludes here 
today. "For someone thinking of running for President, this is a great place to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 The most severe criticism of Clinton's handling of foreign affairs came from 
the nation's senior Republican elected official, Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole of Kansas, who ranked first in a recent USA Today poll of voter 
preferences for the party's 1996 nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry about lack of world leadership demonstrated by the White House," Dole 
told the crowd at a reception Friday night. "Our credibility is being eroded 
around the world." He complained that Clinton, in dealing with the bloody civil 
war in Bosnia and crises in Haiti and Korea, had not been decisive enough in 
his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to opinion surveys that indicate most Americans are reluctant to get 
involved overseas, Dole said: "You can't run America by polls. You can't take a 
poll every day on Bosnia and Korea. You have to stand up to the American people 
and persuade the American people, and then they'll follow you." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole told reporters before his speech that he plans to push this week for 
Senate approval of a resolution directing the President to lift the arms 
embargo against the Muslim-led Bosnian government, regardless of what U.S. 
allies want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole also charged that the Clinton Administration had "gone too far" in 
cutting defense spending, leaving the United States ill-prepared to deal with 
crises overseas. "There is a difference between cutting and gutting," said 
Dole, who called for a two-year moratorium on military-base closings. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar criticism came from two-term South Carolina Gov. Carroll A. Campbell 
Jr., who has been testing the presidential waters even as he campaigns for 
Republican congressional and gubernatorial candidates in the 1994 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I travel this world a lot," Campbell said in a speech to the conference's 
opening session Friday, "and world leaders everywhere say: 'What is wrong with 
your country? Why don't you lead?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say that I don't know," he said. "We can't turn inward and do 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, a former House member, argued that the United States should have 
taken a stronger role in urging quicker U.N. intervention in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a lot of threats to do things and didn't do them until it was too 
late," he said. "We'd better understand that we have here (in Bosnia) a Muslim 
group, and we'd better ask ourselves this question: 'Are we not doing what we 
should do there because they are Muslims?' " 
</P>
<P>
 While some Republicans contend that Clinton's difficulties abroad offer GOP 
candidates a chance to reap political hay, others disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are running a campaign, you find that people are more interested in 
what you can do for them directly about such things as jobs, taxes and welfare 
reform," said Larry Bigham, who is challenging incumbent Democratic Rep. John 
M. Spratt Jr. in South Carolina's 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
 Bigham and others who share his view were no doubt pleased with Saturday's 
conference address by former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, 
who barely mentioned foreign affairs and instead critiqued Clinton's proposals 
for domestic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the collapse of Communist regimes abroad, Kemp said: "While the whole 
world is moving toward privatization, you go to Washington and hear President 
Clinton talk about nationalizing the country." 
</P>
<P>
 He also challenged his own party, saying: "We can't just be the party of small 
government and big prisons. We have to propose what we want to do to lift up 
this country and bring us together." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp called on Republicans to make a greater effort to reach out to African 
Americans and other minorities by becoming "the party of democratic capitalism 
for the inner cities of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who has been quietly but steadily 
building a 1996 campaign infrastructure through a satellite and cable 
television network called Republican Neighborhood Meetings, also complained 
that Clinton is unnecessarily expanding the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should spend less time reinventing government and more time remembering 
how we got to be such a great country in the first place," said Alexander, who 
served as education secretary under President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander faulted Clinton's "Washington-knows-best" proposals for education 
reform for not allowing more flexibility and freedom of choice for individual 
parents and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of adopting Clinton's elaborate and costly ideas for welfare reform, 
he said, the nation would be better off "sending welfare back to the states 
along with the dollars to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, the final presidential aspirant to speak, concentrated 
his fire on Clinton's proposal to reform health care, which he labeled as 
"socialized medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to imposing an excessive taxing burden and driving many small 
business into bankruptcy, Gramm said the proposal would take away the right to 
choose a doctor from most Americans, except for employees of the federal 
government and some big corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 "But let me give you the good news," he said, "there is a big difference 
between Elvis and the President's health care plan. And the big difference is 
that Elvis may be out there alive somewhere."

CLINTON URGES HUNTERS TO BACK ASSAULT GUN BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton stepped up his campaign to ban assault weapons Saturday, 
urging hunters in an open letter to help outlaw firearms "designed for the 
battlefield." 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Clinton stressed that he had been a hunter since age 12 and 
offered assurances that he would "not allow the rights of hunters and sportsmen 
to be infringed upon." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "I know the difference between a firearm used for hunting and 
target-shooting and a weapon designed to kill people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate has approved legislation that would outlaw assault weapons, and a 
vote is expected in the coming week in the House, where proponents of the 
measure are still short of support. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and various Cabinet members have lobbied for the legislation with 
frequent public appearances. The President is intensifying efforts on behalf of 
the bill with a White House event Monday, mailings to newspaper editorial 
boards and individual lobbying of swing lawmakers, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation at issue would stop the manufacture, sale and new possession 
of 19 semiautomatic assault-style weapons, bar production of copycat models and 
limit detachable magazines to 10 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault-weapons ban is being debated as part of a broader anti-crime 
package in Congress.

 A drifter was charged with snatching a 7-year-old girl from her bedroom and 
raping her in a nearby park after lab tests linked him to blood and body fluids 
at the scene. Bobby Ray Cornett, 45, of Athens, Tenn., was jailed Friday 
without bond on charges of aggravated kidnaping, capital sexual battery and 
aggravated burglary, police said.

SETTLEMENT PUTS BILLIONAIRE IN CONTROL OF BIOSPHERE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Biosphere 2's financial backer has taken control of the environmental project 
under a settlement of a lawsuit that questioned the project's management. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas billionaire Ed Bass sued last month, and the agreement was announced 
Friday.It requires court approval, and a court receiver will continue to run 
the project until then. 
</P>
<P>
 The $150-million project seeks to replicate the Earth's environment inside a 
glass-and-metal dome. Bass had claimed that the project was being mismanaged 
and that managers were resisting his efforts to resolve its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The managers were ousted because of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Other details of the settlement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's important to remember is that the objectives of the Biosphere have not 
changed," said Terrell Lamb, a spokeswoman for Bass. "We intend to pursue those 
objectives with renewed commitment and vigor." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven people are living under Biosphere's sealed dome.

UNIVERSITY PLANS TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT FOR OVIATT LIBRARY

 Hoping in part to quash a feared exodus of students, Cal State Northridge 
officials say they plan to build a new library on campus by this fall as an 
interim replacement for the heavily damaged Oviatt Library, which may take two 
years or more to fully reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 The university's enrollment already was on a downward slide even before the 
Jan. 17 earthquake battered the campus and closed the 220,000-square-foot 
Oviatt, CSUN's sole library.Without some substantial facility, faculty members 
have warned, students could leave in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson approved the interim library plan this past 
week. Dean of Libraries Susan Curzon said she will pursue a warehouse-like 
tilt-up concrete structure that would hold about one-quarter of the Oviatt's 
1.1 million volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Curzon said she has yet to settle on the size of the building, how much it 
will cost, or where on campus it would be built. But CSUN Provost Louanne 
Kennedy told faculty members that one possible site is an open area near the 
collapsed CSUN parking structure on Zelzah Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty members, who rely on the library for their own research and class 
preparations, applauded the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's 24,813 students this semester have had no on-campus library since 
classes began in mid-February. The university instead has been operating hourly 
shuttle buses to take CSUN students to and from libraries at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 By the beginning of next week, shortly before spring finals, CSUN officials 
expect to open two small emergency library facilities on campus, a 
15,000-square-foot refurbished hall and a 12,600-square-foot dome. But those 
alone were deemed inadequate to serve the entire campus for the coming school 
year.

DANA PARSONS: WHEN PARENTS CEDE CONTROL, SCHOOLS SEIZE COMMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was a school superintendent's kid. I've had many schoolteacher friends over 
the years. As such, I've heard the laments about how parents didn't understand 
what teachers and administrators were trying to do and how school boards 
didn't, either. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the plight of professional educators, I'm a sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
 But (you knew there would be a "but," didn't you?) it might not be a bad idea 
for administrators to spend part of the upcoming summer contemplating whether 
they've gone too far in trying to maintain control of their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not going to begin every paragraph by saying educators have a tough job 
today. Let's take that as a given. But a spate of recent conversations I've had 
with parents, seemingly unrelated but similar in tone, suggest that many of 
them think school officials may have turned their schoolhouses into fiefdoms. 
</P>
<P>
 I spent some time on the phone recently with a father who was unhappy that his 
seventh-grade son had gotten beaten up by three other kids at school. What 
bothered the man even more than his son's misfortune was that his son, along 
with the other boys, was suspended for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 I told the man that I probably couldn't do much for him, in that readers 
wouldn't know what role his son played in the fight. He conceded that point, 
but asked what the logic would be in his smallish son picking a fight with 
three older boys. 
</P>
<P>
 In a follow-up letter, the father was still furious about his son's 
suspension: "What judicial process in any other aspect of public law would 
conclude that a child attacked and beaten . . . should be punished?" 
</P>
<P>
 That conversation followed by a few weeks one I'd had with a mother at an 
elementary school that was debating whether to establish voluntary uniforms for 
students this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 What irked the mother wasn't so much whether or not students should wear 
uniforms, but what she perceived as school administrators' stacking the deck in 
favor of uniforms. When a parent survey first indicated support for uniforms, 
the woman spearheaded a move for a follow-up survey that, she said, was more 
neutral in tone. 
</P>
<P>
 The second survey overturned the findings of the first. "My concern was how it 
was arbitrarily shoved down our throats until we stopped it," the mother said. 
Emphasizing that she is "very supportive" of the school in other matters, she 
said wearing uniforms, even if labeled as voluntary, "is an affront to 
someone's civil liberties, telling them what they can and can't wear." 
</P>
<P>
 What do these instances say about our schools? It suggests to me that power 
loves a vacuum, and in a society where many parents have ceded control of their 
children to schools, the schools have accepted that mantle. Sometimes, too 
zealously. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's campus troublemakers have infinitely more capacity to do harm than 
troublemakers in my day, and it isn't surprising that administrators may go 
overboard in meting out punishment. When we have schools where kids are 
bringing guns in their backpacks, we can understand why administrators may 
sometimes overlook the niceties of English common law. 
</P>
<P>
 They may well think they've handled the problem by suspending a kid who does 
nothing more than swing back when he's accosted on the playground. They may 
think they're preempting a crisis by pushing for school uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In both instances, however, they're taking the quick-fix solution to more 
vexing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Georgiann Boyd with the county Department of Education to put 
administrators' problems in context for me. She pointed out that when it comes 
to fights, they are often faced with conflicting stories and that a fight can 
have complex origins. On the issue of uniforms, school administrators "are 
trying to get a handle on this thing called school violence," she said. Law 
enforcement officials like the idea of uniforms, and school administrators may 
be reacting to that, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if schools are more autocratic than, say, a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's more of a concern because more kids are being expelled than 
before," she said. Parents may be more vocal about suspensions because they 
usually mean that someone has to supervise the child at home, which may be more 
difficult today because of working parent situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd said she thinks school officials try to treat situations fairly and are 
taught in training sessions that "cutting corners" on things like discipline 
only leads to more trouble later. 
</P>
<P>
 My father loved being an educator 30 years ago. In many ways, he probably 
ruled as judge, jury and executioner when it came to problems within the school 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the difference is that the cases just keep getting tougher and tougher 
every year.

SCOTT HARRIS: STUDY HARD AND ONE DAY YOU'LL BE MISS OCTOBER 
</P>

<P>
 "Today is my birthday!" Shannon McCarthy proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her eighth, to be exact. Shannon seemed quite pleased. Part of the reason was 
that Shannon's birthday Thursday coincided with Take Our Daughters to Work Day. 
Instead of attending classes at Old Orchard Elementary School in Santa Clarita, 
Shannon followed her father, Shawn, on his duties as a cameraman for KABC News. 
This innocuously sexist event, conceived and promoted by the Ms. Foundation, is 
designed to free girls of psychological shackles imposed by our patriarchal 
society. It's kind of a feminist version of be-all-you-can-be Army ads. 
</P>
<P>
 And where did Take Our Daughters to Work Day wind up taking little Shannon? 
</P>
<P>
 Why, to the Playboy Mansion! 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this was a birthday Shannon will never forget. Someday she will realize 
that she has done something millions of Y chromosome humans only dream of. She 
has had an inside peek at Hugh Hefner's enchanted kingdom, the playground of 
the Playmates and sybaritic symbol of evil in the minds of so many feminists. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn McCarthy, it must be said, came by his assignment honestly, as did yours 
truly. We were to serve as the public's eyes and ears as Jennifer McCarthy, 
Miss October, 1993, and no relation to Shawn and Shannon, was crowned the 1994 
Playmate of the Year. (Readers may recall how the older Ms. McCarthy recently 
delighted a group of children at the Panorama City Branch of the Los Angeles 
Public Library with a heartfelt reading of "Green Eggs and Ham.") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny McCarthy may be a nice young woman, but she is not the Ms. Foundation's 
typical idea of a role model. There is something about a young woman who freely 
removes her clothes and poses for magazines aimed at a male audience that is 
disturbing to many feminists. For many women, this luncheon event would have 
been a cause for distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Larger-than-life blowups of Jenny McCarthy in various states of undress 
decorated the huge tent where lunch for 500 was served. And the guests included 
more than 50 Playmates, who wore name tags proclaiming their name and month, 
dating back to Miss August, 1956.  
</P>
<P>
 This was my first visit to the Hefner compound, which is in Holmby Hills and 
aptly resembles a medieval castle, complete with crenelations. The lush grounds 
have parrots and monkeys. Beside the long drive is a yellow warning sign -- 
"Children at Play" -- that reminds one that Hefner, in his 60s, is the father 
of two young sons with his wife, Kimberly, a onetime Playmate of the Year 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unusual to see so many Playmates without turning any pages. In 
retrospect, it occurs to me that Playmates may be the least qualified people to 
comment on the broader social implications of Playmatehood. Women who have been 
exalted as icons of male sexual desire may not understand the effect they have 
on the multitudes who are not so exalted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing but wonderful," declared 58-year-old Jonnie Nicely, Miss August 
'56. "I've always said that if being in Playboy is being exploited, I'll take 
another 37 or 38 years of it." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, of course, a dark side. Some Playmates, one confided, have been 
banished for inappropriate behavior, such as one who became a porno queen. Then 
there's the sad story of Dorothy Stratten, the Playmate of the Year who was 
murdered by her spurned husband, who then killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Unpleasant memories were distant on this bright, sunny day as Jenny McCarthy's 
family and friends watched her become the latest Playmate of the Year. Hefner 
made a point of describing her secure Catholic upbringing and her 
self-confidence in making the announcement and presenting her with a $100,000 
check. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was signed by Christy, so I know it's official," Hefner quipped. Christy, 
Hefner's daughter from his first marriage, is a self-described feminist who is 
Playboy's president and chairwoman of the board. Hefner took his daughter to 
work more than 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later, I had a few minutes with Hef himself. Hefner argued that, contrary to 
what some feminists think, Playboy has been a liberating force for both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women's movement grew out of the sexual revolution," explained the sage 
of what he dubbed the "Playboy Philosophy." "There's an intricate connection 
between the sexual revolution, the civil rights movement and the women's 
movement. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the anti-sexual part of the women's movement that gets publicity. . . . 
It's quite fitting and delicious that a staunch feminist would become president 
of what is perceived in some quarters as the last bastion of male chauvinism." 
</P>
<P>
 One non-Playmate who seemed to agree was Lynette McCarthy, Jenny's older 
sister and an art history major at UC Berkeley. Lynette says that, though she 
is proud and happy for her sister, she avoids the Playmate topic at Berkeley. 
"Some of the girls who don't shave their legs or their armpits might find it 
offensive," Lynette explained. "But I find them offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 All these McCarthys can make a story confusing. But on Take Our Daughters to 
Work Day, the most important opinion belonged to Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know what a Playmate is?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The birthday girl looked me in the eye. "Someone who models nakedly. Am I 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon also said she was bored. But the next day, her father gave me a 
different report. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, he explained, they attended an open house at Old Orchard. When 
adults asked Shannon what she had done that day, she announced: "We went to the 
Playboy Mansion!" 
</P>
<P>
 "And I got looks," her father said. "Oh, it was tough." 
</P>
<P>
 But then Shannon told them all about the birds and the monkeys and how it 
looked just like a castle.

SUNDAY PROFILE; BACK FROM THE BRINK; LIKE HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN IN DISTRESS WHO 
PASS THROUGH THE SYSTEM, MICHAEL MCKENZIE HAD A HEAD START ON FAILURE -- BUT HE 
BROKE THE CHAIN. THE COLLEGE STUDENT NOW IS A PEER-COUNSELOR AT ORANGEWOOD, THE 
COUNTY'S REFUGE FOR TROUBLED KIDS, WHERE HE SPENT MUCH OF HIS YOUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When his mother started screaming, Michael McKenzie just rolled over in bed 
and shut his eyes tighter. The 8-year-old had learned during a lifelong tour of 
shabby motel rooms and children's shelters how to sleep through noise, or 
hunger or even fear. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been drinking again. He couldn't tell what she was ranting and sobbing 
about this time, but when he heard the banging on the front door he knew he had 
to quiet her down. Half-asleep, he wandered into her room to find her fumbling 
beneath her mattress for a butcher knife she kept stashed there ever since a 
man had followed her home from a bar. She pulled it out just as the door came 
crashing down. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the police kicked in the door they saw her standing there above me with 
the knife, so they tackled her," McKenzie remembers now, 14 years later. "I 
think there were four or five of them. They wrestled her to the ground, really 
hard. I remember I just kept crying." 
</P>
<P>
 That night it was back to a shelter and an uncertain future for young 
McKenzie. It was the fourth time he had been taken away from his mother, and it 
wouldn't be the last. Already a grade behind in school, the shy little boy 
seemed to have disadvantages stacked against him on all sides. His father had 
left long ago, when McKenzie was an infant, and his mother was again seeking 
solace in a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hundreds of neglected or abused children who pass through Orange County's 
social system each year, McKenzie had a head start on failure. But, unlike most 
of those kids, McKenzie escaped.  
</P>
<P>
 A handsome and charismatic 22-year-old, a college student and surfer with an 
easy smile, he seems now to be worlds away from his troubled youth. He's 
overcome emotional problems that made him a dour, depressed youth. And he's 
back at the shelter where he spent much of his childhood, this time to reach 
out to youngsters who, as he did, find themselves paying for their parents' 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie returned two years ago to the familiar courtyards of Orangewood 
Children's Home, the county's refuge for kids in distress. He came back to help 
create and now head a peer-counseling program that the home's officials 
describe as wildly successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Every two weeks, McKenzie and 17 other trained alums of the home meet with 
teens, listen to their problems and answer questions about drugs, suicide, 
pregnancy and other heavy topics. Most of all, they offer themselves as role 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids, the guys especially, come into the program thinking 
they're too cool for it to do them any good; they think we don't have anything 
to tell them that they don't already know," McKenzie said. "But when we tell 
them we've been where they are now, you can see them look up and pay 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie says he wishes a similar program had been in place when he was at 
Orangewood. "People were never able to get me to open up much, and I know that, 
for a lot of the kids I work with, I'm going to run into the same thing. But 
that's OK. Sometimes the ones who don't talk still get a lot out of it. I know 
I would have." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the program, and of McKenzie himself, has been like a tonic for 
many of the world-weary staff at Orangewood. They know the numbers are against 
them, so they embrace the victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get to see a lot of the ones who make it, just the ones that keep 
coming back," supervisor Cindi Ortiz said. "We get a lot of negativity, so it's 
refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 Another person who finds inspiration in McKenzie's turnaround is William G. 
Steiner, former director of Orangewood and now a member of the county's Board 
of Supervisors. The two grew close when the boy was at the shelter, and the 
politician picked McKenzie to hold the Bible for him when he took his oath of 
office in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, that was like a happy ending after seeing a lot of tragedies," 
Steiner said. "I buried a lot of kids through the years, and I saw a lot of 
others take turns for the worst. They end up in jail or on drugs or become 
abusive parents themselves. It can burn you out. So when you have a success 
like Mike, it just renews your faith." 
</P>
<P>
 For much of his youth, it seemed unlikely that McKenzie would become a success 
story. Five times he was taken from his mother's care because of neglect. He 
missed long stretches of school. While most kids were grappling with long 
division, he was coping with a deep depression as he was shuttled between 
foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never blamed his mother, whom he remembers had a "beautiful, peaceful 
smile" that could always renew his hope. "I loved her, and I was able to 
forgive her every time. In reality, yes, I guess I was suffering for her 
mistakes, but I never really thought of it like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The dark years reached their nadir just a few weeks before his 15th birthday. 
His mother died of a stroke, and suddenly he was all alone in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things could have gotten really bad after that," McKenzie concedes. Instead, 
Steiner asked San Clemente stockbroker Peter McKenzie to meet the boy. The two 
hit it off, and soon Michael moved in. Later, he would take his foster father's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter McKenzie had taken in troubled teens before, but he had never seen one 
who had so effectively shut himself off from the world. "At first I wasn't 
really sure Mike even liked me," he said. "He had the biggest wall around him I 
had ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking down that wall would be no easy task. The teen was still doing poorly 
in school and bottomed out when he was expelled for truancy. Most days he slept 
away. "It sounds funny, but that's how my depression was expressed," Michael 
McKenzie said. "I wouldn't get up usually until noon." 
</P>
<P>
 His new father saw potential in McKenzie, but he knew he needed help digging 
it out. "We got him some counseling. We had to. I was going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The professional help, along with a healthy dose of tough love from the people 
around him, helped McKenzie mount an incredible comeback. Taking evening 
classes to make up credits, he managed to graduate on time and was voted 
student of the month three times in his senior year. More than that, he came to 
grips with his past and his mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids like Mike use their problems as an excuse to fail, but Mike was 
lucky enough to have people around him who cared a great deal about him and 
held him accountable for his actions," Steiner said. "We weren't going to let 
him use his background as a reason not to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Westmore, assistant director of the Orangewood Foundation, said the 
true key to McKenzie's success was within him the whole time. "He just has this 
absolute perseverance. You can see it." 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie acknowledges something inside him that guided him through the low 
times. Without it, the tough love and counseling might not have been enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have a lot of opportunities for a long time; I realize that now. But 
when I was growing up, I felt this strength inside me, deep down, that made me 
feel I would succeed," McKenzie said. "There were a lot of times when I may 
have doubted it, but I still had that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, as a youngster, McKenzie had little else he could rely on. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother's battles with addiction and poverty left her little room to raise 
a son. He missed a lot of school, sometimes because he was too ashamed of his 
clothes or where he lived to ride the school bus, other times because he was 
again sleeping late to escape his dingy surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 He would go whole days without eating, or he would force down a meal of 
whatever he could find in the unkempt kitchen -- be it raw sugar, dry cereal or 
uncooked spaghetti. His mother was either working or, when she lapsed into an 
alcoholic binge, off partying. Life was always on the edge and, sometimes, over 
the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie said he and his mother twice ended up living in dank warehouses, 
sleeping on shaky cots among piles of clothes and stacks of boxes. Once, at age 
12, he was arrested for shoplifting. A schoolteacher had chided him in front of 
other students about his socks, which she said were soiled and smelly, so he 
went to a department store to steal some. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time he was kidnaped for several days by two women, co-workers of his 
mother who decided she was unfit to raise him. "That wasn't scary or anything; 
they were nice people, but it was pretty strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Again and again the strangeness in McKenzie's life prompted authorities to 
step in and take him from his mother, the first time when he was just an 
infant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he would spend several weeks or months in foster care until his 
mother could show she had the means to care for him. After he was taken the 
fourth time, after the police believed she was menacing him with the knife, he 
spent three years with a Garden Grove family. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he grew close to those foster parents and the other children in 
their home, he always dreamed of returning to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would come and visit every other Saturday, and then I would watch her 
walk up to the bus stop and leave," he remembered. "It was always hard to see 
her go. I had all these unrealistic expectations that we would be able to get a 
house and be happy. I just didn't see the whole picture." 
</P>
<P>
 When the day came to wave goodby to the tearful foster family and return to 
his mother for the final time, McKenzie was beside himself with excitement. He 
was certain they would now have the life he dreamed of. He was crestfallen when 
he found out that, instead of a home, they would once again be living in a 
motel. That disappointment grew when his mother resumed drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 One night he and his mother fell asleep watching television. He was roused by 
a noise and looked over to see his mother convulsing, gripped by a stroke. As 
she was rushed to a hospital, McKenzie, then 14, was taken to a friend's house 
and then back to Orangewood. A few days later, a counselor took him aside and 
told him his mother was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get to visit her in the hospital, and I really beat myself up about 
that for a long time," he said. "I know she loved me; no matter what happened 
through the years, I know that." 
</P>
<P>
 After that he was lucky enough to be placed with Peter McKenzie. If he had 
stayed in the shelter until turning 18, his life may have taken a decidedly 
darker turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Westmore said studies show that as many as half of the teens who leave 
shelters upon reaching adulthood end up homeless in the first few years out. 
Westmore said she can also attest to other dangers, such as drugs, that await 
the cut-loose charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get a handshake and a pat on the back, and then they're on their own," 
she said. "And it's scary out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Grateful for his chance to start anew, McKenzie decided he wanted to give 
something back. He began helping with Orangewood benefits and activities, and, 
after a summer camp stay sparked an interest in peer counseling, he was eager 
to help with a fledgling program being set up at the home. Soon he was leading 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike was just the natural choice," Westmore said. "He has instant credibility 
with these kids. As the program had grown, time and time again the kids will 
tell us the thing they got out of the sessions was, 'There is life after 
Orangewood.' That's the message Mike brings to them." 
</P>
<P>
 As he hears their sad stories, McKenzie can't help but think about the less 
than bright future awaiting many of the teens. "I think it's so sad. That's 
what we're trying to do, though, is help as many as we can break the cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie hopes to attend a four-year university next year to pursue a degree 
in child psychology or a related discipline. Armed with that, his next goal 
will be to push his personal campaign to help youngsters who grow up adrift or 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking through the spartan rooms of Orangewood, pointing to the playgrounds 
he roamed as a pensive adolescent, McKenzie reflected on his long, scary ride 
and the sad ending of his mother's life, and talked about unfinished business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish things could have been different," he said. "At the time I really 
couldn't understand a lot. But now I see where I came from, the reality of it. 
My mom was an alcoholic, and she had a lot of problems. And that's OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wish I could have told her goodby."

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; YMCA CRITIC COWAN OUSTED FROM BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps, Roger Cowan says, it was due to his picketing in front of the Beverly 
Hills Family YMCA. Or maybe it was his public crusade to oust the Y management. 
Whatever the reason, Cowan has been voted off the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last several months, Cowan helped lead a charge to look into the 
finances and management of the fiscally ailing YMCA. He went so far as to 
protest against Y president Robert K. Tanenbaum, a former councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious to me I was thrown off the board because of political reasons," 
said Cowan, who with his wife, Debbie, founded a citizens committee that 
campaigned against Tanenbaum's reelection in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan said he was not told the reason for his dismissal. Neither Tanenbaum nor 
YMCA Executive Director John Eikrem would comment on the board's actions, taken 
at its April 20 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan won't be the only YMCA critic who is not welcome at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael Bilinsky and attorney Al Ross, residents who have pressed for an 
investigation into YMCA finances, were notified in letters from Eikrem that 
they were banned from the YMCA premises because of their "abusive behavior 
toward staff and board members." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross and Bilinsky denied the allegation. They said that when they tried to 
register their children for a basketball program, YMCA employees would not 
accept their applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Robert Block, who cast the sole vote to retain Cowan on the board, said 
he plans to resign his position as a director in protest of Cowan's removal and 
the banishment of Bilinsky and Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also agreed not to request its annual $37,605 in city funding 
despite the nonprofit organization's chronic shortage of money. Block said the 
board made the decision because the City Council used the funding as the basis 
for an investigation into YMCA management and finances. SUSAN STEINBERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA BAY; GROUP PROPOSES RESTORING SEA LIFE TO ATTRACT 
TOURISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Catalina Island consortium has proposed replenishing ocean life in 
Santa Monica Bay by declaring it the country's first marine "economic 
enterprise zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Catalina Island Conservancy and the island Chamber of Commerce want to restock 
fish, squid, abalone and other marine species that have been depleted by 
overfishing and killed off by high levels of DDT in the water.If sea life were 
replenished, the area would draw more tourists, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 The groups laid out the proposal for Assistant Interior Secretary George 
Frampton and Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) during a recent tour of the 
island.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tourism is a clean, renewable resource . . . and it has only declined because 
what people have been coming here for has been depleted," resident Randall 
Bombard told them.  
</P>
<P>
 Frampton said the timing for such a project is good because of high public 
awareness of the reduction or extinction of marine species.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have suggested that the federal government might focus its 1996 budget on 
rivers, fisheries, coastal and estuary restoration," Frampton said. "There are 
opportunities here if we can develop strategies for governments to work 
together in a way that hasn't been done before."  
</P>
<P>
 Said Harman: "It makes all the sense in the world to find a plan with 
community and government support to restore and regenerate marine resources, 
starting with all the food fish eat -- the kelp beds -- and moving up to the 
fish and other species that used to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Catalina Conservancy President Chuck Olson said it is not clear whether the 
bay can recover. "I've never seen an ecosystem so devastated as the water 
here," he said. SUSAN WOODWARD

COVER STORY; POETIC LICENSE; BEYOND BAROQUE CENTER IN VENICE HAS HELPED NURTURE 
AND LAUNCH THE CAREERS OF ASPIRING WRITERS. MORE THAN TWO DECADES LATER, THE 
AVANT-GARDE STILL REIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE MOFFET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, when poet Amy Gerstler began attending events at Beyond 
Baroque Literary/Arts Center in Venice, she had never spent much time with 
other writers. 
</P>
<P>
 That soon changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had a real impact on my work habits," said Gerstler, 37, who lives in Echo 
Park. "I felt less alone, less like I was working in a vacuum. It made me work 
a little harder." 
</P>
<P>
 She has published 10 books, eight of them collections of poems. Her 1990 book 
"Bitter Angel" won the National Book Critics Circle Award in poetry; her most 
recent poetry collection, "Nervestorm," was published by Viking/Penguin. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerstler is one of a number of artists who went on to gain literary 
recognition after honing their craft at Beyond Baroque, a quirky writing center 
in an old Venice building where the avant-garde reigns. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old nonprofit arts center, familiar to writers around the country 
yet unknown to many Angelenos, offers budding writers a place to read their 
unconventional works, hear criticism and find coaching and other support. 
</P>
<P>
 It's home to the longest- running free poetry workshop in Los Angeles, and on 
weekends presents poetry readings and performance arts events. 
</P>
<P>
 Lodged in the former Venice City Hall, a two-story 1907 building with a bell 
tower and a sloping roof beloved by pigeons, Beyond Baroque has hosted an 
extraordinary range of radical and conventional writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Cooper, known for his writings on young gay males, has passed through 
Beyond Baroque's doors. So has Bob Flanagan, who used the center to fine-tune 
his poetry and performance art on masochism. And the late Raymond Carver, whose 
works are relatively more mainstream, has read there too. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Baroque is "the leading literary organization in the city," said Adolfo 
V. Nodal, general manager of the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of anything in the country like Beyond Baroque," Nodal said. 
"It's really a unique organization, devoted to the writer and run by writers." 
</P>
<P>
 Begun in 1968 by George Drury Smith as a literary magazine, Beyond Baroque 
evolved within a year into a workshop and performance art venue on what is now 
Abbot Kinney Boulevard. A writer and publisher, Smith wanted to provide local 
poets an informal place to meet and discuss their work. Beyond Baroque 
incorporated in 1972 and a few years later moved to its current location on 
Venice Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who runs a small newspaper in Playa del Rey, has always been a key 
donor to Beyond Baroque, but has let others run it. When it incorporated, he 
served on the board of directors until last year, retiring to become an 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the center is run by Tosh Berman, a puckish 39-year-old who had run 
Beyond Baroque's film series for five years before assuming his new post. He is 
a poet and the son of the late Wallace Berman, a seminal Los Angeles artist of 
the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 He oversees four employees plus volunteers -- the center has always had 
spartan staffing -- and plans to make sure Beyond Baroque always will sponsor 
"things that are maybe not totally popular, but really interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 The interior of Beyond Baroque is bare-bones. In the main performance space, 
rows of metal chairs (half of them with cushions) are set out before readings. 
A short, creaky platform at the front of the room serves as a stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls and floor are black, and black shades are pulled down over the 
windows facing the street. A red velvet curtain behind the stage provides a 
splash of color. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare at Friday night readings can range from Los Angeles literary couple 
Holly Prado and Harry Northup reading recent poems, to Flanagan performing his 
"super-masochist" poetry and performance art to nationally known poets as 
Jerome Rothenberg and David Antin. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent night, before an audience of 30 -- roughly the average -- writer 
Jamake Highwater read from his recently published novel "Dark Legend" and 
talked about how mythologist Joseph Campbell influenced his writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on how hard it is to describe a dream to someone else, Highwater told 
the audience: "This language upon which we depend is not capable of expressing 
our experiences. And so what most of us do is change the experience so we can 
talk about it. What artists do is change the language rather than changing the 
dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Shana Olson, a West Los Angeles poet, and Ellyn Maybe, a Venice 
writer, spoke about what they get out of Beyond Baroque. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more the space for the hard-core intellectual than the scene-maker," 
said Olson, who attends readings at many Los Angeles venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson heard about Beyond Baroque while a student at Columbia University in New 
York. A Los Angeles resident since 1982, she likes the literary center because 
"it's not attached to the movie industry; it's real pure." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe she appreciates Beyond Baroque's mixture of performances, art shows and 
unusual books for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes it neat is it has it all in one. It's like an island, with 
everything under one kind of odd chippy roof," Maybe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a wide range of writers read at Beyond Baroque, it has become known 
for showcasing avant-garde scribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nodal of the Cultural Affairs Department said that the organization has 
"supported writers no one else in the city would support" because their work, 
often written in experimental forms, addresses thorny issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last five years, many groups like Beyond Baroque (have been) 
subjected to silencing through the shrinking economy," said Nodal, whose 
department gives the group $15,000 to $25,000 annually. "It was called 
censorship a couple of years ago; now it's called economic restructuring. Many 
small presses and literary groups have suffered greatly. It's doubly important 
for us to finance these institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For those who organize the readings, the more unconventional they are, the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the meaner writers: people who are willing to go out on a limb and be 
monsters, kind of lose it on the page," said former readings series director 
Benjamin Weissman, whose first book of stories, "Dear Dead Person," will be 
published by Serpent's Tail Press in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan, a director of Beyond Baroque's long-running Wednesday night poetry 
workshop, credits the group with helping him to develop his own writing during 
the 18 years he has been with the center. 
</P>
<P>
 It "turned my life around. I came from knowing nothing about poetry at all -- 
from writing awful rhyming stuff -- to poetry as a life style. It was an 
incredible learning experience," said Flanagan, 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Many writers have participated in a key program at the organization: the 
workshops where poets gather to critique each others' work. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent Wednesday, 17 writers gathered to read short pieces and hear the 
verdict of their peers. In two hours, six pieces were read and dissected. 
</P>
<P>
 After a young woman read the evening's first poem, Ocean Park writer Frances 
Dean Smith, 71, who has attended the workshop for more than two decades, 
praised a few phrases but said of the overall piece, "I can't think of a good 
reason why I don't like it, but I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Others suggested some word changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dafydd McKahray, 23, of Hollywood, shared a darkly funny, poignant excerpt 
from a work in progress about social interactions between retarded adults and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, McKahray said, he had already incorporated some of the 
workshop suggestions into his writing. 
</P>
<P>
 McKahray has been a Beyond Baroque regular for two years since moving to Los 
Angeles from New York City. He seldom misses a Wednesday and often attends the 
weekend public readings, even though he's working two jobs and attending night 
school at Santa Monica Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I get out of the workshop are these simple fine-tuning kinds of things," 
McKahray said. "The people try to edit as if they were me writing. They're 
right maybe nine times out of 10." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, Beyond Baroque has not been beyond turmoil. Administrative 
problems in recent years have prompted much soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
 The most extreme of the problems resulted in last year's firing of D. B. 
Finnegan, who had been executive director for five years, and the hiring of 
Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggles, according to several insiders, resulted from long-running 
personality conflicts among the staff. Last year, at one point Weissman was 
fired, several staff members speeded up already planned departures and others 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis spurred Beyond Baroque into a prolonged self-examination. 
Ultimately, Weissman was temporarily rehired and several new staff members were 
brought in. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman has sought to shore up the literary center's $200,000 annual budget. 
Beyond Baroque occupies the old City Hall, owned by the city of Los Angeles, 
rent free in exchange for keeping up the property. Grants from government 
agencies and corporate and private foundations, plus individual donations and 
admission fees, generally $6, cover performers' fees and the salaries of the 
three full-time and one part-time staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's no money for such basic repairs as replacing letters that have 
fallen off the front of the building or fixing malfunctioning toilets in the 
women's room. ("There are no fix-the-toilet grants," Berman quipped.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the organization published literary magazines and managed a small 
press library, but the magazines ran out of money and the library is in storage 
due to lack of demand, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Beyond Baroque wins much praise from those who know it, sometimes the 
organization is criticized for being cliquish and insufficiently multicultural. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle T. Clinton, a Santa Monica poet whose second book, "Good Sense & the 
Faithless," has just been published by West End Press, said some longtime Los 
Angeles poets have never read at Beyond Baroque -- and harbor resentment about 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, along with poet Akilah Nayo Oliver, in early 1991 initiated 
multicultural writing workshops, funded by a California Arts Council grant. But 
she stopped working with Beyond Baroque last June due to health problems. The 
workshop ended as well because funding ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with no Beyond Baroque programming specifically for minority writers, 
Clinton worries that "when they don't set aside the time for multiculturalism, 
it will evaporate." 
</P>
<P>
 She and others also are concerned about the organization's movement toward 
more performance-oriented events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poetry should remain minimalist: language and a writer and an audience," 
Clinton said. "There are so many venues for performance. I'd like Beyond 
Baroque to make more of a commitment to pure poetry readings. That's what I 
need, and that's what the L.A. literary community needs." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Berman said he likes to mix genres, to put different elements 
together "like chemistry, and hopefully something will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman wants the literary center to become a place that welcomes a wider 
variety of writers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new Saturday lecture series, Berman said: "I'm interested in getting 
people from the academic world and sort of bringing them down to the street 
level, or to our audience." On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Goodrich, with large cup of coffee on hand, reads his poems at Beyond 
Baroque in Venice, one of Los Angeles' leading writing centers. Beyond Baroque, 
on a meager budget and staff, has cultivated avant-garde poets and artists for 
26 years. Based in a 1907 building, it has hosted both radical and more 
established writers.

CABLE TV: VALUE OF 'DISSIN' DAT' SHOW ON PUBLIC ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As producer of the public access program "Dissin' Dat," I found the "Mixed 
Signals" article by Scott Collins (Westside, April 21) to be on the 
condescending side. 
</P>
<P>
 During the three years "Dissin' Dat" aired on Century Cable, we amassed a 
mailing list of over 400 viewers.In addition, we were contacted by CNN, 
"Entertainment Tonight" and Fox, as well as by several established writers, 
producers and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 It is indeed true that public access has become a wasteland for misguided 
attempts at show business inclusion. Although our program has ceased 
production, there are industry professionals who watched it, and I was able to 
secure a few small film roles because of the exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 As in any creative endeavor, it is up to the producers to showcase and market 
themselves in the most advantageous fashion; knowing what that is becomes part 
of the learning process.

ZONING: PROPOSAL FOR CHILDREN'S CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As acting president of the Del Rey Homeowners and Neighbors Assn., I object to 
your characterization of the issue regarding the property on Wagner Street as 
(only) a conditional use permit for a children's center. 
</P>
<P>
 The major principle here is the accountability of the Community Plan.The City 
Council approved this plan August, 1976, making the Wagner Street property R1, 
to be used for single-family dwellings only. The Community Plan was revised 
July, 1988, but the Wagner Street property was not affected. This is what the 
residents were told when they purchased their homes in this small neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it fair, is it just, that when the time comes for the property to change 
hands the old rules and laws are thrown out the window? 
</P>
<P>
 I for one would like to encourage our city government to earn back the trust 
that seems to have gotten lost. I say let's follow the Community Plan.

BILL BOYARSKY: HOW NEIGHBORS ARE TRYING TO TAKE BACK THE STREETS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Thursday, as the second anniversary of the riots approached, a colleague 
asked me if I was going to write a column about the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I said. I'm going to do something else. The Los Angeles Police Department 
was in the midst of an analysis of some of the city's most crime-ridden areas. 
I was going to visit one, and write about how things were going. What I'd 
forgotten was that the causes of the riots and crime were intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, you can't write about one without considering the other. 
</P>
<P>
 I picked a neighborhood in Pacoima, in the northeast San Fernando Valley. With 
six murders, 56 robberies and 103 aggravated assaults last year, this small 
stretch of L.A. around San Fernando Road and Van Nuys Boulevard made it to the 
top rank of L.A.'s crime champs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I planned to visit a middle-class residential neighborhood in the hills, 
Lake View Terrace. That would give me a chance to determine whether its 
proximity to the dangerous flatlands had poisoned the atmosphere with fear of 
crime. It also happened to be about two miles from the spot where Rodney King 
was beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 I love my job because events so often don't turn out the way I expect them to. 
This was one of those times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the anniversary of the riots, I drove north on Van Nuys Boulevard, 
looking over the shops, liquor stores, restaurants, auto repair places, markets 
and apartment houses. Off Van Nuys, I saw small single-story homes, the 
majority of them with well-tended yards. Everything looked peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 I was sure the statistics didn't lie. Six deaths in a year is more than enough 
for a neighborhood just over two square miles in size, even though one of them 
actually occurred in Glendale and the killers dropped the corpse off in 
Pacoima. But the large number of single-family homes, and the amount of 
gardening that had gone into their yards, told me that the stats didn't tell 
the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners, permanent residents, gave the neighborhood strength. I've seen 
this in other so-called high-crime areas. Homeowners have a stake in the 
neighborhood. Sometimes they organize and fight the thugs.  
</P>
<P>
 This was the case here. Pacoima resident Arthur Broadous told me that three 
years ago, neighbors decided to chase out the drug dealers, although he's sure 
they're operating somewhere else. "We have a good Neighborhood Watch situation, 
and we are doing well. The police have gone out of their way to network with 
the community. They were doing this before Rodney King. During the riots, you 
didn't see trouble (here). We had been working with the Foothill Division 
before. It became stronger after." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadous is program director for the Pacoima Community Youth Culture Center, 
where I met him. The center executive director is his sister-in-law, Connie 
Taylor-Broadous, who sends her small staff out into the Pacoima community every 
day to try to break the cycle of gangs, drugs and violent crime. Job training 
and other classes and Narcotics Anonymous 12-step sessions are among the 
programs offered by the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to be in the wrong place at the wrong time," said center 
employee Phillip Vasquez, 24, who organizes recreational activities in two gang 
strongholds, the San Fernando Gardens public housing, and a large apartment 
house on Van Nuys Boulevard. "Keep your eyes open." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the unfavorable statistics, Vasquez said he feels the area has been 
quieter since a gang truce began five months ago. Later in the day, City 
Councilman Richard Alarcon told me the same thing. "The gang truce is for 
real," he said. "Nobody assumes it will be here next month or next year, but 
while it's here we'll support it. 
</P>
<P>
 A cop patrolling the area didn't take such an optimistic view. When it comes 
to business -- drugs -- the gangs settle their disputes with gunfire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this gloomy assessment, I found a lot of hope in the homeowner and 
community organizations that were fighting violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 I was also surprised Saturday morning when I visited Lake View Terrace, a 
middle-class, racially integrated residential neighborhood in the foothills 
above Pacoima. I had assumed the residents would be frightened by their 
proximity to the high-crime area down below. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice and quiet around here," said Arnaldo Casillas, who has lived there 
eight years. "We haven't had much stuff on our block," said Roman Carter, who 
was talking to neighbor Lester Moreira. "Most of the neighbors watch out for 
each other. We all moved in at the same time. It's something we can be proud 
of. There are lots of areas where you can't say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who is African American, and Moreira, a Latino, moved into the 
subdivision when it was completed nine years ago. Carter watched the workers 
install the foundation of his home. Both sent their children to the nearby 
public Fenton Avenue School, which they consider excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I drove down the hill to Foothill Boulevard and turned left, passing the spot 
in the 11700 block where Rodney King was beaten by the police, the event that 
sent Los Angeles down the path to the riot. 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy was not only death and destroyed property, but fear -- a feeling 
that extended from the embattled areas to neighborhoods many miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 What I saw in Pacoima and Lake View Terrace was a way to fight the fear, 
through neighbors working with each other.  
</P>
<P>
 The crime statistics that sent me out on this mission are a first step. We 
need more of them, distributed widely so we know the crime situation in our 
neighborhoods. That will replace frightening rumor with fact. 
</P>
<P>
 This distribution of statistics, by the way, is an important part of the 
Police Department's community policing plan, which began in the Valley and is 
now being organized in South-Central Los Angeles and the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The cops will tell you what's happening. Then you help them stop it.

VIOLENCE IN L.A.: THE LAPD REPORTS; ANATOMY OF A PLAGUE; NUMBERS TELL THE STORY 
OF WHO IS GETTING HURT, WHY . . . AND WHAT IS NEEDED

<P>
 Pockets of violence blight the Los Angeles landscape, testing the resources of 
the Police Department and the resolve of residents from the Central City and 
South-Central to Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A year's worth of violent crime statistics from every neighborhood in the city 
-- the LAPD keeps track of crime by reporting district, small chunks of 
territory that parallel census tracts -- reveal that no area is untouched. But 
the same statistics demonstrate that although crime citywide dropped last year, 
some communities remain locked in its grip. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the strip of Los Angeles that runs along the Harbor Freeway from Florence 
Avenue to Manchester Avenue. In 1993, those 40-odd square blocks were among the 
city's leaders in terms of robberies, rapes and murders. 
</P>
<P>
 That comes as no surprise to anyone who knows those neighborhoods well. 
Merchants, residents and police have struggled against drugs, prostitution, 
robberies, assaults and killings for too long. All hope for progress. Many 
worry that it will take years. 
</P>
<P>
 As revealing as the statistics can be, they also can mislead. In 1993, the 
city's murder capital was a small community in the LAPD's Rampart area that saw 
15 homicides. Of those, however, 10 occurred on a single day, when an arson 
fire raged through an apartment building. Increased police presence would not 
likely have had much effect on stopping that crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Other kinds of crimes are more commonplace, and police say they tell more 
about the character of a community. In a small Watts community that is home to 
the Nickerson Gardens housing project, barely a day went by without an 
aggravated assault. No other community in Los Angeles had more.  
</P>
<P>
 Violence in the Valley generally is less acute than in south Los Angeles, but 
corridors of crime parallel Van Nuys and Sepulveda boulevards as they cut 
through the northern reaches of the city. One Van Nuys community, just east of 
Sepulveda Boulevard and south of the Southern Pacific Railroad line, had more 
reported rapes -- 14 -- than any other neighborhood in Los Angeles. Police in 
the Valley also say they are battling a rising tide of murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the city's Westside neighborhoods report relatively few violent 
crimes. But others, such as a 20-square-block area in Hollywood, have become a 
magnet for violence. That community, held in the grip of a local gang, tallied 
the West Bureau's highest numbers for aggravated assault, robbery and rape in 
1993. Residents and shopkeepers are fighting back, painting out graffiti and 
working with the Police Department. But the effort is large, the victories 
often temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Times, using LAPD crime statistics, identified the neighborhoods in each 
section of the city that last year posted the highest number of violent crimes 
in four categories: murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department, drawing largely on the same figures, is expected this 
week to release its own station-by-station analysis of the city's most violent 
trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Unedited versions of the LAPD plans for all of its 18 stations, reviewed by 
The Times last week, reveal a host of strategies that range from increased 
patrols to using officers with better language skills to adding detectives, 
vice officers and the like. Many also stress the importance of the LAPD working 
more closely with the communities it is charged to protect and serve. That is 
the underlying notion of community-based policing, which the Police Department 
has embraced and is attempting to implement across Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an undertaking that many residents in the four corners of Los Angeles 
applaud, even if some worry that it may be too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "This neighborhood is a sad place," said Arthur Lee Boone, a pastor whose Free 
Spirit Church of God in Christ is in one of the city's toughest South-Central 
communities. "If we don't get help, places like this are going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 ' The ones who are sick, who are addicted . . . they think you got a nickel on 
you, they'll kill you. They'll kill me. ' - Arthur Lee Boone, pastor of Free 
Speech Church of God in Christ 
</P>
<P>
 ' He was standing over me with the gun and I don't know if God saved me or 
what but he left . . . and I ran. ' - Maria Murillo, attacked near 5th and New 
Hampshire streets

 Thousands of violent crimes were reported last year in each of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's four geographic bureaus. Some neighborhoods have been 
disproportionately affected, and the LAPD, using publicly available data, has 
prepared a series of reports targeting such areas for special attention. Here 
is a look at the department's four bureaus and 1993 violent crimes in four 
major categories.

THE PERILS -- IN THE MOST CRIME-RIDDEN NEIGHBORHOODS

 'There are a lot of people . . . locked down in their houses, afraid to go to 
the store, afraid to go outdoors.' 
</P>
<P>
 Devin Rene Cain was born and raised in this South-Central neighborhood, a 
hardscrabble stretch of land that straddles the Harbor Freeway south of 
Florence Avenue. It was never elegant, she admits, but in recent years it has 
gotten worse and worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad," said Cain, who raised three children here -- two did just fine, 
the third ended up in prison. "It's ugly, and I don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 The plot of land along the highway is just one mile long and barely three long 
blocks across. And yet last year the two LAPD reporting districts in this 
neighborhood -- known as 1256 and 1266 -- recorded some of the city's highest 
violent crime totals. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostitutes regularly work the strip of Figueroa Street that cuts through the 
center of both districts. Merchants along Broadway and Vermont, the eastern and 
western borders of the zone, complain of robberies. And throughout the area, 
residents say it's all too easy to end up dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "One third of these people are so sick," said Arthur Lee Boone, who once lived 
on these streets, an alcoholic, scrounging for change and cigarette butts. 
Today, he is a pastor at the Free Speech Church of God in Christ on Figueroa 
Street. "The ones who are sick, who are addicted to the cocaine, they think you 
got a nickel on you, they'll kill you. They'll kill me." 
</P>
<P>
 No community in the LAPD's South Bureau saw more killings last year than 
Reporting District 1256 -- which has consistently ranked among the city's most 
violent neighborhoods for the better part of a decade. Twelve people were 
murdered in that small neighborhood in 1993. Another eight were killed in the 
adjoining district to the south. Robberies also abounded, with Reporting 
District 1256 recording more than any other place in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two reporting districts were identified by police officials in their 
soon-to-be-released study as the worst in the LAPD's 77th Street Division. But 
that study only confirms what the statistics make abundantly clear: These 
communities are rife with violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the west and east, two other nearby neighborhoods tallied South Bureau's 
highest number of rapes -- 10 in each area. More than most, however, that crime 
is a difficult one to assess and to combat. It often goes unreported, and 
police concede that stepping up arrests seems to have little effect on the 
number of incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our level of violence has always been one of the highest in the city," said 
Capt. Larry Goebel, commanding officer of the 77th Street Division. "But we are 
starting to make an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime statistics for the first few months of 1994 show significant drops in 
violent crime, Goebel said. He attributes the recent progress to improved 
relations between the Police Department and the community. A new business 
patrol has worked with merchants to identify problem spots and eradicate them. 
As police have succeeded in pushing back street drug deals and open 
prostitution in a few areas, violent crime has receded as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents see glimmers of progress and believe better times are ahead. 
Others are skeptical. They have seen too much decay in recent times to put 
their faith in promises or short-term progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past few years, it's gotten so bad that we operate behind bars," 
said Joanne McCafferty, whose family has run a hardware store on Broadway for 
35 years. In the old days, people would wander in, browse the shelves, linger 
over the merchandise. Now they have to ring a bell, and McCafferty only lets 
familiar faces past the threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the robberies) get so bad sometimes you don't even report it," she 
said. "It's terribly frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away, in the heart of Watts, the problems are dishearteningly 
similar, as are the complaints of the people who live and work in the 
neighborhood. The Nickerson Gardens housing project dominates the LAPD's 
Reporting District 1846, where 334 people were the victims of aggravated 
assaults last year. No other reporting district anywhere in Los Angeles logged 
as many. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gangs are an overarching problem. Jobs are scarce. Drugs, especially crack 
cocaine, are the business of the streets. All that contributes to a rising tide 
of violent crime, and changing demographics have created points of tension as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the influx of Latinos into Nickerson Gardens, you've got the African 
American kids jumping on them," said Mingo Durald, project director of the 
Community Services Center in Nickerson Gardens. "It's an ongoing thing here . . 
. It's people living in poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lockett, an LAPD officer at the Southeast station, has patrolled Watts 
for eight years, and he has watched the toll that crime takes on the daily 
lives of the people in the housing projects. Its effects, Lockett said, are 
profound and depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who are locked down in their houses, afraid to go 
to the store, afraid to go outdoors," he said. "They adjust, but they shouldn't 
have to." VALLEY BUREAU

<P>
 Just as Ventura Boulevard is known as the San Fernando Valley's "Main Street," 
so Sepulveda and Van Nuys boulevards have long been synonymous with 
prostitution and drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 So it seems logical, say police, residents and merchants, that the Valley's 
most violent neighborhoods are situated along those north-south corridors in 
urban landscapes that stand in contrast to the area's image as the pool-dotted 
granddaddy of American suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 From murders in Pacoima to robberies in North Hills and rapes and aggravated 
assaults in the LAPD's Van Nuys Division, the Valley's hot spots share a 
proximity to liquor stores and low rents, industrial parks devoid of greenery 
and boarded-up businesses. All abut the hurly-burly blocks of Sepulveda and Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 In the southeast corner of the Devonshire Division, LAPD Reporting District 
1799 documented 119 robberies last year, more than any other Valley community. 
The North Hills area lies between Sepulveda Boulevard to the west and the flood 
control channel on the east, Roscoe Boulevard to the south and Nordhoff Street 
on the north. 
</P>
<P>
 To the south, a neighborhood along the railroad tracks is known as Reporting 
District 936. That community recorded 14 rapes, more than any other place in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next to it lies a barren industrial area crisscrossed by the Southern Pacific 
Railroad line and the Valley's notorious Blythe Street, which last year 
inspired a controversial court order barring gang members from carrying pens, 
tools and flashlights allegedly used in crimes and intimidation tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Flip Smith, a Sepulveda Boulevard businessman who has organized other 
merchants to fight crime, speculated that Blythe Street gang members slip 
across the railroad tracks to commit rapes and other crimes in a bleak area 
with few residents to witness them. The Van Nuys Division report on violent 
crime noted that in 62% of the patrol area's rapes, the victims knew their 
attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 In another 16% of those cases, the report said, the victims were working as 
prostitutes when they were attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith, a tire store owner and founder of the group Business Watch, also 
maintained that crime along Sepulveda Boulevard is decreasing and that 
merchants, buoyed by their efforts, feel optimistic. Bob Jewell, whose auto 
body shop lies farther north on the boulevard, agreed, saying he was surprised 
to hear that his garage's North Hills neighborhood in District 1799 led the 
Valley in robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed-up merchants have begun calling the police whenever they spot a suspected 
prostitute or drug dealer, Jewell said, and they no longer hesitate to shoo 
them away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We absolutely don't permit these people to function on or about our 
properties," he said. "We had prostitutes soliciting johns in our driveway, 
drug dealers doing deals on the pay phone in front of the hotel across the 
street on a regular basis. Now it's down to one or two prostitutes a day 
instead of 20, and I haven't seen a drug deal in weeks or months." 
</P>
<P>
 Just outside the city of San Fernando lies another Valley hot spot, a small 
community nestled between San Fernando Road and Paxton Street in the Foothill 
Division known as Reporting District 1635. Six murders were recorded there in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have here is a combination of extreme poverty and over-concentration 
of liquor outlets," said Pacoima activist Xavier Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths were unrelated -- one involved a Glendale victim whose body was 
dumped in the area -- but several stemmed from brawls aggravated by drugs or 
alcohol and at least one occurred outside a liquor store, said Lt. Gary Hallden 
of the Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's historically been a problem location," Hallden said. 
</P>

 In recent years, community activists such as Flores have worked to curtail the 
number of liquor licenses granted in the area. But bars and alcohol-selling 
convenience stores remain prolific along Van Nuys Boulevard. Flores' nonprofit 
organization, Pueblo y Salud, has documented a higher concentration of liquor 
outlets there than elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, there's a lot of alcohol available in Pacoima," said Marianne 
Haver Hill, executive director of the charity Meet Each Need With Dignity, 
which has joined the anti-alcohol effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "In more affluent neighborhoods, you never see the number of liquor stores and 
billboards advertising liquor," Haver Hill said. 
</P>

 Within the triangle of Panorama City known as Reporting District 909, a 
devastating combination of crime and recession has driven out once-thriving 
businesses and in turn led to more crime. Last year, it topped all other Valley 
neighborhoods with 208 aggravated assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years a nearby GM plant and a Robinsons department store have shut 
down, taking restaurants, a landmark bowling alley and mom-and-pop shops with 
them, said Officer Tim Bergstrom, who works in the community policing unit of 
the LAPD's Van Nuys Division. Drug-trafficking gangs have replaced those 
establishments, scaring away legitimate businesses and their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a spiral of violence that landed Reporting District 909 on the 
Van Nuys Division's list of that station's 10 toughest neighborhoods, where it 
joins Reporting District 936. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley residents and merchants are determined to fight back. In some cases, 
they say they are making progress. Community activist Paula Rangel, who manages 
an apartment house nearby, said that fighting spirit has enabled law-abiding 
residents in her Parthenia Street building -- the Tropicana -- to maintain the 
upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 That community changed its name from Sepulveda to North Hills to erase the 
stigma of crime, but the area still is plagued by drug dealers who attract 
addicts desperate for cash. 
</P>

 Parents take turns walking their children to school lest their knapsacks get 
stolen. Women at bus stops are warned not to carry purses. And a steady series 
of meetings and barbecues lets neighbors get to know each other.

 "The police don't have much manpower," Rangel said, "so we have to take care 
of ourselves." CENTRAL BUREAU

 Subway riders who come out of the shiny tile portals of the MacArthur-Westlake 
station emerge into a neighborhood that police say had more homicides than any 
other in the city during 1993. But the raw numbers say as much about the 
sometimes deceptive nature of statistics as they do about the level of 
brutality in the crowded, battered apartment buildings near there. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting District 246, which includes the subway station, was the scene of 15 
murders in 1993. But 10 of those resulted from an arson fire set in a nearby 
apartment building last May. The fire raced through the three-story building at 
330 S. Burlington Ave., aided by fire doors that had been wedged or nailed 
open, creating a chimney for the deadly smoke and flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that tragic event was but one of many in an area where day-to-day life 
moves to the cautious rhythm of fear, dictating that children play their games 
behind 12-foot-high iron gates and that only the foolhardy and the criminal 
dare walk the streets after dark. Recently, community leaders have tried to 
disrupt that disheartening reality by sponsoring nighttime anti-crime marches 
and graffiti paint-outs and by establishing Neighborhood Watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community here is no different from any community in any large city . . . 
in that crime ranks very high as a concern in everyone's mind," said Richard 
Booth, vice president of corporate affairs for St. Vincent's Medical Center, 
which is at the northeastern corner of the reporting district and is helping 
organize many of the community efforts. 
</P>

 Even so, drug dealers operate openly along Alvarado, 6th, 7th and other 
streets in the area. Prostitutes hustle business while groups of glowering gang 
members control much of the territory like an occupying army. And the largely 
poor immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador who reside there are the victims of 
the second-highest number of assaults and the third-highest number of robberies 
for the entire Central Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is just one of several communities in the Rampart area where violence 
seems to be a fact of daily life. The Police Department's still unreleased 
violent crime analysis -- copies of which were reviewed by The Times last week 
-- states with a note of resignation that patrol officers in Rampart are so 
overworked that they are able to do little more than react to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that 80% of our violent crime occurs in public and we know that 
uniformed police presence . . . can deter that," Rampart Area Capt. Nick 
Solicos said. "My problem is figuring out where to get the resources . . . and 
basically it boils down to robbing Peter to pay Paul." 
</P>
<P>
 Rampart Area Reporting District 241, an area of newly built and stately but 
faded apartments between 3rd and 5th streets and Vermont and Normandie, puts a 
heavy demand on those limited resources. The area, where large numbers of 
Korean immigrants, whites and African Americans mix with a growing Latino 
population, last year recorded the highest number of assaults in the Central 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several residents said the streets there seem safer as police make 
progress against drug dealing and gangs, others remained worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Murillo, 35, said she is afraid to go out, even during the day. Over a 
year ago she was attacked at 11 a.m. near her home at 5th and New Hampshire 
streets by a gunman who tried to snatch her purse. She resisted and was dragged 
through an intersection before her assailant gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I fell I thought this was my last day," she said. "He was standing over 
me with the gun and I don't know if God saved me or what but he left . . . and 
I ran as fast as I could home." 
</P>

<P>
 Lillia Castillo has managed an apartment building at 5th and Catalina streets 
for 11 years and she said that gang graffiti, rather than assaults, are the 
area's most nettlesome problem. Still, she said she warns her tenants to 
"always look to see if anyone is there before you get out of your car when you 
come home from work because someone might try to hold you up." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest concentration of rapes in the Central Bureau, 10, occurred in an 
area just north of the city boundary with Vernon that is patrolled by officers 
from the Hollenbeck Division. But the reported incidence of that crime seemed 
almost random, with a few being reported in most districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, police believe they are gaining the upper hand. Chinatown had 
the unwelcome distinction of reporting the highest number of robberies in the 
Central Bureau last year, with 221. But with the help of bicycle patrol 
officers deployed in February, police arrested four gang members who they 
believe were responsible for a large number of those crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, said Detective Lt. Dave Rock, the thieves would spot a vulnerable 
pedestrian, confront the victim with guns, demand jewelry or a purse or wallet 
and then jump into a car and drive away. Robberies are down 70% in the past two 
months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Jeng, a Chinatown merchant for the past 15 years, remains wary. She 
knows of many elderly people who have been robbed at the bus stations in the 
area and she was attacked two years ago on Hill Street by two young men who ran 
past her and grabbed a gold necklace purchased on a trip to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, she never walks the streets after dark and she "wouldn't dare 
to wear any gold jewelry. It's just too dangerous." WEST BUREAU

 When the 70-year-old retired legal secretary takes her dog for a nightly walk 
in her Hollywood neighborhood, she takes along a companion: An ice pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "A police officer told me to do that," says the woman, who lives near Las 
Palmas Avenue and Yucca Street, the vortex of criminal activity in the place 
the Police Department calls Reporting District 636. 
</P>
<P>
 It tops the entire western part of the city in aggravated assaults, robberies 
and rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only violent crime in which it did not lead the West Bureau last year was 
murder. That dubious distinction was jointly held by Reporting District 1414 in 
the Oakwood section of Venice, where there was a gang war late last year, and 
Reporting District 667 in the southeastern part of Hollywood. Both had seven 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask residents and police what accounts for all the crime in the Yucca 
Corridor, and they tend to give the same answer: gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some victims are drug buyers getting assaulted and robbed, said Mike Shea, a 
senior lead officer in the Hollywood Division. Others are youthful, weekend 
cruisers from nearby Hollywood Boulevard who get into fights, which "pumps up 
the statistics," said Detective Bernard Rogers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Yucca Corridor has been dominated for several years by the 18th Street 
Gang, according to Sharon Romano, leader of the Hollywood Beautification Team, 
a community organization that has been battling the gang for years. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, representatives of the Beautification Team were out painting over 
gang graffiti in an attempt to clean up the neighborhood and to remove -- if 
only temporarily -- signs of the gang's hegemony. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've harassed us on the streets, pulled guns on us and kicked our paint 
cans over," Romano said. "Painting out graffiti sounds like a simple chore, but 
in the Yucca Corridor it's still a dangerous chore." 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, a Beautification Team painted over all the graffiti on the corner 
of Wilcox and Yucca. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was immaculate," said Officer Shea. "But it lasted just 36 hours. If you 
don't repaint it, dumb as it seems, it will get worse. That's the whole idea 
behind community-based policing. You at least have to keep it in check." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday night, LAPD representatives told about 60 residents that they are 
about to launch a concerted push in the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting May 5 through the first week of July, you'll see more police in this 
area than you ever have before," Officer Mark Severino told those gathered at 
the Las Palmas Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
 This will include added patrol cops, officers from the anti-gang CRASH unit, 
members of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, as well as 
undercover narcotics agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the case agent for your problem," but hardly the sole solution to the 
problem, said Severino, who works with FALCON, a multi-agency narcotics 
abatement task force comprising personnel from the LAPD, the city attorney's 
office and the Department of Building and Safety, which tries to link up with 
community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to tell me about the drug dealers on Las Palmas and Yucca. I 
can see them," Severino said. "But I don't know what goes on in your apartment 
corridors. You do. If you don't tell me or my officers, we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 He told the residents that if they don't band together, they can't win, and 
that it takes hundreds of small gestures, including replacing burned-out light 
bulbs, to make it harder for criminals to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials at the meeting got an earful from the residents about muggings 
of the elderly, inadequate security in their densely packed apartment 
buildings, too much city money spent on palm trees and not enough on 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 As the police were preparing to launch their major push, they learned of a new 
problem. On Thursday night, Joe Shea, leader of a local Neighborhood Watch 
group, told two LAPD officers in a squad car on Yucca that some 18th Street 
Gang members of his acquaintance had seemed particularly edgy lately. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers said that in recent days, a rival group, the White Fence Gang, 
had been spray-painting over 18th Street's graffiti with its WF symbol. That 
could be a sign of a gang war in the making, officers said. It is too early to 
tell for sure. Hot Spots for Violence 
</P>
<P>
 No Los Angeles neighborhood is a stranger to crime, but there are parts of the 
city where the four most serious types of violent crimes -- murder, rape, 
robbery and aggravated assault -- are particularly acute. The map below show 
the neighborhoods in each of the LAPD's four bureaus that registered the 
highest totals in 1993 for each of those crimes. Those neighborhoods, known as 
"hot target reporting districts," have come under special scrutiny in a new 
LAPD study, which is intended to identify those districts and craft strategies 
for thwarting their crime problems. Each reporting district is identified by 
its number in bold type.

ONE KILLED, 10 WOUNDED IN SHOOTOUT AMONG SUSPECTED GANG MEMBERS; CRIME: GUN 
BATTLE AT A FIRESTONE DISTRICT PARTY LASTS UP TO 20 MINUTES AND LEAVES A 
HUNTINGTON PARK WOMAN DEAD. 
</P>

<P>
 A 25-year-old woman was killed and 10 young men were wounded Saturday morning 
during a furious hail of gunfire among suspected gang members who turned a 
normally quiet Firestone district street into a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead woman was identified as Madeline Lorenzo of Huntington Park. She was 
hit in the chest and arm by stray bullets when the gunfire broke out about 
12:30 a.m. in front of a party site in the 8900 block of Fir Avenue in the 
unincorporated area north of Watts, according to sheriff's deputies. She died 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said two of the suspected gang members were hospitalized in serious 
condition with gunshot wounds and eight others were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting erupted when several cars containing suspected gang members 
pulled up in front of the party, which had attracted about 200 people, and 
fired at rivals standing in the street, deputies said. The wounded young men, 
whose names were not released, are all between the ages of 17 and 21. There 
were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said few of the party-goers were gang members, but residents 
disagreed, saying the event was a gang affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the gunplay lasted up to 20 minutes and sent residents of the 
ordinarily peaceful, tree-lined street rushing inside their houses for cover 
and diving out of their beds onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Car windshields were shattered or cracked by bullets and at least one tire was 
blown out by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrified residents spoke for the most part on the condition that they not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept shooting until the bullets ran out," said one woman who watched the 
battle out her front window. 
</P>
<P>
 She said young men hid behind cars and exchanged gunfire with those at the 
party on the other side of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fatally wounded woman fell to the street, she was surrounded by 
people who screamed that she had been hit, the witness said. But the bullets 
kept flying. 
</P>
<P>
 The onlooker said a young man hit by gunfire was picked up by another gunman, 
who threw his wounded comrade over his shoulder and disappeared into a back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," she said. "Now I'm afraid to walk outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, who on Saturday afternoon was repairing a car tire blown out 
by bullets, said that during the gunfire, "My whole family was on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly woman who lives nearby said she was asleep when the shooting broke 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to take cover," she said. "I was afraid it might come in my 
house, so I hit the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the area said that Fir Avenue has been relatively safe, but that 
there is occasional gunfire on nearby streets and that the neighborhood has 
been deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
 The party began about 6 p.m. and was still going strong after midnight when 
the shooting started, neighbors said. Young people, mostly teen-agers, were 
drinking 40-ounce bottles of beer and milling around in the front yard and 
street, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The front yard was still littered with beer cans and bottles Saturday 
afternoon, and the residents of the house refused to talk to a reporter.

RAPPER SHAKUR IS ARRESTED ON GUN CHARGE 
</P>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tupac Shakur, a rap star with a history of legal trouble, was arrested in 
Hollywood after police stopped a car and found him with a loaded gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapper-actor, who is facing felony trials in New York and Georgia, was 
arrested Friday night for investigation of having a concealed weapon, Lt. Tammy 
Tatreau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur was jailed overnight and released Saturday on $1,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found a loaded 9-millimeter pistol and less than half a gram of 
marijuana, Tatreau said. They stopped the car for allegedly traveling 45 m.p.h. 
in a 25-m.p.h. zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the car came to a halt, officers saw Shakur "reaching under the seat in 
an effort to retrieve or conceal something," Tatreau said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Maurice Harding, 26, was jailed for investigation of carrying a 
concealed weapon, which is a misdemeanor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was transferred to Parker Center for an undisclosed medical problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur, 22, starred with Janet Jackson in the movie "Poetic Justice."

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * SPEED HUMPS -- Instructed the Department of Transportation to proceed with 
installing speed humps in residential neighborhoods throughout the city in 
effort to slow down traffic. Order of installation of the speed humps -- 
smaller then speed bumps -- will be based in part on the number of accidents 
and prevailing speeds on a given street.However, before city officials consider 
an installation, three-quarters of a block's residents must approve of 
requesting it. The cost of the humps, about $2,000 each, will be shared by the 
residents of such a block. Several council members said they already have 
requests from citizens willing to pay for the installation. It is possible in 
the future that the city may pay for the humps in neighborhoods where residents 
cannot afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 * SPEED LIMITS -- Approved an ordinance raising the speed limit to 35 m.p.h. 
from 30 m.p.h. on Gateway Boulevard and on Ocean Park Boulevard between Gateway 
Boulevard and Centinela Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * HISTORIC BUILDINGS -- Approved adding three Westside buildings to the city's 
list of Historic-Cultural Monuments: the old Venice Division Police Station at 
685 Venice Blvd., a 1929 Art Deco structure in operation until 1974; the Max 
Factor Make-up Salon at 1666 N. Highland Ave., built in 1935, and the Bradbury 
House at 102 Ocean Way in Pacific Palisades. The last is a two-story adobe 
house built in 1922 that features a central courtyard modeled after the El 
Greco Museum in Toledo, Spain. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

FOR SENIORS; CHOIR LEADER'S GOSPEL: SING WITH LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "God put this choir together." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Ineze Caston explains the group of mostly older women she directs 
Tuesday mornings at the Calvary Baptist Church in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The choir could be described as multiethnic, multiracial, multicultural and 
all those other characteristics that always seem to separate people from one 
another. Caston's goal, though, is for them to sing with one voice, feeling the 
same thing at the same moment and radiating what she thinks is the most 
important thing in life: love. 
</P>
<P>
 This choir sings gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 The choir that Caston directs is a course offering at Santa Monica Emeritus 
College. There are over 40 members -- all of them women. Men occasionally 
enroll, she said, but when they see all the women they get scared off and don't 
come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, they are welcome and should see it as a good thing. It's a place 
where everyone loves each other. One of our members used to go to physical 
therapy because she has one lung, but since she joined the choir she doesn't 
have to go anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caston, who lives in South-Central Los Angeles, also leads the Caston 
Community Chorale and teaches music and Christian education at the National 
Baptist Convention, an annual gathering of Baptists from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The music and church have been a key part of her life from childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Caston, who asked that her age not be printed, was only 12 years old when she 
took over the choir at the Second Baptist Church in Riverside decades ago. 
Being the minister's daughter helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who else was going to do it?" she said. "I enjoyed it. I used to sit on three 
telephone books to play the organ." 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to marry a minister whose church didn't have gospel music. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 12, I had no difficulties leading adults," Caston recalled. "The 
fur did fly when I organized a gospel choir at (her husband's) Trinity Baptist. 
Gospel hadn't come to the West Coast. It was the late '40s. They were still 
singing hymns from Europe. The syncopation, freedom of spirit and feeling of 
gospel wasn't accepted yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Gospel is a combination of spirituals and blues. Spirituals were written by 
slaves as a way to express themselves. Many were work songs; others were 
promises of a better life to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slaves weren't able to choose their own wives and husbands," Caston said. 
"The slave owner did that to make sure they bred strong new slaves. When they 
were freed, they migrated to other parts of the country. Different life. They 
chose their husbands and wives, and love started and then came the blues. So 
the gospel music is the combination of the slave life and the free life. It's 
really the only authentic American music we have." 
</P>
<P>
 To understand gospel, Caston says, is to understand the broken heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never grasped that until after I became a minister's wife -- it's the life. 
I dropped from a soprano to a contralto," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her original gift, though, she believes, came from God, as all good things do.

 "But that don't mean that's as far as it goes. God's just saying, 'Here, take 
it and go with it.' That's why I had classical training." 
</P>
<P>
 It's all about sending a message from the best part of a person -- the soul. 
Singing what you lived. "I remember this woman in the choir, she was Jewish, 
who came up to me and asked, 'What is it that you have that I don't have? I 
want it.' And I laughed. I said, 'Keep living.' We have a lot in common. 
Everyone has a soul," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens are "the most resourceful people in the world. They have 
gotten through it," Caston said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I once saw a little child crawl up on this old lady's lap and ask her, 'What 
did you do when you were a little girl?' And the woman said, 'I lived on a big 
plantation. My mother was a slave and my father was the plantation owner. 
Northern soldiers marched right in front of me. One of them picked me up and 
asked if my father was kind to me, and I said yes. My father was sitting 
silently on a surrey swing right behind me. The soldier took out his sword and 
cut the fringes from the surrey and rode off.' Now where can you get a story 
like that? We have to start listening to older folks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caston remembers bringing in a song written by someone who was seriously ill. 
He died before writing a second verse. It was called "Hold Back the Night": 
</P>
<P>
 I'll do thy will  
</P>
<P>
 if you just say to my soul  
</P>
<P>
 please be still  
</P>
<P>
 I'll be all right  
</P>
<P>
 if you hold back the night  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the black girls and one of the Jewish girls got together and wrote a 
second verse. I sent it to his mother and told her they finished his song. It's 
so easy to be kind. My father used to say it takes more muscles to frown than 
to smile," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second verse: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Your voice speaks loud and clear  
</P>
<P>
 your arms enfold me and I have no fear  
</P>
<P>
 Take my hand and hold me tight  
</P>
<P>
 Grant me your blessings and  
</P>
<P>
 hold back the night  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She brings out the love in people. It's her living. 
</P>
<P>

 NOTE: A recent column on reporting stock sales to the IRS may have confused 
some readers.Let me elaborate. Most 1099 forms are not filed with a tax return 
and should be kept with a taxpayer's records. These include forms 1099-B, 
1099DIV, 1099-G, 1099-INT, 1099-MISC and 1099-OID. However, where income tax 
has been withheld from the payment and the taxpayer receives a 1099-R form, it 
must be filed with the tax return.

 Springer story -- Due to an error in composition, several paragraphs were 
garbled in some editions of a Page One story that appeared in The Times Orange 
County on Saturday. The story detailed the grand jury testimony of a witness in 
the Mark Hilbun murder case. Below is a reprint of the top part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 SANTA ANA -- Kim Springer says it all began so innocently, at a Fourth of July 
office outing to the Orange County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 But postal worker Mark Hilbun didn't want the evening to end. Within hours, 
the phone calls began. Then the bottled water and other odd gifts on Springer's 
doorstep. Then the love letters, followed by ones more threatening. And 
finally, she says, Hilbun left a message inviting her to bring popcorn and 
watch him commit suicide on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd follow me everywhere I'd go," Springer told the Orange County Grand Jury 
in January. "I mean, at one point it was like three or four times a day he'd 
show up. I told him to go back and do his route and deliver his mail. And once 
I slapped him. I didn't handle it very well."  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say it was Hilbun's fixation with Springer that ultimately led 
to the fired postal worker's murderous, two-day rampage across Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 6, 1993, Hilbun had come looking for Springer at the Dana Point Post 
Office when he shot and killed his best friend and wounded another postal 
worker. And before Hilbun was captured, his mother and her cocker spaniel were 
found killed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the postal facility shootings, Hilbun remained at large for several days 
until customers spotted him at a Huntington Beach bar and called police. He was 
arrested without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer was unharmed that day, and has declined to talk publicly about her 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 But grand jury transcripts recently unsealed offer the first detailed account 
of Springer's months of fear and hiding as Hilbun pursued her.

BOXING CLUB HELPS GIVE KIDS A FIGHTING CHANCE; PROGRAM: AT THE GYM, 
PARTICIPANTS PRACTICE THEIR PUNCHES -- AND LEARN ABOUT GIVING BACK TO THE 
COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jose Herrera wants a grudge match with super-lightweight boxing champ Frankie 
Randall. The problem: Jose is only 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always watch Julio Cesar Chavez -- he's my favorite boxer," said Jose, as a 
friend wrapped his hands with fabric tape. "When he lost to Frankie Randall I 
decided I'd learn to box so I could beat Randall someday. But don't tell him or 
he'll come and kick my butt." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Jose will stick to learning the basics. On Saturday, he 
showed up at 10 a.m. at an old, refurbished church in Santa Ana that opened 
last week as a boxing gym for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The after-school boxing program is part of Turning Kids On, or TKO, a 
nonprofit program for boys and girls. The program will also provide a study 
room, youth counseling and possibly arts and crafts for neighborhood children, 
said community activist and mayoral candidate John Raya. 
</P>
<P>
 Raya has worked to open the club for more than a year and a half, when the 
Santa Ana City Council first committed $25,000 to the project and negotiated a 
$1-a-year lease with Raya for the building at 1416 Bristol St. in the Mid-City 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The work paid off, Raya said Saturday, watching as about a dozen boys and 
girls practiced. They took jabs at two "speedbags," tossed medicine balls in a 
red, white and blue boxing ring and skipped over whizzing jump ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Herrera, who was at the gym with his younger brothers Danny, 10, and 
Rene, 8, watched spellbound as Raya hit a speedbag with a steady 
whapata-whapata-whap . 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I want to do," Jose said.  
</P>
<P>
 Raya's 15-year-old daughter, Shannon, also helps out. She is a pitcher on the 
Santa Ana High School softball team, and trains at the gym, coaching younger 
children to build up her own athletic endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to box with my dad," she said. "We had bags in the garage, and he'd 
get me in there to show me what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Cubanito Perez, who boxed for the lightweight world title in 1986, also is 
volunteering as a trainer. Perez, who works as a security guard, will be at the 
gym Mondays and Tuesdays. He says he wants to rearrange his work schedule to be 
there five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went down there, I saw Mr. Raya and how excited he was about the club 
and everything he wanted to do. It was really kind of contagious," Perez said. 
"I decided to go down there and try to give my all." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young coming up, I was real hyper. I got into boxing and it took 
all my energy," added Perez, 36, who has lived in Santa Ana for 15 years. "A 
lot of times kids get into trouble because they don't have anything to do. This 
club has the potential to be one of the best around." 
</P>
<P>
 A set of boxing bags is set up in the former altar area of the church. 
Children now box in a ring where church congregants used to sit. And 
weightlifting equipment now stands in the back of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 To train at the gym, participants must be enrolled in a Santa Ana school, Raya 
said, and they are encouraged to demonstrate an eagerness to take part in 
community affairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The club is open during the week from 4 to 8 p.m., and youths can show up as 
early as 9 a.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana branch of the League of United Latin American Citizens has 
agreed to be the nonprofit sponsor for the boxing club, and will enlist its own 
youth volunteers to work at the club, Raya said. 
</P>
<P>
 While money remains from the $25,000 committed by the City Council to the 
project, and everyone who works at the center is a volunteer, Raya said that it 
will take a steady fund-raising effort to keep the club open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have ongoing utility bills. We'll be looking for people to say, 'Here's 
$100. Pay your light bill,' " Raya said. "Utilities, the phone bill -- those 
are hard expenses we're going to have to raise money to cover." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers are also seeking donations of office supplies and a video monitor 
so youths can watch everything from educational videos to boxing tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Raya said he was inspired in part by memories of a boxing program at El 
Salvador Park in Santa Ana when he was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a wonderful thing," Raya said. "Athletics provide some real-life 
lessons. If we can get kids in there, help them with their homework, kind of 
broaden their expectations and show them they have the skills and the heart to 
succeed, to compete, then the obstacles life challenges them with won't seem so 
insurmountable." 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters who join must help clean the facility and grounds, and eventually, 
Raya hopes they can meet their service obligations by volunteering for other 
community groups, including neighborhood associations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want it to truly evolve into a community center. The boxing is kind of the 
hook for the kids, but there will be other things," said Raya, who hopes to 
eventually hold arts and crafts classes at the club and offer self-defense 
classes for girls.

FESTIVAL OF PRIDE; LAGUNA BEACH CELEBRATION TURNS OUT TO BE LOW-KEY EVENT, 
DESPITE DEBATE OVER ITS POTENTIAL TO MAKE CITY APPEAR TO BE MECCA FOR GAYS; 
ORGANIZERS SAY SUCCESS OF DEBUT SHOULD ASSURE FUTURE GATHERINGS 
</P>

 Some people did the two-step. Others sat nibbling rigatoni and spinach salads. 
Many more greeted old friends and sat on the grass soaking up the 
late-afternoon burst of sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday of "Laguna Pride Weekend" was decidedly low-key for an event that had 
generated heated debate among residents concerned that the gay and lesbian 
festival would turn the city into a gay mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, we can be who we are without worrying about it," said Steve Ludwig, a 
board member of Laguna Outreach, one of the groups sponsoring the event. "It's 
so refreshing, especially for people who aren't open activists." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people attended the city's first-ever gay festival, which began 
Friday night and continues today with entertainment and information booths on 
the grounds of the Festival of Arts; a street gathering at Main Street and 
South Coast Highway, and a volleyball tournament at West Street Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been other gay pride events in Orange County -- including the 
annual Orange County Cultural Pride event at the UC Irvine -- but never one in 
this seaside town with a large gay and lesbian population. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for more visibility and bridge-building between the gay and 
lesbian community and the rest of the city," said Ludwig, as he sold white, 
pink and green Pride T-shirts on the festival grounds. "It's always better when 
you can put a face to an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Developing a presence in southern Orange County wasn't the only purpose behind 
Laguna Pride Weekend. Organizers said they also want to boost business in a 
city hit by fires and floods, and provide an affirmative atmosphere for people 
who fight daily against what they say are misunderstanding and bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, a crowd gathered at the Festival of Arts grounds throughout the 
day, stopping at tables to collect literature from organizations such as PAWS: 
Helping People with AIDS Keep Their Pets; the Orange County Blade, the county's 
only gay and lesbian magazine, and the Log Cabin Club, a gay Republican group. 
</P>
<P>
 By the early afternoon, people had arrived from as far away as Ontario and 
Westchester at the festival grounds, where disc jockeys spun country and pop 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can go outside and hold hands and dance and not have to pretend we're just 
friends," said Kathy from Orange, who declined to give her last name because 
she said her lover hasn't told anyone that she is a lesbian. "This is smaller 
than other gay pride festivals I've been to, but it'll just take time before it 
gets really big." 
</P>
<P>
 Three people, carrying cardboard signs spray-painted with Bible verses and 
"Jesus Saves," turned out near the entrance of the festival grounds to stage a 
brief and quiet protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Reilly, co-chairman of the nonprofit Laguna Outreach, said he thinks the 
Pride Weekend would further promote this artists' enclave as a fashionable 
resort town for gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is fabulous. Attendance is great. I would say the chances of our having 
another one are excellent," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the pride festival said they were concerned that the weekend events 
would undermine the city's reputation as a home for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 But organizers said that presenting Laguna Beach as a place open to gays and 
lesbians would not change the city's image because the city has always been 
accepting of its gay and lesbian community. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna resident Marcy Jacklich wasn't concerned about the debate. On Saturday, 
she came to the festival with commerce on her mind, selling custom-made gift 
baskets to the crowd. She ended up having a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've met some really nice people today that I otherwise wouldn't have met," 
she said. "I support everybody in the community, whether it's the Girl Scouts 
or the Boy Scouts or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 With a sweep of her arm to encompass the small groups laughing over shared 
jokes and couples pushing children in strollers, Jacklich added: "People give a 
bad image if they do something bad. But do you see anything bad here? I don't."

THE DOGS OF WAR; VETERAN OF GUAM CRUSADE FIGHTS FOR FITTING MEMORIAL TO HEROIC 
CANINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a weathered thumb, William Putney traced on a map the route his Marines 
took through Guam during World War II and paused, tapping the spot where 25 
members of his special forces lie buried in a remote jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's no place for war heroes," Putney said. "They deserve better." 
</P>
<P>
 These fallen troops were the dogs of war: Doberman pinschers and German 
shepherds that sniffed out mines, carried messages, scouted trails and guarded 
camp during the gritty liberation of Guam in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a century later, their 73-year-old commander and medic has not forgotten 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 From his comfortable home overlooking a golf course in Woodland Hills, Putney 
wages a lonely campaign to erect a memorial to the dogs that fought alongside 
their human comrades. It's part hobby for the former Marine Corps captain, part 
obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon Putney leaned over his dining table, fingering yellowed 
photos of war dogs in light of the window. Outside, golfers in pastel shirts 
strolled silently toward the green, unnoticed as Putney relived muddy battles 
and the death of each of his dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Missy, a German shepherd, was one of the division's top messengers: smart, 
graceful and calm under fire. Putney shows a videotape of her swimming across a 
river to visitors who need to understand why dogs were used in war. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he curses her handler. Perhaps the young Marine wasn't thinking straight. 
After two weeks hunting their scattered enemy, he and the patrol of a dozen men 
were tired. Missy's handler decided to let her run ahead as a scout, something 
for which she wasn't properly trained. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found out what happened," Putney recalled, "I said things to that man 
I can't repeat." 
</P>
<P>
 The handler unclicked Missy from her leash and, instead of moving to the front 
of the patrol, she bolted toward headquarters, backtracking on her own scent, 
running fast and low with no message attached to her collar. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, another patrol brought Missy's body back to Putney, who pulled 
seven slugs from her corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 A Doberman named Kurt died of shrapnel wounds the second day of the invasion. 
There had been a break in the morning rainfall, and the dog zigzagged in front 
of 250 Marines climbing the hill above the Asan Point beachhead, searching for 
the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a crucial moment for both sides, as the Americans tried to secure a 
foothold on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt froze, indicating troops in the bushes ahead of the Marines. The Japanese 
quickly bombarded the dog with hand grenades and shot his handler, who lived. 
</P>
<P>
 When Putney received Kurt at headquarters, the dog's spine was exposed and 
several vertebrae were chipped, revealing the white spinal cord. Putney tried 
to save him by folding flesh over bone and stitching the skin back together. In 
the evening, Putney took the dog into his foxhole to watch the animal's 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kurt died late that night," Putney said. "I was so tired I put my head on him 
and went to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Bound by foxhole loyalties, the relationship between the Marines and dogs 
often transcended that of master and work animal. After the war, many handlers 
adopted their partners with the permission of the original owners. In all, 350 
dogs served on Guam, some of them transferring to other islands in the Pacific 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of Missy, Kurt and 23 others are engraved on small headstones in an 
obscure clearing 20 miles inland. The dogs originally were buried at a national 
park at Asan Beach, but officials moved them in 1963 after a typhoon wrecked 
the canine cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Putney could not find his dogs when, five years ago, he returned to Guam for 
the first time since the war. Perturbed, he went to military and local 
officials, who gave him rough directions to the jungle graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days hacking his way along tangled footpaths, he came across a 
cluster of toppled headstones, almost missing them in the waist-high grass and 
vines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a disgrace," he said with a Virginia drawl. "A disgrace and a 
dishonor." 
</P>
<P>
 Putney returned to California and wrote letters to the governor of Guam, 
veterans officials, the National Park Service, canine-related organizations and 
old war buddies, trying to enlist support for a better resting place for his 
dogs. He had retired from his veterinary practice several years earlier, and 
his life suddenly had a new focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a bit obsessed," said his wife, Betsy. "But it's fun to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Putney followed the letters with phone calls and another visit to the island. 
In his absence, a U.S. Navy nurse had taken an interest in the forgotten 
graveyard, pruning back the jungle and straightening the headstones. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurse and Putney struck up a long-distance friendship and, until her 
recent transfer back to the Mainland, she kept the clearing manicured. 
</P>
<P>
 The war dog cemetery was recently added to a map of the island's historical 
sites published by Guam's Department of Parks and Recreation, and a Japanese 
tour group began to lead occasional treks there. 
</P>
<P>
 The buried dogs have also attracted more attention from locals, said Guam Gov. 
Joseph F. Ada, whose aunt lives near the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always wondered why it was there when I was younger," Ada said. "Now the 
contribution of the dogs has been brought up more clearly. I think people are 
grateful to them for their part in the liberation and the lives they saved." 
</P>
<P>
 It is partly the sacrifice of canine for human life that makes Putney's work 
so solemn. And history gives him an imperative. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Long before Shakespeare's Antony said, "Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of 
war" in "Julius Caesar," man was sending his best friend into battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The king of Persia unleashed them on the Egyptians in the 6th Century BC. The 
Romans used them to scare and attack enemy horses, as did Napoleon. Cortez and 
Hitler sent dogs out in front of their invading armies. Both North and South 
employed guard and messenger dogs in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a part of history that is largely forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, D.C., a Vietnam veteran, Joe White, has tried in vain for 
several years to persuade the National Capital Memorial Commission to approve a 
war dog monument, undeterred by an act passed by Congress in 1986 to halt the 
spread of such memorials. 
</P>
<P>
 Putney, too, has had a hard time drumming up support from officials. His first 
proposal was to return the cemetery to the War in the Pacific National 
Historical Park at Asan Beach, where it would be accessible to the public and 
given regular care. 
</P>
<P>
 But after several years of review, the National Park Service sent a 
thumbs-down letter stating that the idea is "quite possibly against National 
Park guidelines and criteria." 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Putney said he may accept the Navy's offer of a small plot of land 
for his planned memorial at its base at Orote Point, the Americans' other 
beachhead in 1944. The logistics are set. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers from veterans groups on Guam have offered to move the headstones, 
and the United Doberman Club has agreed to pay for a life-size, bronze statue 
of a Doberman for the memorial. But it needs to happen soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Guam have invited the 55,000 U.S. troops that landed on the 
island and their families to a gala of parades and parties celebrating the 50th 
anniversary of the liberation of Guam on July 21. Putney wants the cemetery in 
plain view by then. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he misses that deadline, Putney has no intention of leaving his war 
dogs in the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have a place of honor before I crawl in my own hole," he 
said. "That's my promise to them."

HALF A MILLION TRAIN SIGHTS ON PLANES' FLIGHTS AT EL TORO; AIR SHOW: THE 
AUDIENCE OOHS AND AAHS THE DEATH-DEFYING DIPS AND DIVES OF THE PERFORMANCES, 
SAVING LOUDEST OVATION FOR THE BLUE ANGELS.

 There were old planes looping and spinning, trailing plumes of colored smoke. 
There were shiny new planes zipping overhead, ripping through the sky to make 
space for complex maneuvers. There were military planes pretending to drop 
bombs, complete with fiery explosions turning to billows of black on the 
ground. There were restored vintage planes surrounded by proud owners and 
overflowing scrapbooks. There were plastic toy planes in the clutches of dozens 
of jubilant children. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the massive, camouflage-colored C-5 Galaxy, its nose lifted to 
the air, its body open so visitors to the 44th annual El Toro Air Show could 
walk through and grab a peek. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, there were 160 planes on display Saturday, another 40 or so flying 
around, at the air show, drawing a crowd of about 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the names of all the planes here," said 12-year-old Jeremy Thacker of 
Buena Park, whose favorites are the A-10 Warthog and F-10 fighters. This was 
Jeremy's ninth air show with his father, Robert, a computer operator. On 
Saturday, Robert Thacker said simply: "It gets better every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a cloud cover that chilled the morning and kept the planes flying low, 
Thacker's comments were a common sentiment on the base Saturday as thousands of 
devotees settled in for the patriotic celebration of military techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 They came on bicycles and motorcycles, in trucks and trailers, pushing 
strollers and little red wagons. They came toting lawn chairs, plastic picnic 
tables and tents. They came waving flags and wearing badges, in uniforms 
ranging from the Boy Scouts to cheerleaders to the Civil Air Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was our first time, but we can't miss it now," said Jim Wronski of 
Orange, who pedaled to the show with his wife on their custom, two-seater 
recumbent bike, which they had painted blue and gold to match the air show 
colors. "It's like a carnival, an old-fashioned get-together. It's a lot of 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, but it's also a lot of work. 
</P>
<P>
 It took about 250 Marines to set up chairs, plastic fences, bleachers and 
concession stands in a 48-hour blitz before the first planes hit the runway 
Friday, said Larry Mutz, a consultant from Tennessee who has helped run the 
show since 1980. After the show repeats itself today from 9 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. 
-- gates open at 7 a.m. -- that phalanx of personnel will return to clean the 
place up. 
</P>
<P>
 On duty during the show are 1,000 Marines, plus 100 civilians, Mutz said. That 
includes the 40-person crash crew that is on standby the entire time. 
</P>
<P>
 For the huge crowds there are 450 portable toilets and 250 concession stands. 
Scattered throughout the base are some 2,500 trash cans -- and they are filled 
and emptied, 10 times each, each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutz doesn't get much sleep in the days before the show, but as the planes 
buzzed overhead Saturday afternoon, he said, "I don't feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The adrenaline kicks in," Mutz said. "When I look down, and see a kid looking 
up, it just makes my day." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of kids were looking up all day long as the stunts seemed to get 
more and more spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, there was Lori Lynn Ross, walking on the wings of a World War 
II-era UPF-7 WACO as pilot Jim Franklin turned the plane -- and Ross -- upside 
down. After lunch, there was the Navy Seals "Leapfrog" team, sailing through 
the air in blue-and-gold parachutes and landing only a few yards in front of 
the crowd. Then came Team American, a trio of aerobatic flight pilots, 
featuring the miraculous return to the air of a Marine who was nearly killed 
six years ago when his plane crashed at the El Toro Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
 "You fall off the horse, you get back on the horse," Col. Jerry Cadick 
shrugged as he prepared for his flight Saturday. "Flying fighters is not 
risk-free -- we all know that. I need (flying), just about how I need food and 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 After 25 years in the Marine Corps, including two in Vietnam, Cadick, now 51, 
was flying an F/A-18 fighter jet during the 1988 show when he went down. 
</P>
<P>
 His face was smashed, set back about an inch. Five ribs snapped, a vertebrae 
exploded. Both legs broken, one ankle crushed completely, the other fractured. 
And a collapsed lung. "Other than that," he joked Saturday, "I was unhurt." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure I know why I'm (alive) -- neither do the doctors or anyone 
else," he said. "It's just pure luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the program was full of air show stars from around the nation, the 
biggest crowd pleaser was saved for last: the elite Navy Blue Angels. With 
their six custom-painted F/A-18 Hornets parked at center stage throughout the 
show, the Angels earned an ovation just for taxiing slowly down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just the most amazing people ever. Everything they do is amazing," 
said Kim Borio, 20, a lifeguard from San Clemente. Wearing a blue sequined 
bikini top with white stars, Borio bounded up to the Angels before they took 
flight, begging them to pose for a picture, then sat cross-legged in the front 
row during their act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming here since I was 5 years old," she said. "It's a big outdoor 
party."

TROUBLES DOG DANA POINT CITY ATTORNEY; GOVERNMENT: JERRY PATTERSON'S RETIREMENT 
BENEFITS DRAW CRITICISM AND COULD AFFECT COUNCIL RACE. BUT A DRUNK-DRIVING 
ARREST, REDUCED TO LESSER CHARGE THURSDAY, IS BEHIND HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The past few months have not been kind to Dana Point City Atty. Jerry 
Patterson, a former congressman whose wife is running for county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he was arrested Dec. 15 for alleged drunk driving, a charge that was 
reduced Thursday to reckless driving -- but only after weeks of negative 
coverage in local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last week, two residents at a public meeting at Dana Point City Hall 
demanded Patterson's resignation for collecting $11,000 a year from the city 
toward retirement benefits, even though he is a private attorney on retainer to 
the city and not a city employee. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice is perfectly legal, but Patterson's benefits were news to 
Councilman William L. Ossenmacher, who called for a city report on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson -- whose wife, Linda Moulton-Patterson, is mayor of Huntington 
Beach, a member of the California Coastal Commission and a supervisorial 
candidate -- acknowledges both cases are embarrassing, although he says he is 
innocent of any major wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd very much like not to have this become an issue," said Patterson, with a 
chuckle born of frustration, not amusement. "To remove this as an issue, I'm 
willing to offer to pay for my share of the benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is election time in Dana Point, the only city in the county to hold its 
City Council race in June. And it appears that Patterson's benefits will be, 
rightly or wrongly, dragged into a fray that could become heated, said City 
Councilman Mike Eggers, who is not seeking reelection after six years on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggers -- who supports Patterson, the only city attorney 5-year-old Dana Point 
has ever had -- said the benefits issue is a tempest in a teapot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's campaign season, what we call 'silly season,' " said Eggers of the 
pre-election weeks. "People are just looking for an issue. . . . There is 
nothing back door, back room or illegal about this at all." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the people who called for an inquiry was Addison DeBoi, a candidate for 
City Council in the election next month. DeBoi said he would like to see a full 
report before voicing an opinion on Patterson's retirement fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson's troubles began while driving through Newport Beach to his 
Huntington Beach home in the pre-dawn hours of Dec. 15. He admits he was tired 
when he was stopped on East Coast Highway for speeding and running a red light. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson failed a field sobriety test and was arrested on drunk-driving 
charges, which he insists was not the case. A breath test at the Newport Beach 
police station showed Patterson's blood-alcohol level to be .08%, illegal under 
California law. A blood test 50 minutes later showed his blood-alcohol at .07%, 
a legally permissible level. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said he was not driving drunk. "At a maximum, I had three glasses of 
wine over a period of time. I was surprised they pursued it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea agreement, Patterson this week pleaded guilty to reckless driving, 
for which he will pay a fine of $400. 
</P>
<P>
 But the benefits issue will linger, said Dennis Vlach, an eight-year Dana 
Point resident and former city traffic commissioner who called for Patterson's 
resignation last week. Vlach, who is not running for any elected office, said 
he plans "to keep hammering on this and keep it an issue at every City Council 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably all legal, but I think it's unethical," said Vlach, a 
firefighter for the city of Los Angeles who lives in Dana Point. "His firm 
contracts from the city. The firm brings in more than $500,000 a year from the 
city and now he wants an additional $11,000 for retirement." 
</P>
<P>
 Ossenmacher does not like the city's participation in the arrangement, period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry Patterson is not by any stretch of the imagination an employee of our 
city, so as far as I'm concerned he's not entitled to benefits," Ossenmacher 
said. "Here we are, paying out a tremendous amount of money to an independent 
firm, and then I find out we're paying his retirement. Maybe it's time we look 
at hiring an in-house attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, 59, is an attorney with the Costa Mesa-based municipal law firm 
Burke, Williams and Sorensen, which is employed by the city as an independent 
contractor. Last year, the city of Dana Point paid more than $684,000 to the 
firm for its services. 
</P>
<P>
 The city pays the firm $6,300 a month as a retainer, which covers the first 60 
hours of work by attorneys. After that, the city is charged $125 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Contract city attorneys may be, and often are, placed on a city's retirement 
plan, according to Michael Ogata, public affairs officer for the Public 
Employees Retirement System, or PERS, the state system that covers about 1 
million active members and retirees from public agencies and school systems. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 1, however, the law will change. Attorneys like Patterson under 
contract to public agencies currently have the option of electing to be part of 
PERS. But after July 1, each City Council must approve the arrangement, Ogata 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new law is not retroactive and will not apply to Patterson, who has 
been on PERS for a total of 17 years in various cities and communities. 
Patterson's career includes stints as attorney for several Orange County cities 
and as an instructor at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only last October, however, that Patterson elected to continue his 
retirement plan in Dana Point because he was no longer on a plan anywhere else, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Dana Point has a more lucrative policy for paying retirement benefits than 
most cities. The city pays for Patterson's contribution to the fund as well as 
the employer's share, a total of $11,000 a year. Patterson said he is willing 
to pay for his share of the retirements benefits in order to end the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our policy. Some cities do it this way, some don't, but probably more 
do," said Dana Point City Manager Stephen B. Julian. "In some cases, employees 
have negotiated this instead of a salary increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Julian said he thinks it is unfair to single out Patterson for his retirement 
package because "he is only taking advantage of something that is clearly being 
permitted."

LITTLE SAIGON'S 'DAY OF ANGUISH'; A COMMUNITY RECALLS 19TH ANNIVERSARY OF FALL 
OF ITS NAMESAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nineteen years after the collapse of South Vietnam, hundreds of demonstrators 
gathered in Little Saigon Saturday morning to mark the loss of their homeland 
with a bitter memorial they call "the Day of Anguish." 
</P>
<P>
 As protesters marched along Brookhurst Street, the gunmetal-gray skies were 
filled with the buzz of six small airplanes towing banners emblazoned with 
Vietnamese slogans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to remind people that we have to take back our country from 
Communism. And we wanted to show that Vietnamese people will always remember 
that day in 1975," said Ban Bui, the president of the Vietnamese Community of 
Southern California, which helped organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Police estimated that more than 300 people participated in the march, which 
drew spectators such as former Vietnamese prisoner of war Qui Dang of Stanton. 
Dang, who was a commanding officer in the Vietnamese army, moved here only a 
year ago after he was imprisoned for 13 years in a Communist jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very upset about it and depressed when he talks about the Communists," 
said his wife, Quang Dang. "He always cries. He never stopped fighting for 
freedom, for human rights, for Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration, which started about 11 a.m., was orderly, according to 
police, who added that they did receive complaints about the small airplanes, 
which were flying so low that residents could read the tail numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 At midnight, the Vietnamese Community of Southern California -- a recently 
revived political and social organization -- scheduled a second memorial to end 
the anniversary with songs and prayers.

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
BERGESON UN-ENDORSES REPUBLICAN MOORLACH FOR DISCREDITING CITRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early withdrawal: State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) has withdrawn 
her endorsement of Republican accountant John Moorlach, who is battling to oust 
longtime Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, the only Democrat holding a 
countywide elective office. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson said she feels Moorlach is a good candidate and has a solid, 
professional background, but is worried that his statements on the campaign 
trail about Citron's investment strategies could hurt Orange County. She 
worries that some of Moorlach's questions threaten to tarnish the county's 
credit rating on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I'm going to stay out of it," says Bergeson, who is retiring 
from the Legislature this year and is running unopposed for a seat on the Board 
of Supervisors. "I don't think it's right to be involved in something that 
could be detrimental to the county." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No stand: Two of the powerful Lincoln Club's most influential members--Buck 
Johns and George Argyros--have jumped to the forefront of a petition drive to 
put the question of a commercial airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station on 
the November ballot. But as signatures are being gathered, the club itself is 
quietly remaining neutral on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 After lengthy discussions, the club's executive board has decided not to take 
a stand--yet, says President Doy Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, we talked quite a lot about it. It's without question a major, major 
issue facing this county," Henley says. "As time marches on, we either will 
take a position or not take a position. . . . Who knows what will happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 The delicate problem for the club is that its members from South County are 
just as adamantly against an airport at El Toro as Johns and Argyros and its 
North County members are for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned about people who are both pro and con on the issue," Henley 
says. "Just as our club does not get involved in primary campaigns because 
they're divisive, this is in a similar category." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Signing on: Meanwhile, the signature gathering to get the airport on the 
ballot continues, and the initiative backers are "about halfway there," says 
Dave Ellis, a Newport Beach political consultant who is working with Argyros 
and Johns. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a spot on the November ballot, 67,000 signatures must be collected. 
Ellis says about 30,000 voters had already signed by early last week. To be 
sure of having enough, organizers hope to have 90,000 signatures by June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis also says they have nearly reached their fund-raising goal of $100,000. 
Business people are eagerly committing money to the project, he says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Public disclosure: The issue of personal income taxes is becoming a hot one in 
the wild Republican primary race in the 70th Assembly District, where 
candidates Tom Reinecke, Marilyn Brewer and Barry J. Hammond are slugging it 
out for the seat being vacated by Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 After insisting that Brewer has been making taxes an issue, Reinecke last week 
issued a challenge to all the candidates in the race to make public their 
personal income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond could not be reached for comment, but Brewer retaliated by contending 
that Reinecke was "grandstanding" and that he had misquoted her. Brewer did not 
say that the candidates' taxes should be looked at, as Reinecke suggested she 
had, but only that "I pay the most taxes of any candidate in the race" because 
of her large, family-owned business that pays employment and property taxes, 
according to her son, Lance A. Brewer, who acted as her spokesman. But he 
declined to make public her tax statements. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out by the end of the week, Reinecke's "challenge" wound up 
falling somewhat short. He released his 1992 income tax returns, but not his 
1993. Reason? He filed an extension before the April 15 deadline because they 
weren't prepared, according to a spokesman. UPCOMING EVENTS

RALPHS FAMILY WANTS TO SELL TOWN OF GORMAN

 This little town that travelers and truckers know as a place to grab a bite to 
eat or let overheated motors cool off while going over the Grapevine on the 
Golden State Freeway is going on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 The family that has owned the town -- which includes a motel, fast-food 
restaurant, coffee shop, bar, grocery store and gas station, not to mention a 
ranch of over 3,000 acres -- for six generations wants to give it all up. 
</P>
<P>
 The price: a mere $13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The sellers: the Ralphs family, of supermarket fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The properties have been grouped into five packages, which can be sold 
separately. Or all of them can be snapped up all at once by a single, very high 
roller. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lovely community," said Cecilia De Fazio, 61, a member of the 
Ralphs family who grew up there. "This is a beautiful place to raise children. 
I raised two of my own here." 
</P>
<P>
 Three generations of the family still live at the ranch, where they raise 
cattle and horses and tend peach orchards. 
</P>
<P>
 De Fazio, who was interviewed by telephone at the family's Gorman Coffee Shop, 
said when the property is sold she would miss her friends in the community and 
"all the nice people who come through here" while traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the family wants to sell the property, her voice cracked and she 
said only: "The time has come when most of us begin to realize that there might 
be other options. It is all for personal reasons."

SANTA ANA MAN HELD IN MURDER OF WOMAN, 71; CRIME: THE VICTIM WAS FOUND 
BLUDGEONED TO DEATH IN THE BEDROOM OF HER APARTMENT IN A HIGH-SECURITY COMPLEX. 
HER FRIGHTENED NEIGHBORS WONDER HOW KILLER GOT IN.

<P>
 Police have arrested a man on suspicion of bludgeoning a 71-year-old woman to 
death in the bedroom of her apartment in a high-security complex for senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dean Owens, 30, of Santa Ana was arrested late Friday night. He was 
being held without bail Saturday at the Orange County Jail on suspicion of 
murdering Patricia Hamilton Powell, Sgt. John Dittus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell's battered body was found about 9 a.m. Thursday in her apartment in the 
Wycliffe Plaza senior citizen complex on North Flower Street. The cause of 
death was blunt force trauma to the upper body and head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who did not disclose the weapon used in the attack, found no signs of 
a break-in, but noted signs of a struggle leading from the living room to the 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to the building -- which is surrounded by lush lawns, ferns and a fence 
of high, pointed black steel bars -- is restricted. Residents have keys that 
cannot be duplicated. Guests must punch in access codes to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some still wonder how Powell's killer slipped into her apartment on the 10th 
floor. "She was very security conscious," said her son-in-law, Frank Scanlan. 
"She never let strangers in unless they could prove who they were." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, residents of the senior citizen housing complex pointed out signs 
newly placed on their front door that read: "Do not admit anyone -- This means 
you!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us are pretty nervous," said Jacqueline Lehmann, 74, who walked out 
of the door of the 12-story building Saturday morning carrying a stack of mail. 
"We love it here. It has very good security. Yet I caught two little boys 
playing on the lawn (inside the complex) once. How did they get in?" 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents said they were not frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sure (Powell) let him in," said a resident who did not want her name 
used. "I think she knew him." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, a witness who is part of the building's volunteer 
security force went to Powell's apartment about 1:30 a.m. Thursday when her 
smoke detector went off. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness said he found a young man -- now believed to be Owens -- in the 
apartment, who explained that he had burned something in the kitchen, police 
said. The witness then left, believing the young man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police could not confirm Saturday whether Owens knew Powell or anyone else in 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Owens was also wanted on an unrelated warrant outside Santa Ana, 
but they did not specify why the warrant had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell was one of the first women in California to join the U.S. Marines 
during wartime, Scanlan said. She worked in the U.S. Marines' postal system at 
Camp Pendleton during World War II and moved to Santa Ana in the mid-1970s, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by her daughter, Claudia, and her grandchildren, Debra 
Johnson, Tiffany Trujillo and Eric and Sean Scanlan.

RED LETTER DAY FOR 30 SPELLING-BEE COMPETITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Joe Beltran and Alexandria Avalos live in East Los Angeles' Ramona Gardens and 
are in the same second-grade classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But here the two friends were Saturday afternoon in unfamiliar surroundings, 
the busy Panorama Mall, trying to keep their thinking caps on straight and 
carry home a prize from the finals of the first citywide spelling bee for 
children from large housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Breezing through words such as escape , magnet , clearing and false , Joe, a 
soft-spoken 7-year-old, crossed his fingers nervously as he four times 
misspelled words, missing chances to eliminate Alexandria. Then Alexandria, who 
said she had practiced "really hard and took an extra long shower" that 
morning, had Joe on the ropes once, but missed boast . 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Joe ended the suspense by correctly spelling act , the 32nd word in 
their head-to-head tussle. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Matute, senior case manager at San Fernando Gardens in Pacoima, couldn't 
have been happier with the competition. The event began with 30 elementary 
school contestants who represented five housing projects in three grade-level 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his brainchild a few months ago to run spelling bees at the housing 
projects -- Ramona and San Fernando Gardens as well as Nickerson Gardens in 
South-Central Los Angeles, Rancho San Pedro in San Pedro and Mar Vista Gardens 
in Culver City -- and bring together finalists from each for a face-off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Housing projects have a stigma in the general population as places where all 
you have are drugs and gangs," Matute said. "But we have a lot of good, working 
people and very intelligent kids. These kids just need opportunities in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, little Joe Beltran "reads night and day," according to his 
mother, Oralia Almanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandria Avalos' father, Alex, is a teacher at the Main Street School in 
South-Central Los Angeles. "This is a very nice idea," he said. "She doesn't 
get to go out a lot, and the bus trip was something to look forward to." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Reyes, a Los Angeles Housing Authority official, told the crowd of 
parents and children that the department hopes to make this an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Ramona Gardens student, Ricky Rodriquez, 9, won the category for 
third- and fourth-graders. Rodriguez, who especially likes karate books and 
ghost stories, correctly spelled decision and obedience.  
</P>
<P>
 Eva Arias, 11, of Rancho San Pedro, a lover of mysteries and funny rhymes, 
captured the prize among fifth- and sixth-graders by spelling advertisement and 
blunder.  
</P>
<P>
 The winners received sets of books and $50 in gift certificates from the 
Panorama Mall. All the finalists got medallions to hang around their necks and 
free treats at the mall's McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a great idea," said DeEtte Bell of Nickerson Gardens, whose 
8-year-old daughter, Lanesha Taylor, was among the competitors.

COWBOYS TAKE THEIR LUMPS BEFORE CROWD'S CHEERS AND JEERS; CONEJO VALLEY DAYS: 
RODEO AND MARCHING BANDS AND FLOATS BRING OUT THOUSANDS ON THE FOURTH DAY OF 
THE FIVE-DAY EVENT. 
</P>

<P>
 More than 3,000 people crowded into the rodeo arena at Conejo Valley Days on 
Saturday, where bucking bulls and rope-twirling cowboys brought a true Western 
flavor to the area's annual country-Western festival. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rodeo and a morning parade down Thousand Oaks Boulevard highlighted the 
fourth day of the five-day Conejo Valley Days carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 At the rodeo, about 60 professional cowboys took their licks in events such as 
bareback bronc riding, steer wrestling, team roping and bull riding as overflow 
crowds cheered and jeered during every second of every ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in this area love the rodeo because it brings out in them the sense of 
their Western heritage," said Alan Guggenheim, chairman of the rodeo event. 
"These are horse people and ranch people in the Conejo Valley, so they can 
appreciate the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the spectators came dressed in full Western gear, sporting ten-gallon 
hats, boots and blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even knew a lot about rodeos. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real good showing for a rodeo," said Matthew Weeks, 21, of Simi 
Valley. "They've got good animals that know how to buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can ride them, then this is a bust," he said, noting that few of the 
riders, ropers and wrestlers were able to gain control of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 In several cases after the chute burst open and the bull stormed into the 
arena, the cowboys were thrown to the ground almost immediately. That might be 
the norm for most rodeos, but some area residents said they had hoped to see 
the rides last a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to see them really ride those bulls," spectator Lisa Thorrilson said. 
"This year they didn't quite live up to how things went last year. It wasn't 
quite as exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 But most on hand left the show smiling, happy to have seen the animals, the 
clowns and a local horseback drill team, the Conejo Riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really is a crowd-pleaser," said Jeff Casey, a member of the Rotary Club 
sponsoring the event. "You could see it just by looking at the kids' faces." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Saturday, hundreds of people lined Thousand Oaks Boulevard under 
overcast skies to watch Conejo Valley Days parade participants march, gallop, 
drive and float their way down Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Onlookers applauded local marching bands, sang along with musical performers 
on floats, and cheered area firefighters who six months ago fought a ferocious 
wildfire just a few miles from the parade route. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not staged, it's not produced and it's a little bit hokey, but it is a 
bunch of people having a whole lot of fun," Thousand Oaks resident Dianna 
Campbell said. "It's nice to have a hometown parade." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, such as longtime Thousand Oaks residents Joe and Lilly Mendolla, the 
parade is a can't-miss event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've sat at the same spot every year since 1968," said Joe Mendolla, who 
this year brought his 2-year-old granddaughter, Megan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love everything about it -- the horses, the floats and seeing all the 
important people," Joe Mendolla said. "This really brings the whole community 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, found the parade a tad mundane. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got parades just like this where I'm from," said Wolfgang Horster of 
Stuttgart, Germany, who was visiting a friend in Thousand Oaks and stopped 
briefly to check out the parade. "You've seen one, you've seen them all." 
</P>
<P>
 But most parade-goers appeared delighted with this year's effort, despite the 
fact that it was slightly smaller than previous years' parades. 
</P>
<P>
 People cheered loudly for a cyclist on an old-fashioned bike, for a cadre of 
Vietnam War veterans and for a man who carefully traversed the parade route 
standing atop two horses that walked side-by-side. 
</P>
<P>
 Other entrants danced to country-Western music on the flatbeds of trucks, 
while local politicians chose the luxury of classic cars to make their way down 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only problem with being in the parade is that you don't get to see it," 
Thousand Oaks Mayor Elois Zeanah said. "But it's such a great day for the city. 
I just love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Days organizers said they hoped the parade would increase 
interest in the carnival, which had faltering attendance its first two nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a key day," said Gary Heathcote, chairman of the Conejo Valley 
Chamber of Commerce, which stages the carnival. "We're looking for the parade 
to bring everyone out so we can make up for the first two days." 
</P>
<P>
 While the attendance numbers from Saturday were not available, the park was 
full and even in the late afternoon cars lined up for about a mile to enter the 
venue at the Moorpark Freeway and Janss Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's attendance figures showed considerable increases from the previous 
two days, with 9,257 people taking in the event. That was up from 7,577 people 
on the third day of the 1993 festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the last day of the festival.

VIOLENCE IN L.A.: THE LAPD REPORTS; 'HOT SPOTS' RESIDENTS AWARE OF RISKS; 
CRIME: THOSE WHO CALL TROUBLED AREAS HOME WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE DANGERS LONG

 The Los Angeles Police Department did not need to tell Traci Cummings that the 
coffeehouse on Ventura Boulevard where she works is smack in the middle of a 
street robbery "hot spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Police Department only a few days ago released reports detailing 
the problems with the part of Ventura Boulevard stretching from White Oak 
Avenue on the east to Vanalden Avenue on the west, Cummings said she knew about 
the area's dangers -- her boyfriend was robbed outside her workplace a few 
months back.  
</P>
<P>
 "I work with only other women and I just know I'm a target," Cummings said. 
"Our corporate office told us to watch out. Every time someone comes in, you 
look and you're ready to roll out of there if you have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that crime has decreased in the San Fernando Valley over the 
past few years, pockets of criminal activity persist and have gotten worse. 
Crime analyses released by police for the five Valley-based divisions on Friday 
don't mean a whole lot, some Valley residents said; people who live in the "hot 
spot" areas identified by the department are well aware of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Reyes, 71, a retired grocer who has lived in a small house at the corner 
of Tampa Avenue and Parthenia Street for the past 35 years, offered a virtual 
crime log of his neighborhood, detailing what had happened where. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had one person killed right there," he said, pointing to a corner across 
the street. "Another person died at that corner after being stabbed." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes lives a couple of blocks south of the Northridge Fashion Center, which 
was identified as one of three trouble spots in the Devonshire Division because 
high pedestrian and vehicle traffic "attracts the criminal element," the report 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The police reporting district that includes the mall logged 31 robberies and 
29 aggravated assaults in 1993. By comparison, a district in Van Nuys reported 
208 aggravated assaults for the year, the highest in the Valley; the highest 
number of robberies, 119, occurred in a neighborhood in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reyes added that although he has seen crime increase dramatically in his 
neighborhood during the past 10 years, the situation is not as bad now as it 
was a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 More security fences have been placed around apartments, Reyes said, and there 
appears to be more police on patrol. He added, however, that drug dealers and 
other criminals still lurk in the streets and alleys near his house. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Reyes' house marks the border between two distinct communities 
near the mall. North of Parthenia Street, on Tampa Avenue, residents pay high 
rents and mortgages to live next to the newer businesses where they work and 
shop.  
</P>
<P>
 On the south side, particularly to the east, buildings are run-down, protected 
with iron bars, covered with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Coon, manager of Rosie's BBQ & Grillery, said a driver was robbed 
while making a delivery to a residence south of Parthenia a year and a half ago 
and employees are now allowed to decide whether to take food to that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably wouldn't go," said Jeff Bennett, a delivery driver for the 
restaurant. "It's not a good area." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the two police reporting districts that include that neighborhood had 
65 robberies, 121 assaults and three murders during 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents south of Parthenia Street agreed that some criminals live in their 
neighborhood. But they said the residents are not responsible for all that goes 
on there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only this area, because a lot of gangs live outside the area," said 
Nicholas Chavez, 32, who lives on Chase Street. "What they do is come down to 
this area and commit crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Gross, who manages the Ridgegate Apartments across from the mall on 
Tampa, said the shopping center is a blessing because it attracts tenants. But, 
she added, several times a year people involved in crimes at the mall run 
across the street and try to hide in the gated complex. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I have apartments over here with windows facing out toward the mall," Gross 
said. "I have a lot of little old ladies living in them, calling me and saying, 
'Why are there police cars out there?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Only one business was singled out as a crime hot spot in the LAPD reports. The 
West Valley Division noted that the Canoga House Motor Hotel at 7435 Winnetka 
Ave. attracted prostitutes and drug activity.  
</P>
<P>
 Just inside the door from a banner advertising "Weekly Rates," a hotel desk 
clerk behind 1 1/2-inch thick, bullet-proof glass acknowledged that the motor 
lodge has had its share of problems. She said she frequently calls police 
herself to ask them to come and calm disturbances among the guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk, who asked not to be named, said a new owner had lost the hotel's 
AAA rating a few years back. Although she said she could not comment on the 
specifics in the LAPD report about the hotel, she said that the quality of the 
clientele varies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are people wanting to get back on their feet, some are business people 
coming through, some are just people from the street," she said. "What can I 
tell you?" 
</P>
<P>
 She said she could weed out the unsavory guests -- if building management 
would be willing to lose their business. For the clerk, remedying the problem 
at her hotel is more straightforward than stopping robberies on Ventura 
Boulevard or elsewhere in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have a local address, usually there's trouble. If you live here what 
do you want a room here for?" 
</P>
<P>
 People in other Valley hot spots said combatting crime is not so simple, even 
if the problem is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 6 feet 3, 200 pounds -- not small," said Derek Lipman, who was robbed by 
a group of young men when he went to pick up his girlfriend at a Ventura 
Boulevard coffee shop in Tarzana. "If these guys would be willing to go after 
me, then they would go after anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime in this area," he said, "has been building for years."

HUNTINGTON BEACH MAN ARRESTED IN KIDNAPING; ABDUCTION: HE ALLEGEDLY DRAGGED A 
WOMAN INTO HIS CAR, MASTURBATED AS HE DROVE AND THEN RELEASED HER, POLICE SAID. 
HE WAS CAUGHT AFTER CALLING TO ASK IF HE COULD MEET HER AGAIN.

<P>
 A 35-year-old man was arrested after he allegedly dragged a woman into his 
car, masturbated a he drove for 10 minutes and then let her out of the car, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Dwayne Ingram of Huntington Beach was arrested Friday on suspicion of 
kidnaping and indecent exposure after he called the woman at work and asked to 
meet her again, Westminster police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The abduction occurred when the 19-year-old woman was walking to work on Beach 
Boulevard, just south of the San Diego Freeway. Police said that Ingram pulled 
alongside her in a beige Toyota about 8:30 p.m. Friday. Believing the man 
wanted to ask her a question, the woman walked to the car, Sgt. Dwight Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when the driver pulled her into the passenger seat and drove to a 
nearby freeway on-ramp, Moore said. As he drove, the man masturbated and asked 
the woman -- whose name was not released -- questions about herself, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who called himself Kenny, then drove the woman to work near the site 
where he picked her up, authorities said. Ingram allegedly called the woman at 
work about two hours later and asked if he could meet her. She agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wha Ingram did not know was that the woman called Westminster police, who set 
up surveillance in the area, authorities said. When Ingram arrived in a silver 
Nissan, police arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 A notebook found in his possession indicates he may have had similar 
encounters with other women, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram was booked at the Orange County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail, jail 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about similar incidents is asked to contact 
Westminster Police Investigator Tom Green at (714) 898-3315, Ext. 306.

 On the floor of the upper house, a senator launches into a harangue about 
Charles Manson profiting off his murderous crimes by selling song lyrics and 
demands repeal of the statute that would allow such an outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 As he campaigns for office, an assemblyman lambastes Manson follower Tex 
Watson, charging that the same statute gave Watson the right to conjugal visits 
with his wife, during which he fathered three children while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the politicians' ire is the "inmates bill of rights," a statute 
dating back to Ronald Reagan's tenure as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year when baseball analogies are used as answers to crime, the inmates 
bill of rights is a hanging curve -- and politicians are slamming it up and 
down the state. It has become the stuff of sound bites, headlines and talk 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gov. Pete Wilson's support, lawmakers are working to rid the state penal 
code of a law they say allows imprisoned child molesters, rapists and murderers 
to receive hard-core pornography, wear their hair as they choose, and sue over 
such slights as food that is too high in cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers for prisoners, and some state lawyers, have doubts that the 
statute's repeal will end many of the most often cited abuses. Court decisions 
in recent decades have affirmed that many prisoners' rights are protected by 
the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons behind the impending demise of the inmates bill of rights are 
many, some tied to the campaign season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, seeking reelection on an anti-crime platform, has made the statute's 
repeal a priority. Two bills to do away with the statute are being carried by 
Assemblyman Dean Andal (R-Stockton) and state Sen. Robert Presley 
(D-Riverside). They are running against each other for a State Board of 
Equalization seat. 
</P>
<P>
 But the movement to gut the statute goes beyond electioneering. The prison 
guards union, an aggressive and well-financed lobby in Sacramento, is 
supporting the repeal effort, as are crime victims groups. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prison population grows beyond 120,000 inmates, California Department 
of Corrections officials say it is more costly to provide benefits required by 
the bill of rights, such as the right of mentally ill prisoners to have court 
hearings before they are forced to take antipsychotic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Corrections attorney Pam Smith-Steward also fears that in time, 
courts could interpret the statute so broadly that the 7,000 prisoners who work 
for the Prison Industry Authority making blue jeans, furniture, license plates 
and other products could receive minimum wage of $4.25. As it is, they make an 
average of 55 cents an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Buried 586 pages deep in the California Penal Code, the inmates bill of rights 
is brief, only 52 words. In a single paragraph, it says that a person sentenced 
to prison arrives with the same rights as everyone else. Any narrowing of 
rights must be directly related to the prison's safe operation, and be the 
least restrictive alternative possible. 
</P>
<P>
 A companion statute lists prisoners' specific rights, among them, the right to 
marry, make wills, correspond confidentially with lawyers, own property and 
receive publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Prisoner rights lawyers say most of the rights listed in the statutes are 
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. But state lawyers say court rulings have 
forced California to give prisoners far more than is required by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (California) law says we may only restrict inmate rights if we can show a 
security link," Smith-Steward said. "It isn't right. It's insidious." 
</P>
<P>
 Although California is the only state with an inmates bill of rights, many 
states give prisoners rights beyond what is required by the U.S. Constitution. 
New York allows conjugal visits. Oregon pays prison workers minimum wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The origins of the inmates bill of rights date to Reagan's first term as 
governor. Red Nelson, then the nail-hard warden of San Quentin, recalls 
approaching Reagan at a reception early in 1967. As they chatted, Reagan asked 
Nelson what he thought of one of the issues of the day: Should inmates be 
granted overnight visits with their spouses? 
</P>
<P>
 It was an innovative concept. Some prison officials believed that the program 
would end homosexuality in prisons, and serve as a reward for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a horrendous idea," Nelson said, and he recalls telling the 
governor so. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan did not take Nelson's counsel. In 1968, he authorized conjugal visits 
as an experiment at one prison, and allowed prison officials to expand the 
policy systemwide in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in a period where people thought they're not bad boys," Nelson said. 
"That was the style. There was no stopping it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, state Sen. Alan Sieroty, a liberal from Los Angeles' Westside, teamed 
up with the Friends Committee on Legislation, a Quaker lobbying organization, 
and proposed the legislation that first came to be known as the inmates bill of 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Wilson, an assemblyman from San Diego, voted for it. So did George 
Deukmejian, then a state senator from Long Beach. Reagan signed it into law. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, politically active lawyers were attacking every aspect of the 
prison system, from restrictions on what inmates could read to indeterminate 
sentencing, which resulted in terms of up to life for even minor crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was a time of political and racial unrest inside the prisons. George 
Jackson, serving time for robbery, published "Soledad Brother" and emerged as a 
leader of the Black Panthers, and a hero of leftist reformers and 
revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Accused of killing a prison guard at Soledad, Jackson was moved to the highest 
security block in the prison system, the Adjustment Center at San Quentin. In a 
visit, a gun was smuggled to Jackson in August, 1971, setting off the worst 
riot in California prison history. Jackson was shot to death, and three 
officers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. became governor in 1974, he brought with him 
some of the lawyers who had been suing the prisons. Sieroty and the Quakers saw 
a chance to expand the inmates bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitudes were so much different in those days," said Sieroty, who 
retired from the Legislature in 1982. "There was a feeling that prison reform 
was a worthwhile thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brown was skeptical of Sieroty's bill, an aide to the then-governor 
recalled that Corrections Department chief Ray Procunier urged Brown to support 
it.  
</P>
<P>
 "His argument was that this would calm things down in the prison system," said 
the former aide. The bill was signed into law in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Sieroty is upset that his work is threatened. He called the statute 
even more important now, given that the inmate population has sextupled since 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pornography was not the reason we wrote the bill," Sieroty said. "The issues 
were much broader than that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections has been trying to weaken the statute since at 
least 1987, with no success. This year, however, the Legislature's attitude 
changed dramatically after the kidnap-murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas and 
arrest of parolee Richard Allen Davis for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime quickly rose to the top of the California political agenda and, since 
the start of the year, the Legislature has been approving anti-crime bills at a 
frenetic pace. The inmates bill of rights has became a symbol for the 
"coddling" criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Presley, the Legislature's top expert on prisons, introduced a 
bill to abolish the bill of rights. He said the costs of operating the prisons 
can be cut if the statute is repealed. His bill cleared the Senate 
overwhelmingly this month, and is awaiting Assembly action. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Assembly, Andal introduced an identical bill, with Wilson's backing. 
Andal and Assemblyman Phil Isenberg (D- Sacramento) reworked the bill to have 
California adopt the the federal standard governing prisons. The bill passed 
the Assembly 60-0 Thursday and goes to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal standard, wardens can impose restrictions if they are 
"reasonably" related to some prison-related interest. The current statute says 
any regulations must be the least restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who represent prisoners in civil rights claims say the federal 
standard is toothless. But even under the federal standard, many rights in the 
inmates bill of rights -- to marry, maintain bank accounts, file lawsuits, 
correspond confidentially with lawyers -- will be protected, said San Francisco 
attorney William B. Turner, an expert on prison law. 
</P>
<P>
 With or without the state statute, Turner added, wardens will not be able to 
stop most pornography and racist material from getting into the prisons. That, 
too, is protected by federal constitutional law. 
</P>
<P>
 As the California law now reads, prisoners can receive almost anything the 
Postal Service will deliver -- short of writings about gambling, bomb making or 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 There likely will be lawsuits if the prisons try to significantly restrict 
pornography from reaching prisoners. Whether the state would win in court is 
unclear. Its track record has not been great. 
</P>
<P>
 A man, imprisoned for second-degree murder for killing his 6-month-old 
daughter, received sadomasochistic photos of adult women. When prison officials 
seized the pictures, he sued in 1992, and a federal judge urged state lawyers 
to settle the case. They did, giving back some photos and paying the prisoner 
$1,200 for pictures officials had destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is doubt among lawyers, including some who work for the state, that 
other often-cited abuses can be stopped. Sen. Charles Calderon (D-Whittier) is 
pushing a bill aimed at stopping prisoners such as Manson from profiting from 
their crimes. Similar laws have been struck down by federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison authorities do not expect immediate sweeping changes if the statute is 
repealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson would eliminate conjugal visits for sex offenders and those serving 
life terms, but prison authorities say the program helps promote better conduct 
by other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison system permits 25,000 conjugal visits a year at a cost to the state 
of $3 million. As recently as last year, the Department of Corrections defended 
conjugal visits, saying in a memo to Andal that "family visitation is a 
valuable tool for inmate management" and a "proven rehabilitative program." 
</P>
<P>
 All this is not to say there would not be changes. Prisons would regain 
broader rights to control inmates' hair or beard length. Authorities also may 
regain some powers lost as a result of court rulings interpreting the statute. 
</P>
<P>
 One that bothers officials came in 1986, when a court of appeal held that the 
inmates bill of rights gave mentally ill prisoners the right to demand a court 
hearing before they could be forced to take antipsychotic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has lost only 17 of the 494 court hearings since 1990. But there are 
court and prison costs, and corrections officials say less expensive 
administrative hearings should suffice in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the prisons, where small slights often loom large, there is talk about the 
legislative effort to repeal the bill of rights. Hyperbolic flyers are 
circulating urging inmates to tell their families and friends to call lawmakers 
and voice their opposition to its repeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are in danger of losing all your rights," a flyer warns. Without the 
statute, the flyers say, prisoners will lose the right to marry, own property, 
make wills, sue, get visits, or correspond confidentially with lawyers -- 
though no politician is suggesting repealing such rights.

D.A. WON'T FILE CHARGES AGAINST FIREFIGHTERS; INVESTIGATION: ORANGE COUNTY 
OFFICIALS SAY THE INQUIRY FAILED TO ESTABLISH THAT WESTMINSTER WORKERS 
IMPROPERLY ACCRUED OVERTIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office said Friday that an investigation 
into allegations that Westminster firefighters improperly accrued overtime pay 
determined there is "insufficient evidence" of any criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew Anderson, who conducted the probe, declined to 
elaborate on the investigation other than to say that it "was pretty extensive. 
We covered all areas, including a wide-ranging review of payroll practices 
within the Westminster Fire Department. Considering that what we were looking 
for is proof of criminal wrongdoing, I can't discuss specifics. . . . I don't 
want to hurt anybody's rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was launched after city officials charged in September that 
firefighters used loopholes in the payroll system, including lax reporting 
policies, to run up overtime charges of nearly $5 million since 1986. The 
allegation was based on a review done by the auditing firm KPMG Peat Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
 A final report submitted April 12 by the accounting firm said that part of the 
overtime expenses from 1986 to 1993 were caused in part by poor management, 
faulty record-keeping and inherent flaws in the department payroll system. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office said in a statement that it reviewed overtime 
pay, shift trades and other areas related to Fire Department staffing and 
payroll and concluded that "insufficient evidence exists to prove criminal 
intent on the part of any member of the Fire Department. Accordingly, criminal 
charges will not be filed in connection with this investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that finding, the rancorous battle between the City Council and the 
firefighters showed no signs of ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster Firefighters Assn. President Paul Gilbrook said that the district 
attorney's announcement was a vindication for the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very relieved," said Gilbrook, who was fired in February for allegedly 
exchanging sick leave for cash improperly and driving a firetruck with a 
suspended driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 "The D.A. has come up with something that we have been telling everyone off 
and on for the past year. We knew all along we're honest people," Gilbrook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook said that city officials engaged in a "witch hunt" and retribution 
for firefighters' political activities, including supporting a candidate who 
opposed Mayor Charles V. Smith in the 1992 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been exonerated," Gilbrook said. "This is good for the firefighters who 
have had very low morale." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan C. Davis, the firefighters' union attorney, said that the district 
attorney's findings will enhance the firefighters' federal civil rights lawsuit 
filed last month against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still a sad day, because the Westminster firefighters firmly believe 
that the City Council will continue their vicious attacks on the firefighters," 
he said. "The mayor and City Council should resign now and allow citizens to 
replace them who are concerned with the safety of the city of Westminster." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Smith, one of four council members targeted by the firefighters' 
association for recall, said he was disappointed by the district attorney's 
finding. He said he will consider asking the Orange County Grand Jury to 
consider the same material submitted to the district attorney's office for 
criminal action. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Richard Jones, prior to Friday's announcement, had said that the 
city could file a civil lawsuit to recover the overtime pay that the 
firefighters may have taken improperly. Jones could not be reached Friday, but 
the mayor said the city would move forward with a civil lawsuit to recover 
overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major reason I'm disappointed is it's been a massive fraud by the 
firefighters' union perpetrated on the taxpayers," Smith said. "And even though 
the district attorney didn't find sufficient evidence to prove their case in 
court, that doesn't absolve them. . . . That just blows my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's announcement came just as city officials completed 
dismissal hearings against two battalion chiefs, two captains and a paramedic 
over some of the same allegations that prosecutors were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that the city planned to continue with its effort to fire the 
firefighters it believes improperly took overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to have any impact on dismissals," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, city and union officials will face off in yet another arena, this 
one the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles over civil rights lawsuits filed by 
the firefighters' union against several municipal officials, including Smith 
and three council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, the firefighters' union attorney, said that the suit before Judge 
Ronald S. Lew seeks the reinstatement of Gilbrook and another dismissed 
firefighter and payment of damages to the reputation of the two union officials 
as a result of the city action. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's decision also came just as the campaigning began for 
the June 7 election to recall Smith and council members Craig Schweisinger, 
Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters' union is supporting the recall drive, stemming from last 
year's cuts in the Fire Department budget that firefighters have alleged 
reduced the city's fire protection capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the cuts were part of the reorganization of the Fire 
Department and have led to an increase of paramedic services to residents 
living around Fire Station 3 on the city's west side. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not optimistic, Smith said he would continue to resist the 
recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to fight right to the end," he said. "It's going to end in a recall 
of four of us, and the takeover of the city of Westminster by the firefighters 
union, which is what they're trying to do."

CITY TO CONSIDER SMOKING BAN FOR PUBLIC AREAS; SANTA CLARITA: THE BROAD PLAN IS 
BACK. IT TARGETS RESTAURANTS, WORKPLACES AND INDOOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Taylor is slightly hunched over, his hands cupped in front of his face 
to shield against a phantom breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a metallic scrape and a momentary hiss. Taylor drops his hands, sighs, 
and wisps of smoke stream out his nose and mouth as he talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder sometimes how much longer I'm going to be able to do this here," 
said Taylor, 32, gesturing to the Newhall restaurant patio where he is having 
lunch. "They can really make you feel like you're a criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 The act of lighting a cigarette has become more difficult in Santa Clarita 
recently and may become harder still in weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are considering a tobacco control ordinance that would prohibit 
smoking in restaurants, workplaces and enclosed public areas. Banks, malls, 
theaters, Laundromats -- virtually all indoor commercial businesses -- would be 
covered. The City Council is expected to discuss the proposal this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of the thinking is, if there are less people smoking maybe it 
will be easier for others to quit," said Councilman Carl Boyer, who agrees with 
the theory from his own attempts to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer quit smoking when discussions about the city ban were first under way, 
but started again on Jan. 17 in the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita City Council actually approved the broad ban in December, 
but changed direction one month later when about 200 people packed City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters cited health damage from secondhand smoke; restaurant owners said 
customers would go to nearby unincorporated areas where no ban exists, and 
other critics said the issue was one of personal freedom rather than health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish we went after guns and drug dealers with the same intensity," 
said Councilwoman Jan Heidt, who prefers letting businesses and smokers police 
themselves. "I think that most of us who smoke here try to be considerate of 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Santa Clarita smokers say they already feel penned in. They often face 
no-smoking house rules set down by spouses or other relatives, and don't 
appreciate having to look harder for havens where they can light up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind not smoking at work, but when I start having to worry about it 
on my (free) time, then I get concerned," said Taylor, a Canyon Country 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to come up to me and ask me to put my cigarette out, that's one 
thing, but all these 'No Smoking' signs are a pain," said Michelle Rauth, a 
Saugus resident. "What if someone wants you to be able to smoke in their 
restaurant? What if someone wants you to be able to smoke in their office?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rauth said that she doesn't go to different businesses depending on their 
smoking policies, but that more establishments seem to be considering bans 
since the City Council has discussed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus stadiums here are the latest to be declared off-limits for smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The College of the Canyons last week expanded an indoor smoking ban to include 
its stadium, uncovered stairwells and a 20-foot radius around campus doorways. 
A similar decision was made for Santa Clarita's public high school and junior 
high schools eight months ago, making baseball and football games smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a decreasing minority being pushed into a corner by a majority," said 
John Hassel, a smoker for nearly 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassel, a trustee for the William S. Hart Union High School District, voted 
for the ban on smoking at Santa Clarita's high school and junior high school 
campuses to set a good health example for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he agrees with the ban, Hassel admits it is difficult to sit through 
a four- or five-hour meeting without a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hell. It's pure hell," Hassel said. Santa Clarita "is not a comfortable 
place for a smoker to be."
