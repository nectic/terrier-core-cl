GEORGE RAMOS: PROP. 187 FOES GET A BOOST FROM AN UNLIKELY ALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernie Gustafson is the last guy I would have expected to oppose Proposition 
187, the so-called Save Our State initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot, because he's 
no bleeding-heart liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 A rock-ribbed conservative, he put in nearly 33 years in the U.S. Immigration 
and Naturalization Service, chasing after border jumpers from the Rio Grande to 
L.A. He rose through the ranks, becoming the district director for INS 
operations here and in Phoenix. He stood shoulder to shoulder with Harold 
Ezell, the controversial INS regional head during the Reagan years and a 
co-author of Proposition 187, which would deny education and health benefits to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 When he retired in 1989 from la migra , Gustafson had warred with just about 
every Latino activist and politician in L.A. who thought him a tool of a racist 
bureaucracy intent on deporting all foreign-looking people. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is he opposing Proposition 187? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bandage approach to a major problem," he explained, "dreamed up by 
politicians and wanna-bes with rose-colored glasses. It's a political 
opportunity for these people. It will solve nothing. It will take the innocence 
of children and make them the scapegoats of a failed policy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson is different from most who oppose Proposition 187. He is a 
non-Latino who is intimately familiar with the immigration problem. 
</P>
<P>
 While district director in L.A., he never shared Ezell's affinity for cameras 
and microphones, but he echoed his boss's demand for control of this country's 
borders. Many grudgingly admired Gustafson because of his folksy desire to put 
a human face on the immigration service. He has gained legions of fans who 
listen to his weekly Spanish radio show, on which he answers questions about 
immigration policy and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 When I heard of his opposition, I was surprised. When I went to see him the 
other day, he was as I remembered him -- direct, plain-spoken and yet 
passionate. 
</P>
<P>
 He slams Ezell, Gov. Pete Wilson, former INS Commissioner Alan Nelson -- who 
support Proposition 187 -- as opportunists who have used immigration to gain 
favor with voters. Gustafson is particularly critical of Wilson, who as a U.S. 
senator in 1988 complained that the INS was too quick to deport illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, in 1994, he thinks we don't deport them quick enough," Gustafson says. 
</P>
<P>
 He rejects the argument that illegals are a drain on California taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority who come here are not coming for any benefits," he argues, 
"unless you call living a benefit. They're not coming here to go on welfare. 
They're not coming here to go on food stamps. They're coming here to work." 
</P>
<P>
 His prescription for fighting illegal immigration is twofold. First, he says, 
a beefed-up Border Patrol, not the U.S. military, is the proper agency to deal 
with the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, federal agencies, including the INS, should streamline their rules 
governing legal immigration. For example, Gustafson says, more than 3 million 
illegal immigrants nationwide qualified for amnesty under the landmark 1987 
legalization law. But the government has been slow to allow relatives of these 
people to come to this country. Unwilling to wait years for the necessary 
paperwork, these relatives enter illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes sense to me," he says. "The wife and the kids come because the 
father, as the qualified alien, is already here. They don't want to wait." 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute. "You were part of amnesty," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I implemented the (amnesty) policy," he replied evenly. "I implemented it 
with fairness and openness. More than a million applied for amnesty in Los 
Angeles. I think I did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 What he didn't say is that Ezell, Nelson and others left the INS after their 
political appointments were up, leaving Gustafson and other career managers in 
the understaffed agency to grapple with amnesty and other programs. Now, it 
seems Gustafson's former friends have found new energy to get at illegal 
immigration in another way -- Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It will be quite a sight when Gustafson joins his onetime enemies, the Latino 
immigrant-rights advocates and civil libertarians, at an anti-Proposition 187 
march scheduled for Oct. 16 in Downtown L.A. "I can't believe Gustafson is 
going to be with us," says one Latina activist. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't either. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson doesn't care if Ezell -- with whom he sang in a trio to promote 
amnesty -- disapproves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've deported Ezell from trio amnistia ," he barks.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH OPINION; DO 
YOU KNOW ANY YOUNG GANG KIDS LIKE 'YUMMY'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON asked local high school students if they knew any very young 
gang kids like Yummy, and about how to keep violence from overwhelming 
children. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The murder of 11-year-old Robert Sandifer (nicknamed "Yummy" for his love of 
cookies) on Chicago's South Side was awful enough; that Yummy was himself the 
accused murderer of a 14-year-old girl was worse. His story has sparked a 
national debate about how to save such kids.  
</P>

<P>
 My friend is in a gang. And she always seems to be picking on people. But if 
there were to be any killing, it would only be their enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want you to think that I think it's okay to kill or fight with other 
people. But when you live in a place where violence is always there, it seems 
better to be with a group of people who will back you up. I could have been in 
a gang, but I choose not to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 It always seems to go back and forth. When there is a fight, then another 
fight happens. As for Yummy, I really think he was used by the gang. I don't 
understand why they killed him. He was doing their shooting for them. But you 
have to understand, these days, killing seems like a natural thing to do. It's 
not surprising to me that an 11-year-old is killed. Everybody has guns. SUZANNA

</P>
<P>
 Of course I know kids who are involved with violence. And when I used to go to 
school in Wilmington, it seemed a month didn't go by when someone I knew wasn't 
shot. To a lot of people, killing doesn't mean anything. And to society it also 
seems that the killing of our youth is no big deal, which really scares me. 
CHERIE JACKSON 
</P>
<P>
 17, Senior, Corona High School 
</P>
<P>
 I come from a single-parent home. And I knew there were kids that fought. But 
I didn't want to become involved with any of that because my mother taught me 
morals and values. 
</P>
<P>
 I really can't understand how a child could kill. I have a 12-year-old 
brother. And when I look at him, I just can't imagine him killing anybody. 
CAMERON FUGIMOTO 
</P>
<P>
 17, Senior, Wilson High School 
</P>
<P>
 I just think it's sad that kids are now killing each other. I was shocked to 
hear about Yummy. I don't understand it. But it's getting worse, not better. 
There must be some solutions. Maybe our government leaders have to start really 
doing something instead of just grandstanding. But no matter how much 
government gets involved, no solution will work unless parents are involved. 
RUBY COOK 
</P>
<P>
 14, Sophomore, La Mirada High School 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in Compton. And basically, I think for a lot of kids, it seems that 
you have to belong to a gang to have friends. But more importantly, you need to 
belong to a gang so they will back you up. So I can understand why being in a 
gang would help you protect your back. And for little kids, they seem to want 
to be like the big kids. They want to hang out and act like gangsters. So in 
the case like Yummy, he was probably only doing what they wanted him to do. 
DIANE HELD 
</P>
<P>
 17, Senior, Saddleback High, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 I do know people who seem to be surrounded by violence. I don't want to say 
involved with violence because it seems that violence is engulfing a lot of 
people these days at home, school and everyday life. And for many of these 
people, they just live with it. 
</P>
<P>
 For Yummy, what happened to him -- I was shocked. For a child -- any child -- 
to get killed is something I cannot let myself get used to. All kids are not 
born violent. They are caught up into a cycle that we (society) need to break. 
BROOKE HAMILTON 
</P>
<P>
 17, senior, Corona High School 
</P>
<P>
 I really can't understand why anybody would kill a 12-year-old kid. But see, I 
grew up in a safe middle-class home where gangs were not a part of it. I think 
what happened with Yummy was a tragedy. But how could it have been avoided? Can 
a lifestyle like that be avoided when you live in a place where gangs are 
everywhere? I think Yummy, the 14-year-old girl he killed and the guys who 
killed Yummy are all victims of society. Society has to figure out a way to 
help these kids. CESAR PACHECO 
</P>
<P>
 15, Sophomore, Saddleback High School 
</P>
<P>
 There are some kids who are involved with violence. But I try to stay away 
from it. Sometimes it's hard. Like when I was leaving a student council 
meeting, these gang members came up to me and asked me if I was in a gang. I 
said no, but they didn't believe me. They told me that if they found (a weapon) 
on me that they would kill me. CHRIS SIMMONS 
</P>
<P>
 16, Junior, La Mirada High School 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up with a guy who was always fighting. It seemed violence was a part of 
his life. I think he is now in a mental ward. But I can see that there are a 
lot of people like him who want to hurt people. I just try to stay out of those 
people's way.

 Most mothers with jobs have faced the child care issue, and few have come out 
of the battle unbloodied. Tough choices have to be made about who provides the 
care, in what location and at what price. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the experts say, quality child care usually is available. Being able 
to afford that quality care is another story. A 1990 National Child Care Survey 
reported that, in families where the mother works full-time, the average weekly 
child care expenditure for children under 5 was $68 or more than $3,500 a year; 
in major cities, the total is likely to be higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "After rent or a house payment, I think child care is the largest single 
budgeting item," says Peter Lunsden, assistant director of UCLA's Child Care 
Service. "It really is something you cannot live without yet the burden on 
individual families is increasing all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is particularly acute in low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liken it to grocery stores," says Sharon Reuss, communications director for 
the New York-based Child Care Action Campaign. "In low-income areas, you find 
mom-and-pop grocery stores where the prices are very high. You don't have the 
kind of supermarket of choices that is readily available in middle-class 
neighborhoods. It's the same with child care in these neighborhoods; parents 
are stuck when it comes to finding child care." 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Making a Difference, a profile of the nonprofit Stone Soup project 
demonstrates a creative solution to the child care crisis, at least for 
children of school age. By bringing together businesses, foundations and the 
community, Stone Soup is able to provide affordable, quality after-school care, 
right at the child's school. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no ideal solution to the child care problem, many parents are 
beginning to advocate another idea for younger children: day care at the 
parent's place of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 One corporation that has instituted such a center, Ventura-based Kinko's, has 
found that on-site day care provides both tangible and intangible benefits to 
the company and its co-workers, as it calls its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 While the company isn't certain how day care affects its turnover rate, 
Kinko's spokesperson Gail Michalak says, "We feel certain that it helps. What 
we are sure of is that it is a tremendous recruiting tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents go over to the center on their lunch hour or during their 
breaks to see their children," Michalak says. "They do not feel pressured to 
leave work at a certain time. If their child is sick, they can go over to the 
center and take a firsthand look without leaving work." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the obvious benefits to parents in the work force, on-site day care 
centers can be costly. "It's expensive to set up," says Marilyn Nolan, director 
of the day care center at USC. "You have to hire staff, you have extra 
liability." And a business has to be large to even consider providing such a 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, I think the United States is really behind the times," says Nolan. 
"Many countries are providing on-site child care and they find that work 
productivity and attendance go up."

 You wouldn't know it by looking at me. I'm party-line politically correct but 
with a terrible secret: I've glanced to see if the 35 m.p.h. freeway driver was 
Asian. As a group of African American boys crossed the street in front of my 
car, I've reached to lock my door. I've stood mute as others -- assuming that 
since I'm middle-class, Anglo and Protestant I automatically share their world 
view -- complained about immigrants, Mormons, South-Central Los Angeles, 
homosexuals and the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Does one racist thought make us a bigot? Two? Twenty? If not, how many do we 
"get"? And what about the times we did not speak out when others spoke in 
ignorance or hate -- should our silences also weigh in against us? Even if we 
grant ourselves a handful of thoughtless gestures over a lifetime, there's 
still plenty of us who, if we're honest, couldn't measure up. Perhaps we could 
start a new 12-step program: "Hi, I'm Debra and I'm a racist." 
</P>
<P>
 I know from my own experience that prejudice caused by ignorance can sometimes 
be righted if we have the courage to speak up. For this to work, a difficult 
thing has to happen: Instead of permitting intolerance to disguise itself in PC 
buzz words or in silence, we have to allow a kind of world where people can say 
what they think -- even if what they think is offensive. Particularly in our 
universities where young people are for the first time trying on new ideas -- 
sometimes even bad ones -- we must discover a way to tolerate intolerance so it 
can be brought out into the open instead of festering in the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 My own worst moment came in college: After pulling an all-nighter, I turned to 
a friend's roommate and tossed off a dismissive comment about the "Jews" living 
in the San Fernando Valley. The air suddenly felt as though it had been sucked 
out of the room. The friend's friend, who was Jewish, turned to me: "I've heard 
about people like you. You're racist." I started to explain that I didn't 
intend my comment to be taken literally; I had used the word "Jew" in a general 
sense, as one would use the word "niggardly." Horrified at the unfolding 
stupidity of my argument -- until that moment, had I never thought of these 
words as ones to be taken personally -- I sat miserable and silent while the 
woman prepared to go to a neighbor's until I left. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks after the incident, I agonized over whether or how I might make 
things right. A letter? A phone call? What would I say? "Hi, remember me? I'm 
the racist you met at Linda's house a couple of weeks ago." Cowardice won over 
guilt; I did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I began to reconsider my assumptions -- some of them so slight they 
might never be cross-examined. How many of these assumptions had made their way 
into conversations with people too polite to tell me what they thought? How 
many times had I conspired with others by not speaking up? 
</P>
<P>
 I understand the impulse for some to mandate what should be off-limits to 
promote a safe environment for everyone. But this tactic may lull us into a 
false sense of security. These lessons have to be learned the hard way: face to 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 During a discussion about AIDS, my class of college freshmen struggled to keep 
their deliberation afloat without saying anything sexually naive or politically 
incorrect. A big bear of a football player blurted out: "I have to say this -- 
I'm really homophobic. I'm sorry, that's the way it is." An embarrassed silence 
fell over the room as the football player, arms crossed defiantly across his 
chest, glared at the desk in front of him. Another male student, well-liked for 
being "one of the guys," turned to the athlete. "I'm gay," he said quietly. No 
one moved. At last, the football player uncrossed his arms: "When did you 
know?" he asked. For the next half hour, the gay student fielded questions from 
the other undergraduates. Even after class was over, small groups of students 
lingered, unwilling to give up what had been a compelling exchange of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, I thought about how far the other way the discussion could have 
gone. But it didn't. And while I was certain my football player didn't leave 
the classroom reconsidering his teammates as possible additions to the dating 
pool, the next time someone started railing about "those fags" he might be less 
inclined to automatically jump into the melee. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, I find myself reluctantly turning in my PC membership card. 
If our true aim is to change the way people think, we must be brave enough to 
talk, let others talk and to listen. This is also an open letter written many 
years too late. To Linda's friend: I'm sorry. And thank you.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SECOND OPINION / 
OTHER MEDIA; LOS ANGELES SENTINEL; GARCETTI'S NO-DEATH DECISION IN 'BEST 
INTERESTS OF HIS OFFICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Sentinel is an African American weekly published on Thursdays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are many people in the Southland, and, indeed, the nation, who are 
pleased that the Los Angeles County district attorney's office has elected not 
to seek the death penalty in the double murder case involving O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 And, there are a goodly number of people who are upset with the decision, 
announced last week by Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. The district attorney, they 
say, just wimped out to the black leaders who urged Garcetti not to "go that 
way." In this respect, the operative word is that Garcetti "elected" not to go 
that way for several very practical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Garcetti heads a district attorney's office that has a mediocre 
conviction rate in high profile cases. Being a politician up for reelection in 
two years, he wants this one very badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Past history also has something to do with his decision. Garcetti can remember 
that it was the black vote that was credited with sweeping his former boss, Ira 
Reiner, into office in 1984, keeping him there in 1988, and helping him hasten 
his decision to throw in the towel in 1992. Virtually all of the black 
community is galvanized around Simpson for one reason or another. Why take a 
chance on ticking off a potentially potent voting bloc by going for the death 
penalty? 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason Garcetti is stepping back from seeking lethal injection or the 
gas chamber is because juries have traditionally not opted to convict popular 
defendants in capital cases or defendants alleged to have committed "crimes of 
passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, by lowering the stakes Garcetti raises his chances of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding how this decision may sit with women and women's rights 
activists and organizations, we categorically reject the notion that failing to 
go for the death penalty is waffling on the issue of spousal abuse. These are 
separate issues. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe that Garcetti's decision was a prudent one in the best interests of 
his office and administration of justice.

 For the estimated 400,000 Korean Americans who call Southern California home, 
the Korean Friendship Bell in San Pedro embodies the ties between the old world 
and the new. The 17-ton copper alloy bell, believed to be the largest Oriental 
bell in the world, rests on an oceanside bluff in Angels Gate Park, where huge 
guns defended the coast in World War I. The bell was a gift from the people of 
South Korea to the United States during the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976. It is 
patterned after the Bronze Bell constructed by King Songdok in 771 and rings 
out three times a year: July 4, Korean independence day Aug. 15, and at 
midnight Jan. 1. STEVE CHO 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. businessman and general secretary of the Advisory Council for the 
Democratic and Peaceful Unification of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Statue of Liberty is on the East Coast, a gift of Europeans. Asian 
immigrants are on the West Coast and, for us, the Korean Friendship Bell is our 
Statue of Liberty. It commemorates the day in 1945 when we were freed from the 
Japanese occupation. This was also the day Korea got divided. Below the 38th 
Parallel the U.S. stepped in, while the Russians occupied the north. The bell 
is very important to the Korean American community. We now have plans to donate 
a gate at the entrance to the park similar to the famous South Gate in Seoul." 
JOONHO LEE 
</P>
<P>
 Director, Korean Cultural Center 
</P>
<P>
 "Why a bell? Traditionally, Korea is a Buddhist country. Every temple has its 
own bell. Very early in the morning, they ring the bell and the day starts. For 
Koreans, this kind of bell-ringing is a symbol of a good start or celebration."

DON'T BLAME CITY DOGS FOR BEING BAD -- IT'S THE OWNERS WHO ARE BRUTES

 Dog Park: The 98% who are good citizens need to confront the 2% who ruin it 
for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget O.J., Cuban refugees or Haiti. What's on the minds of many Silver Lake 
residents is the continuance of a dog park on the northeast slope of the 
recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
 I ardently support saving the fenced section that permits the dogs to exercise 
and socialize, and, perhaps more importantly, lets their owners build community 
and neighborliness -- qualities vital to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent meeting moderated by Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg, dog park advocates lauded the results of the dog zone: crime 
reduction, better behaved dogs, better neighbors. The preponderance of 
testimony revealed that, except for one or two vituperative souls incensed at 
the possibility of the rest of Los Angeles descending on a plot of grass, the 
majority of objections were about doggie poop and doggie fights -- both the 
responsibility of doggie owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently 98% of the dog park users do scoop the poop, do control their 
animals and do care about their own, and their dog's, behavior. The complaints 
were about the 2% who don't care about anyone but themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of the two-hour community meeting was a compromise: Goldberg agreed 
to a one-year pilot project that calls for fencing off a section of the 
recreation center for the animals and their owners. Details will be worked out 
after consultation with the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Goldberg's meeting could have been about many issues: drugs, car 
theft, graffiti, a noisy late-night disco. Ultimately, it was about 
responsibility -- not only individual, but the community's responsibility to 
stop the 2% who ruin it for the rest. If we're not willing to call people on 
their doggie poop, how can we expect to stop drug trafficking, gang violence 
and the widespread disintegration of neighborhoods? This requires the 98% to 
stop accepting the unacceptable, to stop being silent. We can do that by 
tapping into the same energy that brought us together to save a dog park. It 
starts with getting everyone to clean up after their dogs and themselves.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
STONE SOUP: RECIPE FOR RELIABLE, LOW-COST CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents seeking trustworthy after-school care for children age 6-12 often meet 
with utter frustration, especially if they don't have money for top-flight 
private care. Statewide there are only enough child care spaces to accommodate 
one in five school age children, and what is available is often not affordable. 
Without dependable, inexpensive, supervised care that's conveniently located, 
these working parents are forced to make painful choices between leaving their 
children on their own before and after school, during holidays and school 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone Soup, a school-based nonprofit model for solving this problem, serves 
2,600 children at 49 schools statewide. It began in Lawndale in 1987, helping 
school districts, cities and business and community groups to pool their 
resources so they can offer convenient, year-round child care at a cost 
averaging less than $1 an hour per child. The Ingredients of a Community-Based 
Child Care Partnership 
</P>
<P>
 The name "Stone Soup" comes from a Napoleonic-era children's story about 
starving soldiers who persuade reluctant villagers to share their resources to 
make soup. The soldiers contribute a pot and stone as a symbol of the 
collaboration. Each villager contributes a food item. The resulting soup 
sustains everyone, though it began with nothing more than a stone. Here's how 
Stone Soup applies the concept to child care: 
</P>
<P>
 School district shares its liability insurance, facilities, utilities, and 
custodial services. 
</P>
<P>
 City may offer direct financial contributions, park and recreation service 
access, library services, field trip transportation, summer program support. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone Soup staff organize the partnership, administer the program and work as 
teachers and supervisors at each school site. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses, community groups and foundations donate start-up money for school 
sites and staff development. They also provide funds for activities and 
materials such art supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents pay fees and may volunteer at child-care sites. Who Pays What 
</P>
<P>
 To start a Stone Soup partnership at an elementary school costs about $6,000. 
Once established, cash expenses are covered by: 
</P>
<P>
 Parents' contributions: 80% 
</P>
<P>
 Donations, grants and outside support: 12% 
</P>
<P>
 Government funding; 8% A WELCOME SERVING OF CHILD CARE 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $69 a month for after-school care for one child, $196 a month for summer 
care. Costs for additional children add about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Availability: before and after school and during winter, spring and summer 
vacations from 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Child-staff ratio: 11 to 1 
</P>

A MOMENT OF TRIUMPH; BUT MANY WORRISOME QUESTIONS REMAIN CONCERNING HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a very close call. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin by which the United States averted an outright military invasion of 
Haiti can literally be measured in minutes. Airplanes carrying paratroopers of 
the 82nd Airborne Division were already on their way to Port-au-Prince when 
Haiti's military dictators finally accepted U.S. demands that they voluntarily 
step down or be ousted by force. Their apparent agreement should, everyone 
hopes, finally allow the first popularly elected president in Haiti's history, 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to return to office three years after he was ousted in 
a bloody coup that was condemned around the world -- and that sent desperate 
Haitians fleeing into exile, most of them to the United States as illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and other Administration officials, most especially his 
three peace envoys to Haiti -- former President Jimmy Carter, retired Army Gen. 
Colin L. Powell and Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) -- can certainly feel a genuine sense 
of achievement, even triumph, in this last-minute accord. They have at least 
averted the bloodshed that could have occurred if an all-out invasion had begun 
this morning as scheduled, in the hours before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 But that said, it must be pointed out that the deal reached by the trio of 
U.S. negotiators with the Haitian junta is fraught with uncertainty and risk. 
To what extent will the demands of the Haitian economy and its unstable public 
security put new burdens on the United States forces and Treasury? Finalizing 
the details could take as long as a month, and Haiti could still get very 
dangerous for thousands of American troops. They will begin coming ashore 
today, in broad daylight and now, thankfully, facing no official hostile fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern about what might happen in Haiti in the weeks to come springs less 
from any flaws in the accord reached with the Haitian junta than from the 
nature of the people with whom the United States struck this last-minute 
diplomatic bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 One year ago this same junta reached a similar agreement with Aristide, under 
U .N. auspices. It was signed with great fanfare and hope at Governor's Island, 
N.Y. Among other things, that 1993 agreement called for the resignation of Lt. 
Gen. Raoul Cedras, the Haitian army commander who led the coup against 
Aristide. It also included an amnesty for Cedras and other Haitian military men 
so that they would not be prosecuted for their role in the coup and the brutal 
oppression of Aristide supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the generosity of the Governor's Island agreement, the deceptive 
Cedras and two other top leaders of the Haitian junta, Gen. Philippe Biamby and 
Port-au-Prince Police Chief Michel-Joseph Francois, ultimately reneged. They 
refused to step down, refused to allow Aristide's return and eventually used 
mobs of Haitian thugs to turn away ships carrying unarmed U.N. troops who were 
to enforce the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The current standoff with the United States, which is not acting unilaterally 
against Haiti but enforcing a U. N. Security Council resolution passed after 
the Governor's Island accord collapsed, would never have come about if Cedras 
had kept his word one year ago. So among the many questions that remain to be 
answered, the biggest is this: What guarantee is there that Cedras, Biamby and 
Francois will keep their word? 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, as Defense Secretary William Perry said at a White House briefing 
late Sunday, the presence of 15,000 well-armed American troops can and should 
have a certain persuasive effect. Indeed. But that persuasive pressure stems 
from the unstated threat that force can still be used against the junta, if 
things comes to that. But the use of force could throw off the timetable for 
restoring Aristide to power and starting the vital flow of U.S. and global aid 
to Haiti.

SOMETIMES A STATE CAN TAKE TOO MANY INITIATIVES; CALIFORNIA'S INITIATIVE 
PROCESS EMPOWERS CITIZENS BUT IS TOO PROBLEM-FILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 November's ballot contains only 10 propositions, far fewer than the 28 that 
burdened the 1990 ballot. But three of the 1994 propositions address problems 
that have stumped think tanks and legislatures alike: violent crime 
(Proposition 184), the health care crisis (Proposition 186) and illegal 
immigration (Proposition 187). Can the average voter do any better? 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, was the original promise. California's initiative law was 
passed in a historic special reform election in 1911. The Progressives who 
pushed for those reforms wanted to break the grip of monied interests, 
primarily railroads, on the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Those same Progressives would surely be stunned to learn that by the 1990s the 
amount of private money poured into highly professionalized ballot initiative 
campaigns had outgrown the amount spent on all lobbying of Sacramento 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a mistake to suppose that money once again rules unchecked. The 
success of big money in buying voters for the ballot initiatives it favors has 
been less than its success in buying legislators for the bills it favors. 
Roughly $100 million of insurance industry money was not enough to stop 
Proposition 103, the auto and liability insurance reform initiative of 1988. 
But do the citizens really have more power now? 
</P>
<P>
 A LAW DEGREE HELPS: Among the many merits of "Democracy by Initiative," a 
penetrating 1992 report on initiative reform from the California Commission on 
Campaign Financing, was its recognition that time and the will of the citizenry 
have changed the original initiative law. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 13, the 1978 property tax initiative, revised more than taxation: 
It also changed citizens' understanding of their power to advance a legislative 
agenda. The report's astute subtitle was "Shaping California's Fourth Branch of 
Government." 
</P>
<P>
 The question is: Now that the citizens have made themselves not just voters 
but legislators, are they up to the task? 
</P>
<P>
 The California voter has, by law, just 10 minutes in the booth. For guidance, 
he or she is provided with a ballot pamphlet written at an 18th-grade reading 
level. That's college plus two-thirds of a law degree just to read the 
pamphlet, let alone to evaluate the underlying issues. Studies show that fewer 
than 10% of voters with an eighth-grade education and only half of those with 
an advanced degree manage even to read the pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems do not begin (or end) in the voting booth. Those whose signatures put 
a given initiative on the ballot in the first place are not required to have 
read what their signature sponsors. If a drafting error, no matter how blatant, 
is spotted after an initiative has qualified for the ballot, even the 
proponents may not correct it. Has language in a California ballot initiative 
ever struck you as contradictory? It may be because the sponsors have spent 
more money qualifying their initiative than buying legal talent to write it 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 If and when their contradiction -- the one that left you scratching your head 
-- becomes law, resolving it typically falls to the third branch of government, 
the judiciary. Unfortunately, initiative law is more nearly set in stone than 
legislative law. When badly written legislative law ends up in court, if it is 
not thrown out as unconstitutional, the court may gently suggest that a little 
corrective drafting is called for. But badly written initiative law is beyond 
such easy correction. The Legislature is forbidden to touch it. Correction can 
only be made by a new initiative. And at the going rate of $1 million per 
qualified initiative, no one is going to launch a campaign just to make a 
correction. So those who are hurt by badly drafted initiatives -- like the 
younger homeowners who pay higher real estate taxes because of flaws in 
Proposition 13 -- have, effectively, no recourse. 
</P>
<P>
 MANY UPTURNED PALMS: Using Proposition 13 as an example, one might think that, 
over time, younger homeowners could surely muster enough signatures to lower 
their own real estate taxes by a ballot initiative. Unfortunately for them, the 
law requires that the signatures of an intimidating 5% of all registered voters 
-- 8% if the initiative is to revise the state Constitution -- be gathered 
within a period of just five months. Gathering so many signatures so fast costs 
money -- for computer mail specialists and paid signature-gatherers (the going 
rate is about 75 cents per signature). And once an initiative has qualified, 
other palms must be crossed with silver: pollsters, electronic media advisers, 
billboard specialists and sundry pricey consultants. Increasingly, the paid 
professionals of the multimillion-dollar ballot initiative business define the 
fourth branch of government more than citizens do. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any way to reclaim the ballot initiative, the fourth branch of 
California government, for the California voters while providing it with the 
capacity to correct its own mistakes? Yes, and we'll outline some useful 
suggestions in our next editorial on this subject.

 The "proper use of our wildlife heritage in this day and age" (as Mark Palmer,

danger of abuse by so-called "sportsmen" and hunter groups who seem bent on 
destroying the wild cougars in California. 
</P>
<P>
 People like Dan Heal, chairman of the California Sportsmen's Task Force, who 
hunt for the pleasure of killing wild animals, would have you believe that 
unless they are allowed legal hunting of cougars, these animals will overrun 
the wild, endangering everyone who goes there. This is, of course, ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters' endorsement of existing statutes providing protection for these 
animals should stand as a symbol for wildlife preservation in California and 
elsewhere.

COMMON SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While reading the newspaper Sept. 4 and getting annoyed at the stupidity of 
various politicians, I was reminded of an idea I put forth some time ago. It 
elicited hoots of derision from my nearest and dearest, but I believe its time 
has come. 
</P>
<P>
 This country should establish a Panel of Common Sense, staffed by laymen with 
impeccable judgment, such as myself. We would have members of various racial, 
religious and ethnic groups with hands-on experience in many fields. Anyone 
with "expertise" derived from research or political office would be 
automatically excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 When a major new law, public policy or legal ruling is contemplated, it would 
be submitted to us first. We would call each other up and ask the one question 
that seems to elude many legislators, judges, psychologists and other 
professionals. That question is: "Does this make any sense to you?" 
</P>
<P>
 I'm afraid the answer would very often be a resounding "No!"

HEALTH CARE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Greetings, Congress -- Guess What's Waiting," editorial, Sept. 12: 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of achieving the possible has much to recommend it. However, the 
statistic in the editorial, that 73% of the nation's smallest firms dleo not 
offer employees insurance coverage, coupled with the statement that "Small 
employers should be obliged to join such cooperatives, though not to pay for 
the employee coverage" demonstrates a serious lack of understanding of life 
among the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Assume, if you will, that the average small business pays employees $8 per 
hour. Assume, also, that this employee is able to find a rental at $600 per 
month. The $8 per hour will generate $1,387 per month, gross, and a net of 
$1,151, assuming 17% deductions. After paying rent the employee retains $551 to 
provide food, clothing, utilities, school expenses, transportation, insurance, 
savings and miscellaneous expenses for a family that could include a spouse and 
several children or a dependent parent. It is patently illogical to expect such 
a person to purchase health care insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever we like to think, we already pay for health care for everyone, and in 
the most illogical, inefficient, demeaning and expensive manner possible. The 
"system" by which the uninsured poor receive medical care ensures that children 
will go un-immunized, diseases will be undiagnosed and untreated (sometimes 
with catastrophic results) and that the rest of us will pay premium dollars for 
this appalling care. Fundamentally, I believe in a Canadian-style system. Since 
the federal government appears ready to surrender to special interests, they 
have opened the door to the proposed single-payer California system 
(Proposition 186). It may be our last, good hope for effective health care 
reform.

 Let me tell you how "poorly" our current health system works. In January of 
1993 I had a high fever for several days. I was unemployed and uninsured. 
Exaggerated "county hospital horror stories" made me reluctant to go. When I 
finally did, I was diagnosed with a very dangerous heart infection. After being 
hospitalized for six weeks in a very clean double room I was released. I thank 
the staff of 5C at Olive View Hospital every day I enjoy the life they saved.

 I felt the need to respond to James G. Kreder's letter (Sept. 10) "explaining" 
the lack of passage of a health care bill. His points varied from exaggerated 
to paranoid, but one was egregiously in error -- that America has the best 
health delivery system in the world. I have traveled and occasionally been 
forced to test health care systems in Italy, Austria and Canada. I can tell you 
that these systems work better. It's not just better service: The statistics 
verify that they function better. Their infant mortality rates are lower. The 
average age at death is higher in Canada and Italy, and in Austria it is equal 
to the U.S. And here's the scandal: We spend 11% of our GNP on health care, 
while they spend only a bit more than half that in Austria and Italy and less 
than a third in Canada. We're being ripped off by the medical community and the 
insurance providers -- it's plain when you look at the facts.

 "Health Reform Has a Hold on Australia" (World Report, Sept. 13) clearly shows 
that single-payer health reform is the right way to go. Australia had private 
insurance companies delivering health care until 1984. Then their government 
adopted health reform. After 10 years it has been so successful that even the 
politicians who opposed it initially are now in favor of it. The people show a 
high rate of satisfaction and health care costs have been controlled.

DOWLING ON HARASSMENT

<P>
 Re "The Sexual Harassment Jackpot," Commentary, Sept. 7: 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Dowling expresses complete ignorance of an important human rights 
issue, sexual harassment. "Good manners" have nothing to do with it leand 
neither does "sexual attraction." She makes a similar blunder when she 
intimates that sexual harassment first occurred with the "sexual revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment is all about power, control and intimidation. Oftentimes it 
has been used to exert that power and control in the workplace, preventing a 
co-worker or subordinate from gaining a promotion, or even earning a 
livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the court system the harassed have regained some of that human dignity 
and respect. A juror from the recent newsworthy case (Sept. 2) cited by Dowling 
summed it up best when he was quoted as saying, "We wanted to send a message to 
Baker & McKenzie that if they continue with this kind of conduct, they can 
expect the retaliation of the court system." 
</P>
<P>
 Dowling needs to educate herself as to the law and as a physician needs to 
sensitize herself to what the true issues are that may face her patients. 
Unfortunately, a "tongue" alone has not protected people in the past from 
harassment, but luckily laws and their enforcement do.

 I take exception to Dowling's superficial assessment of sexual harassment. 
Proposing to fight the pervasive and debilitating social plague of sexual 
harassment with nothing more than "good manners" and "common sense" is like 
trying to combat cancer with two aspirins and a good night's rest. 
</P>
<P>
 While it may be true that chauvinism is a permanent part of any society, if 
we, as a nation, hope to effectively combat the devastating effects of sexual 
harassment, then we must commit ourselves to a more aggressive campaign whereby 
punishments are both substantively meaningful and enforced. If that means 
multimillion-dollar jury verdicts against convicted harassers, then so be it!

RULING ON CONDO PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court's ruling that condominium homeowner's 
associations may ban pelets, including indoor cats, from dwellings (Sept. 3), 
deals another severe blow to animals at a time they can least afford it. With 
people's needs for animal companionship notwithstanding, the tragedy of pet 
overpopulation has reached epidemic proportions, with 10 to 20 million cats and 
dogs being destroyed annually by U.S. shelters, and millions more left homeless 
on our streets.What is desperately needed is more homes for animals.  
</P>
<P>
 This ruling will give people with disposable mentalities yet another excuse 
for abandoning pets.  
</P>
<P>
 It has become increasingly difficult to find rentals willing to accept pets, 
and now that condos have the green light to evict pets, the only people who 
will be privileged enough to own pets are those who can afford single-family 
homes.

 We are very sorry to see yet another area where senior citizens are restrained 
in their attempts to lead a normal, happy life. If we can sell our house, we 
would like a small condo. Our small dog up until now has fit the present 
25-pound limit. This rule seems fair to all. To ban all pets will cause a lot 
of lonely, unhappy people. It takes away the advantage of buying over renting.

FOR CLINTON, SOMETHING WORSE THAN LOSING THE HOUSE; POLITICS: THE DEMOCRATS 
THAT SURVIVE NOV. 8 WILL BE THE MOST LIBERAL AND THE LEAST RELIABLE TO BACK HIS 
AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS K. BAKER, Ross K. Baker is a professor of political science at Rutgers 
University and the author of House and Senate (Norton, 1989.) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few weeks before the 1954 congressional elections, President Eisenhower 
received a visit from his economic adviser, Gabriel Hauge. Hauge's analysis of 
the likely outcome of the upcoming contests for the House and Senate indicated 
sizable Republican losses. What alarmed Hauge the most and what ultimately 
impelled the President to undertake a 10,000-mile, 40-speech whirlwind tour was 
the evidence that the toll of defeat would not fall evenly on all Republican 
candidates. Those deemed most likely to lose were those who represented swing 
districts in the East and Midwest, constituencies in which the numbers of 
Democratic and Republican voters were roughly equal. These members were the 
party moderates, and what their wholesale electoral slaughter presented to 
Eisenhower was the specter of the right wing of the GOP becoming the dominant 
force on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Eisenhower's dramatic two-week canvass in late October, the GOP lost 
17 House seats and surrendered control of the chamber to the Democrats, who 
have held it ever since. Most of the GOP right-wingers survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Change the date, the party and the name of the President and you have almost 
precisely the grim-visaged political picture that faces President Clinton in 
1994. To lose one or both houses of Congress would be bad enough, but would 
this "New Democrat" really like to wake up on the morning of Nov. 9 to discover 
that the rump of his decimated party in Congress was composed uniformly of 
members well to the left of him on many issues? 
</P>
<P>
 The House Democrats most likely to survive an Election Day massacre are those 
who represent the most reliably Democratic districts. It can be safely assumed, 
for example, that no Democrat in the 39-member black caucus will be defeated. 
These House members represent the most solidly Democratic districts and are 
consistently the most liberal in their voting records.  
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, the very certainty of the success of the African American 
Democrats in the House comes, at least in part, at the expense of many fellow 
Democrats whose districts have been drained of reliably Democratic black voters 
by the Voting Rights Act. By packing black voters into districts in such 
numbers as to assure the election of House members of their own race, the 
legislation strips white Democrats of an important general-election 
constituency. These white Democrats tend to be more centrist in their politics; 
their absence will result in a vastly more liberal contingent in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Even where race is not a factor, redistricting in the aftermath of the 1990 
census has not been kind to the Democrats. Some district maps that gave 
considerable advantage to the Democrats after the 1980 census have been 
replaced with more evenhanded alignments. Demographic shifts and voter 
realignments have drastically cut the number of Democratic members from the 
places most likely to produce political moderates -- the South and border 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Carolina, for instance, it is entirely possible that the state's 
delegation to Washington after Nov. 8 might have as few as four Democrats among 
its 14 House and Senate seats. The only certain survivors will be the state's 
two African American members. 
</P>
<P>
 With the House Republican Conference being overwhelmingly conservative and 
likely to become even more so after new members, supported by newly energized 
conservative groups, are sworn in, we will see a Congress more ideologically 
polarized than any since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 For party control to change in Congress is rare. Ideological transformation is 
even rarer. There are some compelling examples of such upheavals. In 1958, 
while retaining control of the Senate, the Democratic caucus itself was altered 
from one dominated by conservative Southerners to one in which Northern, 
Midwestern and Western Democrats were dominant. The House that was sworn in 
January, 1981, was magnitudes more conservative than its predecessor, even as 
Democrats maintained a 50-seat advantage. In a political environment in which 
ideology has come to rival partisanship in securing the loyalty of politicians, 
the bare party numbers may conceal a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
 It would not surprise me to learn that President Clinton may already be 
pondering his relationships with a Democratic congressional caucus that is not 
only more liberal by reason of the subtraction of party moderates, but one that 
is well to the left of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton can, of course, distance himself from the barn-burners and wrap around 
himself and the GOP the warm fleece of bipartisanship, as he did in the 
aftermath of the setback on the crime bill, but he can't nestle down too cozily 
with them. In his quest for a second term, he will need the support or, at the 
very worst, the neutrality of the liberals just to survive the primary. As 
Jimmy Carter learned, there is no force more destructive to a Democratic 
President than alienated and disaffected liberals. By themselves they can not 
win the White House, but they are virtuosos in the art of losing it for others.

A BATTLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED; PELELIU: AFTER 50 YEARS, A SALUTE TO 
U.S. TROOPS SLAUGHTERED WHILE STORMING A JAPANESE-HELD ISLAND FOR NO GOOD 
REASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEL STELCK, Del Stelck, emeritus professor of history at Cal State 
Northridge, served as a scout- sniper with the 1st Marines in the Peleliu, New 
Guinea, New Britain and Okinawa campaigns. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty years ago this month, the 1st Marine Division assaulted Peleliu, a tiny 
Pacific island. Marines were supposed to overrun the 2-by-6-mile fortress in 
four days, mop up in a week. Instead, Japanese troops were still fighting years 
later. For Col. Lewis (Chesty) Puller's 1st Marines, Peleliu became the 
costliest battle of the Pacific War: Seven out of 10 were killed or wounded in 
eight days. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Americans knew then or have ever heard of Peleliu (pronounced 
PEH-leh-loo). In early autumn, 1944, America's attention was focused on the 
liberation of Europe. Through the decades, far-distant Peleliu seemed to be 
best forgotten. In contrast to Europe and other Pacific locations, there were 
no memorial services or dedication of monuments on Peleliu. The few Peleliu 
survivors ever to return found only a crumbling Army monument. But all that 
changed last week when 80 Marine officers and men returned to Peleliu to mark 
the Sept. 14 landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Southernmost of the Palau group, Peleliu is about 500 miles east of the 
Philippines. The strategy behind the invasion of the island was to protect Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur's flank when he invaded Mindanao in the southern Philippines. 
Adm. William F. (Bull) Halsey's successful carrier strikes convinced him that 
Leyte, in the central Philippines, had fewer defenders than had been thought. 
He radioed Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, urging all other operations be called off 
and Leyte seized. But in a decision still difficult to understand, Nimitz 
ordered the convoy of Marines to take Peleliu anyway. Awaiting them were elite 
Japanese troops that could have been bypassed.  
</P>
<P>
 Aerial photographs suggested Peleliu was flat. Not seen were formidable 
limestone ridges turned into underground fortresses, all connected by tunnels 
impervious to aerial and naval bombardment. Studded with steel and concrete, 
the Japanese positions covered every square yard of Peleliu from the beach to 
the inner recesses of the ridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Off Peleliu's smoke-shrouded coast, the early morning pre-invasion bombardment 
appeared impressive. Could any defender still be alive? But as the first waves 
of Americans moved toward shore, Peleliu erupted into a living hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Sledge, a mortar man, barely 20, later wrote "With the Old Breed," 
providing a classic account of the unforgettable reality of battle for enlisted 
Marines: The Peleliu beach was "a continuous sheet of flames. Defenders emerged 
from cover and increased their fire. Shells screamed and exploded everywhere. 
Huge geysers erupted around landing craft forced into single file through reef 
obstacles only partially destroyed. Direct hits engulfed dozens of craft in 
black dirty smoke sending debris and bodies into the air. Survivors staggered 
and crawled ashore through heavy fire. Hundreds of dead young Marines sprawled 
on the surf and in the deep tank traps a few yards from the water's edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Each enemy shell brought mutilation and death to the congested beaches. 
Inland, it was impossible to dig in. Jagged coral slashed shoes and clothing 
and tore bodies. Peleliu coral soaked up and retained 115-degree temperatures. 
Enemy artillery and mortar harassed all night. Odious blowflies from bloated 
dead bodies alit the moment a C-ration can opened. Acute dysentery struck. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaughter continued as Marines fought inland through the ridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days, and the 1st Marines ceased to exist as an assault unit. The 321st 
Army Infantry took over their positions on the eighth day. In a few weeks, 
enemy fire whittled down the 5th and 7th regiments. On Oct. 16, the 81st Army 
Division relieved the entire 1st Marine Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Historian William Manchester, himself a Marine gravely wounded on Okinawa, 
visited Peleliu in 1978, where he observed well-kept Japanese memorials. 
Disappointed not to find a suitable memorial to American veterans of Peleliu, 
he wrote, "To consign brave men to oblivion is profane." 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week, the 1,794 heroic Americans who died on Peleliu will be 
thanked and remembered.

JOB SECURITY? IT'S JUST AN ILLUSION; EMPLOYMENT: IF YOUR BOSS DISLIKES WHAT YOU 
READ, YOU COULD BE SACKED. THE RIGHT TO FIRE WITHOUT VALID REASON FLOURISHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REGINALD ALLEYNE, Reginald Alleyne is a law professor at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under a 19th-Century judge-made common-law doctrine formally described as 
"employment at will," workers in the United States could be fired for any 
reason or no reason at all. Many scholars now believe that employment at will 
is a dead legal doctrine. They accurately point to 20th-Century state and 
federal laws limiting employer discretion to terminate employees, large jury 
awards for some terminated employees and growing numbers of court filings under 
state and federal laws prohibiting arbitrary discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also true that courts have made exceptions to judge-made 
employment-at-will doctrine. Outrageously arbitrary discharges that affect 
public policy -- like the discharge of an employee for refusing to provide 
perjured testimony in the employer's interests, are now illegal under 
California common law, for example. A few statutes ban similarly arbitrary 
discharges, but only when the public has an interest in the outcome. Thus, a 
California statute makes it unlawful to fire an employee for serving on a jury, 
because the public has an interest in making jury service minimally disruptive 
for jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite these statutory and judge-made exceptions, the law of employment 
at will still dominates the American work place. Its statutory and common law 
exceptions create no more than a contrary illusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The true measure of employer discretion to terminate employees at will is not 
the number of statutes and common-law decisions making exceptions to employment 
at will. It is what those statutes and exceptions cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Add up all the state and federal statutes banning discrimination on grounds of 
race, sex, religion, age, national origin and handicap. Include the federal law 
prohibiting discrimination because of union activity. Mix all of these statutes 
with judge-made exceptions to employment at will on public-policy grounds. 
Combined, they still ban no more than a tiny fraction of arbitrary reasons for 
which an employer may lawfully discharge employees. 
</P>
<P>
 For every private-sector employee fired for reasons made unlawful by a 
discrimination statute or a narrow exception to common-law employment at will, 
thousands may be discharged for arbitrary reasons not covered by statute or the 
common law. John Doe and Mary Poe, for example, could not be discharged for 
reasons of race or sex, but both could be lawfully fired by their corporate 
employers for reading a newspaper the employer did not like. They could collect 
no more than a few weeks of unemployment compensation. Poe and Doe could both 
be fired for theft of company property -- even though they stole nothing. 
Except in Montana -- the only state with a law making discharges "without just 
cause" illegal -- no statute would cover their cases, nor would any exception 
to employment at will. So outside of Montana, no legal forum would be open for 
them to prove their innocence and recover their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 If Poe and Doe were covered by collective-bargaining agreements, their union 
could take their cases to arbitration and probably win. But that possibility 
would govern today for only 11% of the private-sector work force, and that 
figure will shrink to around 6% by the year 2000 if many prominent economists 
are right. 
</P>
<P>
 Employment at will, long dead and buried in the world's other industrial 
democracies, is alive and well in the United States. Its viability is enhanced 
by the illusion of its death.

CHARGERS MOVE TO THE TOP IN AFC WEST

<P>
 A touchdown pass play that covered all but one yard of a football field, 
thrown to a guy who before the game had made but one catch? 
</P>
<P>
 An interception return for a touchdown during which the safety was so alone, 
he high-stepped the last 40 yards? 
</P>
<P>
 The team is the San Diego Chargers, their record really is 3-0 for the first 
time since 1981, then this must be, well . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "No, this ain't magic ," groused defensive end Shawn Lee. "It's heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, then, it is also courage, something displayed in bunches Sunday when 
the Chargers whipped the Seattle Seahawks, 24-10, in front of 65,536 at Husky 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Call this the Giddy Bowl. It was a match between two unbeatens who could have 
easily shown up winless; teams who finished 1993 at the bottom of their 
division and had suddenly risen to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to turn the other guy into the impostor, the two teams engaged in a 
battle of penalties (17 for 140 yards), attrition (seven players left the game 
because of injuries) and hard knocks (eight sacks). 
</P>
<P>
 And the winner, as usual, was the team that wasn't afraid to be good. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be the Chargers, who turned risky plays into big plays, stunning 
the Seahawks not once but twice with a 99-yard touchdown pass and 73-yard 
interception return. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the Chargers' 10 touchdowns this season have come on plays of 47 yards 
or longer, causing Coach Bobby Ross to exclaim, "Like I keep reminding our 
team, we are not going to play conservative, that's just not the way we are." 
</P>
<P>
 It is only fitting that next week the Chargers travel to the Coliseum for the 
first of two grudge matches against a franchise that many felt invented the big 
play.  
</P>
<P>
 "The game against the Raiders will be an absolute war," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers, who have won their last three games in the Coliseum, would 
appear ready. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback Stan Humphries is sound and sharp for the first time since 
leading them to a division title two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite scrambling from the likes of Cortez Kennedy and Rufus Porter for most 
of Sunday, he completed 19 of 29 passes for 262 yards, more than the entire 
Seahawk attack could manage. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries, the AFC's only starting quarterback who has not thrown an 
interception, also completed seven of his last nine passes for 147 yards, 
including a 99-yard strike to Tony Martin that clinched the game in the third 
quarter and tied an NFL record. 
</P>
<P>
 Staring down a full blitz about seven yards deep in his end zone, Humphries 
found Martin in one-on-one coverage about 50 yards away. Martin ran so hard in 
the final 60 yards, defender Patrick Hunter suffered a strained hamstring 
trying to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh time in league history that a touchdown pass had covered 
such a distance, the first since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the coverage and my eyes lit up like a Christmas tree," Martin said. "I 
just kept hoping Stan could get me the ball. He did. It was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Humphries: "It was a pretty gutsy call." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly when Martin, acquired in a trade last spring from the Miami 
Dolphins, had caught only one pass in the previous two games. And he had 
earlier had a pass intercepted on a trick play that eventually allowed the 
Seahawks to take a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chargers' defense is sound and finally playing up to its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that was Junior Seau storming Seahawk quarterback Rick Mirer midway 
through the third quarter. And yes, that was former first-round draft choice 
Stanley Richard stepping in front of Mirer's ensuing pass and returning it 73 
yards for a touchdown, the first interception of Mirer this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard had a 99-yard interception return for a touchdown in the season opener 
at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Charger defense also roughed up Seahawk running back Chris Warren, forcing 
him to sit out most of two quarters because of a chipped elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 With 19 seconds to play in the first half, the Seahawks had 28 yards in 
offense. They finished with only 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers say they are ready for whatever Al Davis has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very emotional game up there," said defensive end Leslie 
O'Neal, who had three sacks. "The Raiders said a lot of things about the 
Broncos this week. It will be very interesting to see what they say about us."

SORRY GEORGIA, BUT 49ERS OWN RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: YOUNG IS SHARP IN 34-19

 Quarterback Chris Miller's signing was going to help the Rams bridge the Grand 
Canyon gap that has existed with the 49ers in recent years, but after Sunday's 
34-19 pratfall before 56,479 in Anaheim Stadium, the Rams remain the pits. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is hurt, the 49ers (2-1) are as dominant as ever, and now the Rams 
(1-2) have to travel to Kansas City to play the team that beat San Francisco. 
</P>

 "This game was frustrating because I don't fear San Francisco," Ram safety 
Marquez Pope said. "They practice and watch the same amount of film as we do."

 The 49ers, however, have scored more points than the Rams in their last eight 
meetings. They are 13-2 against the Rams in Anaheim Stadium, and they were not 
even at their best in winning their eighth consecutive game here. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers were coming off emotional games with the Raiders and Chiefs, and 
they were playing without three starters along the offensive line and defensive 
end Richard Dent. Wide receiver Jerry Rice dropped a pass, running back Ricky 
Watters fumbled and the 49ers were tagged with 14 penalties for 177 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still need to work on some things and execute better," said Rice, after 
catching 11 passes for 147 yards, including a one-yard touchdown pass. 
"Fortunately, we had Steve Young out there and he made it all happen today." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who threw for an NFL-high 462 yards against the Rams a year ago, 
completed 31 of 39 passes for 355 yards. Young tossed a three-yard touchdown 
pass to wide receiver John Taylor to open the scoring, ran for a one-yard score 
on the final play of the first half and then increased the 49ers' lead to 34-13 
in the fourth quarter with another one-yard scoring dive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the offensive line did a pretty good job overcoming some tough odds," 
Young said. "When you play the Rams, it's always going to be a good game no 
matter who is favored." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers rolled up 454 yards in total offense while controlling the ball for 
almost 10 minutes longer than the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't win with the 49ers' offense out on the field," said Ram cornerback 
Todd Lyght, who was assigned coverage of Rice most of the day. "In order to 
beat the 49ers you have to have ball control. You can't play defense against 
these guys all day, it just doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram offense, sharp on its first drive, failed to keep pace with the 49ers' 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who ranked 28th in completion percentage among NFL starting 
quarterbacks, threw a four-yard touchdown pass to tight end Troy Drayton -- 
Drayton's first catch of the season -- to make the score, 7-7, in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers went ahead by 10-7 on Doug Brien's 33-yard field goal, but the Rams 
matched that with Tony Zendejas' 25-yard kick in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were right there," Miller said, "and then I took this shot in my shoulder 
and I couldn't feel the ball. My fingers went numb, and I tried to stay in 
there and grind it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hurt us more by staying in there, and that's disheartening, but I was 
waiting for the feeling to come back in my fingers." 
</P>
<P>
 While Miller tried to hang tough, the Rams were unable to hold on to the ball 
in the closing minutes of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "With three minutes to go I told Jerome (Bettis) to run the ball and the clock 
out," Lyght said. "I knew if they got back in there, they would probably get at 
least a field goal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams punted with 1:30 left in the half, and the 49ers refused to settle 
for a field goal. With no timeouts remaining, Young completed a 28-yard pass to 
Rice, who went down at the Rams' one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 With the clock running, Young grounded the ball with four seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought they might try something outside," defensive tackle Sean Gilbert 
said. "That's what we called." 
</P>
<P>
 Young ran a quarterback sneak to give his team a 17-10 halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hit us right in the gut with that one," safety Anthony Newman said. "But 
if we're going to be a good team, we have to answer that in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams began the third quarter with excellent field position, but could not 
advance. They started at their 41, and punted. They took possession again at 
their 42, and punted again. Brien's 47-yard field goal pushed the 49ers ahead, 
20-10, and the game was getting away from the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked Chris early in the third quarter if something was wrong with his 
shoulder," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "He said no, so we left him in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller tried a third series in the third quarter, and the Rams punted once 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw the ball and it took about a half hour to get there," said Miller, 
who completed eight of 19 passes for 86 yards. "I had nothing on it and knew I 
had to come out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, however, didn't get the ball back until after Young's touchdown pass 
to Rice -- Rice's 128th touchdown, increasing his NFL record. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who relieved Miller a week ago in Atlanta, guided the Rams to a 
35-yard Zendejas field goal and a Bettis two-yard touchdown run, but the 49ers 
had already secured first place in the NFC West Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, who is supposed to be the perfect complement to a deep-throwing 
Miller, went over the 100-yard mark for the second consecutive game with 104 
yards in 21 rushes. But both performances have come in defeat, and overall the 
Rams are 2-7 when Bettis rushes for more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played some quality football," Bettis said. "We just couldn't sustain it." 
</P>
<P>
 Flipper Anderson, who caught five passes for 154 yards last week, failed to 
catch a pass, while being covered at times by Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Francisco is already a great team," Anderson said. "I think Deion adds 
more to an Atlanta team than a San Francisco team. San Francisco is going to be 
great with Deion or without Deion." 
</P>
<P>
 What about the Rams? Unfortunately, Sanders and his agent refused to return a 
call from the Rams earlier this month.

RAIDERS' HOSTETLER DISARMS CRITICS, 48-16; PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER POOR 
PERFORMANCES IN HIS FIRST TWO GAMES, HE PASSES FOR 338 YARDS AND FOUR 
TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST THE BRONCOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sore arm? Sick offense? Sad defense? 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders put the rumors to rest, the obituaries on hold and the critics on 
mute for at least a week by breaking out of their season-opening slump with a 
long-awaited offensive explosion Sunday at Mile High Stadium, beating the 
Denver Broncos, 48-16, before a disgruntled crowd of 75,764. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders stumbled out of the starting blocks, losing their first two 
games by a combined score of 82-23, much of the criticism and speculation 
centered on quarterback Jeff Hostetler, who seemed as if he had forgotten how 
to throw a spiral. He kept denying there was anything physically wrong with his 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday, who can argue? 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, looking every bit the quarterback who led the Raiders back to the 
playoffs last season, completed 21 of 33 passes for 338 yards and four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders opened a 21-3 first-quarter lead, surpassing their previous season 
point total with 10 minutes remaining in the second quarter. They went on to 
score their highest overall total since beating the Atlanta Falcons, 50-19, in 
a 1979 game at the Oakland Coliseum. The 32-point margin of victory was the 
widest since the Raiders beat the Chargers, 42-10, in a 1983 game at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders scored on their first four possessions Sunday. They scored on the 
ground, through the air, on field goals and off an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler went to Ty Montgomery on a 65-yard touchdown pass play, Tim Brown on 
a 43-yarder, Andrew Glover on a seven-yarder and Harvey Williams on a 
five-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked after the game if he had had a sore arm, Hostetler simply smiled and 
asked for another question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take the blame," he said of the poor start. "I don't have any excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 His coach, Art Shell, offered one anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might have screwed him up," Shell said of his quarterback, "by not giving 
him enough playing time in the preseason. But I never lost faith in him. He's 
going to be the quarterback here for many years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Hostetler's problem was the pressure he has faced over the last couple 
of weeks. The Raiders failed to generate a running game, enabling the defense 
to concentrate on the quarterback. And once the Raiders fell behind, they were 
forced to stay in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders rushed only 14 times last week, only 34 times over the two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell had vowed to change that and he made good on his promise from the start 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders rushed on their first five plays and never slowed down, winding up 
with 30 carries for 102 yards. Montgomery led the way with 53 yards and a 
4.1-yard-per-carry average. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams scored the game's opening touchdown on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many people put it all on the tailback," Montgomery said. "We have to get 
the ball to get the feel of it. We fell so far behind in those other games, we 
had to get away from the running game. People put so much (criticism) on us, 
they did not give us much of a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Raiders were going to break out of the doldrums that had threatened to 
end their season before it started, it figured that the turnaround would come 
against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have dominated this rivalry of late even in the best of times. And 
right now, Denver is going through the worst of times. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is 0-3 for the first time since 1968, and the fans and Denver media 
are howling for Coach Wade Phillips' job. 
</P>
<P>
 How bad has it gotten? 
</P>
<P>
 When Hugh Millen took the field in the fourth quarter to replace quarterback 
John Elway, the fans cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheered the exit of Elway? That has to be a first. 
</P>
<P>
 They also booed him while he was on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the worst I've ever heard Mile High," he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most points Denver has given up in a home game since a 56-10 loss 
to the Kansas City Chiefs in 1966 when Bears Stadium was Denver's home turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Broncos, taking part in the NFL's 75th anniversary 
celebration, were wearing replica uniforms from the 1966 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess they won't be wearing those again. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will take more than a uniform change to turn around a club woefully 
weak on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly the low point for me," Phillips said. "I'm worried about 
the team at this point. I'm not worried about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos scored on a 43-yard field goal by Jason Elam and runs of four and 
one yard by Leonard Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 But after field goals of 42 and 33 yards by Jeff Jaeger had boosted the 
Raiders into a 41-16 lead, the coup de grace was supplied by Terry McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Denver 10-yard line, Elway threw a pass intended for Jeff Campbell. 
Instead, McDaniel batted it, bobbled it, then hung on and danced along a clear 
path to the end zone to close out the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third consecutive week Elway had a pass picked off for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider defense also sacked Elway four times, safety Eddie Anderson getting 
two of those, and recovered a pair of Denver fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the Raiders' fourth in a row over Denver, fifth in a row if 
last year's playoff victory is included, and ninth in the last 10 
regular-season meetings between the two clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just something about the Bronco defense," Brown said, "that brings 
out the best in the Raider offense." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's something in Hostetler that brings out the best in Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider receiver had a career season last year with the arrival of 
Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Raider quarterback slumping the first two games, Brown caught a total 
of 11 passes for 103 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he caught seven for 136 yards and the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Were the Raiders breathing a sigh of relief after Sunday's victory? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not yet," Brown said. "We can't breathe easy yet. We've still got a long way 
to go."

THROWING TO HIM WAS NO GAMBLE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: GATEWOOD (23 CATCHES, 363 
YARDS) HAS RECORD NIGHT FOR FAST-BREAKING UNLV IN LOSS TO IDAHO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometime during his record night, sometime long after his reception total 
reached double digits, Randy Gatewood remembers an Idaho defensive back 
yammering in his ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was a backup guy," Gatewood said, shaking his head Sunday 
afternoon, the scabs on his arms the only visible reminder of the previous 
night as he sat in the Nevada Las Vegas athletic offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he was kind of getting fed up, he started trying to talk to me a lot, 
mouthing off, and I ended up beating him a couple of times. I can't tell you 
what I said, but I told him something. 
</P>
<P>
 "And after that, none of them said anything else to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Although UNLV lost to Idaho, 48-38, Gatewood set NCAA single-game records for 
receptions (23) and receiving yards (363) while carrying the Rebel offense 
almost all the way back from a 45-10 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous records of 22 receptions by Brigham Young's Jay Miller and 349 
yards by Chuck Hughes of Texas El Paso had stood for 21 and 29 years, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter alone, Gatewood, a 6-foot senior from Wichita Falls, 
Tex., caught 13 passes for 207 yards. Gatewood also chipped in 56 return yards, 
giving him 419 all-purpose yards. All from a receiver who says he had never 
caught more than nine passes in a game before Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you catch a couple of tough ones, you kind of get in that zone where all 
you see is the ball," Gatewood said. "All you really think about is the ball 
and you don't worry about the defenders, you don't worry about anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything thrown my way, I just felt like I was Superman. I could catch 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 In a full season at UNLV last year, Gatewood, a junior college transfer, 
caught 40 passes for 629 yards. In three games this year, Gatewood has 39 
receptions for 610 yards to lead both categories nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Under first-year Coach Jeff Horton, whose 1993 Nevada program led the nation 
in passing offense, the Rebels have opened the offense. Saturday night, playing 
catch-up, two quarterbacks threw a combined 79 passes for 635 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Davis, who did not enter the game until four minutes remained in the 
third quarter, was 30 of 46 for 381 yards and four touchdowns, setting NCAA 
records for most passing yards (347) and completions (25) in a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton says he wants his offense to have the same impact on college football 
that the Loyola Marymount program had on college basketball in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be the Paul Westhead of football," Horton said. "I want to play 
fast-break football, run as many plays as we can. The more plays we run, the 
better chance we have to score, the more opportunities, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Gatewood said he hoped his historic performance would put the new UNLV system 
on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it can help me, help the program, help the quarterbacks, help 
everyone involved," Gatewood said. "I'm just glad things turned out the way it 
did, because in years past UNLV had some problems with football, so now, I 
couldn't have come to a better place at a better time." 
</P>
<P>
 Gatewood plays the slot position in UNLV's three-wideout formation. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, Idaho chose to blitz often, leaving the middle wide open for 
Gatewood, who says that, after a while, he and Davis, who attended Eisenhower 
High in Rialto, understood that he would be open and that the ball would be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's basically what it turned into," Gatewood said, "you run the route, you 
get open, you catch the ball. That's all we did." 
</P>
<P>
 As he ponders his status in next year's NFL draft, Gatewood says he has been 
timed in about 4.6 seconds in the 40-yard dash, not particularly fast for a 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never run a good 40 time," Gatewood said. "It seems like in all my years 
of playing, I never ran a good 40. But I was always able to get open, even 
catch the deep balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm starting to do a lot of great things, with a lot of hard work, a lot 
of pressure the coaches are putting on us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be all right, though."

 The real Jeff Hostetler and the real Bronco defense showed up Sunday in 
Denver. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing like a four-touchdown, 338-yard performance to end the speculation 
that the Raider quarterback has a sore arm. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The way they played, the Broncos should have worn their old, ugly 
horizontal-striped stockings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 John Elway ought to have a greater appreciation of Dan Reeves as a coach now. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elway appears to be aging at 34, but San Francisco quarterback Steve Young, 
who will be 33 next month, continues to live up to his name. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Young showed his versatility by throwing a one-yard -- count it, one -- 
touchdown pass to Jerry Rice against the Rams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had the same kind of home-field advantage at Anaheim Stadium that 
UCLA had during the Rose Bowl game against Wisconsin. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If more people cared, there might be another bona fide Ram quarterback 
controversy with Tommy Maddox fans clamoring for him to get some playing time 
ahead of Chris Miller and Chris Chandler. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You could say the roof fell in on the Seattle Seahawks except that their 24-10 
defeat to San Diego was at Husky Stadium, not the Kingdome. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Humphries to Tony Martin, shades of John Hadl to Lance Alworth and Dan 
Fouts to John Jefferson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Best matchup of the AFC season might be Kansas City at Miami on Monday night, 
Dec. 12. . . .

 The Pacific 10 Conference is a disappointing 10-9-1 in nonconference games and 
2-5 against the mighty Western Athletic Conference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But UCLA and USC can't be as bad as they looked the last two weeks on national 
television. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska and Penn State are going to score a ton of points at home against 
anyone outside the NFL. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State seems to have the best balance of defense, pass offense and rush 
offense among the legitimate contenders for the national title. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Nittany Lions could be accused of pouring it on -- in the first quarter -- 
in each of their three games this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska averages 295 pounds in the interior offensive line, but Nebraska 
Kearney averages 313. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Nebraska Kearney should be allowed to play the next three games in 
Lincoln against Pacific, Wyoming and Oklahoma State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of Bruins to watch in the future are true freshman wide receiver Jim 
McElroy and sophomore quarterback Ryan Fien. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy flashed the speed that won him the L.A. City 100-meter title at 
Washington High last year by catching two passes for 32 yards against Nebraska 
and Fien went six for seven for 68 yards in relief of Wayne Cook. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Next year's UCLA-Miami game, scheduled for Oct. 14 at the Rose Bowl, might be 
switched to the season opener the first week in September. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant thing the nearly-point-a-minute Florida Gators have done 
this season is shut out Tennessee at Knoxville. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If Whitey Herzog becomes Royal manager, I wonder if he will live in Kansas 
City. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball lost one of its finest and most underrated television analysts when 
Tony Kubek announced his retirement. The former New York Yankee shortstop never 
was shy about offering a well-founded opinion. . . .

<P>
 The Ruelas brothers, Gabe and Rafael, have won their world titles the 
old-fashioned way with hard work. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gabe's 12-round decision over World Boxing Council junior-lightweight champion 
James Leija on Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden was among the highlights 
of what might have been Don King's best card ever, top to bottom. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lack of skilled boxing trainers, but Joe Goossen has become one of 
the finest in the business. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen is a good teacher and conditioner and, like Angelo Dundee, his biggest 
strength is the psych jobs he gives his fighters, who include the Ruelas 
brothers and heavyweight Jeremy Williams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Quick now, name a half-dozen Clipper players. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Bull General Manager Jerry Krause, who finds something wrong with most 
of his players, should have no trouble pinpointing a weakness or two in Ron 
Harper's game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Golf's new Presidents Cup is gimmicky, but quite watchable. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Breeders' Cup without Holy Bull is like the NFL playoffs without the 
Dallas Cowboys. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Green Bay Packers' loss to the Philadelphia Eagles must have ruined Bud 
Selig's week.

GOLF ROUNDUP; U.S. WINS PRESIDENTS CUP WHEN COUPLES BEATS PRICE

<P>
 The United States put the International team in a Ryder Cup squeeze Sunday and 
walked away with the first Presidents Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team, starting fast with three Ryder Cup veterans and closing 
strongly with three more, won six of the 12 singles matches and defeated the 
International team, 20-12, at Gainesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the six Americans with Ryder Cup experience won Sunday, including Fred 
Couples, who closed out Nick Price with a 147-yard nine-iron from a bunker to a 
foot from the 18th hole to win the deciding match. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really ask for a better day," Couples said. "I did happen to beat 
Nick Price and I did get the 17th point, but what really mattered is that we 
won as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the end of a frustrating competition for Price, who was the only one of 
the 24 players not to win at least one match. 
</P>

 Mike Sullivan, who missed the cut in eight of his last 11 tournaments, made 
three birdies on the back nine to overtake Jeff Sluman and win the B.C. Open by 
four strokes at Endicott, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan closed with a five-under 66 for a four-round total of 18-under 266, 
one stroke shy of the En-Joie Golf Club record set in 1982 by Calvin Peete.

 Isao Aoki ended a two-year winless drought on the Senior PGA Tour, winning the

 Aoki shot a three-under 69 to complete the 54 holes at 14-under 202. He won 
$82,500.

MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP; TIRE FLAT, GAS GONE, BUT HE WINS ANYWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his engine sputtering and one of his tires flattened, Rusty Wallace 
redefined victory in one word -- luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fortunate to win today," Wallace said. "Under any other circumstances I 
couldn't have made it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a bizarre conclusion Sunday to the SplitFire 500 in Dover, Del., Wallace 
led a frustrated field of racers across the finish line at a virtual standstill 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 He won after limping one final time around the one-mile Dover Downs 
International Speedway as the race finished under a caution flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Right behind him with gas and tires, but fresh out of laps, were Dale 
Earnhardt and Darrell Waltrip. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace was lucky to keep his car moving. Earnhardt might have won had the car 
stopped at any time on the final lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pulled up alongside me and pointed to his gas tank, and said, 'Me, too,' " 
Wallace said. "So I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did Earnhardt, whose lead over Wallace in the Winston Cup points chase 
was reduced by five to 227 with six races left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was about out of fuel there at the end, but I really think I could have 
beaten him if it had been restarted," Earnhardt said. "Who knows? Somebody 
might have come up and beat me from behind. We'll never know now." 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely scenario would have been a victory by Waltrip, which would 
have ended a two-year winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had gone green, I couldn't have won because of the tire," Wallace said. 
"I was riding on the apron to get the car flat so it would pick up (drop gas 
into engine) and I ran over something." 
</P>
<P>
 With Earnhardt nearly out of gas, Waltrip probably could have maintained power 
because he was the last of the leaders to pit and should have had more in his 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace also was fortunate to have been in contention at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Mark Martin, one of a record-tying 12 drivers to lead in the fiercely 
contested event, blew a big lead and eventually crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with two laps left and NASCAR ready to end the last of 13 caution 
periods with a one-mile shootout -- which Wallace could not have completed -- 
Rick Mast and Sterling Marlin ran out of fuel. That necessitated a finish under 
caution and negated a final showdown between Earnhardt and Waltrip. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Paul Tracy finally got his first oval-track victory, leading a 1-2-3 sweep by 
Marlboro Team Penske in the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix at Nazareth, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the lead from pole-winning teammate Emerson Fittipaldi on the first lap 
around the one-mile oval on the Roger Penske-owned Nazareth Speedway, Tracy led 
192 of the 200 laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Unser Jr., who clinched the Indy-car PPG Cup championship a week earlier 
with a second-place finish at Elkhart Lake, Wis., finished second again, 
outdueling Fittipaldi, who wrapped up the runner-up spot in the championship 
with Sunday's third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth Penske sweep of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy earned the seventh victory of his career -- all of them for Penske. He 
moved past Michael Andretti into third place in the season standings.

PRO FOOTBALL; FOSTER OF OLD HELPS STEELERS FREEZE THE COLTS; AFC: RUNNING BACK 
RECAPTURES 1992 FORM, RUSHING FOR 179 YARDS AND ONE TOUCHDOWN AS PITTSBURGH 
DEFEATS INDIANAPOLIS, 31-21. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Barry Foster, fully recovered from ankle surgery, ran for 179 yards and a 
touchdown in his biggest game in two years to upstage Marshall Faulk, and the 
Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Indianapolis Colts, 31-21, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was supposed to be Foster vs. Faulk, but it ended a mismatch. Foster had as 
many yards as the Colts offense and the blitzing Steeler defense limited Faulk, 
the AFC's leading rusher, to 61 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't the challenge," said Foster, who gained 1,690 yards in 1992 before 
missing half of 1993 with a bad ankle. "I respond to the challenge the defense 
gives me because every defense is determined not to give me 100 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, averaging 2.8 yards per carry through two games, had his best game 
since a career-high 190 yards against the Jets on Sept. 13, 1992. Overall, the 
Steelers (2-1) outgained the Colts, 500-179, and outrushed them, 261-73, as 
Foster and rookie backup Bam Morris rushed for 235 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris also turned a routine screen pass into a 49-yard gain ahead of Neil 
O'Donnell's go-ahead eight-yard touchdown pass play to John L. Williams in the 
fourth quarter. Morris later put it away with his first NFL touchdown on a 
one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Humphrey returned the opening kickoff 95 yards and Quentin Coryatt 
returned O'Donnell's fumble 78 yards for a touchdown -- the ninth and 10th 
return touchdowns against Pittsburgh in two seasons -- as the Colts (1-2) 
opened a 14-0 lead. But they didn't have the offense to sustain it. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbaugh, who had a 77.8% completion rate through two games, was only nine of 
20 for 120 yards, was sacked three times and threw an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stopped our running game pretty good but we also stopped ourselves," 
Colt Coach Ted Marchibroda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulk had no chance to become the only rookie to rush for 100 yards in his 
first NFL three games. Outrushed by Foster, 104-29, in the first half, Faulk 
had to work hard for his yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We read all week about how good he is," Lloyd said. "We said in the huddle 
that we couldn't trust one guy to bring him down, that we had to gang tackle 
and pursue him." 
</P>
<P>
 Harbaugh was effective only during a 66-yard scoring drive capped by his 
19-yard touchdown pass to Sean Dawkins that made it 21-17 in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh regained the lead, 24-21, as Foster, held to 128 yards in 45 
carries in his first two games, rushed for 22 yards in three carries ahead of 
O'Donnell's second touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell, 22 of 35 for 254 yards, had earlier connected with Green on a 
27-yard touchdown pass play that cut the Colts' lead to 14-7.

PRO FOOTBALL; CHRISTIE AND SMITH PROVIDE EVERYTHING THE BILLS NEED; AFC: 
KICKER'S FIVE FIELD GOALS AND DEFENSIVE END'S FOUR SACKS LEAD BUFFALO TO 15-7 
VICTORY OVER HOUSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Steve Christie and Bruce Smith were up to their old habits again on Sunday -- 
beating the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo's Jim Kelly and Andre Reed played a personal game of catch to set up 
five field goals by Christie, and Smith stopped Houston's offense with four 
sacks, leading the Bills to a 15-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith battered Oiler quarterback Bucky Richardson all afternoon and delivered 
a jolting blind-side sack late in the third quarter that ended an Oilers' drive 
at the Bills' 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's sacks resulted in 28 yards in losses. It was his second four-sack 
performance; the other was against Indianapolis in 1990. Smith was going 
against veteran center Bruce Matthews, playing at tackle for the first time 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put a guy out there who hasn't played out there in eight years," Smith 
said. "It was real tough for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills (2-1) had five sacks and Matt Darby kept Houston (0-3) out of the 
end zone by intercepting Richardson's pass in the end zone with 6:15 to play. 
Richardson averted the shutout with a 22-yard touchdown pass play to Patrick 
Coleman with 3:51 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce played a great game, he got a lot of pressure on them," Buffalo Coach 
Marv Levy said. "We didn't prepare for a quarterback, we just prepared for the 
run-and-shoot and the things they do." 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive problems brought criticism from Houston's defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get help from the offense," safety Bubba McDowell said. "We got 
to get help. The Patriots scored 35 points against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Christie beat the Oilers in the 1992 wild-card playoff game with an overtime 
field goal that capped the biggest comeback in NFL history for a 41-38 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie warmed up with second-quarter field goals of 37, 42 and 48 yards, 
giving the Bills a 9-0 halftime lead that could have easily been bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie kicked two more field goals in the second half, a 29-yarder in the 
third quarter and a 48-yarder in the fourth period that tied his career high 
for one game. He kicked five field goals against Miami in a playoff game after 
the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, subbing for injured starter Cody Carlson, failed to ignite the 
Oiler offense in the first half, despite the roaring cheers from the crowd when 
he was introduced as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson had several of the scrambles that have made him a crowd-pleaser 
near the end of the game, but they came too late to help the Oilers avert 
defeat.

PRO FOOTBALL; DOLPHINS DO A BIG NUMBER ON JETS, 28-14; AFC: KIRBY'S RUNNING, 
MARINO'S PASSING AND JACKSON'S LATERALING HELP MIAMI DEFEAT RIVALS AND STAY 
UNBEATEN.

 Ingenuity, interceptions and Terry Kirby helped the Miami Dolphins halt the 
hex cast by the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby rushed for 100 yards and a touchdown, an injury-plagued defense 
intercepted four passes and Keith Jackson lateraled to Irving Fryar for a short 
touchdown Sunday as Miami handed New York its first loss, 28-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami (3-0) took sole possession of first place in the AFC East and beat 
division rival New York for only the second time in the last seven tries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired of losing to the Jets," said J.B. Brown, who had an interception 
to set up a touchdown. "Tell all the New Yorkers that live down here that we 
kicked the Jets' butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Marino made Miami's domination complete by completing 23 of 31 passes for 
289 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of this team," Coach Don Shula said. "That was one outstanding 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The quick start bodes well for the Dolphins, who made the playoffs six of the 
seven previous times they began 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good feeling," Marino said, "a lot better than 2-1." 
</P>
<P>
 Jet safety Ronnie Lott said, "Miami gave us an old-fashioned beating." 
</P>
<P>
 Boomer Esiason, whose four interceptions all came in Miami territory, said, 
"We realize we're not the Steelers of the '70s or the Packers of the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby, a second-year player from Virginia, carried 15 times for his first 
100-yard game, helping Miami keep the ball away from the Jets and wearing down 
their defense on a sunny, 90-degree day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way we're going to make it to 'The Show' is to both run and pass the 
ball," Kirby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson caught six passes for 100 yards -- his best effort in three seasons 
with Miami. Jackson also contributed the game's most memorable play when he 
avoided being tackled at the one-yard line by tossing a lateral to Fryar, who 
scored for a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins' defense, depleted by injuries at linebacker and cornerback, 
nonetheless frustrated New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Darrell Malone and rookie linebacker Aubrey Beavers -- both playing 
more because of injuries to others -- came up with the first interceptions of 
their career to thwart early threats. Beavers made a diving catch of a pass 
bobbled by tight end Johnny Mitchell after New York had reached Miami's 39-yard 
line. "We killed ourselves," Mitchell said. "I just want to forget this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Jet defensive end Marvin Washington said, "We started out tight and sloppy, 
and we were consistent. We were tight and sloppy the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Ram Michael Stewart intercepted an Esiason pass in the fourth quarter.

BLEDSOE CARRIES PATRIOTS; AFC: QUARTERBACK THROWS FOR 365 YARDS TO HELP MAKE UP 
FOR POOR PASS DEFENSE IN 31-28 VICTORY OVER BENGALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the same story for the New England Patriots: Drew Bledsoe was 
brilliant, the pass defense pathetic. Only the ending was different 
Sunday--they won. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe set a club passing record and turned the game around with a perfect 
34-yard touchdown pass play to Michael Timpson, sending the thrill-a-minute 
Patriots to a 31-28 victory over the winless Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third consecutive week, the Patriots spent the day making big pass 
plays on offense to make up for big pass plays against their defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was wild," said Coach Bill Parcells, who prefers more of a low-scoring, 
grind-it-out approach. "It was like the other two have been. We were able to 
score pretty well and move the ball pretty well. Our defense went to sleep on a 
few big passes." 
</P>
<P>
 The secondary's lapses helped Cincinnati (0-3) drive 99 yards to score in the 
closing minutes. But New England (1-2) recovered the onside kick and ran out 
the clock, averting a third consecutive letdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bledsoe, "That's a game you have to win in order to start turning the 
season around--0-3 is not insurmountable, but it feels like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe had his club-record fourth consecutive 300-yard game in a wide-open 
offense that has become decidedly un-Parcells. The second-year quarterback 
completed 30 of 50 passes for 365 yards, setting his receivers up for another 
round of big numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Timpson and Ben Coates each surpassed 100 yards receiving for the second week 
in a row by making big play after big play. Bledsoe had 20 completions of at 
least 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe got hit hard only a few times. The Bengals remained the only NFL team 
without a sack partly because of their ineptitude and partly because Bledsoe 
didn't give them much of a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys are doing such a great job protecting me," said Bledsoe, who has 
been sacked just three times in 143 pass plays. "As long as we're winning, let 
me throw every play, especially the way the offensive line is protecting me." 
</P>
<P>
 Klingler completed 21 of 29 passes for a career-high 266 yards against the 
league's worst pass defense but fumbled twice and missed a wide-open Jeff Query 
on a deep pass in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to be able to hold onto the ball," Klingler said. "I turned the ball 
over twice and gave them six points. I missed Jeff Query and we lose the 
ballgame. That's my part." 
</P>
<P>

PRO FOOTBALL; DEFENSE DOES ITS PART IN SAINTS' FIRST VICTORY, 9-7; NFC: THREE 
FIRST-HALF FIELD GOALS BY ANDERSEN IS ENOUGH FOR A VICTORY OVER THE BUCCANEERS.

 Jim Everett, playing only a half, and his backup, Wade Wilson, were unable to 
produce any touchdowns for the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morten Andersen kicked three first-half field goals and the Saints' 
defense came back to life in a 9-7 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory enabled the Saints (1-2) to avoid their worst start in 14 years, 
while denying Tampa Bay (1-2), which missed a 54-yard field goal as time 
expired, its most promising start under Coach Sam Wyche. 
</P>
<P>
 "I challenged the team to play well this week," said New Orleans linebacker 
Sam Mills. "I just spoke about what was on my mind. I thought that we had to 
answer the bell." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen kicked field goals of 43 and 31 yards in the first quarter and Jim 
Everett threw for 31 yards to Wesley Walls to set up another 43-yard kick 
before the half for a 9-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saint defense gave up about 400 yards per game in losses to Kansas City 
and Washington, but only allowed only 232 on Sunday. The unit held up in the 
intense 87-degree heat despite being on the field for most of the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers had the ball for more than 10 minutes of the last quarter, but 
weren't able to do much until quarterback Craig Erickson's 28-yard completion 
to Willie Green on fourth and 27 in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 An 11-yard pass interference penalty against Tyrone Legette at the Saints' 36 
gave Tampa Bay its last hope with one second remaining. The 54-yard field goal 
attempt was within Michael Husted's range, but sailed wide right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is going to give our defense a good deal of confidence for next 
week," Saint Coach Jim Mora said, looking ahead to a game at San Francisco. "I 
felt a good spirit in the locker room after the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett completed 10 of 19 passes for 108 yards for New Orleans before taking 
himself out of the game at halftime because of a sore groin. Wilson was nine of 
12 for 68 yards in the second half.

PRO FOOTBALL; DEFENSE SAVES CUNNINGHAM AND THE EAGLES, 13-7; NFC: FUMBLE ON 
PASS PLAY LATE IN GAME AGAINST PACKERS COULD HAVE BEEN COSTLY FOR PHILADELPHIA. 
</P>

<P>
 Randall Cunningham almost became a throwback to Joe Pisarcik. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles appeared to have wrapped up a 13-7 victory over the Green Bay 
Packers on Sunday when Cunningham scrambled for a first down after the Eagles 
had been pinned back deep in their own territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of simply running out the clock, Cunningham rolled to his left to 
pass. And of course the worst happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of just taking a sack, he tried to get off a pass as he was hit by 
Steve McMichael and Don Davey. The ball popped loose and Sean Jones recovered, 
giving Green Bay the ball at the 16 with 2:03 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Eagle defense, as it had all day, came through again. On fourth and 
one at the six, Brett Favre threw in the right flat to Edgar Bennett, who was 
stuffed by cornerback Otis Smith for virtually no gain. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, the Eagles were the beneficiaries of one of the biggest blunders in 
NFL history. Pisarcik, who was later with the Eagles, was the quarterback of 
the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 All Pisarcik needed to do to wrap up a victory over the Eagles was to kneel. 
Instead, he tried to hand off to Larry Csonka. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball was fumbled and the Eagles' Herman Edwards returned it for a 
touchdown and a 19-17 victory. The coach who called the play was fired that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 So Cunningham, Coach Rich Kotite and offensive coordinator Zeke Bratkowski 
were all breathing a little easier after the Eagles escaped on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how a defense, when a mistake is made, smothers the opponent," Kotite 
said. "That's what winning football teams do, and that's what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 On another big play earlier in the quarter, defensive end Mike Flores stopped 
Bennett on fourth and one at the Eagle 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes later, linebacker William Thomas had a 13-yard sack that moved 
the ball out of field-goal range. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles got all the offense they needed on two 26-yard field goals by Eddie 
Murray and a one-yard touchdown run by Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie White, the defensive end whose illustrious eight-year career with the 
Eagles earned him a spot on the NFL's All 75-Year team, was consistently 
double- and triple-teamed in his first game in Philadelphia since joining the 
Packers before last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra attention limited White to three tackles, although he drew three 
holding penalties on tackle Broderick Thomas.

PRO FOOTBALL; VIKINGS DELIVER OLD-FASHIONED WHIPPING; NFC: MINNESOTA PUTS 
TOGETHER A COMPLETE GAME AND LEAVES THE BEARS EMBARRASSED, 42-14. 
</P>

<P>
 The Minnesota Vikings celebrated the NFL's "Throwbacks Weekend" with a 
dominant performance Sunday, delivering an old-fashioned beating to the Chicago 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's the uniforms, it's the players," said Coach Dennis Green, 
reflecting on the 42-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings played basic football behind the passing of Warren Moon, the 
running of Terry Allen, the receiving of Cris Carter and an 81-yard 
interception return for a touchdown by DeWayne Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a complete game," Green said. "The special teams caused 
turnovers. We played good run defense and running was our No. 1 option. It was 
a good, solid, complete game for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bear Coach Dave Wannstedt: "We got whipped in all areas. I am 
embarrassed. We've got to regroup and somehow get this thing back on track. It 
wasn't any one person, it wasn't any one phase." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago (1-2) had trouble bringing down Allen and containing Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who had two touchdown runs, gained 159 yards in 22 carries. Carter had 
eight catches for 79 yards in the first half, when the Vikings took a 10-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are on our way," Carter said. "We have a lot of talent. This is the best 
team since I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
 Moon completed 22 of 29 passes for 236 yards as the Viking offense, which had 
only one touchdown entering the game, got untracked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good day for everybody, the offensive line, the running backs," Moon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear linebacker Joe Cain, who started in the middle in place of an injured 
Dante Jones, said, "It wasn't just the quarterback. It was everyone else. It 
was ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen had a 44-yard run on the first scrimmage play of the second half and the 
Vikings (2-1) reached Chicago's nine before settling for Fuad Reveiz's 22-yard 
field goal for a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Conway fumbled the ensuing kickoff and Minnesota's Dave Garnett 
recovered at the Bear 18. Moon wasted little time, hitting Jake Reed over the 
middle on the first play for a 20-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, a rookie from North Carolina State, stepped in front of Conway, 
the second-year receiver from USC, and raced down the sideline on his 81-yard 
return with 6:25 left in the quarter. Carter caught a two-point pass for a 28-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was running for a while," Washington said. "I didn't know how long 
it was. I thought it was maybe 60 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen tacked on a one-yard touchdown run before Chicago scored on Tim Worley's 
one-yard run with 9:18 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings' Robert Smith had a 14-yard touchdown run to make it 42-6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears' Tom Waddle caught an eight-yard pass from Erik Kramer for the final 
score.

PRO FOOTBALL; VERSATILE MEGGETT LEADS GIANTS PAST REDSKINS; NFC: RUNNING BACK 
RUSHES FOR TWO TOUCHDOWNS, PASSES FOR ANOTHER AS NEW YORK DEFEATS WASHINGTON, 
31-23. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If Dave Meggett doesn't beat you one way, he'll beat you another. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask the Washington Redskins, who saw the New York Giants' most versatile 
player beat them in every way -- running, receiving and passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Called on to carry the offense in the absence of the injured Rodney Hampton, 
Meggett responded with two short touchdown runs and a 16-yard touchdown pass to 
Aaron Pierce in New York's 31-23 victory over the Redskins on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the day, Meggett had a career-high 26 carries for 82 yards, caught four 
passes for 52 more and had the one touchdown pass. The 5-foot-7, 195-pounder, 
given the day off from punt and kick-return duty, was in on 31 of the Giants' 
55 offensive plays. Meggett has thrown three passes in his career -- all for 
touchdowns against the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Brown did the rest of the damage against Washington (1-2), completing 14 
of 19 passes for 221 yards and a 30-yard touchdown pass play to Mike Sherrard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave isn't going to grind people up, but you have to use what you've got," 
Giant Coach Dan Reeves said of Meggett. "We didn't change a lot. We used him 
more as a receiver, because he's a little better than Rodney and he does throw 
that halfback option pretty well. He really likes to throw it against the 
Redskins." 
</P>
<P>
 Meggett scored the Giants' first touchdown on a two-yard run 4:55 into the 
game, and then took over in the second half after the Redskins had taken a 
20-17 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opening drive of the third quarter, Meggett took a handoff from Brown, 
ran to his right and found Pierce in the end zone to put the Giants ahead, 
24-20, with 11:40 left in the period. He ended his day with a spinning one-yard 
scoring run with 7:09 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Meggett's touchdown pass, though, was the turning point between the NFC East 
rivals. It ended a six-play, 57-yard drive that included a 15-yard reception by 
the sixth-year player from Towson State. 
</P>
<P>
 For Washington, the loss overshadowed another strong effort by John Friesz, 
who completed 32 of 50 passes for a career-high 381 yards and two touchdowns. 
The 10,000 Club 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's Henry Ellard became the 10th NFL player with at least 10,000 
receiving yards Sunday, getting 197 in 10 catches against the New York Giants.

CARDINALS REMAIN WINLESS; INTERCONFERENCE: MCMAHON ISN'T THE ANSWER ON OFFENSE 
AND DEFENSE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE IN 32-0 LOSS TO CLEVELAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No way, the Arizona Cardinals had promised. No way would a team coached by 
defensive mastermind Buddy Ryan go 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals were so sure of themselves, their boastful prediction made it 
into a Cleveland newspaper that was tacked on the Browns' bulletin board all 
week. And the Browns clearly took offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an insult for somebody to say they're going to come in here and 
do it in your stadium," Brown Coach Bill Belichick said after his team pummeled 
the Cardinals, 32-0, Sunday on the strength of a 29-point second half that left 
Ryan groping for clues. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in Ryan's six years as a head coach -- five of them in 
Philadelphia -- that one of his teams was shut out. Perhaps equally disturbing 
was the way his fabled "46" defense failed to pressure Cleveland's Vinny 
Testaverde into the kinds of mistakes he'd made the previous two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our offense is fixable," Ryan said. "It's just a matter of people 
starting to pick up the blitz and taking a stand and playing tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody quit on me today. I pulled a couple of guys because 
they just didn't have that look in their eye that I want to see. I don't know 
how to explain it. It's that deep look." 
</P>
<P>
 But wholesale personnel changes won't help, said Ryan, adding that he plans 
only a few subtle adjustments this week as the Cardinals wait out a bye. 
Arizona had been picked by many to be one of the most improved teams in the NFL 
this season and a playoff contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (0-3), uninspired by Ryan's decision to start Jim McMahon at 
quarterback in place of Steve Beuerlein, was shut out for the first time since 
1991. The Browns (2-1) got their first shutout at Cleveland Stadium since 1983 
and their first on any field since 1991, stopping the Cardinals on the 2 with 
one second left. 
</P>
<P>
 Intercepted six times in the previous two games, Testaverde passed for 248 
yards and two touchdowns, ran for another and was sacked just once. He threw 
one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Testaverde connected with rookie Derrick Alexander on an 81-yard play that put 
Cleveland ahead, 25-0, midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Eric Turner then added the exclamation point, a 93-yard interception 
return with two minutes left after Jay Schroeder had replaced McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was under a lot of pressure from last week's performance (four 
interceptions in a loss to Pittsburgh), coming in against the No. 1 defense," 
Testaverde said. "I was thinking about it all week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals entered the game with the NFL's lowest-ranked offense, and they 
looked it. 
</P>
<P>
 They had minus-one yard on offense in the first quarter, didn't get a first 
down until 10 minutes remained in the second quarter, and got past midfield 
five times in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't deserve to start after the way I played today," McMahon said. "I 
don't know what it is. I'm not blaming anybody else. I stunk it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gut-check time. We're 0-3. We're not out of it by any means. But if we 
don't start winning ballgames. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns started slowly on offense but got a lift late in the first quarter 
when rookie Antonio Langham intercepted McMahon's pass to set them up at the 
Arizona 31. Seven plays later, Matt Stover kicked a 32-yard field goal for a 
3-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Short punts led to the Browns' two third-quarter touchdowns -- Testaverde's 
one-yard sneak and Tommy Vardell's 16-yard reception. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns added a two-point conversion after Vardell's score, with holder Tom 
Tupa picking up the ball and running up the middle for an 18-0 lead.

PRO FOOTBALL; OFFENSIVE LINE RISES TO THE OCCASION; RAIDERS: AFTER FAILING TO 
OPEN HOLES THIS SEASON, IT DOMINATES THE BRONCOS AND GIVES HOSTETLER SOME 
BREATHING ROOM.

<P>
 If the Denver Broncos did not have an inferiority complex in regard to the 
Raiders before Sunday, they sure have one now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't need any added motivation to get ready to play them," Denver tight 
end Shannon Sharpe said after the Raiders' 48-16 victory. "There's really no 
excuse the way they beat us. They straight out kicked our butts in our own back 
yard in every phase of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Raiders handed the Broncos their worst home defeat in 28 years, 
Denver fans rained boos on their beloved Broncos as they left the field mixed 
with a chant of "Wade must go!" throughout the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I don't have the answers or we would be doing better," Denver 
Coach Wade Phillips said. "This is certainly the low point for me." 
</P>
<P>
 And losing to the Raiders, which the Broncos (0-3) have done in 10 of their 
last 11 meetings, is something Bronco owner Pat Bowlen rates with losing four 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing three times to the Raiders last season, including a season-ending 
wild-card playoff game, Denver spent the entire off-season committed to 
defeating its arch-rivals this year. 
</P>
<P>
 From trying to steal Tim Brown from the Raiders, to signing proven veterans 
such as wide receivers Anthony Miller and Mike Pritchard, and running back 
Leonard Russell, the Broncos believed that they had upgraded their offense. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat the Raiders' big-play offense, Denver went out and added 
hard-hitting defensive players such as cornerback Ray Crockett, safety Ben 
Smith and defensive tackle Ted Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did the Raiders dominate so thoroughly Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't know until we get to look at the film," Crockett said. "But I do know 
they just came out and took it to us." 
</P>
<P>
 When they sit down today and review the game, Crockett and his teammates will 
find the answer in the Raiders' offensive line. From the Raiders' first 
possession, Don Mosebar, Steve Wisniewski, Kevin Gogan, Gerald Perry and Bruce 
Wilkerson took matters upon themselves and controlled the game. 
</P>
<P>
 After being criticized for a poor rushing attack, the Raiders ran for 53 yards 
on a seven-play, 58-yard scoring drive. They opened hole after hole for Tyrone 
Montgomery and Tom Rathman as they gained more yards on the first drive than 
they had all season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were going to come out and try to run the ball," Phillips said. 
"We just didn't stop them. We just didn't match up well." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Broncos' defensive front on the ropes, the Raiders changed things up 
with play-action passes on running downs. Quarterback Jeff Hostetler had plenty 
of time to find open receivers, thanks to his front line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offensive line was determined to establish some kind of running game," 
said Brown, who caught seven passes for 136 yards. "They were really gung-ho." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the Raiders' rushing game started rolling, Denver found itself searching 
for defensive answers. The Raiders took a 21-3 first-quarter lead and never 
looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played terrible football in the first half and once we tried to fight 
back, mistakes certainly hurt us," Phillips said. "We started out playing bad 
and we lost our poise." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Raider defensive lineman Nolan Harrison: "They hate us and we hate them. 
I don't buy the psychological stuff. They came out and tried to beat us. If a 
team comes out and beats us all the time, our number one priority would be to 
come and beat the hell out of them. So, it's better them than us."

 Defenseman Rob Blake broke a 3-3 tie with a power-play goal early in the third 
period as the Kings edged the San Jose Sharks, 4-3, in an exhibition game 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake beat goalie Wade Flaherty from the top of the slot at 1:13 of the third 
period for the decisive goal.

 Wayne Gretzky scored his first exhibition goal of the year when he took a pass 
from Jari Kurri and scored on the power play at 9:36 of the second period.

FAIRPLEX; FAVORITE DEFEATED IN FEATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When she's right, Southern Truce is a match for any horse in the nation, as 
she proved two years ago with a victory over Paseana at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are also dark days, like Aug. 21 at Ellis Park in Kentucky, where 
she finished seventh as the 2-1 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 It was later discovered that Southern Truce had an excuse for that dismal 
showing. She developed an illness during shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no apparent excuse Saturday at Fairplex Park, where odds-on favorite 
Southern Truce hooked up in a speed duel with Steff Graff and both were run 
down by Fantastic Kim, who won the $50,000 E.B. Johnston Stakes by three 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, Southern Truce's trainer, Roger Stein, found plenty of 
excuses. He was fuming at his jockey, David Flores, and also at Steff Graff's 
trainer, Jude T. Feld, and jockey Brian Edie. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's a horse like that even doing in a race like this?" Stein said. "You 
don't send a 24-1 shot out there with a class horse. That's why bettors get mad 
out there. Those kind of horses don't belong on the same track with good ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Stein was mad at Flores because he didn't want Southern Truce on the lead 
early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rode the horse the way I thought I had to," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores took Southern Truce to the lead in the 1 1/16-mile race and was 
challenged by Steff Graff and Certam De May. Southern Truce finally took 
command briefly after two turns, but Fantastic Kim, ridden by Joey Castro, was 
in perfect position to make a move. 
</P>
<P>
 That move came nearing the far turn and by the time the horses hit the top of 
the stretch, the only question was the final margin of victory. Horse Racing 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lifebuoy, a 3-year-old, collapsed shortly after the finish of the second, a 
four-furlong race for Appaloosas. He got up under his own power and was taken 
away in a van to be examined. Jockey Brian Long, who pulled the horse up when 
he noticed it was bleeding, was uninjured and rode in the next race. . . . 
Aquiles, ridden by Cornilio Velasquez, won the 1 1/8-mile Panama Premio in 
Panama City, where Laffit Pincay Jr. was being honored. Pincay's mount in the 
race, Patricio, finished out of the money.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southland-based Dramatic Gold won the Molson Export Million by 1 1/2 lengths 
at Woodbine in Toronto on Sunday, ending Canada's string of success in the race 
for 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 The gelding, owned by John and Betty Mabee of San Diego, was the first 
American-bred to win the 8-year-old race since Prized won in 1989. 
Canadian-breds had won the last four races. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic Gold, running out of the No. 11 hole, took the lead by going 
three-wide at the quarter-pole. Corey Nakatani, leading rider at the recent Del 
Mar meeting, held Dramatic Gold off the pace set by Nice To Know, making his 
move on the final turn to cover the 1 1/8 miles on the dirt in 1:49 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pushed the button and he gave me everything he had to win the race," 
Nakatani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic Gold, who earned $600,000, was the second betting choice and paid 
$8.60, $4.60 and $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce's Mill paid $6.30 and $3.50. Concern, a slight favorite over Dramatic 
Gold, returned $2.80. Golden Gear finished fourth, followed by Basqueian, Powis 
Castle, Parental Pressure, Road Rush, Unaccounted For, Nice To Know and Alynar.

 Florida widened its margin over Nebraska from nine points to 17 points after 
beating Tennessee, 31-0, on Saturday, the Volunteers' worst home defeat in 70 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators received 33 first-place votes and 1,507 points from a nationwide 
media panel. Nebraska, which defeated visiting UCLA, 49-21, got 20 first-place 
votes and 1,490 points.

ROWING; U.S. GETS FAST START, WINS FEATURED EIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. men's eight-oared shell defeated reigning world champion Germany in 
the final day of competition at the 1994 World Rowing Championships on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans got off to a fast start, and by the halfway point of the race, 
1,000 meters, the U.S. team had a full boat length lead over the crew from 
Romania, and the German crew, unable to match the brutal pace, had slipped to 
fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States started off the day with a silver medal in the men's four 
with coxswain, behind Romania, matching the best U.S. finish in this event 
since 1984. Close on the heels of this race was the women's four-without 
coxswain, which was another silver-medal finish for the United States, this 
time behind the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest upset of the regatta came in the women's single scull, when 
favored Silken Laumann of Canada, Olympic medalist and world champion, had two 
false starts charged against her and was disqualified from the race. Trine 
Hansen of Denmark went on to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States claimed its first gold medal in the women's lightweight 
four-without coxswain. Great Britain made a mad rush to catch the Americans in 
the last 500 meters of the race but with a furious sprint, the Americans held 
on to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The regatta marked the first time that the World Rowing Championships have 
been held in the United States. The last major regatta in the United States was 
the 1984 Olympics at Lake Casitas.

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY; SKATING RULES LEAVE BONALY UP IN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The CBS search for sports programming to fill its lost weekends, liberalized 
eligibility rules that have given Brian Boitano, Kristi Yamaguchi and others 
new competitive life and, of course, the Tonya vs. Nancy afterglow are dynamics 
that have combined to create more opportunities for more figure skaters than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tug-of-war among traditional governing bodies, independent promoters, 
television networks and agents for the sport's few marketable names, such as 
Boitano and Yamaguchi, has also created more confusion than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, try to figure out the status of France's Surya Bonaly. 
</P>
<P>
 The French federation announced last month that Bonaly, the four-time European 
champion and 1994 world championships silver medalist, would compete in the 
U.S. Figure Skating Assn.'s annual invitational, Skate America, Oct. 27-30 in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bonaly's agent, Michael Rosenberg of Palm Desert, recently announced that 
she will open her season in an Oct. 1 professional competition in Sun Valley, 
Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 If Bonaly competes in Idaho, she would not be eligible for Skate America 
because the Sun Valley event, promoted by Michael Berg, is not sanctioned by 
the USFSA. 
</P>
<P>
 The USFSA, however, has entered into negotiations that could result in Berg 
receiving a sanction. 
</P>
<P>
 That would free Bonaly to compete in Skate America. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Rosenberg announced, Bonaly also is entered in an unsanctioned 
professional competition in Cleveland on Oct. 19. As negotiations between its 
promoter, Dick Button, and the USFSA are not as likely to result in 
sanctioning, Bonaly again would be out of Skate America. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if Bonaly chooses to compete in events that do not have the 
blessing of the USFSA, she could still apply for reinstatement to the 
International Skating Union that would allow her to compete in the 1998 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 She must first submit her application to French federation officials, and they 
say that they will not pass it on to the ISU if she competes this season in 
unsanctioned events. 
</P>
<P>
 ISU council members, including USFSA President Claire Ferguson, met over the 
weekend in Zurich, Switzerland, in an attempt to restore order. They should 
suspend all eligibility rules for one year, which would give interested parties 
an opportunity to sit down with each other and decide the best course for the 
sport and its athletes. One can only hope they would exhibit more vision than 
the parties involved in the baseball strike. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Gwen Torrence in the 200, Jackie Joyner-Kersee was one of only two 
U.S. women to lead individual events in this year's outdoor track and field 
listings.  
</P>
<P>
 But although she was first in the long jump, she dropped to third in an event 
she has dominated in recent years -- the heptathlon -- behind two Germans, 
Heike Drechsler and Sabine Braun. Competing in her first heptathlon in 13 
years, Drechsler was the world leader with the 6,741 points that she scored two 
weeks ago in Talence, France. Asked if she is setting her sights on 
Joyner-Kersee's world record of 7,291, Drechsler said, "One never knows. If I'm 
motivated." She was motivated to compete in Talence by a $30,000 appearance 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Track and field's male athlete of the year: Is it Great Britain's Colin 
Jackson, who won all 20 110-meter hurdles races he entered, or Algeria's 
Noureddine Morceli, world leader in the 1,500, the 3,000 and the mile? . . . 
U.S. athletes showed so little interest in track and field's recent World Cup 
in London that International Amateur Athletic Federation President Primo 
Nebiolo says they might not have a separate team in future events. They would 
have to qualify as part of a team representing the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Gymnastics Federation is waiting to hear whether two-time world 
all-around champion Shannon Miller will try to represent the United States in 
the Nov. 11-20 world team championships in Dortmund, Germany.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller's coach, Steve Nunno, said previously that she needs a break after 
finishing second in the all-around in her two most recent competitions, the 
Goodwill Games and the U.S. championships. If Miller decides she wants to 
compete in Dortmund, she must qualify for the U.S. team in an Oct. 15-16 meet 
in Richmond, Va.

 Chinese sports officials win the gold medal for double standards. After 
lecturing International Olympic Committee members last year not to allow 
politics to interfere with sports in the vote for the site of the 2000 Summer 
Olympics, the Chinese are threatening to boycott next month's Asian Games in 
Hiroshima if Japanese authorities allow Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, to 
enter the country for the opening ceremony.

HYDROPLANE RACING; VILLWOCK PICKS UP THE PIECES, WINS FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Villwock overcame a blown engine, a swimmer in his racing lane and the 
fastest unlimited hydroplane racers in the world to win the Bayfair '94 before 
an estimated crowd of 60,000 on a sunny Sunday at Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second victory in San Diego for the lanky former crew chief for 
Chip Hanauer who became a racer two years when he drove Coors Light to victory 
in his first unlimited race. It was also Villwock's second consecutive victory 
after winning the Texaco Cup last month in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Villwock almost didn't make the five-lap final after "blowing my engine into a 
million bits and pieces" during the third and final heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an incredible team effort," Villwock said. "We were in a deep, deep 
hole and they pulled me out. We had a steering problem (in the heat) and that 
led to the engine exploding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I entered a turn at a bad angle and when the boat hit a big wake it bounced 
up and the propeller got out of the water. The engine revved to the moon." 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion ripped holes in the side of the boat and wing, splintered the 
bottom and damaged the engine beyond repair. One metal piece flew nearly a 
quarter of a mile, across adjacent Ingraham Boulevard into a parking area where 
it hit a car and punched a hole through the door and shattered a window. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the final, we had good speed at the beginning and once we got the lead 
from Miss Budweiser, we motored away," Villwock said. "I was in the center (of 
the course) at the start and was just trying to hold my line because I was 
trapped between two white walls of water." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Villwock is not as well known as Hanauer or Mark Tate, the victory 
was not a big surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Von's American Dream was the fastest qualifier with a lap of 166.027 
m.p.h. on Friday and the boat has won seven of its last eight heats -- here and 
Seattle -- losing only the one in which the engine exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Villwock averaged a course-record 149.330 m.p.h. in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanauer, in Miss Budweiser, was running a solid second until the third lap 
when the rear wing broke off his boat and Tate moved Smokin' Joe's up to finish 
second behind Von's American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the way the day started out, we're pretty happy to finish second 
and move closer to the (driver's) championship," Tate said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the day's first heat, Tate was leading after half a lap when the throttle 
cable broke, leaving the boat dead in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate has a 1,484-point lead over Nate Brown, driver of The Tide, with one race 
remaining, Oct. 16 in Honolulu, where the maximum point total available is 
1,600. In the boat championship, Miss Budweiser leads Smokin' Joe's by 404 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was delayed nearly an hour during the third heat when Veronica 
Lynn Morrison, 25, of La Mesa, was spotted swimming in the middle of the racing 
lanes as four 6,000-pound boats were circling the course for the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve David, in Miss T-Plus, spotted her on his first staging lap and radioed 
his crew, who informed racing officials. A helicopter hovered over her as the 
boats were told to shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the helicopter down close to the water and then I saw her," Tate said. 
"My first thought was she fell out of the helicopter." 
</P>
<P>
 She was directly in the middle of Tate's lane, forcing him to make an abrupt 
turn to the right to miss her. Because the boats were sitting in the salt water 
so long, they were brought back to the pits and lifted from the water and 
restarted nearly an hour later. The woman was charged with obstructing 
navigation on Mission Bay.

PROFILE; NEW FED VICE CHAIRMAN SEEKS BALANCE AFTER LONG SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Alan Blinder, it has been a disorienting summer. 
</P>
<P>
 When it began, he was a member of a White House economic team characterized in 
a best-selling book as overly conservative. Blinder and his colleagues, 
journalist-author Bob Woodward wrote in "The Agenda," had coerced President 
Clinton to abandon his liberal campaign pledges and to focus instead on deficit 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 By Labor Day, Blinder was being characterized as a closet liberal, a 
Democratic outrider in his new institutional home, the Federal Reserve Board. 
Press accounts portrayed the Fed's new vice chairman as indifferent to the 
risks of inflation, and overly preoccupied with the impact of interest rate 
increases on jobs and employment. 
</P>
<P>
 A magazine columnist, reacting to a recent speech by Blinder about 
unemployment, proclaimed him unfit to succeed Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman. 
Inside the clubby central bank, some conservatives clucked that Blinder, the 
first Democrat appointed to the Fed in 14 years, might hurt their credibility 
where they believe it matters most -- on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 To be attacked from both ends of the political spectrum within the space of a 
few months is a rare feat for an economics professor from Princeton with little 
avowed interest in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was seen as being a moderate or slightly to the right of center in the 
White House, but here I'm seen as being left of center," Blinder sighed in an 
interview last week. "I can understand it, because at the White House everyone 
is a Democrat, and I was slightly to the right of center there. The Fed is a 
conservative institution, and the center is different here than it is at the 
White House."  
</P>
<P>
 It was an important revelation for Blinder, one that helped him recognize the 
need to pay more attention to how he is portrayed publicly at the Fed. Somewhat 
naively, Blinder thought he had left such spin-control concerns behind when he 
escaped the hothouse environment at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference between the White House and the Fed is like night and day," 
Blinder observed in his quiet office along the marbled corridors of the Fed's 
headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you have time to think; there, everything was frenetic, and we worried 
all the time about message. Here, message has very little to do with what we do 
. . . but this episode shows that maybe I should be paying a little more 
attention to it." It is a fact of life in official Washington: Perception -- 
even within the cloistered walls of the Fed -- has a nasty habit of becoming 
reality. And relearning that harsh lesson might help Blinder survive the recent 
flap and live up to initial expectations that he would succeed Greenspan as Fed 
chairman when his term expires in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy surrounding the 48-year-old economist reflects the nuances and 
subtleties buried deep in U.S. monetary policy. It flared up following press 
reports about Blinder's remarks at a Federal Reserve conference on unemployment 
in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in late August. In a speech, Blinder said that over the 
short term, Fed policies designed to fight inflation can indeed cost jobs, but 
over long periods of time he believes there is no real impact on employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, central banks, or more generally macroeconomic policies, do 
indeed have a role in reducing unemployment as well as in reducing inflation 
(in the short run)," Blinder said in Wyoming. But efforts to fine-tune monetary 
policy appear to have no long-lasting effects on unemployment, he added, and 
lax money policies eventually lead to higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where employment is concerned, macroeconomics is everything in the short run, 
but nothing in the long run," Blinder warned. 
</P>
<P>
 To many economists and Clinton Administration officials, Blinder's remarks 
were not that startling. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the White House 
Council of Economic Advisers, described them as coming straight out of the 
economic textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his speech created quite a stir among some Fed officials. It 
particularly rankled those who hold the conservative view that even talking 
about the possibility of trade-off between inflation and employment threatens 
to undermine the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy was fanned by a New York Times article suggesting that the 
Jackson Hole address reflected a rift between Blinder and Greenspan over 
monetary policy. It noted that Greenspan has suggested publicly that the Fed's 
only objective should be fighting inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 That story, in turn, prompted Newsweek economic columnist Robert J. Samuelson 
to charge that Blinder is "soft on inflation." Then the Wall Street Journal's 
conservative editorial page chided that "we've all enjoyed the spectacle of 
Alan Blinder's education as a central banker." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all economic experts found Blinder's comments objectionable. Some were 
surprised that the press had portrayed the issue as a Greenspan-Blinder battle. 
After all, they noted, Blinder's first major decision since joining the Fed was 
to vote with Greenspan in mid-August to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consensus in the profession is that there is a short-run trade-off 
between inflation and unemployment," noted Allen Sinai, chief global economist 
at Lehman Brothers. "There is an argument over how long that will last, whether 
it is one or two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I thought it was OK for Blinder to remind people (of that trade-off.) 
That doesn't mean he is soft on inflation. And I don't think there is any rift 
between Blinder and Greenspan now. There might be some intellectual nuances or 
differences between them, but there is no reason Blinder and Greenspan have to 
talk and think exactly alike." 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder dismisses the whole controversy as a "tempest in a teapot." 
Nonetheless, he felt compelled to talk to Greenspan about the alleged rift. 
Both agreed there is no fundamental difference between them on monetary policy, 
Blinder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan declined to comment on the matter, and a Fed spokesman said the 
central bank had no official comment either. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his initial hazing, Blinder said he doesn't regret making the move 
from the White House to the Fed. What he gave up in access to the President, he 
has more than made up in increased independence and authority. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long career at Princeton, Blinder served intermittently as an economic 
adviser to the Clinton campaign in 1992, then joined the new Administration as 
Tyson's deputy at the Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder played a pivotal role in a wide range of policy fronts: He helped 
shape Clinton's 1993 economic plan, and served as a member of the negotiating 
team sent to Japan to hammer out an agreement on a new framework for bilateral 
trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder also brought to the White House a skeptical eye on the subject of 
health care reform. Early on, he privately raised many of the concerns that 
helped sink the Administration plan when it finally reached Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 When a vacancy on the Fed's seven-member board of governors appeared early 
this year, the White House offered the post to Blinder, but he rejected it. 
When the Fed vice chairmanship opened up a few weeks later, Blinder was more 
interested. The position offered greater status and increased power -- and the 
possibility of succeeding Greenspan when his second term as chairman expires in 
March, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he assumed his new post in June, Blinder was already being 
assailed by Fed watchers who had read his past columns in Business Week. The 
critics characterized him as a liberal who might upset the delicate 
conservative balance within the Fed. His comments in Wyoming fanned those 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the Jackson Hole flap has any lasting impact on Blinder's credibility 
as a Fed member or his standing as Greenspan's heir apparent is still unclear. 
Even critics say it all will be forgotten if Blinder recognizes it was a 
learning experience, and realizes that his words now carry more weight than 
they did when he was a Princeton professor. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Blinder just wants to forget the whole thing. He said the controversy 
has had no serious impact on his work, and he is sticking to his guns about 
what he thinks should be done with Fed monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Blinder's policy preferences appear to be closer to his colleagues 
than some critics believe, he clearly does not intend to launch a crusade for 
zero inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could get economic growth of about 2.5% per year and inflation of 3%, 
and we could keep that for several years," he said, "I would be ecstatic."

 OCTOBER CLASSIC? Major league baseball has struck out, but Orange County fans 
can still find plenty of college sports to watch, even baseball. . . . Local 
teams will soon start fall training, and Costa Mesa's Southern California 
College -- including pitcher Ila Borders, one of the few women ever to compete 
at the college level -- plays its first practice game Oct. 11 against a team of 
community college players. . . . Coach Charlie Phillips says it's a good show: 
"I like our game because, unlike the pros, we play fast and quick. You can get 
in a good game in about two hours." 
</P>
<P>
 FOOTBALL BUZZ: Chapman University, which Saturday at Whittier started its 
first football season in 62 years, is preparing for its home opener at 7 p.m. 
this Saturday against Claremont, and Athletic Director Dave Currey says 
excitement is building. . . . "I can't say we've sold 16,000 season tickets," 
he said. "But I've talked to more faculty in the last two weeks about coming to 
an athletic game than I have in the last four years." 
</P>
<P>
 NO WAY OUT: UC Irvine's nationally ranked water polo team is down to its last 
line of defense. Junior Jeremy Storton, heir apparent to All-American 
goaltender Mike Rall, suffered a detached retina and is out indefinitely, so 
freshman Tom Davis from La Habra High is the only goalie. . . . "I told him to 
go get a flu shot right now," said Irvine Coach Ted Newland. "I've got nobody 
else, and it's been a long time since I've been in the cage." Newland shouldn't 
have to worry about Davis' staying eligible -- the biology major was a high 
school salutatorian.

STREET SMART: THE REASONS BEHIND THE WIDENING OF MACARTHUR BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I want an update on an issue that I know you have covered before -- the lane 
width on northbound MacArthur Boulevard north of Ford Road where Irvine and 
Newport Beach adjoin. I know that Caltrans said it was planning on taking care 
of it later. When is later? 
</P>
<P>
 You should understand that Caltrans recently widened MacArthur Boulevard down 
the hill 100 yards or so, and it is three lanes wide from there all the way to 
the San Diego Freeway. Caltrans also widened the northbound lanes just south of 
the intersection with Ford so it is three lanes and includes a right-turn lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that it narrows back down to two lanes almost immediately. This 
narrowing causes a crunch because some people have changed into the far right 
lane just before the intersection to get around cars. But after the 
intersection, they have to move back a lane to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 That is dangerous because they also have to avoid people trying to enter from 
Ford Road into what looks like their entry lane. 
</P>
<P>
 What is really silly is that when Caltrans widened MacArthur, it put all the 
added width into the center divider lane and into the southbound lanes, which 
didn't need it.  
</P>
<P>
 There are four southbound lanes from Bison Avenue to Ford. Only three of them 
are marked, but frequently people use all the width available. There is no way 
the traffic needs all of that width. It's needed on the other side of the road. 
 
</P>
<P>
 My suggestion is that Caltrans reconfigure the striping to all three lanes up 
and three down instead of four and two. If that can't be done, the far right 
lane before the Ford Road intersection should be made a right-turn only, a 
change that would keep motorists from using it as a blast-through lane. That 
would allow a driver to turn right from Ford Road onto MacArthur without having 
the fear of being run down. 
</P>

<P>
 The most recent improvements to the MacArthur Boulevard-Ford Road intersection 
were completed by the city of Newport Beach, responded Rose Orem, a Caltrans 
spokeswoman. The improvement project you mentioned provides a third northbound 
lane that allows more vehicles to pass through the signalized intersection, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans reviewed the accident history for this location and did not find a 
high occurrence of accidents, Orem said. Traffic engineers maintain that the 
two northbound lanes are enough to accommodate current peak traffic volumes. 
Besides, the most recent traffic count indicated that more vehicles travel 
southbound during the morning commute, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plans to begin construction in 1996 to widen MacArthur Boulevard to 
three lanes in each direction from East Coast Highway to Ford Road, Orem said. 
And within the next two to five years, there are planned improvements for 
MacArthur north of Ford as part of a realignment to provide access to the San 
Joaquin Hills Toll Road, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 This letter is written to request information concerning the design of 
freeways not only in Orange County, but in almost the entire state.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems that not much thought was given for entering and exiting freeways. 
Lines of traffic, especially in South Orange County, are almost always backed 
up on both the entrance and exit ramps, causing horrendous tie-ups and unsafe 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Either synchronization with surface traffic signals at these junctures was not 
well thought out, or perhaps basic design flaws existed from early planning and 
design.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, thruways, parkways and expressways in the East are designed with 
a cloverleaf design as the basis for entering and exiting. When traffic enters 
or exits, it does so in its own independent space, not tied up with left or 
right turns off the freeways, or in lanes that serve as freeway entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems California has gone out of its way to do just the opposite. How many 
times have you heard people remark, "I got off the freeway there, but I 
couldn't find the entrance to get back on!" 
</P>
<P>
 Also, could you explain why freeway crossings in some areas are labeled 
"separations" as opposed to other areas where they are called "intersections." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Too many vehicles, not design flaws, are the reason for traffic tie-ups at the 
intersection of local streets with freeway entrance and exit ramps, Caltrans 
spokeswoman Rose Orem said. Any time the demand exceeds the capacity, as it 
does during peak commuter hours, motorists will experience congestion 
regardless of synchronized lights, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is responsible for most traffic signals where local streets join 
freeway ramps. The local agency, that is, the city or county, is responsible 
for all other traffic signals on local streets. In a few instances, Caltrans 
has granted the local agency control of the traffic signals at the intersection 
where a local street meets with a freeway ramp, Orem said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-quadrant cloverleaf interchange is much more costly to build than a 
diamond or a partial cloverleaf design, Orem said. It also requires more land, 
which is hard to come by in the densely populated urban areas of Orange County, 
and where right-of-way costs are prohibitive.  
</P>
<P>
 With the cloverleaf, motorists have no room to accelerate when they are making 
the loop in a circular motion, Orem said. Also, the distance is too short to 
allow motorists to change lanes and get out of the way of the motorists going 
left to enter the freeway or right to leave it, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Your questions of why and where freeways cross and what these joining points 
are called is addressed in the state's Highway Design Manual, Orem said. Where 
an interstate or state highway crosses over another interstate or state 
highway, the structure that carries the one highway over the other is called a 
separation. A freeway intersection is the term used when a freeway off-ramp 
exits onto a local street, Orem said. 
</P>

 Board members voted Aug. 11 to drop charges against Chief Fiscal Officer Joyce 
Capelle, who was accused of tolerating sexual harassment in the workplace, 
officials said. Tonight, Capelle will appeal a letter of reprimand that board 
members proposed to place in her file. The session was made public at Capelle's 
request, Supt. Robert L. French said. The charges were made last year, when 
then-Deputy Supt. Richard L. Donoghue was fired for allegedly touching 
employees, distributing lewd material and using offensive language. Both 
administrators have denied the charges.

 What: Some $400,000 short of achieving their dream, Kimberly Gardens Mobile 
Home residents are asking the City Council for a loan to purchase the lease on 
their mobile home park. Previously, the Kimberly Park tenants had requested a 
$100,000 grant to pay finance costs for a $6.36-million loan, a request denied 
by the council earlier this year. However, residents say they've found almost 
$6 million in financing and are asking the city and the County of Orange for a 
simple interest loan to cover the difference. County officials have expressed 
some willingness to be involved in converting the park to tenant ownership, but 
say the city must extend at least a quarter of the $400,000 required by 
Kimberly Gardens residents. More Information: (714) 707-5583

WESTERN MELTDOWN OVER BOSNIA?; CONGRESS MAY DRAW ITS OWN LESSONS FROM EUROPEAN 
POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Haiti is on the foreign-policy front burner now, of course. On the back 
burner, Bosnia simmers on and may come to a brief boil in mid-October. But the 
unwatched pot that may yet boil over is NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is now caught between the Bosnian preferences of 
Congress and those of our major European allies. Britain and France, in effect, 
see the creation of a new "Serboslavia" as the path to stability in the region. 
They furiously oppose the majority in Congress that wants the United States 
unilaterally to lift its arms embargo on official Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
German foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, has lately joined his British and French 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Since rejecting the peace proposal set forth by the United Nations, the 
Bosnian Serbs have ferociously escalated their "ethnic cleansing" of northeast 
Bosnia. The astonishing European response to this new aggression has been a 
campaign, initially successful, to begin easing up on economic sanctions 
against Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic publicly opposes the Bosnian Serb 
rejection of the United Nations' peace plan, his country continues privately to 
supply and otherwise assist the Bosnian Serbs. Rather than expose Milosevic, 
however, the "contact group" of four European powers (Russia is the fourth) 
plus the United States recently chose to provide him the cover of token 
international monitoring of the Serbian-Bosnian border: 135 monitors, far too 
few to cover the long border, and all under tight Serbian supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reward for Milosevic's "cooperation," the contact group will ask the U.N. 
Security Council to end all economic sanctions on Serbia. When the Security 
Council complies, as it almost surely will, Bosnian Serb aggression will only 
escalate -- though possibly under cover of a token acceptance of the peace 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress' view that Serb aggression must be halted by the stick rather than 
the carrot, by strengthening the Bosnian military deterrent rather than by 
enriching the Serbian economy, is far more realistic. However, realism also 
dictates that the United States not pursue a European policy in defiance of our 
three most powerful European allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has set Oct. 15 as a deadline for the Bosnian Serbs to 
accept the peace plan. When that date comes the Administration will most 
probably ask the 15-nation U.N. Security Council to lift the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven members of the council -- France, Britain, China, New Zealand, Spain, 
Argentina and the Czech Republic -- will abstain. Veto-wielding Russia will 
oppose. The United States' request will be denied, and Congress will not muster 
a two-thirds majority in both houses to force President Clinton to take 
unilateral action. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus will Europe have won in its struggle with the U.S. Congress. But Congress 
may be prepared to make virtue of this necessity. The moral that Congress may 
draw from the Bosnian rebuff is that a U.S. withdrawal from formal European 
collective security may be an idea whose time has come. A growing number in 
Congress may say: Yes, let France, Germany and Britain handle post-Cold War 
Yugoslavia on their own. But let them also handle post-Cold War Russia on their 
own. They have all the money, troops and weapons they need for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe will not, in a major way, assist the United States in handling North 
Korea or Cuba or Haiti or other security problems defined as Washington's and 
Washington's alone. Congress may conclude that it is time to introduce a kind 
of parity. 
</P>
<P>
 European, particularly British, comment on U.S. solicitude for the Bosnian 
Muslims has typically faulted it as moralism from afar and on the cheap. But 
the U.S. appetite for the role of world moralist, much less world policeman, is 
smaller than such commentators think. The risk is that Europe's attitude toward 
Bosnia may yet become America's attitude -- toward Europe.

 A boat of experienced lightweight women won the first United States gold medal 
at the 1994 World Rowing Championships at Indianapolis.

 The lightweight four without coxswain applied power and knowledge to seal 
their victory as Great Britain on one side and China on the other closed in

RAVE PARTY EXTRAS ARE 'DEEE-LITED'; DRUG OVERDOSES MAR OTHERWISE ORDERLY 
CONCERT FOR 10,000 WHO ALSO ARE FILMED FOR MOVIE SCENE.

 New Year's 2000 occurred at 10:14 Saturday night . . . and again at 10:29 . . 
. and again . . . and again . . . and again. Each time with as many as 10,000 
people cheering and hooting in a rainbow rain of confetti as soldiers wielding 
M-16s stood on top of Humvees to deal with spreading civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what happened at the corner of 5th and Flower streets, between 
the Bonaventure Hotel and the Central Library in downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course it was all Hollywood fantasy, with the scene being shot (and 
re-shot) for a movie and the many paying extras lured by a "rave" concert 
featuring performances by neo-disco group Deee-Lite and techno composer-deejay 
Aphex Twin. 
</P>
<P>
 The colorful, future-technology orientation of the rave world is itself fairly 
fantastic, so it made a good match for the film, an action-adventure titled 
"Strange Days." 
</P>
<P>
 One element of reality did interfere in the wee hours when five people were 
hospitalized for what were believed to be overdoses of the hallucinogenic drug 
Ecstasy, a common presence on the rave scene. 
</P>
<P>
 That led police to order the revelry stopped shortly before it was scheduled 
to end at 4 a.m., though no other serious problems were reported. A police 
spokesman said later Sunday morning that the event had gone smoothly, 
considering its complex logistics. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Deee-Lite hit the stage at 12:35 a.m., the crowd had celebrated so 
many New Years for the cameras that it really felt like the turn of the 
millennium. But that didn't mean the throng's party energy was spent, thanks in 
large part to the, well, delightful performance by the New York act.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the new "Dewdrops in the Garden" album may not really show it, 
Deee-Lite singer Lady Kier has an abundance of the one thing really missing 
from the techno scene: personality -- and enough of it conceivably to bring the 
group back from the one-hit-wonderdom it slipped into after 1990's irresistible 
single "Groove Is in the Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, Deee-Lite is not really a techno act, but a frothy disco troupe, 
bringing the Manhattan club vibe of the '70s firmly into the '90s, with the 
sexual liberation message still strong. The key difference is that now it's not 
so much liberation from social repression as from AIDS-era fears. 
</P>
<P>
 If the crowd's fashions are any indication, a new generation has been aching 
to break free of that fear, with decadent gender-bending encroaching on the 
rave-standard grunge-meets-Dr. Seuss styles. And Kier looked like the perfect 
trend leader, playfully romping with two agile male dancers through homemade 
routines that looked like low-rent Madonna, without the ego. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yeah, Kier is a better singer than Madonna, too. 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp contrast, Aphex Twin (Richard Barnes) showed absolutely zip 
personality as a performer when he went on at about 2:30, merely standing at 
the back of the stage twiddling knobs and working turntables.  
</P>
<P>
 But what twiddling! Artfully sculpting beats, he carved wondrous soundscapes 
out of the kind of techno repetition that left to others is too often 
somnolent. If he and Deee-Lite are indeed an indication of what this music will 
be like in five years, it's in good hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The music, actually, has nothing to do with "Strange Days," being produced by 
James Cameron ("True Lies," the "Terminator" movies), directed by Kathryn 
Bigelow and starring Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett and Juliette Lewis. To the 
filmmakers, this event was merely a way to provide an appropriate backdrop for 
what is apparently a climactic scene in the action adventure. Presumably it was 
worth the reported $750,000 tab for the night (including renting out half the 
1,300 rooms in the Bonaventure). 
</P>
<P>
 But to the rave-goers -- most paid $10 in advance to attend but others 
apparently just walked in -- the filming was merely the backdrop to their main 
party event, said by promoters to be the largest rave ever held in the U.S. The 
filming and the setting -- with a high-profile police and security presence 
that had little to do to control the well-behaved crowd -- robbed it of any 
sense of underground cachet, once the currency of the rave world. 
</P>
<P>
 And a number of regular ravers complained that it was too "bright" to be a 
real rave. But maybe it's time for this scene's music to really come into the 
light.

THEATER REVIEW; THOUSAND OAKS' CIVIC ARTS VENUE LAUNCHES 'LA MANCHA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks has never been known for its thousand theaters -- or indeed, for 
any professional theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But the people of that city got tired of driving to Los Angeles after hours, 
so they've turned their new City Council chamber into an after-hours theater. 
</P>
<P>
 And not just a community theater, of which Ventura County has many. A 
professional theater company, with an Actors' Equity contract, has opened the 
new 349-seat Forum Theatre at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza with "Man of 
La Mancha." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, hundreds of people recently attended a conference about how to 
develop more professional, mid-sized theaters. In Thousand Oaks, they've gone 
and done it. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course it remains to be seen if the community will support the artists as 
well as the building. Opening weekend was almost sold out. But it's usually 
easier to build theaters than it is to sustain the companies within them. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Susana Repertory Company, the new theater's resident company, probably 
has a better chance than most. Its track record goes back to 1988, when it was 
born in Simi Valley. Its announced programming is not likely to ruffle many 
civic feathers; scheduled to follow "La Mancha" are "A Christmas Carol," "The 
Boys in Autumn," "Bullshot Crummond" and "Little Shop of Horrors." Don't expect 
any searing commentaries about the underbelly of Thousand Oaks any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that "Man of La Mancha" is the safest possible choice. Dale Wasserman's 
book does take the side of prisoners against the authorities. But those 
authorities -- the nasty folks who ran the Spanish Inquisition -- aren't likely 
to be seen as a metaphor for the daytime users of this space. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Santa Susana did "La Mancha" in a makeshift Simi Valley tent after 
its temporary quarters were declared unsafe by city inspectors. That production 
more truly reflected the show's situation -- the company, like Cervantes in the 
play, was making theater under the pressure of outside stresses. The tent 
suggested the dungeon where "La Mancha " is set better than any other venue in 
which I've seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Forum Theatre's stage hardly looks like a cramped dungeon. It's a deep, 
roomy plain. Ten rows of sharply raked seating rise from its east side, and 40 
additional seats are on each of the north and south sides. A spacious walkway 
further separates the bulk of the seats, those on the east, from the action. 
During the first act, my view from the 10th row wasn't nearly as intimate as 
you might expect in a house of only 349 seats. But during the second act, my 
view from the first row on the south side was much better, except for a few 
blocked sight lines. 
</P>
<P>
 This revival brings back the three exceptional stars of the 1989 version in 
fine form. Lane Davies, also the artistic director of the company, plays 
Cervantes with wry resignation and Quixote with winning naivete. Eileen Barnett 
makes us see and hear both Aldonza the wench and Dulcinea the angel. Jerry 
Winsett's a model Sancho. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a few fuzzy lyrics, the supporting cast is also strong, under the 
direction of Bruce French. The amplified volume of Carol Weiss' five-piece 
backstage orchestra isn't always well-balanced or perfectly coordinated with 
the singers. But generally, this "La Mancha" -- and this theater -- are a 
welcome addition to the theatrical landscape. 
</P>

ELTON JOHN: HIS OWN ROAD; POP MUSIC REVIEW: DIGGING INTO HIS HISTORY, THE ROCK 
ICON FILLS GIG WITH SONG TRACKS NOW RARELY PERFORMED LIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The surest bet in town Saturday night was that Elton John would open his 
concert at the Pond with "Your Song," the wonderfully engaging pop valentine 
that was his first American hit almost a quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And the odds were overwhelming that the singer-pianist would close with 1973's 
"Candle in the Wind," the bittersweet, Marilyn Monroe-inspired tale of 
loneliness at the top that has become the signature ballad of John and his 
songwriting partner Bernie Taupin. 
</P>
<P>
 Pity, however, the poor gambler who tried to predict much else in the 2 
1/2-hour affair -- a warm, revealing trip down some of the less-traveled stops 
on John's musical yellow brick road. 
</P>
<P>
 Going in Saturday, we knew that John was not bringing along his band on this 
acoustic tour, which continues tonight with the first of four sold-out benefit 
concerts at the Greek Theatre for the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Instead, he 
is being accompanied only by percussionist and showman extraordinaire Ray 
Cooper in a reprise of a triumphant 1979 pairing. 
</P>
<P>
 What we quickly learned after the opening "Your Song" was that John was going 
to concentrate on early album tracks -- songs that he has rarely performed live 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans were undoubtedly restless as they kept waiting for personal 
favorites in John's list of more than 50 Top 40 songs. Even they, however, must 
wonder if it is really necessary to hear "Crocodile Rock" every time the 
Englishman steps on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated at the piano in a white blazer over a red T-shirt, John served, in 
effect, as his own opening act. Playing with the energy and passion of someone 
brand new on the pop scene, he went through more than a dozen songs during the 
concert's first hour, including such rarities as "The Greatest Discovery" and 
"Talkin' Old Soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Cooper joined him for the final 90 minutes, John initially 
continued to steer away from the expected hits. After a dramatic rendition of 
"Tonight," one of John's darkest yet most hauntingly beautiful compositions, 
the two musicians turned to such lesser-known numbers as "Idol" and the lilting 
"I Think I'm Going to Kill Myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, John showed little of the flamboyance of his early days, when 
his colorful wardrobe and stage manner were at times as liberating as his 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was Cooper who added the visual flair Saturday. From congas and 
cymbals to vibraphone, Cooper played with such dramatic facial expressions and 
gestures that even Madonna would have been upstaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching John go through this unexpected playlist in this relatively naked 
musical setting, you felt a sense of renewal on the part of both the artist and 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a valuable sense of celebration in hearing the hits again and again, 
but John gave us something more -- a chance to be touched anew by music that 
may have been missed or forgotten the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, you were reminded that John is more than simply a commercial 
hit-maker -- he's a singer, pianist and composer of exceptional range and 
talent. Over the years, both his music and Taupin's themes have evolved from 
the youthful innocence and simplicity of "Your Song" to the social 
consciousness of the AIDS-related "The Last Song." 
</P>
<P>
 And not everything was old Saturday: There were "Can You Feel the Love 
Tonight," his current hit, and a new ballad. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of the encore, John caught us off guard once again by performing 
"Crocodile Rock" after all, but with a new, slower arrangement. The song was a 
sweet acknowledgment of the value of celebration in pop music -- how even the 
slightest of tunes can stir all the good feelings associated with it over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fitting summary to a performance that was as dignified as it was 
daring. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elton John plays tonight through Thursday at the Greek Theatre, 2700 N. 
Vermont Ave., Sold out. 7:30 p.m. (213) 480-3232.

 Love Story: Ebony magazine claims to have the real inside exclusive on how 
Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley fell in love. The magazine says its 
interview with Jackson in the October issue is the first in which he talks 
openly about his romance with Presley. In the article, Jackson says the two 
first met 20 years ago in Las Vegas when Elvis took his young daughter to watch 
the Jackson Five. Three years ago, they renewed their friendship. But Jackson 
says he fell in love with Presley after she expressed so much compassion about 
his legal problems, his addiction to prescription drugs and his well-being 
after the L.A. earthquake. The two talked on the phone extensively and visited 
each other. "It kind of unfolded," Jackson says. "We spent a lot of time on the 
ranch and just walked around and talked." Jackson proposed to Presley over the 
phone. He said, "If I asked you to marry me, would you?" She said, "Of course." 
Jackson said talk of the couple recording together is a "complete rumor." But 
another prospect is likely: Jackson said they plan to have children. MOVIES

 'The Phantom' Disappears for Now: Paramount Pictures has temporarily pulled 
the plug on "The Phantom," a big-budget action film based on the comic-book 
super-hero. The movie, to be directed by Joe Dante, had been set to begin 
filming Oct. 17 in northern Australia, but that has been pushed back to 
February, according to Alan Ladd Jr., who is producing the movie along with 
Robert Evans. "The question was, do we rush now to meet our October start date 
or do we take our time," Ladd said. Sources say the production was postponed, 
in part, because the film may need a major star to justify its budget. Billy 
Zane, who appeared as a maniac in the 1989 movie "Dead Calm," has been 
mentioned for the lead role, but no one has yet been signed. Meanwhile, sources 
say Michael Douglas' production company, which recently moved to the Paramount 
lot, has been in high-level negotiations over whether to become involved in the 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 The $775,000 Question: The big movie at the box office over the weekend was 
not in the No. 1 spot. Hollywood Pictures' much-anticipated "Quiz Show," 
directed by Robert Redford, grossed $775,000 in limited release on only 27 
screens for a whopping $28,700 per-screen average. The movie will expand to 220 
theaters on Friday and go into wider release on Sept. 30. As for the 
top-grossing film during the weekend, Universal's "Timecop" opened with $12 
million, according to early industry estimates. Paramount's "Forrest Gump" was 
in second with $6 million, followed by the studio's "Clear and Present Danger" 
with $3.3 million. Warner Bros.' "Natural Born Killers" was fourth with $2.9 
million and New Line's "The Mask" was fifth with $2 million.

 Toronto Winners: "Priest," Antonia Bird's drama about a traditional Catholic 
who begins questioning the values of the church, received the People's Choice 
Award for best feature at the 19th annual Toronto International Film Festival 
on Sunday. The British movie is Bird's first feature film. The Tunisian release 
"Les Silences du Palais" ("The Silences of the Palace"), Moufida Tlatli's film 
about a young singer who looks into her past, received the International Film 
Critics Award for best first feature. The 10-day festival included 296 movies 
from 45 countries. TELEVISION

 The Doctor Is Out?: Rob Morrow reportedly will leave "Northern Exposure" in 
the middle of the new TV season. Producers of the CBS show have denied reports 
that Morrow's Dr. Joel Fleischman will depart, but TV Guide says in the Sept. 
27 issue that Universal will let him out of the rest of his contract without a 
fight. Morrow, who also stars in the movie "Quiz Show," apparently wants to 
pursue more film work. But the show's producers reportedly will introduce two 
new characters to replace Morrow -- Dr. Phillip Cooper and his wife will move 
to Cicely, Alaska, to escape big-city life.

 True to Life: Actress Tracey Gold, the former star of TV's "Growing Pains" who 
underwent her own much-publicized battle with anorexia nervosa, will star as 
another real-life woman struggling with the disease in "For the Love of Nancy," 
an ABC movie airing Oct. 2. Gold plays 18-year-old Nancy Walsh, a college 
freshman whose parents take her to court when she refuses medical help for her 
disease. Jill Clayburgh and William Devane co-star. QUICK TAKES

 "Alfie," Bill Naughton's black comedy which has been touring Britain, will 
play at the Tiffany Theater in West Hollywood on Oct. 13-Nov. 20. The play, 
starring and directed by former British pop singer Adam Faith, is part of UK/LA 
1994, a festival of British arts going on in Los Angeles this fall. . . . Bree 
Walker-Lampley, the former KCBS-TV Channel 2 anchorwoman who left to form her 
own production company, has a leading role in CBS' upcoming science-fiction 
movie, "The Deception." Walker-Lampley's previous acting experience has been 
limited to cameos. BETH KLEID

ART REVIEW; 'PLANE/STRUCTURES' AT OTIS: ENRICHING WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Art these days feels like an endangered species. The market boom of the '80s 
made it appear important and fashionable. Economic stagnation suffocated 
enthusiasm, aided and abetted by art grown so thin and preachy as to be 
virtually indistinguishable from the media. Even L.A.'s great quake contributed 
to the dirty work, causing collectors to shun art in fragile materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The single hope that lay shining in all this rubble was that art would hunker 
down and -- forgetting careers, cash and glitz -- once again pursue the muse 
for its own sake. A new, bracingly important exhibition of abstract art at the 
gallery of Otis School of Art and Design proves not only that this is 
happening, but has been happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Plane/Structures," it includes a couple of works each by 16 L.A. 
artists and was sponsored by the free-floating support group, the Fellows of 
Contemporary Art. They have done outstanding work filling important recognition 
gaps around here since 1976, but they've never chosen better than in backing 
this show. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is the brainchild of critic David Pagel. Since he is a regular 
contributor to The Times and since what follows will be enthusiastic, I feel 
obliged to point out that we are not personally acquainted. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not made an exhibition the casual browser will warm to. He has made an 
exhibition so smart, dense and resonant as to rewrite conventional wisdom about 
the nature of L.A. art. His visual evidence is compelling, as is his catalogue 
essay and those by Dave Hickey and Joe Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is reputed to be a brainless bird with no sense of history. 
According to its lore, all its best Cold War-era art was made around the '60s, 
nothing of great significance has been done since and few if any of the artists 
to emerge subsequently carried on the key ideas of the Ur-masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagel proves this is nonsense. The great admired master of the '60s generation 
was Marcel Duchamp, revered for his sidewinder conceptual thinking and mordant 
sense of fun. His spirit is everywhere in "Plane/Structures." His cryptic 
ready-mades echo in Liz Larner's steel-chain work "Wrapped Corner" and Jonathan 
White's pieces involving glass resonators. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of this work is severely minimal and conceptual, but this is formalism 
with an attitude. James Hayward's black paintings combine L.A. sensualism with 
Ad Reinhardt's message that this is tough stuff. All of it has the amused 
strength of sheer hiccupy hopelessness. There is a collective murmur that says, 
"Well, nobody is going to like or reward this work, much less get it, so I 
might just as well go the hell ahead and make it the way I want it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pae White makes a plexiglass slab in naughty translucent chrome yellow, blots 
it up with solvent, lays it on the floor and calls it, "The Inconsolable 
Wailing of the Damned." Take that. 
</P>
<P>
 The indispensable master of L.A.'s classic hard-edge painting was John 
McLaughlin. His stripped-down monochrome canvases are wonderful exercises in 
perceptual rigor, but they are more. 
</P>
<P>
 They combine European philosophical dynamism with Japanese Zen contemplation. 
They set the stage for an L.A. art that would find its originality through 
hybridization. These artists have a lot more history to throw in their 
blenders. John Miller, for example, seems to add optical and perceptual styles 
to McLaughlin's minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Caren Furbeyre's pink liquid column "Crystal Eyes" brings Peter Alexander's 
lyrical brand of macho Finish Fetish art -- that well-known form of '60s art 
whose practitioners were obsessed with perfection of surface, like hot-rod 
painters -- into the era of feminism. Mary Corse's "Black Light Painting" lends 
metaphysical mystery to the purity of Light and Space art. Linda Hudson 
cross-fertilizes Ed Moses' funk with Robert Irwin's Apollonian invisibility and 
makes intimacy out of them. James Richards' twine paintings add a note of 
thrift-shop crafts to urbanity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If this art were classical music, it would be by Alexander Scriabin or Erik 
Satie. It has their quality of high intelligence being willfully eccentric and 
minor. Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe's unstretched abstractions with their frames of 
pushpins combine extreme refinement with a sense of the primitive. 
</P>
<P>
 If this art were popular music, it would be the blues. For one thing, a number 
of the artists are attracted to deep cobalt. Scot Heywood uses it in a 
rectangular painting that becomes both weightless and sculptural simply by 
being hung tilted. Carolee Toon's "Blue Pocket, Reserve Blues" uses this 
compelling hue's capacity to be at once absent and present to create a sense of 
nuance in a solid field. Maxwell Hendler's "Film Noir" polishes it to a 
reflective surface like a deep azure pool. He brings the same L.A. love of 
surface to it as to his early Magic Realist paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 The spirit of John McCracken's sculpture is omnipresent behind all this. Once 
considered an isolated master of classicized Finish Fetish art, he has clearly 
been a major influence. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, of course, the computer must be reckoned with. Most artists regard 
the thing as anathema. Here, certain of them have clearly been inspired by the 
capacity of its logic and precision to almost invisibly create magic. At a 
distance Fandra Chang's "Bit Fall" looks like a series of green vertical 
stripes rendered in translucent acrylic. Up close it reveals itself as a screen 
with openings of pixel-small proportion. Roy Thurston's untitled diptych of 
small deep-rose squares ripples inexplicably to the eye until close examination 
shows it is a relief of vertical slots of nearly microscopic smallness. 
</P>
<P>
 In style these artists are the clear inheritors of the L.A. aesthetic. In 
temperament they have the feel of the French post-Post Impressionists, the 
Nabis. They share the curious toughness of Bonnard and Vuillard in continuing 
to make beautifully crafted, witty, wistful, sophisticated art knowing that 
they are at the end of the line.

STAGE; MACLAINE PUTS A PERSONAL SPIN ON ONE-WOMAN SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She sings! She dances! She acts! She tells jokes! What a talent! Shirley 
MacLaine's one-woman performance for the season's opening night Friday at the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts was a nonstop, high-voltage tribute to 
the joys of versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute. Let's keep this in context. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her unstinting enthusiasm and undeniable charm, MacLaine didn't 
actually do most of the above tasks strikingly well, although some were more 
successful than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Her singing, for example, had its good and bad moments. At her best with 
sweet-toned ballads, MacLaine was considerably less appealing when she tried to 
belt out high notes that pushed her vocal skills too far beyond their limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Her dancing, except for one exuberant high-kicking, in-your-face outburst, was 
mostly all posture and movement and manner. Some of her imagery -- "Sweet 
Charity" was a good illustration -- is so well-known from movie posters that 
MacLaine only had to strike the familiar pose to generate spirited applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the youthful vigor of her early years, however, there was no 
denying her remarkable physical fluidity, the dexterity with which she made the 
difficult seem easy, and the startling pliability in every one of her limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jokes? Well, MacLaine didn't so much do jokes; she told stories while tossing 
off spontaneous-sounding lines, often with good- natured jibes at herself. 
Admiring the auditorium, she noted that she'd never worked in it before, "At 
least not in this lifetime." Describing her relationship with Tom Cruise, 
MacLaine suggested that he came to see her show, "to get an idea what his wife 
is going to look like in 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps predictably, for a former dancer who spent much of her professional 
life in films, MacLaine's trump cards were her sheer celebrity presence and her 
unflagging abilities as an actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Always in command of the stage, always alert to -- and willing to use -- the 
audience's awareness of the details of her public persona, MacLaine made nearly 
every number into a personally oriented mini-drama. 
</P>
<P>
 An opening piece was structured around songs from Broadway musicals that are 
associated with her in one way or another. The obvious irony was that MacLaine 
had started off as a musical theater hoofer (with a much-praised substitution 
for Carol Haney in 1954's "Pajama Game"), but almost never got to sing and 
dance in pictures such as "The Apartment," "Irma La Douce" and "Two for the 
Seesaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Another number was set up by her much-publicized spiritual quests. Quietly 
offering to take the audience into her confidence, she described a trip to an 
underground city in Peru, where she met a wise old guru named Mr. Calabash. 
Remarkably, few of the listeners picked up on the slowly unfolding gag until 
she began to repeat the mantra taught to her by Mr. Calabash: "Ink-a-dink-a-do, 
a-dink-a-do. . . ." It was a tale well worthy of Jimmy Durante. 
</P>
<P>
 But the finest segments in her show involved neither dance nor jokes. The 
first was a lengthy medley of standards arranged to depict MacLaine's view of a 
woman's love life. By singing bits and pieces of songs -- usually choosing only 
the most telling lines -- MacLaine was able to fully apply her acting abilities 
to the material without having to rely too heavily on her vocal skills. 
</P>
<P>
 An equally superb segment was built around a dark, passionate rendering of 
Stephen Sondheim's "I'm Still Here." It is a song that has been reduced to 
musical meatloaf by nearly every aging cabaret chanteuse in the country, yet 
MacLaine made it into something fresh and new and prime. Again, part of its 
impact traced to the lyrics' clear associations with her own career. Equally 
important, she performed the piece with consummate dramatic subtlety, capturing 
and articulating the multilayered meanings in each of Sondheim's lines. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an appropriate climax for the evening. Far more than her hard-working 
versatility, it was the perfect summing-up of exactly what it is that Shirley 
MacLaine does so well. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLaine also appeared at Cerritos on Saturday and Sunday.

POP; FAMILIAR BENNETT STILL CHARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are much worse things that have resulted from hype than the fact that 
Tony Bennett, thanks to some shrewd maneuvering, is suddenly the crooner du 
jour of Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
 A somewhat youthful contingent did turn out for his show on Saturday at the 
Universal Amphitheatre, though the nearly full hall was mostly full of 
Generations R through V, the older-timers getting a chance to hear Bennett's 
"Unplugged" act without having to figure out which channel MTV is on. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of two sets and 25 tunes, Bennett steered a steady course not 
too unfamiliar to anyone who has picked up his new "Unplugged" album; that is, 
the song intros were basically verbatim, the set list was three-quarters 
identical, and "Old Devil Moon" would have been the opener whether or not there 
was a full one outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when a singer this accomplished announces that "I put together the finest 
American popular songs I could think of this evening" and can match his boast, 
familiarity hardly breeds contempt. If Bennett's geniality is like the Beatles 
to feisty Sinatra's Stones, the jilted lovers of many generations have him to 
thank for honey-dripping the heartbreak in such weepers as "When Joanna Loved 
Me" and "I'll Be Seeing You," classics that combine wistfulness and wit. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's his lighter side that's the indelible part of Bennett's stage 
persona. The 68-year-old singer seemed eager to prove how undiminished his 
breath control is, resulting in a lot of big finishes you couldn't begrudge him 
too much given the easygoing, casual charm of the rest of his delivery. The 
Ralph Sharon Trio provided the best of all possible supports, as always, with a 
brush-twirling snare solo from drummer Clayton Cameron a deserved crowd 
favorite.CHRIS WILLMAN

THEATER REVIEW; TRYING TO FAN FLAMES OF YESTERYEAR IN 'LATER LIFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The setting is an elegant terrace overlooking Boston Harbor. From inside the 
house come the warm light and convivial sounds of a party. Outside, the green, 
metal patio furniture matches the ivy on the eggshell-colored windows, and the 
cushions are white, never mind what it costs to clean them. Everyone has a 
drink. This is A.R. Gurney country. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurney is the playwright who chronicles what some people say doesn't exist: 
the interior lives of the wealthy, East Coast Anglo Saxon Protestants from 
which he comes. Some of his plays, such as 1988's "Cocktail Hour," which had 
its premiere at the Old Globe, offer witty and compassionate insight into this 
shaky old guard, gnawed by the knowledge that its day of extreme privilege is 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Old Globe presents "Later Life," a lesser Gurney that nevertheless 
might find a wide, sympathetic audience in its West Coast debut. At least 
that's what another theater, South Coast Repertory, must be hoping. South 
Coast, about 80 miles north of the Old Globe, opens its production of "Later 
Life" later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later Life" explores a scenario that may be attractive for older, well-heeled 
audiences to contemplate: What if a nice, divorced banker in his 50s attends a 
charming party around the corner from his Beacon Street apartment and meets a 
lovely woman with whom he almost had an affair when he was 22? And what if 
she's now trying to get out of a bad marriage and is warmly inviting his 
confidences and fanning the flames of their long-ago attraction? 
</P>
<P>
 While the outcome is not as predictable as its contrived setting might 
indicate, "Later Life" is a strangely unfulfilling play. Austin (Frank 
Converse) considers Boston the Athens of America, and he worries that his 
beloved hometown might be losing its particular character. The trouble is, 
beyond being a repressed old dear, Austin doesn't have much of a character, and 
his hopes and fears seem as colorless as the washed stone of the gracious house 
he is visiting (rendered beautifully by set designer Allen Moyer). 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth (Jennifer Harmon) is also colorless, despite Gurney's giving her a tragic 
life history and a stormy marriage. She has the chirpy manner of a therapist 
who always knows the answer to every supportive question she asks. Ruth's 
attempt to wake Austin with her cliched nostalgia ("We were doing something 
rare in this world; we were making a connection") doesn't add up. What would 
she wake him up to? 
</P>
<P>
 Things get more confused when Ruth turns suddenly from a cheerleader for 
intimacy to a disapproving judge. Austin has made some unforgivable misstep, 
but this viewer had trouble distinguishing it from any of his other comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later Life" is essentially a one-act comedy of manners, with a bonus track: 
two supporting actors play a stream of amusing party guests who venture onto 
the terrace and into John and Ruth's rendezvous. Richard Easton is hilarious, 
whether as an ex-philosophy professor who composes an ode to his doomed affair 
with cigarettes or as a computer dweeb who wants John and Ruth to be amazed 
that his wife "is still using DOS 2.0, can you believe that?" In her multiple 
roles, Linda Atkinson tends to push. Her portrayal of an adoring, excited 
Southern housewife whose husband has just been transferred to Boston, however, 
is touching. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Nicholas Martin choreographs that pivotal scene, in which Ruth 
confides her troubles to the Southern couple, with a touch of genius: As Ruth 
confides her tragedy, the husband leaves her side and hands his wife a 
handkerchief to hand to Ruth. It's a lovely observation of a certain man's 
relationship to grief, worthy of Gurney's finest plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later Life" is not one of those plays. Converse and Harmon look right, do 
well, but cannot complete the hole in the center of a hollow play. 
</P>

SCREENING ROOM: JACKIE CHAN, THEN BERTOLUCCI'S 'CONFORMIST' AT NUART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jackie Chan Festival at the Nuart enters its second week with two of 
Chan's most recent and best pictures -- and two among his lesser-known 
pictures. "Crime Story" (tonight at 7:15), which is as fast and furious as 
action pictures get, provides a shrewd change of pace for Chan. As skilled at 
comedy as he is at kung fu, Chan this time plays it straight as an inspector in 
the Royal Hong Kong Police. His seriousness proves to be an effective foil to 
this exceedingly slick movie's spectacular stunt work and its visual panache. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by a 1991 kidnap of a real estate tycoon, the 1993 "Crime Story" 
combines all the details of an astute police procedural with one exciting 
sequence after another. There are chases galore, a terrific episode aboard a 
flooded ship, a classic rescue of a child from a burning tenement and much 
more. Movies don't get much more kinetic than this, and director Kirk Wong 
(plus an uncredited Chan) and a raft of writers make it fun all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 To watch Chan in the fresh and exhilarating "Super Cop -- Police Story III" 
(tonight at 5:20 and 9:30) is like watching Douglas Fairbanks Sr. or one of the 
silent-era clowns in one of their biggest hits. In this 1992 film, Chan is a 
whirling dervish with a Beatles mop-top and an impish grin, a one-man Cirque du 
Soleil, and "Super Cop" shows off both his sense of humor and his acrobatic 
martial arts wizardry just as effectively as "Safety Last" served Harold Lloyd 
seven decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A fearless, devil-may-care Hong Kong cop, Chan is the inevitable choice for a 
highly dangerous mission to retrieve from a Chinese prison labor camp a 
gangster who is to lead him to his brother, a mighty Hong Kong-based drug lord. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan's adventures lead him to a secret jungle compound along the border 
between Thailand and Cambodia and culminate in a whirlwind chase through Kuala 
Lumpur involving a helicopter, every kind of street vehicle and finally a 
train. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan is well-matched by his elegant leading lady Michelle Khan, playing a 
People's Republic of China secret agent. Chan, director Stanley Tong and their 
cast and crew recall what Hollywood has largely forgotten: how to make pure 
escapist entertainment that's fast, light, topical but unpretentious. 
</P>
<P>
 Restored to its original length and rich color under the supervision of its 
legendary cameraman Vittorio Storaro, Bernardo Bertolucci's 1970 "The 
Conformist," which plays at the Nuart Thursday through Sept. 28, seems every 
bit the masterpiece it was when first released by Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 In this dazzling film, Bertolucci manages to combine the bravura style of 
Fellini, the acute sense of period of Visconti and the fervent political 
commitment of Elio Petri, ("An Investigation of a Citizen Under Suspicion") -- 
and, better still, a total lack of self-indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted by Bertolucci from an Alberto Moravia novel, "The Conformist" is at 
once a study of one man and an entire society. A traumatized product of an 
extravagantly decayed aristocratic family, Jean-Louis Trintignant's Marcello, 
whom we meet at 30 in 1937, is a respected professor of philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also a repressed homosexual so determined to maintain his respectability 
at all costs that he is ripe for recruitment by a Fascist espionage 
organization for a deadly mission that he believes will atone for a terrifying 
youthful incident.  
</P>
<P>
 Bertolucci has told Moravia's story so well, fusing Marcello's destiny with 
that of Italy, that when it comes full circle its culminating scene is 
devastatingly ironic even though it incorporates outrageous theatricality and 
bald coincidence.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Conformist," which memorably co-stars Dominique Sanda as a sexually 
ambiguous beauty, is not merely an indictment of fascism -- with some swipes at 
ecclesiastical hypocrisy as well -- but also a profound personal tragedy. The 4 
1/2 minutes put back in the film are part of a party scene in which all the 
guests are blind except Marcello. (310) 478-6379.

MUSIC REVIEWS; BOWL ORCHESTRA ENDS ITS SUMMER SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say goodby to the 1994 summer season at Hollywood Bowl, which was scheduled to 
end Sunday night with a third performance of its traditional fireworks-finale 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Heard at the first run-through Friday, which turned out to be a protracted 
dress rehearsal for a Saturday-night live-television performance, this was a 
motley agenda variably performed, with long waiting periods between musical 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mauceri, now completing his fourth season at the helm of the Hollywood 
Bowl Orchestra, and arguably the most charming classical-music emcee in the 
business (at least since the death of Leonard Bernstein), tried valiantly to 
bridge the gaps caused by the needs of broadcast-rehearsal, but it was a losing 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 On the program, no fewer than 11 composers were represented, usually by 
snippets; until the closing "Fireworks Music" by Handel, those snippets were 
written by film composers. As usual, Mauceri did not deal in cliches but in the 
byways of Hollywood history. 
</P>
<P>
 The work of the justifiably admired Franz Waxman, an Oscar winner for "Sunset 
Boulevard," who founded the Los Angeles Music Festival (1947-67) appeared three 
times: in the "Ride of the Cossacks" (from "Taras Bulba"), being repeated from 
Thursday; in an arrangement of Irving Berlin's title song to "Sayonara," and in 
the practically legendary "Carmen" Fantasy, written in 1947 for Jascha Heifetz. 
</P>
<P>
 Violinist Bruce Dukov, concertmaster of the Bowl Orchestra since its 
inception, was the virtuosic, resplendent-toned soloist in the Fantasy, sailing 
nonchalantly through these many technical hurdles, unraveling convoluted 
passage work with an effortless musicality.  
</P>
<P>
 The other high point on Friday -- when 13,360 were in attendance; the Saturday 
night audience was sold out at 17,979 -- was the U.S. premiere of Waxman's 
"Sunset Boulevard" Sonata for Orchestra, a gripping quarter-hour that showcased 
not only the composer's melodic gifts and compositional accomplishment but also 
this orchestra's smooth sense of ensemble.DANIEL CARIAGA

MUSIC REVIEWS; LONG BEACH SYMPHONY OPENS 60TH YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the beginning of its 60th season, its sixth under the music directorship of 
JoAnn Falletta, the Long Beach Symphony is a dependable, often sparkling 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 It can take on some of the most demanding repertory -- as it did Saturday 
night at Terrace Theater -- without batting an eye. Its ensemble values are 
consistently smooth and professional, its fortes imposing and muscular without 
stridency, its member-soloists confident. 
</P>
<P>
 As an interpreter, Falletta, too, is a reliable commodity, an imaginative 
programmer who strives for the firm, center ground in her performances. She's 
not much of one to emote on the podium or, for that matter, to display much of 
any aspect of her personality. But she handily avoids cold abstraction by 
getting -- allowing might be the better word -- the orchestra to play in a 
relaxed, warm and lyrical fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Falletta & orchestra's account of the season-opening "Roman Carnival" Overture 
by Berlioz revealed all of the above, a neat and vital reading with the details 
painted in, and a velvety English horn solo from Joan Elardo. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance of Copland's Third Symphony on the second half of the program 
left various impressions: of an orchestra quite comfortable with the technical 
demands of this taxing work; of a healthy brass section and impressive strings; 
of a conductor that wasn't taking many risks, attempting clarity and 
objectivity and achieving it; of a piece of music that sometimes tries too hard 
to be the Great American Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Dicterow, concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic, was the splendid 
soloist at the center of the evening, in Brahms' Violin Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered a wonderfully spacious, sensitive and reserved account, both 
technically and musically commanding. He made the absence of soloistic charisma 
a wholly positive thing, with playing concentrated and intense yet always 
lovable and unforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Falletta's accompaniment veered toward politeness on occasion, but proved 
generally warm, colored and singing. TIMOTHY MANGAN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; 3 RUNAWAYS REUNITE AT THE WHISKY 
</P>

 It wasn't money that persuaded three founding members of the Runaways to 
reunite at the Whisky on Saturday. "Because there isn't any," singer Cherie 
Currie assured the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The original all-female rock quintet never enjoyed much chart action during 
its brief career in the mid-'70s. But its tough bubble-gum rock did inspire a 
lingering cult following here and abroad, and paved the way for later 
all-female punk acts in Los Angeles, from the Go-Go's to the edgier L7. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Whisky, bassist Jackie Fox and drummer Sandy West joined Currie during 
one of her own rare concert appearances and ripped through six Runaways songs. 
Two guitarists from Currie's own band filled in for the missing Joan Jett and 
Lita Ford, the two Runaways who found greater success as solo artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without those key members, songs such as "Cherry Bomb" and "Queens of 
Noise" were simple and direct rockers that now sound charmingly retro. As 
Currie played to the ecstatic hard-core fans near the stage, West pounded at 
her drums with an intensity suggesting this was more than a lark.  
</P>
<P>
 The Runaways material easily outpaced Currie's more anonymous solo songs. But 
while the singer expressed some regret over quitting the band in 1977, she 
noted that this trio was unlikely to perform again. Which may be a lost 
opportunity -- they'd probably be huge in Japan. STEVE APPLEFORD

TV REVIEW; 'ER': CALL IT GENERAL (ELECTRIFIED) HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two hours with the revved-up premiere of NBC's new medical series "ER," 
you're ready for a Xanax. 
</P>
<P>
 There's screaming, there's shouting, there's frantic movement. There's the 
gunshot victim with a hole in the chest, the terrified baby-sitter with the 
battered infant, the doctor who's physically attacked by the son of a fatal 
heart attack victim after another patient accuses him of being anti-Semitic, 
the young woman who comes in to get felt up, the hypochondriac in for her 
hangnail. And so on and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 As the walking and wheeled-in wounded surge through the emergency room of the 
large Chicago hospital, only rarely does "ER" pause for a breath. So when one 
of its overworked, underpaid residents exclaims, "I could never give this up," 
you know he needs a shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 As marred and derivative as "ER" is, however, there's something quite 
seductive about this series created by Michael Crichton and John Wells. The 
performances -- notably by Sherry Stringfield, George Clooney, Eriq LaSalle and 
Anthony Edwards as residents -- are strong. Enough of the story lines are 
sufficiently compelling to hold your attention. And the pace? Well, put it this 
way about all the pulsating and fluid camerawork: You rarely lose interest. 
</P>
<P>
 And equally significant -- unlike its competitor on CBS, the new medical 
series "Chicago Hope" -- there are no superheroes or easy miracles in sight. 
After a comatose staff member is rushed in after overdosing on drugs, the 
patient's fate remains unresolved even as the final credits roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, "ER" also opens with enough compound fractures to potentially 
disable even the sturdiest series. One is a predictable subplot about Edwards' 
character weighing an offer to enter private practice. Another is a contrived 
emergency that puts LaSalle's unseasoned surgeon into the operating room. A 
third is Stringfield's character informing a patient he has less than a year to 
live while still unsure about his diagnosis. And finally, when a wife 
batterer's clash with an inept intern is played for laughs, you want to sue for 
malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
 Left untreated, "ER," too, may have less than a year to live. 
</P>
<P>
 * "ER" premieres at 9 tonight and then will be seen Thursdays at 10 p.m. on 
NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

ALASKANS SHOW MIXED EMOTIONS ON EXXON RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH and STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Small commercial fishermen in this quiet port, among those pounded the hardest 
by the devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill, aren't throwing any parties to 
celebrate the $5-billion verdict delivered by a federal jury Friday against 
Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most felt a weary triumph, and surprise, at the size of the punitive 
damages award, no one expects that much money to ever get here. Of more 
immediate concern was the job of unloading gear from their boats, as they ended 
their halibut and silver salmon seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt better that the jury judged Exxon's story and said, 'Yeah, you should 
pay, you were responsible,' " said Chris Nerison, as he gazed over the 1,000 
boats in Cordova harbor during the drizzly Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Nerison, who fishes for salmon and herring, never expects anything 
close to $5 billion to wind up in plaintiffs' pockets. And other fishermen 
doubt they will get anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," said Thea Thomas, over a cup of coffee at The Reluctant 
Fisherman Inn. She fishes commercially for salmon and herring. At least she 
fished for herring until the fish failed to show up last year, cutting her 
income by one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any upbeat mood is because we've had a pretty good year for the first time 
since the spill," she said, "not the judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas noted that the grinding pressure of poor fishing in various species, 
squeamishness over the quality of Alaskan fish -- particularly in Japan -- and 
other problems had plagued the fishing community year after year since the 
Exxon Valdez ran aground in 1989, producing the biggest oil spill in North 
American history. 
</P>
<P>
 Families broke up, people committed suicide, parents couldn't send their kids 
to college, and the town's schools and library cut back personnel and hours as 
fishermen had trouble paying boat mortgages while the litigation ground on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The banks let them go for a few years," Thomas said. "Many lost their boats 
just in the last two years. It took a while for people to go broke." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken a series of economic hits," said Margy K. Johnson, an innkeeper 
and the mayor of Cordova. "One knocks you to your knees, a series renders you 
down and out." 
</P>
<P>
 The punitive damage award -- or whatever survives Exxon's planned legal 
challenges -- will be apportioned among all plaintiffs winning claims for 
actual damages from the spill, including about 10,000 fishermen and at least 
4,000 others -- from native villagers who lost subsistence harvests to such 
coastal businesses as fish hatcheries and processors. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian O'Neill, the Minneapolis lawyer who led the plaintiffs' legal team, 
estimated that fishermen will receive anywhere from $25,000 to $250,000 each in 
punitive damages, with the payouts hinging on their former production. An 
estimated $1 billion will be divided up by the 82 law firms representing 
plaintiffs in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5 billion in punitive damages is second in the U.S. courts only to the 
$10.5-billion award Pennzoil won in 1985 from Texaco Corp. The Exxon decision 
dwarfs what had been the biggest civil award in an environmental case -- the 
$470 million that Union Carbide paid because of its role in the tragic chemical 
leak in Bhopal, India, in 1984 that killed 4,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill agreed with the skeptics in Cordova that the plaintiffs are unlikely 
to receive punitive damages anytime soon, though he expressed confidence the 
award eventually will arrive. "I guess we'll slug it out for another year or so 
before we get the appeals out of the way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel relieved that I'm not going to go down in history as the world's 
biggest loser," added O'Neill, who has worked on the case since 1989. Given the 
vast environmental disaster in this case, he asked rhetorically, "How could you 
lose to Exxon?" 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Exxon says it already has paid $3.5 billion in cleanup costs. 
Also, in a previous phase of the trial, jurors awarded commercial fishermen 
$287 million for actual damages to their livelihood. Exxon also agreed to pay 
3,500 native Alaskans $20 million in place of food they normally would have 
caught in Alaskan waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Still to come in the Exxon case are smaller trials, including what U.S. 
District Judge Russel Holland is terming the "fourth phase" of this summer's 
three-part trial. This case, which will be held before a new jury, will include 
halibut fishermen, shrimp fishermen, lodge owners, helicopter leasing firms and 
others citing lost income after the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in Valdez, the petroleum town where the Exxon Valdez took on its fateful 
cargo, most workers and contractors on this end of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline 
were glad to see Prince William Sound's hard-pressed commercial fishermen stand 
to be the potential beneficiaries of much of Friday's judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the clamor of a local rock band Saturday night in The Pipeline Club -- 
where according to court testimony, Exxon Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood went 
drinking hours before his tanker left port -- there was sympathy for the 
fishermen as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oil field reaction is that they go along with the fishermen, that Exxon 
deserves everything they get. They're people too," said one contractor for 
Alyeska. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all happy they got something; they haven't had anything, for years," 
said June Morgan, tending bar at the Club Bar, a fishermen's hangout near the 
Valdez harbor. 
</P>

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; HAITI ON THE EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and Jean-Bertrand Aristide have been working on the creation 
of a new civilian police force. Under the plan, roughly 4,000 soldiers of 
Haiti's present 7,000-member military will be dismissed as irredeemable but 
will be offered civilian jobs.The rest will form the nucleus of an interim 
police force to be augmented by several hundred Haitian refugees being trained 
at Guantanamo Bay and by other Haitian exiles. This force will be supervised by 
500 international monitors while the United States trains a new permanent 
force. LIMITED NETWORK COVERAGE 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. television networks agreed to a compromise with the Pentagon under which 
they will refrain from broadcasting any sensitive pictures or narratives during 
the first hours of any U.S. invasion. They will not approach any troops or use 
camera lights during hours of darkness without the permission of military 
escorts. They refused, however, to stay in their hotels and off rooftops until 
the streets are secured. The networks were also told that the Haitian forces 
lack night-vision equipment and were urged to carefully prevent their night 
lenses from falling into Haitian hands. QUOTED 
</P>

 'We are ready . . . We will go in with a substantial military force.'

RITES MARK BRAVERY IN DEFEAT AT DUTCH BRIDGE; EUROPE: WORLD WAR II ALLIED 
OPERATION AIMED AT INVADING NAZI GERMANY LEFT BRITISH PARATROOPERS STRANDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was meant to be the most dramatic and successful Allied military operation 
after D-day, and it was indeed the largest airborne assault in history -- 
involving 35,000 U.S. and British paratroopers. 
</P>
<P>
 But 50 years later, in this small Dutch city on the Lower Rhine, survivors and 
national leaders -- including Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and Britain's 
Prince Charles -- on Sunday commemorated the valiant efforts of soldiers who 
suffered one of the worst Allied defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 Under rainy skies, they took part in a remembrance at the nearby Oosterbeek 
Airborne Cemetery where 1,700 bodies of the Arnhem dead lie -- some with the 
headstone "Known Unto God" -- those who believed their battle would end the war 
in Europe by the end of 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gen. John Hackett, who commanded a British airborne brigade at Arnhem and 
was in attendance Sunday, put it: "If we had been able to get the British 2nd 
Army across the Rhine and into the Ruhr, the war would have been over. At the 
time, we were much nearer Berlin than the Russians, and if we had got there 
first, the whole subsequent history of Europe and the Cold War would have been 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time Sunday, Dutch military buffs donned World War II U.S. army 
uniforms and drove a long column of U.S. jeeps and other vintage vehicles from 
Eindhoven to Nijmegen, about 10 miles south of Arnhem, to honor the American 
airborne troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arnhem defeat has been recounted in a dozen books, including the 
best-selling "A Bridge Too Far" by Cornelius Ryan, which was later made into a 
popular movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The ill-fated operation's code name was Market Garden, and the plan, devised 
by British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and approved by Supreme Allied 
Commander Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, was to stage airborne landings across 
bridges in the Netherlands and seize the Arnhem bridge 65 miles from the Allied 
front lines. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bridges in Allied hands, the British 2nd Army would race up the road, 
crossing the Rhine at Arnhem, in a position then to push east -- outflanking 
Germany's Ruhr industrial area and halting war production. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early part of the operation, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division, under 
Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, would drop and take the bridges around Eindhoven, about 
40 miles southwest of Arnhem. Simultaneously, the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, 
under Gen. James Gavin, would seize two major bridges farther north at Grave 
and Nijmegen. 
</P>
<P>
 The British 1st Airborne Division would jump and land by glider at 
northernmost Arnhem to capture the big bridge across the Rhine and hold it 
until British reinforcements from the 2nd Army arrived a couple of days later. 
</P>
<P>
 When Montgomery explained the complex plan to British airborne commander Lt. 
Gen. Frederick (Boy) Browning, the veteran paratrooper suggested, "Sir, I think 
we might be going a bridge too far." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part of the operation, the Americans performed superbly, securing 
the key bridges in their sectors and creating makeshift crossings where the 
Germans blew up bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rest of the plan was badly flawed: Browning ignored last-minute photo 
intelligence and reports from the Dutch Resistance underground that two German 
SS panzer divisions were in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Air Force, fearing antiaircraft fire, insisted on dropping 
paratroopers five to eight miles away from their objective, forcing lightly 
armed paratroops to fight their way to the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The air landings were scheduled over two days' time -- thereby giving up 
surprise and the full weight of the forces in action on the first day. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, field radios didn't work and units were not able to communicate with 
one another or headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more vitally, Montgomery failed to consider the marshy nature of the 
wet fields along the highway route the armored columns and infantry would 
travel: They were basically confined to a single road on which a disabled tank 
could block a whole column. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the British division found itself fighting German troops to get 
to the Arnhem bridge. Only one battalion of the British 1st Airborne -- 600 men 
or so -- reached the north end of the Arnhem bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The British soldiers held on for five days, fighting under appalling 
conditions until running out of food, water and, most important, ammunition -- 
waiting in vain for reinforcements to come to their aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the reinforcements to move quickly over bridges cleared by the 
two U.S. divisions resulted in the eventual surrender of the Arnhem troops: Of 
about 12,000 British troops who took part, 1,485 were killed in action; 6,525, 
most of whom were wounded, were captured, and only 3,910 were evacuated by 
boats across the Rhine on Sept. 25 and 26, l944. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens of Arnhem waited until April 4, 1945, to be liberated by the 1st 
Canadian Army. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the planning -- and of the ground forces to reach the British 
troops -- still rankles, particularly among the former paratroopers, wearing 
red berets with silver wings and sporting medals on their blazers, who have 
thronged this Dutch city for the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gen. Hackett, now 84, who escaped Arnhem and was protected by a Dutch 
family for five months, put it, "The ground troops could have broken through on 
the night of Sept. 20, if they had gone hell for leather." 
</P>
<P>
 And Sapper Jack Standen, 78, who was a member of the Royal Engineers attached 
to the paratroopers and who attended the ceremonies Sunday with his wife, 
Yvonne, said: "We should never have been there. They should have realized the 
2nd Army could not get to us in time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was supposed to keep the Germans from blowing up the bridges, defuse the 
charges. But I never got to the bridge. Never past headquarters at Oosterbeek. 
We all wound up defending the perimeter; we were all infantry at the end. I was 
one of the lucky ones who got out across the river." 
</P>
<P>
 Former airborne Capt. Keith Bell, now 74, who jumped at Arnhem and later went 
to work as an insurance broker in New York, also reminisced with some 
bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 Still fit-looking, with a quiet parachute regiment tie, he recalled: "I jumped 
from my DC-3 Dakota at 500 feet just as it was hit by flak. Ten of my men got 
out with me; 10 died in the crash of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "We formed the defensive line at Oosterbeek. I was wounded and, when the 
evacuation was ordered, tried to escape, but I was captured -- and was a POW 
for the rest of the war until our prison camp was liberated by the Americans on 
April 12, the same day President (Franklin D.) Roosevelt died. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have landed next to the bridge and took our losses there. It was 
not well planned. We were eager to go in. We fought well. We were all so young 
then. And so many dead. I felt a great sadness at the cemetery today." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a brighter side, according to Hackett it is the firm ties between 
the British and Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has come out of this tragedy," he said, "is a friendship which will 
endure long after all of us have gone. It was not so much a strategic and 
tactical defeat as a victory for the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reuters news agency said Dutch police reported Sunday that Hackett was 
injured in a car accident just after the memorial service at the Oosterbeek 
cemetery. He was released from a hospital after receiving treatment for minor 
injuries, but an 82-year-old British veteran in the car was kept overnight 
after suffering a fracture.

LAW ENFORCEMENT; ATLANTIC CITY HAS TEMPTING PERKS TO LURE POLICE BACK TO URBAN 
LIVING; USING A CASINO FUND, IT OFFERS NEARLY INTEREST-FREE HOUSING, TAKE-HOME 
CARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the surface, this East Coast gambling resort, which draws millions of 
visitors a year, might seem to have it all: sea, sand and a castle called 
Trump. But Atlantic City, with its deeper problems, now is trying to throw 
money at its police officers just to get them to move back here. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual gamble over a dilemma faced by many large cities, including Los 
Angeles, Atlantic City has pooled $5 million from its casino endowment fund to 
pay for practically no-interest home mortgage loans that the mayor, police 
chief and casino commission hope will convince the police that living here is 
worth the price. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers would get loans at next to nothing, accelerated monthly payment 
schedules, even free take-home city cars. And yet, while there have been lots 
of inquiries since the program was announced earlier this summer, there still 
are no takers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, even some of those pitching the plan the hardest -- such as the 
police chief and the head of the police union -- admit they have no intention 
of taking advantage of such a sweetheart deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting calls now from all around the country from police departments 
looking at what we're trying to do here," boasted Police Chief Nicholas Rifice. 
But he lives north of the city and his kids are in school there, and he doesn't 
plan to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a lot of positive feedback from the rank and file. I think they 
like it," said the president of the Police Benevolent Assn., Robert Campbell. 
He also lives outside Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure all the loans will be taken," predicted Sgt. Ernest Jubilee. He is 
the Police Department's chief spokesman and, with just a couple of years left 
before his retirement, he sees no reason to pull up stakes in the comfortable 
suburb of Pleasantville and move back to Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the police officials believe that the giveaway better suits young 
police officers, those who are single or married with only young children, the 
kind that might be more adaptable to moving. 
</P>
<P>
 But therein lies the rub. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, as crime, poverty and urban decay moved into Atlantic City 
before and after the casinos arrived, rookie officers steadily migrated out of 
the city. Today, only about 21% of the 400 officers call Atlantic City home. 
</P>
<P>
 That figure is comparable to Los Angeles, where only 17% live in the city, 
according to findings released earlier this year by the American Civil 
Liberties Union. City Hall officials in Los Angeles have begun weighing similar 
programs, including rent subsidies and salary incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Under New Jersey law, city officials cannot impose a residency requirement on 
police officers to force them to live within the city limits. But city 
officials can require that new officers, when they are hired and join the 
police academy, live in Atlantic City. So the vast majority of the recruits 
take apartments in the city during their training and then, once they get their 
badge, they bolt for the 'burbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't keep them," said Campbell. "We can't make them stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Nicholas R. Amato can. At least he's going to try. 
</P>
<P>
 Amato is executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority 
on Atlantic Avenue here. He said he thought up the plan, won support from City 
Hall and drew up the contributions from the casino reinvestment fund. He 
brought in the Washington-based Police Foundation to study the situation and 
now is crossing his fingers that his real estate venture is going to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a perception that Atlantic City is not safe, and having a police 
officer living on your street helps change that perception," he said. "We have 
to make it clean and safe and affordable." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Amato isn't a permanent resident here either, but rather commutes 
home on weekends to northern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor James Whalen does live here, and his son, a police officer, lives 
with him. Although the son has not yet committed, his father is nudging him to 
sign up and buy his own home in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of how many officers sign up, and I think we'll fill the initial 
round of 35 loans, there are other things we are doing to make life attractive 
here," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic City is unique in that it is merely 40 blocks long, with just 35,000 
residents, but it swells with more than 30 million tourist visits a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Police respond to 300,000 calls each year. Visitors who stop at the first red 
light off the Atlantic City Expressway see an eerie scene of glitzy high-rise 
casinos next to the blight of boarded-up downtown buildings. In the fancy 
hotels, employees warn tourists not to wander off the boardwalk at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of the city's tough image as a crime zone, Chief Rifice has begun a 
series of efforts to get more desk officers back on the street and to step up 
community policing programs. He said there have been some gains already in 
lowering violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amato argues that turning more officers into homeowners is the best 
community policing program ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that crime and cops cannot exist on the same street," he said. 
"People aren't so dumb to hang out and sell dope and rob people in front of a 
policeman's house." 
</P>
<P>
 How the so-called 3-2-1 Police Loan Program works: 
</P>
<P>
 An officer and his or her family choose a home, then turn for financing to 
Amato's casino panel. The commission has earmarked $5 million to cover the 
first 35 loans. The loan limits would be $120,000, and no down payments are 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest rates are set by three categories depending on the type of 
neighborhood the officer selects. In the roughest areas, an officer would pay 
only a $100 application fee and just 1% interest on a 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgage. But for every year he or she lives there, a year is lopped off the 
back of the loan, meaning the officer would own the home free and clear in 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan parameters stay the same for the other neighborhoods too, except that 
a medium area would be a $200 application fee and 2% interest, while the best 
area would be a $300 application fee and 3% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The money comes from reimbursements paid back to the commission by three Trump 
casinos: Trump Castle, Trump Plaza and the Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer would get a free patrol car to take home and use on personal 
errands too, but the officer must park the car on the street or in his 
driveway. It must be visible. And he must respond to any nearby disturbances he 
hears on the car radio. 
</P>
<P>
 When the program was announced this summer, a flurry of police officers 
arrived at the commission's headquarters downtown, just a couple of blocks from 
the famed boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Jubilee said one officer told colleagues he was returning to Atlantic 
City, then changed his mind and built a pool in his back yard in the suburbs. 
Another officer has said he may apply for a loan, but he already lives in the 
city with his parents. And a husband and wife who are both officers also are 
considering the program, but they also already live in the city as renters. 
</P>
<P>
 While that kind of interest is promising, Hubert Williams, director of the 
Police Foundation, said it still misses the goal of getting more officers back 
in the city. It was Williams who studied the Atlantic City police residency 
patterns and helped shape the program with Amato. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the more advanced thinking projects in police work in the 
country," he said. "Whenever you set up a situation where police are working 
and living with the public in a positive way, it reduces fear and enhances the 
reputation of the police department."

RULING PARTY SWEPT OUT IN SWEDISH VOTE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a brief fling with conservative government, Swedes restored the Social 
Democrats to power in national elections Sunday, initial projections showed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Democratic leader, Ingvar Carlsson, 59, declared victory and called 
on Prime Minister Carl Bildt to resign.Minutes later, Bildt conceded defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 But unofficial results showed the Social Democrats, who built Sweden's welfare 
state, would not win an outright majority in the 349-seat Parliament. That made 
a minority or coalition government likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters dismayed by rising inflation, 14% unemployment and an enormous public 
debt had been expected to oust Bildt's center-right coalition after just three 
years in power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Democrats, who led Sweden during most of the past 60 years, focused 
their comeback campaign on limited welfare cuts, higher personal taxes and 
business development.

 The first uniformed Germans to visit the Auschwitz death camp in 50 years paid 
an emotional homage to the past on Sunday in a ceremony that also symbolized 
hopes for the future of united Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 60 soldiers and 35 officers of the Bundeswehr, the German army, 
were in tears as they toured the barracks that housed 1.5 million people killed 
by the Nazis at Auschwitz during World War II, including more than 1 million 
Jews.

PLO POLICE, ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS CLASH IN GAZA; OFFICER KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Islamic militants opposed to peace with Israel clashed with PLO police Sunday 
in a Gaza Strip gunfight that killed one officer and wounded two Islamic 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first fatal clash between the security forces of Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat's self-rule government and 
gunmen from the main opposition group, Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas warned that the incident could increase its opposition to Arafat's 
autonomy government in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West Bank, meanwhile, Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian 
riding in a car that ran an army roadblock near the city of Ramallah. A second 
passenger was wounded, Israeli military sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 And an Israeli soldier was stabbed at a highway intersection south of Tel 
Aviv, police said. A Palestinian stabbed the trooper from behind with a large 
kitchen knife, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gaza, Palestinian security sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
intelligence agent Lt. Yusri Darwish Hams, 43, was killed in a confrontation 
with two Hamas activists in the southern town of Rafah. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas issued a leaflet saying Arafat's forces fired on two of its activists 
who were stopped on a main road and refused to surrender their weapons. The 
leaflet said PLO agents seriously wounded a Hamas leader, Mohammed Abu Shamala, 
and slightly wounded another activist. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO police reportedly raided homes of Hamas activists in the Rafah area after 
the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hold the intelligence forces responsible for what happened today, and we 
call on the Palestinian forces to protect the warm relationship between our 
people and not to escalate the situation," the Hamas leaflet said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,000 Palestinian mourners, including approximately 1,000 members of 
Gaza's 8,000-strong security forces, attended Hams' funeral in Rafah, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has demanded that Arafat crack down on Hamas and a second militant 
group, the Islamic Jihad. The two groups have claimed responsibility for the 
deaths of 11 Israelis since May. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat arrested nearly 50 Islamic Jihad activists earlier this month, but 
released most of them after they pledged to support the self-rule accord.

SHUTTLE CREW LOOKS FORWARD TO LANDING BUT MAY BE DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With their mission accomplished, Discovery's six astronauts looked forward to 
coming home today and taking their first showers in a week and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 They may have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Stormy weather was forecast for Kennedy Space Center at 11:23 a.m. PDT, the 
time of the scheduled landing. NASA could send the shuttle to Edwards Air Force 
Base in California later in the day. The astronauts have a second landing 
opportunity in Florida at 12:55 p.m. PDT if bad weather or technical problems 
force them to pass up the first. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty fatiguing up here. I think a lot of us are looking forward to 
getting home, getting a good shower and some good old earthbound things we 
enjoy," Discovery's pilot, L. Blaine Hammond Jr., said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Hammond said he and his crew mates wouldn't mind spending 
another day in orbit "because it's an opportunity so rare." They've been aloft 
since Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The astronauts achieved everything they set out to do. They released and 
retrieved a sun-gazing satellite, measured the damaging effects of their own 
jet exhaust on space structures and helped direct laser pulses at Earth for an 
atmospheric study. 
</P>
<P>
 And -- most spectacularly -- they tested a new jet pack during a rare 
untethered spacewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronaut Mark Lee described the spacewalk as a once-in-a-lifetime "special 
treat." He became the first human satellite in 10 years on Friday when he 
disconnected his lifeline and used the jet pack to drift over an open cargo 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's partner, Carl Meade, gave him a spin and a toss to see if the jet pack 
would steady an astronaut tumbling out of control. It did. Meade also tried out 
the jet pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "The total blackness of space just overwhelms you when you don't see the 
shuttle," Lee said during Sunday's space-to-ground news conference. "That part 
was probably the scariest of the whole part: When you're rotated, you're 
tumbled and all of a sudden you see black . . . you hope that the shuttle shows 
up again when you come around." 
</P>
<P>
 The $7-million jet pack, called Safer, is intended as an emergency rescue 
device for future space station crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two exist but NASA plans to build more now that engineers know Safer 
works. The new units should be ready by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 During routine landing preparations, the crew test-fired the 38 steering jets. 
One jet failed; NASA said that would pose no problem for the trip home.

BABBITT OKS OVERHAUL OF PARK SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has approved a plan to reorganize the 
National Park Service, downsize the Washington headquarters and place more 
employees in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt, Assistant Secretary George T. Frampton Jr. and National Park Service 
Director Roger G. Kennedy announced the decision to go forward with the 
reorganization during a conference call with regional offices and the major 
parks last week, Frampton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secretary made a point of saying that he was committed to holding the 
Park Service harmless as possible for FTE reductions," Frampton said, referring 
to "full-time equivalent," the budget measurement used to count personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any FTEs saved from Washington and regional office reductions will be 
positions that will be available in the parks." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a work force reduction of about 1,400 employees, Frampton said, the 
plan approved by Babbitt would reduce the cut to 450 to 500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 To help ease the cutback, the Park Service will offer "buyouts" of up to 
$25,000 to employees who volunteer by Friday to resign or take early retirement 
between Oct. 15 and Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Frampton said payroll savings from the job reduction should help offset the 
costs of the reorganization, estimated at $30 million over two years. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the department will proceed with the reorganization plan, which was 
written by a group of Park Service employees, as soon as Congress gives its 
approval.

CIA OFFICIALS ARE CRITICIZED IN REPORT ON AMES SPY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER PINCUS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The CIA inspector general has identified more than a dozen active or retired 
officials who either ignored warnings or overlooked complaints against onetime 
counterintelligence officer Aldrich H. Ames during the nine years he spied for 
Moscow, according to sources familiar with the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiefs, deputies and operating personnel in the Office of Security reportedly 
come under fire in a 400-page report for their failure to follow up on 
information about Ames' lavish spending in 1990.The security office's polygraph 
operation, which passed Ames in 1986 and 1991 despite some indications of 
deception, was specifically criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials in the Operations Directorate, either his direct supervisors 
or managers, also are said to be cited in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft report, which is described as "tough" by one person familiar with 
its contents, is made up of two basic sections. The first is a factual 
narrative of Ames' 31-year CIA career, exploring particularly the times he was 
reported for alcoholism, displayed sudden wealth and was identified as having 
violated agency rules. That history is followed by an analysis of the 
individual and institutional failures that permitted Ames to carry out his 
espionage activities undetected for almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft is being circulated inside the agency for comments from the 
individuals and offices mentioned. The comments will be reviewed by Inspector 
General Frederick P. Hitz, who will deliver it shortly to CIA Director R. James 
Woolsey, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey is expected to decide before Sept. 29 what actions need to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames pleaded guilty in April and was sentenced to life in prison.

SIR KARL POPPER; PHILOSOPHER DENOUNCED TOTALITARIANISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sir Karl Popper, who as one of the 20th Century's most respected philosophers 
railed against Marxism and dismissed Freud, has died in a south London hospital 
after a long illness. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
 A proponent of individual liberty -- rather than the impersonal forces of 
history -- as a shaper of events, Popper had a profound impact on contemporary 
political thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hintze, the general secretary of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
Christian Democrats, described Popper as a centrist. "His guiding philosophical 
steps were based on anti-totalitarianism, therefore posing a determined 
opposition to far-right extremists as well as communists," Hintze said. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 
1987 for his efforts to boost democracy as an alternative to guerrilla warfare, 
credited Popper's work with solidifying his aversion to authoritarian regimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Arias cited Popper's best-known book, "The Open Society and Its 
Enemies." Published in 1945, it critiqued the philosophies of thinkers from 
Plato to Marx for giving rise to totalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only we, as human individuals, can do it," he wrote. "Instead of posing as 
prophets we must become the makers of our fate." 
</P>
<P>
 Popper also was known throughout his career for his writings on the scientific 
process. In 1957 he dismissed Freudian psychoanalysis, along with Marxism and 
astrology, as a self-confirming, non-scientific theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Popper was a professor of logic and science at the London School of Economics 
at the University of London for two decades beginning in 1949.

PRO FOOTBALL; MONTANA CONTINUES MASTERY OF FALCONS; INTERCONFERENCE: HE PASSES 
FOR GEORGIA DOME RECORD 361 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN LEADING CHIEFS, 30-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Montana seems to always have his way with the Atlanta Falcons and doesn't 
seem to know why. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea," he said Sunday night after passing for a Georgia Dome record 
361 and two touchdowns, leading Kansas City to a 30-10 victory over the 
Falcons. "I wish I knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana completed 28 of 39 passes, including touchdown passes of 13 and 34 
yards to J.J. Birden, as the Chiefs remained unbeaten after three games, the 
first time they've been 3-0 since 1966, when they ended up in the first Super 
Bowl, losing to the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Montana's seventh victory in a row in Atlanta, the other six coming 
when he was with the San Francisco 49ers. It also lifted his career record in 
starts against the Falcons to 14-5, including 12 of his last 13. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gave him an 18-4 mark in domed stadiums, arenas in which he enjoys 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't throw the ball hard. There's no wind in here. There's no wind to 
hamper the ducks I throw," he said, flashing a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana was intercepted twice, but got plenty of help from a defense that 
forced the Falcons into six turnovers. There were two interceptions of Jeff 
George, who passed for 299 yards and Atlanta's only touchdown, a 25-yarder to 
Andre Rison in the final quarter after Kansas City had built a 23-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Thomas was the ringleader of the defense with a sack, two forced 
fumbles and two fumble recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today everything worked -- inside pressure, outside pressure and excellent 
coverage in the secondary," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the outstanding work in the secondary came from Dale Carter, who held 
Andre Rison to three catches for 72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs wasted little time setting the tone when Carter ended George's 
string of 279 passes without an interception, third-best in NFL history. Carter 
returned it 24 yards to the Atlanta 28, setting up the game's first touchdown 
-- a 16-yard pass play from Montana to Birden. Tough to Intercept

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; 'KILLERS.' GET IT ? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Jennifer Myers says that "the audience doesn't get it," I am afraid she 
didn't get it. But it is a different it ("Two Thumbs Down for 'Natural Born 
Killers': Young Viewers May Not Perceive the Satire," Sept. 12). 
</P>
<P>
 In Jonathan Swift's era, satire averted retaliation invited by a direct attack 
on the Establishment. In our free society, anyone can and does say anything, 
especially about our leaders. Satire has become obsolete, an arcane device 
appreciated by very few. 
</P>
<P>
 And the it ? That society doesn't see violence as reprehensible. It is too 
frightful to be real. It can still only happen to others, not to me. Every 
presentation of violence is absorbed as entertainment only. Taken any other way 
it would be too menacing. And the media is merely part of the system to deliver 
the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The media fete us with hours of police-formation riding/driving. The audience 
reaction to Stone's cinematic violence is the important message. Do we respond 
to themes of extreme violence as entertainment because we feel helpless to 
control its menace -- or do we simply not get it?

COUNTERPUNCH: THE ETHICS OF A MOVIE ON THE QUIZ SHOW SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ENRIGHT, Don Enright is an Emmy Award-winning producer of movies for 
television. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife and daughter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the quiz show scandal broke, my sister was 10 years old, and I myself was 
8. Almost overnight, our lives changed. 
</P>
<P>
 As the producer of the wildly popular "Twenty-One" -- and five other network 
shows -- our father had been the toast of the industry. As his bright, 
well-behaved children, we had enjoyed a modest schoolyard notoriety. But now 
our father had suddenly become a villain, excoriated everywhere as the living 
symbol of all that was wrong with the country. And many kids were no longer 
allowed to play with me. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other kids -- and many adults -- were, for years after, just casually 
nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, in watching my father go down, I was taught about more than social 
cruelty. Among many other things, I learned to have a healthy skepticism for 
the official story. Yes, Dan Enright fixed his quiz shows, but shows had been 
fixed since the the beginning of quiz show history. As I saw my father take the 
fall -- and watched so many others, equally culpable, scurry away, free -- I 
learned much, since confirmed, about public executions and more about 
sanctimonious hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 And now life has brought us "Quiz Show," the movie ("They Conned America," 
Calendar, Aug. 28). 
</P>
<P>
 Written by a former film critic, who calls it his "revenge on television," and 
based on the memoirs of its hero, a young congressional investigator, the film 
is explicitly intended as a public morality lesson. It was produced and 
directed by Robert Redford. 
</P>
<P>
 "The film raises the question of ethics," he told the New York Times. "Are 
they going to keep the concept of ethics . . . . Or will it disappear from the 
language, like shame? " 
</P>
<P>
 Someone needs to give the answer to Robert Redford. 
</P>
<P>
 While in interviews Redford admits to changing some facts, on screen "Quiz 
Show" is explicitly represented to be a true story. It uses real names in its 
promotion, it uses real faces. At the same time, the movie carries none of the 
familiar fictional content disclaimers. Not even at the very end in tiny 
letters. No, Redford hands down his movie as revealed truth, re-created. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not. "Quiz Show," the movie, is rigged. Fixed. Just like its 
television counterpart. And for precisely the same reason. Played straight, the 
story would be much more dramatically complicated and much less morally 
convenient. The real truth is that Redford has sacrificed truth -- not to say 
decency -- to make his show a more dramatic, more compelling and, ultimately, 
more successful product for mass entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely the same offense for which they once, quite properly, condemned Dan 
Enright. 
</P>
<P>
 But the irony is lost on Robert Redford. His fix is in from the opening titles 
-- a flamboyant sequence portrayed as part of "Twenty-One" but actually lifted 
from a rival program. People will ask: "Does it matter? Does that really change 
anything?" I don't know. Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it doesn't matter that Redford creates whole scenes from whole cloth, 
drastically alters the sequence of events, forever transforms my father and his 
associates into malign caricatures, offensive and unrecognizable. The man who, 
as a deputy district attorney, really investigated "Twenty-One" has told the 
New York Times that this film is a "tawdry hoax" and that much of its portrayal 
of Dan Enright -- bribing the court to suppress evidence, tricking a contestant 
into rigging -- is wholly fictitious. Yet apparently, as a media-certified 
public moralist, Redford qualifies for an unrestricted dramatic license. 
</P>
<P>
 Because, though I have a videotape in my office of the actual show episode 
that Redford dramatizes in his movie, so far, nobody has asked to see it. Maybe 
truth only really counts when scandal is in season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of shame," he lamented to the New York Times, "carries no weight 
anymore." Yet shame sure weighed heavily on Dan Enright. He lived in his shame 
until the day he died, trying for years to make amends, haunted by his history 
in everything he did. At his funeral, hundreds of people mourned him. 
</P>
<P>
 But, oh, how my father's great shame now rests so lightly, on the broad 
shoulders of Robert Redford.

COUNTERPUNCH: SPORTSWOMEN SPEND MONEY TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BONNIE FRANKEL, Bonnie Frankel is a runner and swimmer who last year 
successfully challenged an NCAA rule that prevented older female athletes from 
competing in college sports. She is a recent graduate of Loyola Marymount 
University, where she was on the swim team, and she competes on the masters 
circuit. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Amateur Athletic Foundation recently reported in a study that local 
television stations under-report women's sports and female athletes (Larry 
Stewart's TV/Radio column, Sports, Aug. 12). According to Stewart, one way to 
correct this gender imbalance is to hire more female sportscasters. 
</P>
<P>
 While this is a laudable goal, we have seen that hiring of women and 
minorities for visible anchor positions in television fails to bring a 
much-needed balance to overall news coverage, whether crime or sports. So, 
while I welcome more female sportscasters, it doesn't assure they'll cover 
women's sports events. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, news anchors do not make decisions on what is broadcast. Station 
management, dominated for decades by men, as all entertainment and media 
companies have been, decides what entertainment and news we receive. According 
to the 1994 Women, Men and Media annual survey, men do stories about other men 
76% of the time on television news. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to ever change decisions made by male media executives is to 
change the financial balance in their advertising dollars. A friend of mine who 
worked for a very powerful advertising agency told me about her effort in the 
'70s to get the agency to support a beer campaign aimed at women. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her client was a major Midwestern beer company, there was a lot of male 
tradition to overcome both at the brewery and the ad agency. Her research 
showed that women buy the beer, not men. It made sense to her that the ads 
begin to depict women bonding over a beer the way men do. She was sure sales 
would soar, but she could not persuade her agency to take the chance, even for 
one quarter's worth of advertising. The idea was never even presented to the 
client. 
</P>
<P>
 My point is not to glamorize women drinking beer but to get advertisers of all 
sorts of products associated with sports to recognize a fact and an 
opportunity: There has been a generational shift in how many of us feel about 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, at age 48, I challenged the NCAA to allow older female athletes the 
chance to compete in college sports. I won. In doing my homework, I was stunned 
to discover that the NCAA did not sanction women's competition on college 
campuses until 1981. But what a sea of change has occurred in the world of 
sports in the last 10 years as a result -- a whole new generation of female 
athletes has charged onto the scene. We are interested in more than fashionable 
athletic wear, sturdy athletic shoes and trendy beer and sports drinks; we take 
our athletics very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting lifestyle changes show up everywhere. Not all family gatherings 
now end with the same old ritual -- the men adjourn to the living room to watch 
football, the women do the dishes. That pattern is a relic from a generation 
that told its girls that sports were only for "tomboys," not young ladies. That 
pattern existed before the advent of women's sports at colleges and 
universities, before the advent of Martina, before Title IX and the explosive 
expansion of sports for girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Another friend of mine just sent his daughter off to a prestigious East Coast 
college on a full four-year volleyball scholarship. That would never have 
happened when I was a girl. It has taken a lot of women a lot of years to come 
to terms with our athletic power and prowess. It has taken a full generation of 
college and professional women's sports to allow us the dignity of competing 
without being labeled "boy crazy" or any other pejorative term. But we're still 
relegated to the "back of the bus" when it comes to media sports coverage. 
Women's sports coverage still has the air of accommodating rather than 
respecting our achievements. "Skategate" nearly undid us. Although it was the 
first time a women's sport achieved the kind of blanket coverage that 
ordinarily goes to men, the Tonya and Nancy story took on soap-opera rather 
than athletic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate America is missing the boat. There is real money here, fellas. Yes, 
hire female sportscasters -- but more important, turn them loose on sports news 
about women. The inevitable result will be a whole new advertising audience you 
never dreamed existed. We are out there by the hundreds of thousands, running, 
training, biking, hiking, playing all forms of sports, not on strike, and 
hungry for the recognition we deserve.

COUNTERPUNCH: TAKE THE 'A' WORD OUT OF THE CLOSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KEARNS, Michael Kearns is an openly gay, openly HIV-positive actor 
and the artistic director of Artists Confronting AIDS. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I sat in the Pasadena Civic Auditorium at the 46th annual nighttime Emmy 
Awards, snuggling with nominee Sir Ian McKellan (the most elegant and eloquent 
openly gay actor in the world), it became painfully apparent that -- in spite 
of the ubiquitous self-serving red ribbons -- AIDS has become a dirty word on 
the Emmy telecast (in startling contrast to last year's Oscars). 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, the "A" word was never mentioned. Perhaps it was on a list of 
words the producers threatened to bleep? 
</P>
<P>
 When introducing the list of nominees for best made-for-television movie, 
Angela Lansbury awkwardly referred to "And the Band Played On," employing the 
catchy phrase (presumably provided by the show's writers) "a microscopic 
organism." Hello? That's a bit like calling "Murder, She Wrote" a 
"criminological detection show." Those writers for the Emmys should get an 
award for euphemizing. 
</P>
<P>
 And when producer Aaron Spelling accepted the award for "Band," he also 
managed not to utter the "A" word. It would be like Steven Spielberg accepting 
the award for "Schindler's List" and avoiding the words Jew or Holocaust. While 
Spelling managed to acknowledge author Randy Shilts, he failed to mention 
Shilts died of AIDS. Is it accidental, or deeply subconscious, that Spelling 
chose to speak more openly about AIDS backstage -- in front of a fraction of 
the audience? While the cause of Shilts' death may be considered common 
knowledge in Hollywood, certainly Spelling, if anyone, knows the impact of 
speaking directly to multimillions of television viewers and educating them 
about another talented young man being eclipsed in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well, he had on a red ribbon. But what do the red ribbons mean? Are we 
presumptuous enough to believe everyone in the television audience knows? Are 
we so blase about AIDS we no longer need to include a heartfelt statement 
indicating the significance of the red ribbon? Red ribbons on award shows have 
become a vapid, politically correct accouterment, worn as routinely as a 
cummerbund. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the Emmys, one might have assumed "And the Band Played On" was a 
biopic depicting the life of John Philip Sousa and wearing a red ribbon 
indicated you were a Sousa aficionado. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest laugh of the evening was when a teary, quivering Faye Dunaway, 
responding to a deserved testament to the late, great Jessica Tandy, suggested 
Hollywood "has a heart." Really, Faye. What about Emile Ardolino, the 
Emmy-nominated director of "Gypsy," who died of that microscopic organism? No 
special mention of his name, let alone a tribute. A town with heart, blah, 
blah, blah. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS, however, wasn't the only "A" word avoided. When accepting her award for 
best actress in "David's Story," a compelling movie about autism, a loopy 
Kirstie Alley managed to ramble incoherently about her husband instead of 
seizing an opportunity to inform multitudes about a disease that screams for 
understanding. A town with heart, blah, blah, blah. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most damning of all is the parade of gays and lesbians in the 
television industry -- most of whom ostentatiously sport red ribbons -- who 
remain barricaded in their closets. If we know anything about HIV/AIDS after a 
dozen years, we are absolutely certain its relentlessness is largely due to 
homophobia. Gays and lesbians in the entertainment industry who refuse to come 
out are directly contributing to the specious notion that homosexuality is 
shameful. That goes for everyone from the stars of series (you know who you 
are) to key grips. Robotically pinning on a red ribbon doesn't cut it; the only 
way a gay man or a lesbian can effectively combat AIDS is to come out of the 
closet. Period. 
</P>
<P>
 That brings me back to Sir Ian, an actor whose luminous career continues to 
reach meteoric heights after he proudly announced his homosexuality. While no 
one really takes seriously his not picking up an Emmy, many of us longed to 
hear his impassioned voice, soulfully embracing his gayness and actually saying 
the word AIDS. A man with heart, yes -- from London, not Hollywood.

AMERICORPS VOLUNTEER HELPS HERSELF AND OTHERS; COMMUNITY: A HMONG IMMIGRANT 
WILL WORK IN A LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROGRAM. SHE IS EARNING MONEY FOR HER COLLEGE 
EDUCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 College student Mali Vang knows what it's like to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old Hmong immigrant from Laos shares a home with 12 relatives -- 
her parents, five siblings, an aunt and four cousins. At 15, she began working 
in fast-food restaurants to help the family survive and to save for her 
education at Rancho Santiago Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 But there won't be another burger-flipping job for her this year. Instead, 
she'll spend 32 hours a week helping a Santa Ana low-income housing group as an 
interpreter for Hmong and Laotian communities. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of President Clinton's AmeriCorps community service program, the 
federal government will provide her $4,700 for college tuition in exchange for 
the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents always wanted me to go to college, and I feel better if I can make 
a difference in people's lives," said the soft-spoken Vang, after completing 
her final interview Friday at the Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp. near 
downtown Santa Ana. "It's great to help somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country this year, 20,000 AmeriCorps members will help with a 
variety of community outreach programs. Some will coordinate child immunization 
drives. Others will work in community policing, urban beautification and 
domestic violence prevention.  
</P>
<P>
 Students will also bolster the ranks of the National Community AIDS 
Partnership, the YMCA and Teach for America organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four AmeriCorps members will work for the Barrio Housing Corp., a 
nonprofit organization founded in 1974 to build and maintain low-income housing 
in this heavily Latino city. It was the only Orange County agency chosen to 
participate in AmeriCorps, which Clinton envisions as a domestic Peace Corps 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the answer to our dreams," said the group's president, Helen Brown. 
"The corporation was started by 400 low-income families who wanted to be the 
kind of landlords who helped families become self-sufficient and offered 
anti-gang and anti-drug activities. But we've never been able to expand on that 
idea because we didn't have enough money to hire the people to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization maintains 1,300 housing units at complexes in Santa Ana, 
Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Palmdale, Chula Vista and Santa Maria. Brown said the 
AmeriCorps volunteers will be assigned in teams of five to work with the 
residents' associations that govern the complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers will help identify needed services, from child care 
cooperatives and health care clinics to after-school youth activities and 
English classes. Students also will pair people with the appropriate service 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Vang, who speaks Hmong and English, said the Hmong community needs bilingual 
people to act as liaisons in a world that can sometimes be very unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hmong families get welfare information in the mail but because they don't 
understand it, sometimes they throw it away," said Vang, a sophomore human 
service major.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we could teach them basic English and help them know where to go for 
help. Maybe we could set up a program to help the kids with their homework, 
because most times both parents work and don't have much education themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow AmeriCorps member and Rancho Santiago student Monica Arreola will lend 
the same kind of help to Latino residents of Barrio Housing Corp. complexes. 
The 19-year-old sophomore said she wants to find ways to give kids in her 
neighborhood a chance at a life other than one of drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope, since I've grown up in Santa Ana, I can help uplift the community," 
said Arreola, 19, a criminal justice major who wants to be a police officer. 
"If we don't help the children now . . . " Her voice trailed off. "It's kind of 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
 The two said they jumped at the chance to join AmeriCorps, for both altruistic 
and selfish reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy to pay for education these days," said Arreola, who said she 
considered joining the military as a means of paying for college. "And this is 
hands-on experience that will be useful if I become a police officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at the housing organization said they are thrilled that young people 
today are dedicated to community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "These participants will allow us to broaden the scope of activities of the 
residents' associations," Brown said. "And the AmeriCorps participants will go 
away with an understanding of what life in a very low-income community is like. 
Hopefully, they'll have a more gracious heart."

GOING ON-LINE TO HELP OTHERS GET OFF THE BOTTLE; TECHNOLOGY: AGING FORMER 
DRINKER DEDICATES BULLETIN BOARD SERVICE TO MEMORY OF HIS LATE WIFE.

 Inside the guts of Grant Hoel's computer lie a personal tribute and what could 
be the genesis of sobriety for anyone else who has a computer, modem and an 
addiction to alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 The 72-year-old Hoel has written a program for a computer bulletin board that 
offers information about Alcoholics Anonymous, and a few megabytes more. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many questions on the mind of a person who needs help but is 
afraid to do anything," said Hoel, who lives and works in Capistrano Beach. "I 
love what AA has given me. I was just a . . . drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the bulletin board's menu are AA telephone numbers in Orange 
County, stories written by teen-agers overcoming the struggles of addiction, 
answers to commonly asked questions, and excerpts from a book by a Laguna Beach 
author on 12 steps toward recovery, which were originally designed by AA. 
</P>
<P>
 It was AA's philosophy, which Hoel first heard more than two decades ago in 
the basement of a skid row church in Phoenix, that plucked his life from the 
wreckage of a two-quart-a-day vodka habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoel hasn't taken a drink since 1968, but it doesn't mean that things are 
getting any easier. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, his wife, Dori, died of emphysema at age 70. The couple met through 
AA and had built their new life around helping others beat the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Dori was one of six women who led an AA meeting for former First Lady Betty 
Ford when she checked into a Long Beach hospital. Over the years, Dori also 
assisted several South County women in their quest for sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a quality about her that gave people hope," said Muriel Zink of 
Laguna Beach who wrote "Step by Step," a book from which Hoel borrowed a few 
passages for his project. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Dori's death, Hoel said he and his wife had talked about the idea of 
launching the computer bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished the task in her memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't planned this way, I'll tell you," Hoel said. "It meant so much to 
her that I dedicated the service to her with hopes that newcomers might not be 
terrified by going to an AA meeting. You know, people are worried that there 
are going to be a bunch of guys in trench coats. And they don't want to be seen 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 His face etched by lines created by more than time, Hoel must stop himself 
from crying when he talks of his spouse. She learned about the ravages of 
alcoholism through an article in a 1962 Saturday Evening Post, which she kept 
and Hoel now treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoel said he can't publish a magazine but hopes to reach people in the 
computer age, when information-seeking can be cloaked in anonymity -- something 
many alcoholics crave as much as a slug of liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the information on the bulletin board is from a pamphlet that's 
printed and available, but you have to go to a meeting to get it," said Hoel, 
who would be glad if one person benefited after connecting via computer to the 
project that may be the only one of its kind in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 A manager at the main Orange County office of Alcoholics Anonymous in Santa 
Ana said she has heard of computer bulletin boards where people post messages 
but nothing as comprehensive as Hoel's program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is neither endorsed by AA nor does Hoel say that it is. The 
organization, founded in 1935, does not take a position on similar activities 
outside of its own program. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the group's title professes, anonymity is a main trait. Meetings are 
not discussed. Privacy is paramount. Last names are usually withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta, a manager at the Santa Ana office of AA who chose not to give her 
last name, said anything that may help someone gain sobriety is worth pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
 A staff member at the General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous in New 
York City said people with home computers have been swapping comments about AA 
since about 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as AA members write letters back and forth, it's another way of 
corresponding and communicating with each other," said the staff member, Helen. 
"If this is something that is occupying his time and giving him something to 
do, I think it's good." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulletin board is a free service, although Hoel does have a computer 
consulting business he runs with a partner, Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael, who met Hoel three years ago through AA, said the bulletin board 
project carries out the goal of AA: stay sober and help others achieve 
sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interest in that bulletin board will help him not drink today," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hoel, the bulletin board is also a way to thank those who have lent 
emotional support. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Phoenix bank vice president said he once had bar tabs spread over 
seven establishments totaling about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He sought help from the wife of a co-worker. She told him about an AA meeting 
in the church basement on Van Buren Street in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 There, by chance, Hoel said he saw 35 friends who were once his drinking 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Today most of his friends are men young and old and in AA. Recovering 
alcoholics do not discriminate by age, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't start to learn anything until 1968," Hoel said, referring to his 
last drink. "Then I started to learn about loving, caring and sharing." 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone number for Hoel's computer bulletin board is (714) 496-3930.

COMFORTABLE, VENERABLE CAFE SERVES ITS LAST SLICE OF LIFE; TRADITION: AFTER 47 
YEARS, REGULARS BID FAREWELL TO THE PALI, AN INSTITUTION IN SILVERADO CANYON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rustic Silverado Canyon has two country stores, a post office and a library. 
But by Sunday night, it no longer had the Pali Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Proprietors of the 47-year-old restaurant -- the canyon's only eatery and 
longtime village cracker barrel -- said they were serving up their last stack 
of pancakes and closing for good after failing to settle a dispute with their 
landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the closure shook up the cozy community of 900 people, who talk with 
pride about how little there is to do there, normally. Yet on Sunday, canyon 
regulars joined longtime patrons from "down the hill" to bid farewell to an 
institution as familiar and friendly as worn work boots. After a renovation 
this year, the simple wood-framed restaurant sports new padded booths and is 
decorated with framed photographs of scenes from the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be sunk up here," said Toni Doscher, a postal worker in 
Anaheim who has lived in the canyon for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only place we have to meet with each other if you want to get out of 
the kitchen. If you have a little business meeting. If it's a beautiful night 
and you want to take a walk," Doscher said between sips of navy bean soup. 
"It's the epitome of canyon living -- the relaxed lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers streamed in all day -- making for Pali's busiest day ever -- and 
some sat for hours until the final closing at 3 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Myers sat tearfully at the counter, clutching a wadded tissue and 
counting the hours until the doors shut. Since losing her secretary's job a 
month ago, Myers said the restaurant has been a daily refuge from sitting at 
home across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come in here and talk to people without being afraid for your life. 
Everybody in here knows everybody else," she said. "If it weren't for this 
place, I wouldn't know hardly anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant has hosted benefit dinners and sponsored booths at the annual 
Silverado Country Fair. Children wait for rides there and neighbors call to 
track down friends. It's been a stand-in family kitchen for David and Melinda 
White, who take their two sons twice a month for breakfast with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to change our lifestyle more than if Denny's switched hands," 
said David White. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred and Laura Schmidbauer said they were closing the establishment after 
running it the past nine years because the building owners declined to make 
improvements to the property -- including a new paint job outside and work to 
the parking lot -- that the couple says are needed to expand the business and 
make it profitable enough to keep. Fred Schmidbauer said that means adding an 
outdoor patio and drawing more customers from outside the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple spent about $10,000 in renovation indoors this year, he said. With 
one year left on a 10-year lease, they stopped paying rent about a month ago, 
and then were told to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he pays the rent, he can stay," said landlord John Toepher. "I'm sorry 
it's all come to this. But life goes on. If you don't pay your rent, you can't 
stay. It's pretty basic." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Schmidbauer hugged customers goodby and arranged to sell off the 
equipment, he was trying at the last minute to find someone who would buy the 
contents of the business and reopen the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has been a hot topic on the community grapevine and put residents 
in the uncomfortable position of watching friends feud. The landlords live near 
the restaurant and are well regarded in town. The Schmidbauers live in Mission 
Viejo but are treated as locals in a community that makes keen distinctions 
between "canyon people" and "flatlanders" below. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's affected everyone in the canyon," Doscher said. She and others held out 
hope their beloved restaurant might be bought -- and saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Chathi Anderson, a Pali waitress and sometime-manager for 2 1/2 years, planned 
to make the drive down the hill Tuesday to take the test for a teacher's aide 
job. She wasn't thrilled at the prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ticked off. I don't want to look for another job," Anderson said shortly 
after serving up the restaurant's final order: a turkey sandwich and navy bean 
soup. "I'd be happy to run the place for anyone who wants to buy it. I 
definitely don't want to leave."

UNIFORM APPEAL; COLOR-CODED CLOTHING IS A GROWING TREND AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Listen carefully and you can hear the sounds of Farsi, Spanish, Portuguese, 
Tagalog -- at least 15 languages echoing through the stucco corridors of Thomas 
Jefferson Elementary School in diverse southwest Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, during the second week of the new school year, the clothing on 
the more than 900 Jefferson pupils was getting more uniform every day, a 
phenomenon that tends to blur their socioeconomic and ethnic differences. 
</P>
<P>
 A voluntary switch to color-coded uniforms is taking hold at Jefferson, one of 
about 50 elementary schools in Orange County trying them out this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a trend welcomed by many parents concerned about the costs of new 
clothes, their children's study habits and the popularity of wanna-be gang 
attire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can afford them, and I think they look just as nice," said Olga Barajas in 
Spanish, her kindergarten son, Jose, nestled under her arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at many schools are reporting that 25% to 30% of children are 
turning out in uniforms. But at the new Woods Canyon School in Aliso Viejo, 
Principal Diane Hoff said 65% of her 838 pupils are wearing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think starting a uniform program in a brand-new school has been an 
advantage," Hoff said. "The parents are saying how much cheaper it is and how 
nice the children look." She said she sees the uniform phenomenon "growing at 
our school." 
</P>
<P>
 At Jefferson, boys and girls have a selection of blue or white garments that 
are on display in the school office. Each article is priced under $10 and can 
be purchased at K mart, Target or other stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls have a choice of plaid jumpers, dark blue skirts and sweaters and 
blue or white blouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, Jose Barajas was dressed in the complete boys' uniform: Dark 
blue pants, a dark blue sweater with a light blue shirt and a dark blue tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has learned to tie his tie himself," his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 While uniforms in Orange County schools remain completely voluntary, some 
districts elsewhere, like the Long Beach Unified School District, are now 
requiring them. Historically, Californians have opposed such impositions, but 
recent passage of a bill authored by Sen. Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi) shows the 
attitudes are changing. 
</P>
<P>
 These are days of dress codes and uniforms, and many pupils and parents are 
accepting them willingly, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After surveying the thoughts of the parents, some of our schools decided to 
try out uniforms this year on an optional, voluntary basis," said Jacqueline 
Price, spokeswoman for the 32,000-student Capistrano Unified School District. 
"We already have a pretty high participation rate."  
</P>
<P>
 She said she liked the Palisades Elementary School sweat shirts so much, she 
ordered one for herself.  
</P>
<P>
 For some Latino children, uniforms are a proud tradition brought from their 
homelands. Many schools in Mexico and Central America have uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of school last week, school officials estimated about 10 
pupils in every Jefferson classroom wore the new garb.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the kids are sitting up a little taller because of the pride in how 
they look," said Jacquin Terry, principal at the 29-year-old school. "Even on 
the playground, I think they carry themselves a little more ladylike or 
gentlemanly-like." 
</P>
<P>
 The uniform idea began in Orange County two years ago at Pio Pico Elementary 
School in central Santa Ana, where nearly 98% of the pupils are 
Spanish-speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents there expressed concern about clothing costs and the possibility that 
by their dress the children might be pegged as gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the parents first went to the superintendent with the idea, I think they 
wanted their kids clearly designated as schoolchildren," said Principal Judith 
Magsaysay. "But I think the uniforms also offer a sense of purpose. The 
children understand they are dressed to learn."

SHERIFF, LAPD FACE EXODUS OF OFFICERS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: MANY LEAVE FOR JOBS IN 
SIMI VALLEY AND OTHER CITIES, DRAWN BY THE PROMISE OF A BETTER LIFESTYLE AND 
LESS DEMANDING DUTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fed up with overwork and being second-guessed, some Los Angeles-area police 
officers are defecting to new jobs on the safer streets of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past month, the Simi Valley Police Department has hired three Los 
Angeles Police Department officers and a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the 16 Simi Valley officers who list LAPD or Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department on their resumes were hired in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 And more would-be defectors call Simi Valley every month, driven by what they 
view as bad morale in their own departments and lured by the prospect of a 
better quality of life in Ventura County and a better workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're calling us all the time," said Simi Valley Capt. Jerry Boyce. "It's 
good for us, but it's bad for L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Los Angeles agencies acknowledge that their officers are defecting to 
other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been losing about eight to 10 officers every month. . . ," said LAPD 
personnel Cmdr. Dan Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about 100 officers resigning annually, fully 50 to 75 of whom defect to 
other departments, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Better equipment, pay and working conditions are drawing most of them away, 
Watson said, as is "the fact that we are understaffed and they have to work 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is losing deputies at a similar 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In fiscal 1991-92, 24 deputies left for jobs with other police agencies. The 
number rose to 34 in 1992-93, then more than doubled the next year to 75, said 
Fred Ramirez, the department's director of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who leave cite similar complaints, said 
Martha Zavala, the department's assistant personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for choosing Simi Valley seem obvious: 
</P>
<P>
 * For the past three years, the FBI has ranked Simi Valley one of the five 
safest cities in the United States over 100,000 in population. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residents show an uncommon devotion to their police force, possibly because 
the 1990 U.S. Census showed that Simi Valley has the third-highest 
concentration of law enforcement officers residing in a city of its size in 
California, second only to Santa Clarita and Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 * Simi Valley officers work a four-day week of 10-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
 * And they earn -- after benefits are figured in -- about the same take-home 
pay as is offered by LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have better working conditions, the support of the public, and the 
opportunity to do police work without having to run from call to call and not 
being able to help people," Boyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, say former Los Angeles officers and deputies now working in Simi 
Valley, life in their old departments was growing increasingly difficult -- 
particularly after LAPD officers beat Rodney G. King in 1991, and Los Angeles 
erupted in riots the year after the officers were found not guilty in a Simi 
Valley court. 
</P>
<P>
 From rookie deputies to veteran patrol commanders, their gripes are the same, 
said Simi Valley police Detective Randy Foushee, who runs background checks on 
potential employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first and foremost thing they have in common is the fact that they feel 
unappreciated by upper management," Foushee said. "And the other thing they 
have in common is they don't feel they have a future." 
</P>
<P>
 Calls from L.A. applicants have increased in the 2 1/2 years since the riots, 
Foushee said . 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the King beating, veteran Van Nuys patrol sergeant John Rygh 
retired after 25 years with the LAPD. A year later he got a detective's job in 
Simi Valley, where he has lived since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before he left, said Rygh, 50, things were unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a decline in morale and some issues that concerned me," he said. "To be 
as blunt as I can, I think there was what I perceived as a lack of focus over 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD required that all citizen complaints of police misconduct be logged 
into an officer's record unless they were clearly disproved, he said. This left 
some officers' otherwise clean records permanently stained with lies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every week, former colleagues call to talk, he said. The atmosphere is even 
worse since the riots, they tell him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, 'There's no presumption of guilt (in Simi Valley) on the part of an 
officer,' and that blows them away," Rygh said. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD's Watson replied, "No way is the No. 1 reason they leave because they 
feel there's a lack of support by the department or the community, but that 
does come up with some people." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said he dislikes the fact that many of those who leave do so after 
about five years, taking their LAPD training with them.

SKY WARS CHAMBER; HIGH-TECH SOUTHLAND FACILITY VIES FOR FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an immense steel vault bathed in eerie blue light and protected around the 
clock by armed guards, the Air Force's latest fighter jet was being tricked 
into thinking it was in the heat of high-tech combat. 
</P>
<P>
 The F-16 Falcon sat motionless on a huge turntable at Edwards Air Force Base 
as computer technicians bombarded it with electronic signals mimicking enemy 
missiles and radar stations, simulating a flight over hostile territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The fake mission was being staged inside the Benefield Anechoic Facility, a 
computer-stuffed building where sophisticated electronic gear intended to help 
American military pilots outmaneuver future enemies is tested. The facility is 
the largest of its kind in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Enclosing 4.6 million square feet of space, the Benefield chamber is big 
enough to hold virtually any U.S. military airplane, including the B-1 bomber. 
Planes are rolled in through one of the world's biggest doors, a 250-ton steel 
device so bulky that it takes 40 minutes to close. 
</P>
<P>
 As Congress cuts funds for defense facilities nationwide, the Benefield 
complex is in the enviable position of undergoing a $200-million upgrade that 
began last year and is scheduled to last another seven years -- the most 
expensive improvement of any U.S. military test facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But the chamber is also the focus of an ongoing tug-of-war in Washington over 
how to spend increasingly scarce military research funds. The Navy operates a 
similar chamber in Maryland, and members of Congress from California and 
Maryland have squabbled over which should get more federal dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Benefield chamber is a strange-looking place, with thousands of small, 
blue spikes protruding from nearly every square foot of its walls, floor and 
ceiling. With overhead spotlights barely piercing the gloom, a visitor might 
mistake it for some vast, heavy-metal concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of foam, the pyramid-like spikes absorb stray radar signals that bounce 
off aircraft during tests of electronic-warfare devices that allow military 
jets to detect, evade and jam enemy radar and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some testing must be done in flight, the Benefield facility allows 
engineers and computer scientists to work out some bugs on the ground, which is 
cheaper and safer. Also, precision measurements can be made repeatedly in the 
chamber, something very difficult to do in the air. And Edwards, about 100 
miles northeast of Downtown Los Angeles, is the Air Force's premier flight-test 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get out of the fly-fix-fly syndrome," said Mickey R. Brown, a 
retired Air Force captain and flight-test engineer who is the civilian chief of 
testing at the chamber, which employs about 70 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealed in steel, the facility is a "sterile" test environment, keeping out the 
multitude of radio, TV and radar signals that could strike a test aircraft 
flying over Edwards and nearby towns such as Palmdale and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The steel also prevents electronic signals emitted by classified military 
transmitters from leaking into the open air. While Air Force officials believe 
that the threat of espionage has diminished with the Soviet Union's collapse, 
electronic-combat signals theoretically could be picked up by foreign 
satellites or spy ships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force spent $82 million to build and equip the chamber, which opened 
in 1989. It is named for Tommie D. (Doug) Benefield, former chief test pilot 
for Rockwell International, which built the B-1, the first aircraft to be 
tested there. Benefield died in a B-1 crash in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much classified work going on in it, the chamber is protected 24 hours 
a day by armed guards. Engineers, scientists and technicians are issued 
ATM-style cards that allow them access only to rooms for which they have 
specific clearance. 
</P>
<P>
 So elaborate is the security system that if someone tries to use a card to get 
into a room for which he or she has no authorization, the name is automatically 
printed out in the guards' control room. Air Force officials recently allowed a 
Times reporter and photographer to tour the chamber, but only on a day when no 
aircraft were in it. 
</P>
<P>
 But as defense downsizing continues, the Benefield facility has been caught in 
a struggle in Congress and the Pentagon over how to spend federal funds on 
electronic-warfare testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Its chief rival is the Naval Air Warfare Center in Patuxent River, Md., where 
the Navy has its own, smaller anechoic chamber.  
</P>
<P>
 Although many defense experts think the Air Force and Navy could get along 
with one chamber, the Pentagon -- under congressional pressure -- has issued a 
stream of confusing and contradictory reports about which chamber should be 
funded. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Pentagon-hired consultant in 1992 recommended developing Benefield as 
the "least-costly alternative," Maryland representatives asked the Pentagon's 
inspector general to review the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general said the report "contained critical flaws," and urged 
that equipment be reallocated to both Benefield and Patuxent River from other 
locations. Later, a top Pentagon test official rejected the inspector general's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, none of the aircraft tested in the Benefield chamber have seen 
combat, Brown said. But that is likely to change the next time American jets 
are committed in wartime. 
</P>
<P>
 Technicians operating the threat emitters -- three wall-mounted loudspeakers 
that beam signals at the aircraft -- can select from a library of signals 
representing radar devices from other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 How the foreign signals are gathered is classified information, says Austin 
Page, Edwards' intelligence director. New signals are delivered to the base 
each month, Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what goes on in the chamber involves testing high-tech gear that lets 
American pilots jam enemy radar or electronically camouflage their locations -- 
a tactic known as "spoofing." 
</P>
<P>
 As military jets fly faster and air warfare becomes more high-tech, pilots 
must know quickly if their planes have been "painted" by hostile radar . 
</P>
<P>
 Once warned, a pilot can take evasive action.

STREET SMART / RICHARD SIMON: MTA'S TOP-SECRET COUNTINGHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps nobody counts more in this town than the pocket-less employees who 
work at a nondescript building in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 They handle the money dropped into Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus 
fare boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the MTA's countinghouse, whose precise location the agency keeps secret 
for security reasons, 29 workers handle more than one million coins of all 
types deposited every day into bus fare boxes and rail ticket machines: 
pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, tokens and on occasion, francs, pesos and 
Chuck E Cheese's tokens. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no nickel-and-dime operation. The facility -- which has no identifying 
signs but plenty of armed guards and cameras -- processes about $125 million a 
year in dollars and cents. 
</P>
<P>
 To enter MTA's cash-counting operation, you must pass through three locked 
doors. A sign on the wall reads: "A reward of up to $5,000 will be paid to any 
RTD employee who furnishes information resulting in the arrest and conviction 
of anyone who steals or assists in the theft of RTD property." 
</P>
<P>
 When they report to work, security dictates that employees change into 
uniforms without pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers feed the coins into machines, which do the actual counting. But 
dollar bills are stuffed into plastic bags and sold to private companies for 
about 97 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 (MTA says it costs more for union workers to prepare for acceptance by the 
banks every one of the 200,000 or so dollar bills collected every day. Banks 
will only take dollar bills stacked face up in bundles of $100.) 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar bills are bundled by weight, not by volume. Every morning, one 
worker sets that day's standard by counting out $4,000 in dollar bills, then 
weighing the money. Other workers then stuff the other dollars into bags that 
are weighed to match the standard. (For the record: $4,000 in dollar bills 
weighs about nine pounds, although it can fluctuate slightly. An MTA spokesman 
said they weigh the dollar bills every day "for atmospheric reasons. The dollar 
bills on a humid day can weigh more because there is more moisture in the air. 
On dry days, they can weigh less.") 
</P>
<P>
 Workers sift through the stacks of paper money looking for $5, $10 and $20 
bills. A $100 bill has been spotted. 
</P>
<P>
 Coins are dumped into machines, which separate them. The machines count 3,000 
coins per minute, then spit them out into bags. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility gets more pennies than any other coin -- about 350,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other big cities, bus riders in Los Angeles can pay their fare with 110 
pennies -- or 135 pennies if a proposed fare increase goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the MTA welcomes the smallest of small change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'dwell' time at the fare box is very important to us," Mike Butler, 
director of accounting, said, noting that dropping pennies in the fare box can 
delay boarding by other passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, the facility gets a call from an upset bus patron who has 
dropped a rare coin or other precious object into the fare box. Workers have 
returned keys and even wedding rings inadvertently dropped in the fare box. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA facility is one of the busiest in a regional network of similar 
operations that keep the economy moving by processing the millions of coins 
deposited every day in Southern California's pay phones, parking meters, news 
racks and vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Horn, a clerk at the MTA cash-counting operation, said it takes muscles 
to excel in his line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "No weakling can do it," he said, bending over to lift a 50-pound bag of 
$1,000 in quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 It also requires a certain discretion. Horn doesn't tell his friends what he 
does for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want them to know I work around a lot of money," he said. "I'm afraid 
they might suggest something that I would never want to cross my mind."

FIRST PINCH-HITTER; FIRST LADY STUMPS FOR BROWN, PRAISES LITTLE LEAGUE 
CHAMPIONS 
</P>

<P>
 As campaign rallies go, this one had the look of a clunker. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, Bill Clinton himself, had been the scheduled speaker. But he 
was stuck back in Washington, preoccupied with the Haiti business. 
</P>
<P>
 So he sent his wife. But her plane was late. And it was very hot out on the 
jet-black Tarmac at Burbank Airport, the late-afternoon sun beating down on the 
200 Democratic faithful who had gathered to cheer on gubernatorial candidate 
Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 And the faithful were bored and thirsty, milling inside black velvet security 
ropes, unmoved by music from the hit movie "Forrest Gump," uninspired by a 
placard in the crowd that proclaimed, "We Support Pres. Clinton's Haiti 
Policy," unprovoked by a longtime activist whose T-shirt read: "Homos for 
Hillary." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, abruptly, a water cooler appeared. And so did the Northridge Little 
League champions. And the champs made it a show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited. We get to see Mrs. Clinton!" said John Michael Baca, 11, a 
second baseman on the team. "We get to see Pete Wilson. No, Kathleen Brown, I 
think. It's fun, because it's the First Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, because it's the First Lady we get to see the Secret Service guards and 
their guns!" added center fielder Michael Nesbit, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Just then Brown arrived, and the Little Leaguers, in their uniforms, crowded 
around the woman in the red dress. "Did any of you hit any home runs?" Brown 
asked. "I did," said one voice. "I did," added another. "I hit two," said a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown tried a risky move. "Any girls on the team?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No girls!" came back a chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in a deft political family, Brown tried a slightly different tack. "Do 
you guys think California is ready for a woman governor?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes!" cried the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right!" she exclaimed. "This is my team!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Vote for Kathleen Brown!" said one of the Little Leaguers. "She's the 
nicest!" 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the blue-and-white Air Force jet zoomed in from the west. In a 
black suit trimmed in pink, Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped off the ramp to loud 
applause. She mingled with the Little Leaguers for a few minutes and posed for 
photos. 
</P>
<P>
 A cooling breeze began to blow. The music on the loudspeakers turned to a CD 
from the rock group 10,000 Maniacs, who sang out: "These are days you 
remember."  
</P>
<P>
 As the music faded and Clinton and Brown stepped up to a podium, the harshness 
was gone from the sun, replaced by a soft light that illuminated their excited 
faces and cut through the smog to reveal the beauty of the San Gabriel 
Mountains in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 To enthusiastic applause, both the candidate and the First Lady jabbed at Gov. 
Pete Wilson, the Republican incumbent whose job Brown wants, blaming him for 
the state's lackluster economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But to even louder applause, Clinton took a few moments to praise the Little 
Leaguers, who won the U.S. title last month in Williamsburg, Pa., before losing 
the world championship to a team from Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a "real joy," she said, to meet the Northridge team. She was "so 
impressed" with "their style and their sportsmanship and their winning." 
</P>
<P>
 They were, she said, a "real symbol" of overcoming adversity, of "the spirit 
of California." As the boys bowed their heads and their coaches and parents 
beamed, she added that they were "what I have always thought of as Californian. 
Good-looking. Lots of sun. Hard-working. Strong. Smart." 
</P>
<P>
 And resourceful. Todd Delevie, 12, a backup catcher on the team, snagged the 
First Lady's autograph. As Clinton and Brown sped off to a fund-raiser later 
Sunday night in West Los Angeles, he proudly showed it off, fetching the scrap 
of paper and a well-used black Bic pen out of his right back pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came totally prepared," Todd said. "You have to in a situation like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to get the autographs of people who are famous," he said. "And this is 
a cool one. She's -- well, she's awesome! And so was this, 'cause I got to meet 
her."

COUNCIL HEADS FOR NEW FIGHT IN DISTRIBUTION OF QUAKE AID; RECOVERY: VALLEY 
LAWMAKERS, FOR THE SECOND TIME IN TWO MONTHS, ARE TRYING TO BOOST THEIR SHARE 
OF GRANTS WHILE CUTTING FUNDS FOR SOUTH LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For the second time in as many months, San Fernando Valley lawmakers are 
closing ranks in a bid to increase earthquake repair funding for the Valley at 
the expense of South Los Angeles communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The simmering dispute is expected to come to a head Wednesday, when the City 
Council is scheduled to decide how to distribute $2.2 million in federal grants 
to help senior citizens recover from the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The first sign of renewed conflict came last week when three Valley council 
members, acting as the Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake Recovery, recommended 
increasing the allocation for senior programs in the Valley and slashing the 
amount proposed for seniors in South and South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The move has demonstrated how jealously protective the Valley delegation has 
become about quake funding as the city's recovery moves into its ninth month. 
</P>
<P>
 It also shows how rarely Valley council members rally in a common cause, 
despite complaints for years that the region does not receive its fair share of 
city services. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been other issues we've agreed on, but this is something that has 
a uniqueness because we had the epicenter in the Valley," said Councilman Joel 
Wachs, who represents parts of the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But the move to increase Valley funding angered representatives from South Los 
Angeles, who said senior citizens in that area need help even though they did 
not suffer the heaviest quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get concerned when I see everybody talking about the earthquake in the 
Valley," said Councilwoman Rita Walters, whose district stretches from Downtown 
to South-Central Los Angeles. "Well, the (quake-damaged) Coliseum is the best 
example I know to show that we had an earthquake in South-Central." 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Webb de Macias, chief of staff for Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who 
represents parts of South Los Angeles, agreed. "There are needs in the southern 
part of the city and we should not subtract money from those areas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month Ridley-Thomas led a move to cut the Valley's share of $47 
million in housing funds and instead increase funding for housing citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 He engineered the switch when three Valley council members were absent. Later, 
after a long, contentious meeting, the council reversed itself and restored the 
full Valley allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest controversy began when a council committee headed by Walters 
approved a plan for the $2.2 million that set aside a lion's share for the 
Valley but also allotted $560,000 to four senior services centers in South and 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When the proposal was forwarded to the Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake 
Recovery, Valley council members Richard Alarcon, Hal Bernson and Laura Chick 
voted to increase the funding to Valley senior services agencies by $120,000 
and slash $195,00 from senior centers in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview later, Alarcon, who represents parts of the northeast Valley, 
said he voted to slash the South Los Angeles funding because most quake damage 
was in the Valley, not in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it was warranted," he said. "I don't think there is anybody in Los 
Angeles who doesn't know the hardest hit areas were in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Building and Safety Department estimated that about 75% of the $1.6 
billion in quake damage to the city's commercial and residential buildings was 
in the Valley and about 10% was in South Los Angeles areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some City Hall officials say a clash can easily be avoided because there is an 
additional $1.8 million set aside for the second year of the program that could 
be used to increase the funding for both the Valley and South Los Angeles this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need to go one against the other," Wachs said. "There is still 
plenty there to spread around." 
</P>
<P>
 The money is distributed to senior services centers to help relocate seniors 
from damaged homes, fund repairs and provide legal assistance, among other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Franklin, director of the Theresa Lindsay Multipurpose Senior Center in 
Central Los Angeles, said he was shocked that the earthquake recovery panel 
recommended cutting the allocation to his agency from $140,000 to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "That won't allow me to deal with all the earthquake-related issues that some 
of my seniors have," he said, noting that many senior citizens need to be 
relocated from their homes while cracked walls and broken windows are repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennistine Lyle, director of the Bradley Multipurpose Senior Center in 
South-Central, agreed. The panel recommended the same cut for her agency. "Just 
because the buildings didn't fall down doesn't mean we don't need assistance," 
she said.

A FINE MESS AMONG PRESS; CONFLICT: OUSTER OF 'NON-JOURNALISTS' FROM GREATER LOS 
ANGELES PRESS CLUB LEADERSHIP SPAWNS A RIVAL FACTION. NEITHER SIDE IS YIELDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Call it bad news for the public relations people. And bad PR for the news 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The squabble over who should be considered the "press" at the Greater Los 
Angeles Press Club has left its 420 members with two presidents, two "official" 
newsletters, rival boards of directors and enough name-calling to set 
everyone's head spinning. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began with an attempt to remove public relations professionals from 
leadership positions in the 48-year-old club. That led to a legal fight over 
the group's $450,000 bank account and even a tug-of-war over the keys to its 
Hollywood headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed. It's going to take a lot of work to get our credibility 
back," admitted Press Club President Dusty Brandel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this has gone too far. We need somebody to come along and say, 'You 
kids stop fighting with one another,' " acknowledged Press Club President Ross 
Olney. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandel, of the Glendale News-Press, is the club president who in July fired a 
dozen "non-journalists" from the group's 24-member board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Olney, an author who lives in Ventura, is the club president elected in August 
by dissident board members, including many of those run off by Brandel. 
</P>
<P>
 Olney's group then changed the locks to the Press Club office at the Hollywood 
Roosevelt Hotel, seized the club's checkbook and tried to change account 
signature cards at banks where the club keeps its $450,000 -- earmarked for the 
purchase of new club headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandel's group responded by filing a theft report with police, talking hotel 
officials into letting them back in the office and obtaining a temporary 
restraining order to keep the dissidents from withdrawing the money -- proceeds 
from the $1.3-million sale of the club's former headquarters, on Vermont Avenue 
near the Hollywood Freeway, six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The original Los Angeles Press Club was a rented house on South Westlake 
Avenue that poker-playing newspapermen used as their private speak-easy in 
1928. It was the Prohibition era, but club members hired nearby USC medical 
students to brew beer in the cellar. The club folded after three years, 
following several raids by Prohibition agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The current club was formed in 1946 by eight reporters from The Times, the 
Examiner, the Herald Express and the old Daily News, who gathered at a hotel 
across from Hearst's Herald building. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the club sponsors monthly luncheon discussions and evening 
"mixers" and conducts an annual journalism awards contest for Los Angeles-area 
newspapers and television and radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The current dispute became public when both sides distributed competing 
editions of the club's September "8 Ball Monthly" newsletter.. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandel's newsletter accuses the dissidents of conducting illegal Press Club 
meetings and announces plans to tighten up membership requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that we have anything against public relations, an honorable profession," 
wrote that newsletter's editor, retired television newsman Maury Green of 
Sherman Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Olney's newsletter, on the other hand, accuses the incumbents of illegally 
removing board members and pledges to avoid future disputes through careful 
adherence to club bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the world has changed since 1946 and so has the club," wrote that 
newsletter's editor, free-lance writer Patricia Kirk of Malibu. "It's obvious 
the club was intended to serve working journalists. But did the founders intend 
to downgrade or exclude journalists if they made career changes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides acknowledge that the club's interpretation of "journalist" is the 
key to the dispute. In the past, the club generally defined three classes of 
membership: "active" (working news media); "associate" (people employed in such 
areas as public relations or advertising); and "honorary" (celebrities and 
politicians). 
</P>
<P>
 Only "active" members had club voting rights. But former reporters and editors 
who became publicists and media consultants have been allowed to keep their 
"active" status. And several years ago the club relaxed its rules to give 
voting rights to those in "communications" fields such as advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one can say for certain what percentage of current club members 
are employed in news-gathering, critics contend that there has been a takeover 
by public relations members. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandel said she decided to yank those who did not "have active affiliation 
with the news media" off the board on the advice of several lawyers and 
parliamentarians. The board's 24-member size made it unwieldy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't accomplishing anything at meetings." said Brandel, 59, a newspaper 
advertising saleswoman who also writes on motor sports. "Everywhere I went I 
heard, 'It's not a Press Club, it's a PR club.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The suddenness of the purge outraged some. 
</P>
<P>
 Olney, 65, the author of 172 books -- mostly nonfiction children's volumes -- 
said he would have preferred that the board be reduced "by attrition or 
election." Though he agrees the club should be "more journalistically 
oriented," he adds: "Of course, public relations people, in my opinion, are now 
more journalistically oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 KCAL-TV anchorman Jerry Dunphy supports Brandel. "I think when it becomes 
top-heavy with PR people, the edge is taken off the meaning of a press club," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olney's backers include ousted club director Richard Tyler, a former newspaper 
writer who now is vice president of marketing for the Burbank-based Triple 
Check financial services company. 
</P>
<P>
 "PR people such as myself don't want to dominate the Press Club," Tyler said. 
"If they dominate it, what good is being in it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ali Sar, executive editor for administration of the Pasadena Star-News, San 
Gabriel Valley Tribune and Whittier Daily News, said he suggested that all 
Press Club officers resign and a caretaker group run the club until new 
elections are held. Olney's side agreed, but Brandel's didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandel's restraining order prohibits the dissidents from using the Press Club 
name, entering its headquarters or attending its meetings. Her supporters will 
seek a permanent injunction Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Olney's side goes to court today to seek an order to keep Brandel from holding 
the club's annual general membership meeting on Wednesday, the night members 
are scheduled to nominate a new board for 1995.

 Students attending competitions, conventions and other extended field trips 
might no longer be allowed to take side trips to visit amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District officials began a review of the 
district's policy on extended field trips at the request of school board 
President Judy Miner. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of side trips to nearby amusement parks on weekend field trips came 
up at Tuesday's board meeting during discussion of two planned Esperanza High 
School field trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Field trips of more than one day must be approved by the board, which usually 
does so with little comment. But last week Miner questioned side trips to 
Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm being planned for students attending a 
weekend journalism convention in Anaheim next month and a side trip to Marine 
World Africa USA for students participating in a band competition in Northern 
California in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am nervous about students spending the evening at amusement parks," which 
are difficult to supervise, Miner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved both trips, but asked district officials to determine if 
the side trips violate any board policy and to weigh potential liability 
problems. DANIELLE FOUQUETTE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; DRUNK DRIVING FINES ON COUNCIL AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will meet at 6:30 p.m. tonight to decide whether to alter the 
way it assesses fines for drivers convicted of driving under the influence of 
alcohol.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would reduce the fines for a conviction from $1,000 per drunken 
driving-related accident to $500 if police alone respond and $500 if fire 
personnel or paramedics respond.On Nov. 16, 1992, the City Council approved the 
$1,000 fine, but complaints soon arose when only one agency responded to the 
scene. The City Council could alter the fee to make it more equitable, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also consider the partial closing of South Coast Drive and 
Hyland, Sunflower, Cadillac and Scenic avenues for Costa Mesa High School's 
second annual Mesa 500 5K Run/Walk, which is scheduled for Nov. 12.  
</P>
<P>
 The event, sponsored by South Coast Metro Rotary Club and State Farm 
Insurance, will raise money to support school programs and services.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the council will weigh awarding $10,000 in community development 
block grants for improvements at the Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter and the 
Newport-Costa Mesa-Irvine YMCA.  
</P>
<P>
 At the shelter, $1,717 would be used to install an awning to protect the 
outdoor cafeteria from weather and direct sunlight. A water fountain and screen 
doors would also be installed at the shelter for homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA would use its $8,283 to create a therapy group meeting room and a 
library. Though the center is in Irvine, 45% of its clients are from Costa 
Mesa. Private offices will also be built at the YMCA Community Counseling 
office at 2 Executive Circle, in Irvine.TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; A COMMUNITY TURNS THE PAGE

<P>
 Like the community it serves, the El Campanero newsletter has grown 
dramatically in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, it started as a six-page publication sent to 3,000 homes.Its most 
recent edition weighed in at 20 pages that will be read by 9,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
 But the surest sign that the newsletter has come of age: An El Campanero salad 
now graces the menu of Hautte Caffe, a popular Rancho Santa Margarita 
coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like this community has gradually grown bigger, so has the El 
Campanero," said Jack Wynns, the newsletter editor who oversees a staff of 20 
volunteers. "Everyone I talk to sees us as a reflection of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 As the developers of the planned community envisioned, the people who live in 
Rancho Santa Margarita are trying to mold themselves into a village of 
neighborhoods where everyone knows each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories in the El Campanero try to express that sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent edition, one unsigned article told the first-person story 
of a mother with non-Hodgkins lymphoma whose neighbors stepped up to provide 
meals, new clothing and constant attention for the troubled family. 
</P>
<P>
 The newsletter urges citizen participation and thoughtfully reflects on the 
personality of Rancho Santa Margarita through stories on "What the Library 
Means to the Community" and the "Urban Village." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're really doing is developing a real close-knit community where 
people know and help each other," Wynns said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People feel a sense of belong to this community that is a little bit unusual. 
. . . What the El Campanero is trying to do is demonstrate that spirit of 
community." FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; SILENCE PUT TO TEST ON SAT SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who makes her living helping people hear wants to plug up the ears of 
a few high school students.  
</P>
<P>
 It's part of an experiment to determine the effect of complete silence on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test scores of local students, who are taking the test next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Wilson, an Irvine audiologist and speech pathologist, is following up 
on the doctoral dissertation she made while studying at Vanderbilt University 
in Nashville, Tenn., where she earned a Ph.D. in audiology.  
</P>
<P>
 But her real inspiration is her son Roger, an 18-year-old University High 
School student who scored 80 points higher on the SAT after retaking the exam 
wearing earplugs. She tried the experiment on some of his friends and found 
similar results. She is now looking to recruit about 100 students for her 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 "My theory is that noise distraction is a neurological process," Wilson said. 
"It's not something to which we can say: 'Now don't pay attention to this 
background noise.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is recruiting high school students who have already taken the SAT test 
so she can compare before and after scores.  
</P>
<P>
 Because Wilson is receiving no grant funding for the study, she is charging 
students $25 each for a set of custom-molded earplugs they will keep after the 
experiment is over. Westone Laboratories of Colorado Springs, Colo., will 
supply the plugs, which normally cost $50 to $60 when molded for a specific 
individual, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not making money on this," she said.

BRAKE TIME; CASTAIC EXIT GIVES WEARY TRUCKERS A BRIEF RESPITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD BIGELOW, For The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 1914, truckers have pulled their rigs onto a mile-long stretch of 
Castaic Road to stop for a rest, refreshment and a bit of respite from the open 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they come here by way of an exit off the Golden State Freeway in 
diesel-spewing 18-wheelers, headed for destinations as diverse as their own 
home towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers like Ziggy Krolicki of Montreal, who on a recent afternoon sat in the 
shade of a tree near where he had parked his truck: "I just wanted to stop for 
a smoke," said Krolicki, cigar smoke enveloping the brim of his cowboy hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Krolicki was heading back home. Like many truckers traveling north on the 
Golden State Freeway, he said he usually stops along this stretch of Castaic 
Road to let his truck cool down before climbing the Grapevine. 
</P>
<P>
 Those heading south often stop to stall for time to avoid Los Angeles' 
legendary rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic has traditionally tried to accommodate these weary drivers even at the 
risk of aggravating local residents. With this stretch of the road crammed with 
an unbroken series of fast-food restaurants, motels and gas stations, trucks 
are often double- and triple-parked while drivers grab a quick bite or fill an 
empty thermos. 
</P>
<P>
 But most locals -- especially the long-timers who realize that Castaic owes 
much of its economic vitality to the truckers -- are willing to put up with the 
inconvenience. Many mingle easily with the drivers who stop in at the Country 
Girl Saloon, a one-room bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before stepping into the bar, hearty laughter could be heard from outside 
the door of the Country Girl as truckers engaged in friendly, face-to-face 
conversation more personal than could be had via CB radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, sawdust covered the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so you can spit on it," said Richard Gray, a Wyoming trucker who had 
been on the road for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the sun began to set, the truckers preparing to get back on the 
highway made their way across the road to the Giant Truck Stop to fill their 
industrial-size thermoses. 
</P>
<P>
 The coffee was free, but a grateful Dean Crow -- a trucker from Redding, 
Calif., who was hauling a load of lumber to Ontario -- was happy to make a 
contribution to make sure it stays that way for his fellow truckers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ask for a donation, but they have ice and coffee and all that stuff," 
Crow said. "I stop here every time I take I-5." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, he climbed into his Peterbilt truck and rolled down Castaic Road, 
heading for the on-ramp.

<P>
 After eight years in Laguna Hills, the South Orange County Chambers of 
Commerce has moved to a new suite of offices in a new city. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber group recently began operating out of an office in the Plaza 
Empressa, at 29941 Aventura, Suite I at Santa Margarita Parkway and Via 
Empressa. 
</P>
<P>
 With their lease expiring in Laguna Hills at the end of August, chamber 
officials made a decision to move when the Santa Margarita Co. came up with an 
offer for a lease in Rancho Santa Margarita just last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita Co. "made a pretty good offer," said Barbara Thomas, 
director of operations for SOCCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the lease weren't disclosed, but Santa Margarita Co. officials said 
the two sides agreed on a six-month agreement with the possibility of a longer 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we made a very competitive and attractive offer," said Santa 
Margarita Co. spokeswoman Diane Gaynor. "I think we're all very happy with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although concern has been expressed about poor accessibility of the office's 
Rancho Santa Margarita location, SOCCC officials said chamber members will be 
pleasantly surprised at the new office's proximity to the Saddleback Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Foothill Transportation Corridor being built near the chamber site 
and several access roads opening or scheduled to open, Rancho Santa Margarita 
is becoming more centrally located in South County, chamber officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its accessibility to other major South Orange County business centers via 
both (Interstate 5) and the Foothill Transportation Corridor made it a logical 
site for our new headquarters," SOCCC Executive Director Kate Keena said. FRANK 
MESSINA

<P>
 In a city that once bemoaned a dearth of quality dining experiences, two more 
restaurants are seeking approval at a Planning Commission meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for a Boston Chicken Restaurant at Marguerite Parkway and 
Estanciero Drive and a Dairy Queen restaurant in the new Mission Viejo Freeway 
Center will be heard by commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Chicken franchise would join a previously approved California Pizza 
Kitchen and a Blockbuster Video store. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,459-square-foot building requested by the national restaurant chain is 
more than 5,000 square feet smaller than the city approved when the project was 
proposed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the commission will also hear a report on alleged problems with 
trash, graffiti and vandalism in the Mission Viejo Village Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants in the center had complained about teen loitering and trash near a 
Del Taco restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city code enforcement officers said litter stemming from the 
fast-food restaurant was minimal.  
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center is not a major hangout for teen-agers in Mission Viejo, 
sheriff's deputies said. FRANK MESSINA

 Southbound traffic on Magnolia Street between Westminster and Bestel avenues 
will be reduced to one lane beginning this week until January because of 
improvements to the area's drainage system. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction will take place between 7:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Motorists are 
urged to use alternative routes during these hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking in the area will be restricted, but access to businesses and 
residences along the construction area will be maintained, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Bill Patapoff said that a storm drain is being constructed to 
prevent flooding at the Magnolia-Bestel intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The $889,000 project includes installation of concrete pipes, catch basins and 
street work at the intersection, Patapoff said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; CITY OKS ORDINANCE TO CURB FLYER PARTIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of violence at a recent "flyer party" of teen-agers, the City 
Council has approved a new law cracking down on such gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 Flyer parties are advertised in leaflets and can draw large crowds of 
teen-agers.Admission is usually charged. 
</P>
<P>
 A flyer party on Aug. 27 in the 10300 block of Ethel Street resulted in 
gunshots but no injuries. Police said 150 people attended that party and that 
the average age was 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members expressed concern after the shootings. Acting swiftly 
at last week's meeting, the council voted unanimously to immediately adopt an 
ordinance that it hopes will send a message that such violence will not be 
tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed city staff to copy an anti-flyer party ordinance adopted 
in 1990 by neighboring Los Alamitos.  
</P>
<P>
 The new law similarly forbids anyone "to charge admission to any party 
conducted in a residential zone" within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators face a maximum $500 fine and six months in jail. The law also allows 
the city to collect for the costs of policing a party under some circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Walter K. Bowman said he did not think it would be enough for the 
council to simply discuss the aftermath of the Aug. 27 flyer party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to have some sort of law on our books," he said. "And we 
don't need to reinvent the wheel. We can copy the Los Alamitos law." 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members said they agreed. Councilwoman Gail H. Kerry said that 
by taking immediate action, the council was showing it would not tolerate flyer 
parties in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole intent (of the new ordinance) is to come down hard on flyer 
parties," she said. BILL BILLITER

 Charles Landon and Donald Sherrin have been reappointed to four-year terms on 
the Personnel Appeals Commission, a five-member board that hears appeals of 
employees who have been fired, suspended, demoted or disciplined. And the City 
Council last week also appointed Betty Schmicker-Black to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Landon and Sherrin are both incumbents, their terms having expired Aug. 31. 
Along with Schmicker-Black, they will now serve until August, 1998.

 Dean McCormick has served on the Orange County Board of Education for 18 
years. But don't call him an educator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the first to admit it: I'm not an educator," said the 64-year-old North 
Tustin resident, who was recently appointed president of the board."I'm just an 
average businessman. And I think that's an important vantage point to have." 
</P>
<P>
 This year marks the seventh time that the board has selected McCormick as its 
leader. As president, he will preside over board meetings and work closely with 
officials from the county Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick, the general manager of a courier service, attributed his length of 
service to a deep interest in schools and an ability to look at educational 
issues in a layman's terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a great belief in public education and its importance to the 
community," he said. "I can ask many questions because I am not an educator." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education runs about 20 school sites, including campuses for 
severely disabled students, wards of the courts and habitual truants. 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick said he is proud of a recent reorganization of department management 
that made the agency "leaner but stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters have elected McCormick to the board four times. Before joining the 
board, he served in parent organizations at Tustin schools attended by his 
children.SHELBY GRAD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE CITY WOULD 
ELIMINATE 27 JOBS

<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to eliminate 27 full-time permanent positions in 
a $190.2-million budget for the coming fiscal year up for adoption tonight. It 
is nearly $5 million less than the city's financial plan for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the proposed budget is scheduled at 6:30 p.m. in the 
Council Chambers at the Civic Center, 2000 Main St. 
</P>
<P>
 Among new fees would be a charge of $20 for a non-resident library card, which 
would raise $200,000. Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg is also recommending a 
$10 parking fine increase that would raise about $390,000 in additional 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga said the proposed $94-million general fund 
has a surplus of $297,532. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating seven Fire Department positions and changing the way the city 
delivers paramedic services will also be under consideration. 
</P>

L.A. SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of the most notorious, complex and mystifying murder cases of the 
Jazz Age. 
</P>
<P>
 For 16 months, Angelenos were drawn to newspaper accounts of five trials 
detailing the triangle of murder and love centered on a young, dark-eyed beauty 
and murder suspect, Madalynne Obenchain. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening of Aug. 5, 1921, J. Belton Kennedy, an insurance broker, was 
found shot to death on the stairs of his cabin on Beverly Glen Boulevard, in a 
then-rustic neighborhood near the Los Angeles Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Obenchain, 28, Kennedy's girlfriend, was charged with first-degree murder. So 
too was Arthur Courtney Burch, her old college sweetheart, accused of pulling 
the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 But Madalynne's ex-husband, Chicago attorney Ralph Obenchain, came to her 
rescue. After he spent thousands of dollars and hung juries cost taxpayers 
$38,000, his ex-wife and her alleged conspirator were freed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times commented acidly that Madalynne Obenchain "puts men gently aside 
when she tires of them and they yield with a smile of pain. When she wants them 
again, they throw aside careers, freedom -- everything, in answer to her nod." 
</P>
<P>
 The object of all this attention was born Madalynne Donna Connor in 1893 in 
Superior, Wis. At Northwestern University, she met her future husband -- the 
man prosecutors would later refer to as "the Human Doormat" -- and Arthur 
Burch, a college track athlete with protruding ears and thick glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were madly in love with her and wanted to marry her. But her father 
saved her from having to choose by dying in 1914 and leaving her $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-year travel and shopping spree, Madalynne came to her mother's 
home in Los Angeles and met Kennedy, who worked at his wealthy father's 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's relentlessly possessive mother did everything in her power to 
discourage their relationship. She even intercepted his mail and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy proposed, but by 1919, after two years of waiting for Kennedy to marry 
her, Madalynne decided to take Obenchain up on his earlier offer of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But four days after they wed, she was seeing Kennedy again. Once more he made 
promises he would never keep. But this time, Madalynne really believed that 
Kennedy was altar-bound. Her extremely understanding husband allowed her to 
divorce him, gave her $80 a month in alimony and blank checks as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 When it turned out she had been deceived again by her mama's boy, Madalynne 
apparently went into a rage and wired Burch in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Burch hopped on the next train to Los Angeles to aid the woman he called his 
"goddess." 
</P>
<P>
 According to accounts of the trial, Burch waited in the bushes outside 
Kennedy's cabin. As Kennedy and Madalynne came up the stairs, Kennedy bent to 
retrieve a lucky penny Madalynne said she had left under a rock -- and Burch 
blew off the back of his head with a shotgun. A witness testified that she 
heard a man yell, "I got him!" The gun stock was later found washed up on the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Los Angeles Examiner paid him $4,500, Burch confessed to plotting 
the murder with Madalynne. But his attorney said the confession was false. 
</P>
<P>
 Madalynne's first trial in 1922 created a sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Her ex-husband came rushing to her defense, leaving his job. He even tried to 
remarry her in jail, but a judge refused to permit the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 At Christmas she received more than 100 gifts of flowers, perfume and a $1,000 
bill, all delivered to her cell, all from admirers.  
</P>
<P>
 In what would surely have caused a mistrial had it come to light in time, a 
smitten juror at whom she winked in court sent her "food delicacies." 
</P>
<P>
 But instead the trial ended in a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Her ex-husband stayed by her side through the first trial and returned to 
Chicago only after he paid a lawyer to defend her at her second trial.  
</P>
<P>
 The high drama of her second trial turned on steamy love letters passed 
between her cell and that of Paul Roman, a convicted robber who had supposedly 
eyed her from afar. 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote, "Tonight I have a little pale pink rose near me -- the rose will be 
your soft warm lips, dear Paul," and, "Your nearness as I try to sleep seems 
like a caress." He wrote, "What you need is lot of attention, and I'm the guy 
to give it to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Madalynne made a loan to Roman and in exchange he promised to testify that he 
had heard two men on a street corner plotting to kill Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe it wasn't fate that played a hand in introducing Madalynne to Roman. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Madalynne was stunned when a costume shop owner testified in the second 
trial that Roman and Kennedy had been customers who often rented women's 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks before Kennedy's murder, the shop owner testified, she heard him 
say that his "friend" had threatened to beat him if he ever married. She 
identified the friend as Paul Roman. 
</P>
<P>
 All five trials -- two for Madalynne and three for Burch -- ended in hung 
juries. Legal experts interviewed at the time theorized that the male jurors 
who voted for acquittal in Madalynne's trial were all in love with her. In 
addition, it was learned that one of jurors had spoken with the defendant's 
ex-husband for more than an hour during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Madalynne humbly told reporters that she planned to spend the rest 
of her days in a leper colony. But she chose a more comfortable existence -- in 
Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 When the loyal Burch died in 1944, he willed his $1,500 estate to his 
"lifelong friend," Madalynne Obenchain. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

DIRECTOR OF REAGAN LIBRARY HAS PASSION FOR THE PRESIDENCY; SIMI VALLEY: RICHARD 
NORTON SMITH HAS DRAWN PRAISE AND CRITICISM FOR HIS POPULAR, SOMETIMES FLASHY 
EXHIBITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Richard Norton Smith was 5 years old, he knew all the words to "Hail to 
the Chief," he knew that the President of the United States was Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, and he knew that both he and the President were Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described "presidential freak," Smith, now 40, is the director of the 
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential 
Foundation, and director of the Ronald Reagan Center for Public Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other presidential library directors have backgrounds rooted in academia, but 
Smith said his rise to the job as head of the nation's second-largest 
presidential library is an outgrowth of his near-obsession with the men who 
have occupied the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not an academic or a professional archivist, and I don't have a Ph.D.," 
he said. "But I do care passionately about the presidency. I don't know, maybe 
it was inevitable . . . that I would end up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Described by both admirers and detractors as the "P.T. Barnum" of presidential 
library directors, Smith has earned a reputation for enlivening the 
institutions he has worked for with popular, sometimes flashy exhibits and 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 He was lured away from the Herbert Hoover Library in Iowa by the Reagans last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reagans wanted to tap into the energy Smith had shown while revitalizing 
the Hoover Library, which many agreed had become staid before he arrived. By 
1988, only a year after taking the helm, Smith was able to double attendance 
there, according to Timothy Walch, who served as Smith's assistant director. 
</P>
<P>
 "While (Smith) was here he was always innovating -- he was the balloon and I 
was his tether," said Walch, who is acting director at the Hoover Library. "The 
Reagans didn't want a mausoleum to Reagan's past. They wanted something 
exciting and dynamic. That's why they got Richard." 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith's management style has turned off some of the foundation's original 
board members, who say they had hoped the library would become a place for 
serious debate on current public policy issues. Instead, they say Smith has 
encouraged events such as a presidential look-alike contest, and an exhibit on 
First Ladies, which one former board member referred to as a fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunities that have been missed are just tragic," said Martin 
Anderson, a founding board member of the Reagan Foundation who worked with 
Reagan as an adviser through several campaigns and in the Reagan White House 
during the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and his assistants are "just not a player" in the intellectual arena, 
Anderson said. "They aren't out there continuing what Reagan started. There are 
a whole range of issues -- foreign affairs, economic policy, tax policy, 
welfare reform, nuclear proliferation -- that were important during the Reagan 
revolution, and they're simply not dealing with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith himself acknowledges that his style and the direction he has set for the 
Reagan Library have disappointed some people. 
</P>
<P>
 But he defended the library's record for taking on issues of substance under 
his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the prominent speakers who have visited over the last six months as 
part of the Reagan Forum series. 
</P>
<P>
 And more such events are planned, he said. A two-day conference set for 
October, "What's Wrong with American Politics?," will feature panel discussions 
with such famous politicians and pundits as David Gergen, John McLaughlin, 
George McGovern, Robert Novak, Margaret Tutweiler, James Carville and Mary 
Matalin. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also plans to sponsor a fellowship program to help scholars studying 
the Reagan era, and to hold more conferences early next year on such topics as 
the demise of newspapers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strength of the presidential library system is its diversity," Smith 
said. "The libraries reflect the personalities of the individual Presidents 
they were built for. We're creating something distinctive here. Ronald Reagan 
did not become President by listening to elites. He succeeded by doing the 
unconventional. He and Nancy wanted something that was not a conventional think 
tank or an ivory tower. They wanted something that would attract people." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith says the library has to compete for a limited pool of entertainment 
money with the likes of Six Flags Magic Mountain, museums in Los Angeles and 
the large multiplex cinemas across the region. So he challenges the notions 
some may have of what is acceptable at a presidential library in an attempt to 
bring more people into the institution. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his regular refrains is, "History is too important to leave to the 
historians." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he aims to attract to the library the speakers and events that 
create news. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the First Ladies exhibit presented during the summer was a good 
example of mixing the popular with the historical. The exhibit featured 
hundreds of items, including Martha Washington's petticoat and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's law degree. Smith said it was a way of teaching history through 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an enormous number of people out there that want to experience the 
history of their country," he said. "One of the ways to do that is to 
personalize it, to show the impact of an individual. As a biographer, that's 
what's always interested me." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the criticism of Smith's background give short shrift to his scholarly 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Harvard, where he studied government and American 
history, Smith spent several years in Washington working as a speech writer for 
politicians, including Gov. Pete Wilson, who was a U.S. senator at the time; 
former Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts; Sen. Robert Dole; Elizabeth Dole, 
the former secretary of transportation and labor; and former Vice President Dan 
Quayle and his wife, Marilyn. 
</P>
<P>
 He has written several books, including the biography, "Thomas E. Dewey and 
His Times," one of three finalists in its category for the 1983 Pulitzer Prize. 
His biography of Herbert Hoover, published in 1984, led to a speech presented 
at the Hoover Library. The speech so impressed administrators there that they 
asked Smith to serve as director, said John Fawcett, assistant archivist for 
the National Archives in Washington, and the man who hired Smith for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that has to be the best hiring decision I've ever made," Fawcett 
said. "I don't think he could be described as anything but a resounding 
success." 
</P>
<P>
 For about a year, Smith was director of both the Hoover Library and the 
Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kan. He organized a celebration for the 
centennial of Eisenhower's birth there and, as Smith did at the Hoover Library, 
he emphasized the personal side of Eisenhower's life. The exhibit impressed the 
Reagans, Fawcett said. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as he can remember, Smith said he has felt a personal connection to 
the office of the President, a connection he believes everyone has, in one way 
or another. 
</P>
<P>
 He still remembers sitting in front of the television at age 5, watching a 
children's program hosted by "Big Brother" Bob Emory on WBRZ-TV in Boston. At 
the start of each show Smith would join along with the host, holding up a glass 
of milk and toasting a portrait of Eisenhower while singing "Hail to the 
Chief." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6, he persuaded his parents to let him stay up until midnight while the 
returns were counted in the 1960 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember my little world crumbling when it looked like that mean man John 
F. Kennedy was going to beat the good Richard Nixon," he said with a laugh. "I 
have since moderated my opinion of JFK." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is at a loss to explain what possessed him at such an early age and 
continues to compel him to collect such memorabilia as autographs from every 
single President. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first (signature) I collected was Calvin Coolidge as a freshman in 
college," he said. "The first signature I got of a President-to-be was Richard 
Nixon. I wrote him as an 11-year-old when he was a lawyer in New York. He wrote 
back and signed the letter 'Best wishes in the years ahead.' I still cherish 
that to this day." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Reagan helped Smith complete his collection by asking President Clinton 
for his autograph last year. Smith has the autographed picture -- depicting 
Clinton and Reagan standing in the White House -- framed on his office wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who grew up an only child in the Massachusetts hamlet of Townsend, 
about 45 miles from Boston, said he did not inherit his passion for politics 
from his parents. His mother worked as a nurse and his father labored in a 
factory, so Smith spent most of his time with his grandparents, who ingrained 
their deep-rooted patriotism in him. His favorite holiday has always been the 
Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith describes himself as a liberal Republican, "one of the last rock 'n' 
roll Republicans." In 1968, while a whole generation around him was protesting, 
Smith, just 14 at the time, went to the Republican convention in Miami. A 
die-hard Nelson Rockefeller supporter, he remembers hitting a Nixon delegate 
from Iowa over the head with a sign during a heated demonstration on the 
convention floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was Rocky's last chance," he said. "I guess I got carried away." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his politics, he lists many Democrats among his favorite Presidents. 
In the late 1960s, Smith said he admired Lyndon B. Johnson. When Johnson died 
while Smith was a student at Harvard, he remembers being terribly saddened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was a great lesson for me about the unique place that Presidents 
have in our individual and collective conscience," he said. "He was a mountain 
of a man, a truly tragic figure." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith seems most content when talking about the past, when recounting an 
obscure moment from the lives of historical figures, details he says might 
range from the compelling to the pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose it just makes them more human," he said. "It's like with an 
autograph. You see the movements of their hand and they suddenly seem human and 
real. That's what history is to me."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; GANG UNIT ARRESTS 220 OVER FIVE-WEEK SPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A special five-week gang detail netted more than 220 gang-related arrests 
during August and September, police said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-officer unit logged arrests including one for homicide, four for 
robbery, seven for auto theft, 12 for felonious assault and 20 for firearms 
violations, Garden Grove Police Lt. Kevin Raney said.The detail also seized 20 
guns and recovered seven stolen vehicles, Raney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven additional police officers were transferred to the department's gang 
suppression unit Aug. 5 to curb growing gang activity in the city, Raney said. 
The department disbanded the special detail Sept. 9, Raney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure we had a safe, quiet start to school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, gang activity increases during the summer and falls off when school 
begins, Raney said.MARTIN MILLER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: TUSTIN; CITY TO WEIGH CHANGES TO DATES OF ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Options for changing the date of the next municipal election are scheduled for 
discussion when the City Council meets at 7 p.m. tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jeffery M. Thomas has suggested that the next city election, slated 
for April 9, 1996, be held two weeks earlier to coincide with the statewide 
primary on March 26, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis by Chief Deputy City Clerk Valerie Crabill indicates that a 
consolidated election such as this could increase voter turnout and reduce 
costs to the city. Disadvantages of a consolidated election, according to 
Crabill, include the loss of visibility for Tustin issues and candidates, and 
increased campaign costs for City Council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Other options for consolidated election dates are Nov. 7, 1995, which would 
shorten current council terms by five months, and Nov. 5, 1996, which would 
extend terms by seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city chooses to stick to the current system and hold the election April 
9, 1996, it would have no effect on council term lengths. A separate election 
could also be held March 4, 1997, which would extend current council terms by 
11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the council agenda Monday is a proposed law that would prohibit the 
solicitation of motor vehicle occupants. This traffic safety measure is aimed 
at persons who try to sell goods or services to motorists or ask them for 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law is modeled after an ordinance enacted by Agoura Hills. ALAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; CITY DESIGN REVIEW BOARD IS MODIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city moved a few steps closer to completing a four-year overhaul of its 
comprehensive zoning plan last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners and City Council members met in a study session to 
thrash out the final issues in the plan, which they hope to finish before the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Design Review Board, which approves Old Towne changes, came under fire 
during the review session. As a result, the five-member board now will have an 
architect, a landscape architect, a builder and two members of the general 
public instead of one. 
</P>
<P>
 Those board members also will have less latitude to impose their own visions 
on residents.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned that the board work with what the design applicant wants and 
not design for them," said Randy Bosch, chairman of the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, a consultant had offered a revision of the massive document, but 
council members and planning commissioners found it was not sufficient, 
associate planner Barbara Gander said. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of the planning staff then began the long process of reviewing 
zoning in the city and the historic Old Towne district.

 "Overall, we've really cleaned up the documents," Gander said. "It's easier to 
find the rules and regulations. It's really user-friendly. That's a big 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes include a review of minor projects that eliminates public 
hearings, a more liberal ratio of building to lot size and a loosening of 
stringent Old Towne sign codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The revisions leave less discretion to the city staff, Gander said. LESLEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; UNITED WAY LAUNCHES FUND-RAISING DRIVE

 With colorful balloons serving as a backdrop and a Dixieland band trumpeting a 
few Southern tunes, the United Way launched its fall campaign last week in 
Irvine and set a goal to raise $20.2 million by mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "A Day of Caring," the start of the fall campaign, in which an 
estimated 300 people showed up, had a second purpose: 600 volunteers were to 
start sprucing up 33 health and human service agencies in Orange County -- the 
Boys and Girls Club, battered women's shelters and the Salvation Army, to name 
a few. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the organizations that help people but need help themselves, and 
we're there to lend a helping hand," said Jeff Rocke, the vice president of the 
nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the fanfare behind the Sept. 16 start of the campaign centered on 
reaching the $20.2-million goal, a 4.5% increase over last year's $19.3 million 
raised. Rocke said 10 "pace setting" companies, did their part by contributing 
a total of $587,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a boost out of the blocks," Rocke said. TOM RAGAN

EMOTIONS RUN HIGH IN PROP. 187 DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents say if Proposition 187 passes, school officials and doctors and 
social service agencies will, in effect, become agents for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. Skin colors and last names will become suspect and lead 
to discrimination. About 300,000 students in public schools could be turned 
out, and $15 billion in federal funds could be lost and disease go untreated. 
</P>
<P>
 But the other side says that if the state ballot measure is approved in 
November, public education will improve because there will be fewer students 
and more teachers per classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 There will, these people say, be a smooth transition for illegal immigrant 
students not entitled to an education -- they won't be kicked out immediately, 
if they are kicked out at all. What's more, there is no way the federal 
government will withhold funds to so large and powerful a state as California. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the arguments Sunday night at an emotionally charged forum at St. 
Mark Presbyterian Church. An estimated 150 people showed up to learn more about 
the controversial initiative by questioning a five-member panel, including 
proposition co-author Ron Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Save Our State initiative, which would bar illegal immigrants 
from attending public schools and deny them non-emergency health care and 
social services, has been called racist by many who oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill King, a former INS official of 37 years and one of the panel members, 
said: "I keep on hearing it's a racist issue, which is vexing to me. It's not 
about ancestry; it's about illegal behavior. Those who say the proposition is 
racist . . . well, that's just a crutch to lean on." 
</P>
<P>
 Racially motivated or not, Proposition 187 would do nothing to solve the 
state's illegal immigration woes, its opponents agreed, because most immigrants 
come for jobs first, not benefits. The measure could also lead to greater 
health problems by denying illegal immigrants immunizations, said Dr. Robert T. 
Miner, a panelist and member of the Orange County Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disease is 100% nonpartisan, and it has no respect for borders," he said. 
"Even killer bees don't respect our borders. Proposition 187 is the wrong 
prescription for a serious disease. But if you don't allow me to treat the 
little illegal alien now, I'm going to be treating people inside your homes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Prince, a Tustin accountant, said it is wiser to start denying health care 
to illegal immigrants now rather than later.  
</P>
<P>
 "The good doctor (Miner) is living in an ideal world where we try to treat 
every patient," Prince said. "But the state health care system is already 
strained and overburdened. It may be a hard choice to deny health care now, but 
the situation is bad and it's getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Hornbuckle, a panelist and a Costa Mesa City Council member who opposes 
the proposition, said the initiative wouldcost taxpayers in future legal 
challenges, if the voters approve it. That's exactly what happened to the city 
of Costa Mesa, she said, when it tried to stop the influx of illegal immigrants 
by challenging federal laws in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be great politics," she said of the initiative. "But it's bad public 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell Valbuena of Costa Mesa stood up and told the panelists in favor of 
the proposition that they had everything turned around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Illegal immigrants don't cost us money -- they make us money and they save us 
money with their cheap labor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbara Coe, a co-chairperson for the California Coalition for Immigration 
Reform, said: "This is a nation of laws, and people must abide by them. If we 
had the money and the wherewithal, we'd happily educate the children and 
medicate the children and put them in beautiful homes. But we don't have the 
money."

VALLEY CHRONICLE: NORTHRIDGE FAMILY GOES GOOFY OVER DISNEY PARAPHERNALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Miller, principal of a middle school in Watts, is goofy about Dopey. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Kay, has some Mickey Mouse fancies of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 20-year-old daughter, Kristina, has turned a bedroom of their Northridge 
home into the Snow White room. 
</P>
<P>
 The family obsession started innocently enough with trips to Disneyland. "You 
know, we would bring back a couple of souvenirs," John Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, they began picking up more expensive trinkets. Somewhere along 
the line, the Millers began buying top-of-the-line collectors editions of 
famous Disney figures. The value of their collection runs into the thousands of 
dollars, John Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent passion: the Disney Classics Collection, with figurines 
costing more than $200. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interesting thing about the classics is that they seem expensive when you 
first get them, but then you find out that two years later they are worth 10 
times what you paid," Miller says. Most collectors are interested neither in 
quick profits nor long-term investments, Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 The family learned that there were many local collectors just as avid as 
themselves. Miller, a school principal who is used to getting things organized, 
decided to start a Disney collectors club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started with about 15 people who were also interested in collecting all 
things Disney," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, now numbering 40 members, meets every other month in the South 
Court of the Panorama Mall. On Nov. 20, the group's guest speaker will be 
Disney archivist David Smith. In December, the group plans a behind-the-scenes 
tour of Disneyland and Disney's Burbank studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The collectors group, according to Miller, includes people from all walks of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have housewives, several journalists, some retired people and students. 
What brings us together is our love of Disney characters," says Miller. "The 
world we know today can be so difficult, so it's wonderful to have this kind of 
release." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says not everyone in his family is that taken with Disney collecting. 
His 16-year-old son is the lone holdout. 
</P>
<P>
 In a house that looks like Disneyrama, and where his mother has been known to 
dress up like Snow White, Mark is interested in other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks we're nuts," Miller says. Senior Recreation Center Creates a Family 
Atmosphere 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Bucroff became director of the Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Senior Citizen 
Center last December. Since then, he's been trying to form a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing illegal, mind you. He just wants to create a family-like atmosphere 
where friendships can grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here from Westchester, where I knew everyone's name because people 
came every day and hung out at the center. The programs I ran there gave people 
in the community a place to meet new people as well as something to do each 
day," Bucroff says. 
</P>
<P>
 While 23 clubs use the center, most members leave after attending meetings, 
rather than socializing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no real feeling of community," Bucroff says. He set about to change 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 His first change: organizing a monthly dance. Fifty people between the ages of 
60 and 80 attend at a cost of $2.50, covering the band and refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like the fact the dances are held in the afternoon, so they don't have 
to go out after dark," according to Bucroff. "And they particularly like the 
dances that involve dressing up," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest hit to date: the Polynesian ballroom dance featuring Danny Davis 
and his Vibratones band last July. About 90% of the participants came in 
Hawaiian garb. The center's gardening staff found banana leaves and hibiscus 
flowers to decorate the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Dances are set for Oct. 3, with a Western theme, and Oct. 19, a Halloween 
dance that will feature costumes, bobbing for apples and a cakewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Bucroff, pleased with community support, says what interests him most about 
the afternoon socials is how well everyone dances. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who grew up doing ballroom dancing. Watching them makes you 
realize how much the current generations have missed," Bucroff says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bucroff is now planning a series of speakers on legal and medical issues 
affecting seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wants seniors to know they can come and just hang out. Overheard 
</P>

margaritas. Or, how about doing Chinese for a change?"

on a plate."

5 ARRESTED AT HOUSE IN LANCASTER; CRIME: DEPUTIES RESPONDING TO A CALL ABOUT A 
LOUD PARTY FIND A PIPE BOMB, SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN AND DRUGS.

 Three adults and two teen-agers were arrested after sheriff's deputies found 
weapons and drugs at a Lancaster house during a routine call about a loud 
party, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies reported discovering a homemade pipe 
bomb, a sawed-off shotgun and unspecified amounts of methamphetamine and 
marijuana about 9 p.m. after they responded to a neighbor's complaint of a loud 
party in the 44000 block of 40th St. West. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Shows, 21, who lives at the house, was arrested on suspicion of 
possessing controlled substances, a sawed-off shotgun and an explosive device, 
said Lt. Daniel Castillo of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. He is being 
held in lieu of $500,000 at the station's jail, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Bowen, 24, of Quartz Hill, and Marjorie Richardson, 29, of Palmdale, 
were arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of a stimulant, 
Castillo said. Bowen was cited and released. Richardson is being held on a 
previous warrant. Her bail is set at $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 16-year-old girls from Palmdale and Quartz Hill also were arrested on 
suspicion of being under the influence of illegal drugs, Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were called there to tell them to turn down the loud music," Castillo 
said. "It was a routine party call until we found the pipe bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies arrived at the house, a couple of party-goers ran from the 
scene, Castillo said. While they spoke with one of the minors arrested, 
deputies noticed expended .22-caliber rifle casings in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They conducted a search of the house and noticed the shotgun and white 
powdery substance and the marijuana," Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a more in-depth search, they found the pipe bomb and evacuated the house 
until bomb squad investigators could dispose of it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation is continuing, Castillo said.

AEROSPACE WALK OF HONOR INDUCTS 5; AVIATION: LANCASTER PAYS TRIBUTE TO 
DECORATED TEST PILOTS -- TWO POSTHUMOUSLY. THEY JOIN 20 OTHERS.

 Robert Rahn remembers the first time he saw a jet airplane as he taxied down a 
runway in 1940. Little did he know then that within 10 years he would be one of 
the nation's first pilots to fly one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw them placing blocks underneath the wheels of this strange aircraft," 
Rahn said. "What's that?" he asked, calling down to a ground crew member, who 
told him, "It's a jet airplane." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's nice," Rahn recalled saying. "What's a jet airplane?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rahn, 73, was one of five decorated test pilots inducted Sunday into the city 
of Lancaster's Aerospace Walk of Honor in a ceremony that featured "Star Trek" 
legend Leonard Nimoy, who separated Mr. Spock's fictional heroics from the work 
of real heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in the Aerospace Walk of Honor because I believe in history," Nimoy 
said. "History begins with the willingness of one person to do something first. 
To boldly go where no one has gone before," he added, borrowing the now-famous 
phrase from the popular television series. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Rahn, Air Force Col. Charles C. Bock Jr., Herman Richard Salmon, 
Maj. Gen. Robert A. Rushworth and Alvin S. White were honored at the fifth 
annual awards ceremonies at the Lancaster Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The inductees join 20 test pilots who have been honored since the city began 
the awards program in 1990. Together, the pilots honored Sunday logged more 
than 40,000 hours of flight time, carried out hundreds of combat missions and 
flew some of the first jets ever built. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means an awful lot because of all the past honorees, some who I've known 
for 50 years," Rahn said. "Jimmy Dolittle was a hero of mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, a gifted test pilot who, it was said, could "feel with the plane," and 
Rushworth, who flew the X-15 rocket research aircraft 34 times, were honored 
posthumously and their awards were accepted by family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Bock participated in the SR-71 Blackbird Test Program in 1965, and flew more 
than 70 aircraft as well as flying more than 100 combat missions in Korea and 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 When he tested the XF4D Skyray, a prototype Navy fighter jet, Rahn became the 
first man to break the sound barrier and perform a spin and recovery maneuver 
in a delta wing aircraft. He is also the only Army pilot honored in the Navy 
Test Pilot Hall of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
 At a reception before the ceremony, Rahn marveled at the changes in aviation 
that have occurred since he left the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School in 
Lancaster nearly 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 50 years, we went from 15,000 pounds of thrust for an entire plane to 
90,000 pounds of thrust -- and that's just one engine in a commercial 
airliner," he said. "It's just phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin S. White, a World War II combat veteran, was honored for his work as an 
engineering test pilot. He also helped design parachutes used on the ground to 
slow aircraft, and ejection seats. 
</P>
<P>
 White took two experimental aircraft to a speed of more than 2,000 m.p.h. 
while working as the chief test pilot for North American Aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 White, 76, also told a tale about how he survived a midair collision during an 
experimental flight in the final stages of testing for the XB-70, a bomber 
developed to replace the B-52. The plane was later used as a research aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 After his plane scraped wings with an escort fighter, the bomber went into a 
spin and fell 20,000 feet before he was able to escape in an ejector seat, 
White said. "We got hit at 30,000 feet, and I got out about 10,000 feet," White 
said. "My co-pilot was killed."

<P>
 A 14-year-old boy who fell 50 feet down a hillside to his death has been 
identified as Leif Lien of Lancaster, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred Saturday afternoon when Leif was hiking and playing on a 
hillside near the California Aqueduct just south of Lancaster Road, said Lt. 
Daniel Castillo of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Antelope Valley 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Leif was with his 16-year-old brother, Eric Lien, and his 14-year-old cousin, 
Cory Guffey, Castillo said. Leif slipped on some rocks, fell down a 50-foot 
cliff and died when his head hit a rock on the canyon floor, Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys were visiting a cabin owned by Leif's uncle in the 18000 block of 
Lancaster Road. The brother and cousin ran home and called 911 after Leif fell, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County Search and Rescue team retrieved the body Saturday 
evening, Castillo said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

 Chuck Knox: Any way we can take this one and throw it back?  
</P>
<P>
 In case any doubt remained, the clothes do not make the Ram. It was worth a 
try, I suppose -- jerseys the color of the golden fleece, lamb white pants, the 
echoes of '51 bouncing off empty seats in the terrace level, Tank Younger and 
Crazy Legs Hirsch trotted out at halftime for a 10-minute nostalgia fest at 
midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Rams, Sunday was a better day for history than current events. The 
Grandsons of '51 continued to drag the family name through the mud, losing, 
34-19, to a San Francisco team dressed in jerseys from the era of Y.A. Tittle, 
who probably could have replaced Steve Young and won this one, the way Jerry 
Rice and John Taylor frolicked unbounded throughout the Ram secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest the Rams came to catching the proper spirit was rotating their 
quarterbacks, the way Joe Stydahar played it en route to the first and only 
L.A./Anaheim Ram NFL championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not quite the same way, if nits are to be picked. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-three years of ostensible progress have taken the Rams from Bob 
Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin to Miller and Chandler. The theory of 
de-evolution, proved at last? 
</P>
<P>
 Waterfield and Van Brocklin took turns filling the sky above the Coliseum with 
picturesque spirals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Miller and Chandler took turns killing time between Sean Landeta 
punts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tale of the tape: 
</P>
<P>
 Miller -- eight completions, 86 yards, long gain of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler -- nine completions, 87 yards, long gain of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris vs. Chris, separated at birth. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't be right to call it a quarterback controversy, because what would 
be the point? One or the other, what's the difference? 
</P>
<P>
 But this game did feature a controversy regarding a Ram quarterback. It 
involved Miller's physical fitness -- is he or isn't he? -- with Knox and 
Miller addressing the issue from the right and the left. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller absorbed a vicious hit by 49er defensive tackle Dana Stubblefield late 
in the second quarter and began firing punch-drunk passes to open the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him early in the third quarter if he was all right," said Knox, 
knowing that with Miller this is always a loaded question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if there was anything wrong with his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if there was anything wrong with his ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if there was anything wrong with his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was fine, so I left him in there." 
</P>
<P>
 And Miller continued to one-hop passes to Flipper Anderson and Isaac Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was obvious," Knox said, "something was not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Miller fessed up and admitted to a tingling in his right hand. By the 
end of the game, four fingers on that hand had gone numb, Miller was 
complaining of a "fire in my shoulder" and team trainers had diagnosed a 
pinched nerve, recommending postgame X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he fibbed to Knox because "I've never had a pinched nerve before 
and I anticipated it going away. But it just got worse. Obviously, I stayed in 
one series too long." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Knox changed quarterbacks, sending in Chandler on the Rams' first 
possession of the fourth quarter, a 17-10 49ers halftime lead had grown to 
27-10 and the afternoon was wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to go with what (Miller) said," insisted Knox, obviously miffed. "Maybe 
he had some adrenaline going and thought he could play through it. But we were 
in this football game . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Our inability in the third quarter to put points on the board when people 
were open hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler used his three series to drive the Rams to a field goal and a 
touchdown. He might have managed more, but Jesse Hester fumbled after making a 
catch, snuffing a drive at the Ram 32. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he did a good job," Knox said of Chandler. "He threw the ball well. 
Moved the team down the field." 
</P>
<P>
 And Miller? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, this isn't what we want from him," Knox said. "How much of it is due to 
injury, I don't know. He's had the rib cartilage, and now pinched nerve in his 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that if we had gotten a little more out of our passing offense 
today, it would have been a different ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller entered this game ranked 26th in the league in passing efficiency and 
didn't help himself with a full quarter's worth of numbball. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller called it "frustrating," but should any of this surprise anyone who has 
followed Miller's career from sling to cast to arthroscopic surgeon's scar? 
</P>
<P>
 You spend $9 million on the prince of injured reserve, you tend to get what 
you pay for. Three pain-killing shots in the ribs one week, X-rays on a pinched 
nerve the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "My knee feels great," said Miller, who went on to brag that, "I'm not even 
wearing my knee brace." 
</P>
<P>
 So he's got that going for himself, which is nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are going along fine," Miller said, "and then I get this burning thing 
in my shoulder . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I'm throwing OK and the next thing I know, the football's in the 
dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Who says Knox is not a coach for the '90s? Every time he watched one of those 
passes skid across the Anaheim Stadium infield, Knox could feel Miller's pain. 
He got this funny tingling sensation. Felt numb all over.

MIGLINIEKS FINDS HIS OPENING; BASKETBALL: WITH A FEW ASSISTS, HE GOES FROM 
LATVIA TO UC IRVINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Red Army captain, a Russian making no attempt to hide his contempt for the 
Latvian conscript seated in his office, wasn't smiling when he said it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see you are an athlete, but I think we will send you to Afghanistan 
anyway."  
</P>
<P>
 For Raimonds Miglinieks, a young man whose life had revolved around the 
basketball courts of the Soviet sports-school system as a member of numerous 
junior national teams, the officer's words instantly gave new meaning to the 
term "shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 "My sweat went over my forehead," he says, managing a smile six years later. 
"It was like a job interview. They want to know if your parents are agents of 
the United States or England so they can send you to Siberia. It was a scary 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 For a recruit from the Baltic States in the late 1980s, almost any post in the 
Red Army was dangerous. A Latvian soldier might just as easily die at the hands 
of his brothers in arms as Afghan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had friends who were beaten up nearly every day," Miglinieks said. "Others 
were killed." 
</P>
<P>
 But because he could dribble, shoot and pass better than most of his 
countrymen, Miglinieks benefited from a system he was learning to despise. He 
ended up being stationed less than 200 miles from home and his stint as a 
soldier was unpleasant, but uneventful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky again because of sports," he says. "We just marched. They didn't 
really teach you anything. They just abuse people." 
</P>
<P>
 After his discharge, Miglinieks and his wife, Krista, talked often about the 
prospects of a better life. They decided that the "United States is the best 
country in the world to have an opportunity to go to school, get a job, live a 
good life." 
</P>
<P>
 While playing with a goodwill team made up of Russian and American players, 
Miglinieks met his conduit to a new future, former UC Irvine player Wayne 
Englestad. 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks came to visit Englestad in Irvine and never went home to Riga, 
Latvia, again. While playing in a pick-up game at UC Irvine, he met Maz Trakh, 
then an assistant at Riverside City College, and within a few weeks was 
enrolling at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 After four months of study at the Wayne Englestad School of English Syntax, 
Miglinieks flew his wife over, packed his Russian-English dictionary and moved 
out of Englestad's house and into the house of a 72-year-old Latvian benefactor 
in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raimonds spoke very little English then and the first couple of months were 
an extremely difficult transition for him," said Trakh, who is now an assistant 
at UC Irvine. "But then you also have to understand that he came into this with 
a completely different perspective than most young men. This was a new lease on 
life for him and he was going to do whatever it took. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, the guy has a 3.5 GPA." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those weren't the only impressive numbers Miglinieks brought to UC Irvine when 
he accepted a scholarship this spring. In two years at Riverside, he set an 
all-time assist record with 828 and he averaged 18 points and 12 assists last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a three-letter word that describes Raimonds on a basketball court," 
Trakh said. "Ego. He doesn't have one." 
</P>
<P>
 Trakh came to that realization in a hurry. Miglinieks scored 30 points in a 
game early in his freshman year. In the next game, he took two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him what was wrong with him, why he didn't shoot more," Trakh said. 
"He said, 'Maz, we won by 20 points, I was making sure everybody got the ball.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 So how does a foreign player who speaks very little English settle in with 
your average band of trash-talkin' collegiate basketball players? 
</P>
<P>
 "At Riverside, they took some runs at him at first," Trakh said, "but in two 
weeks, he was everybody's best friend. Best way to make friends is to keep 
passing them the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks is slowly getting to know his new teammates through the summer 
ritual of pick-up basketball. A teammate here, a Long Beach player there, maybe 
an NBA player mixed in. And always a measure of macho posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came to Riverside, I had never heard people talk trash during 
game," he said, "but Maz told me about it. Still, I was surprised first time I 
heard, 'Go home to Russia,' when I was at Riverside." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come first to team, there is all new players and we don't know each 
other. Pick-up games are pick-up games. There are no referees and we have maybe 
some arguments. But that's how it is in life, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside Coach Bob Schermerhorn, who expressed reservations about the 
Latvian's abilities the first time he saw him play in a pick-up game, has since 
spun at least 360 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the most unselfish player I've ever coached," Schermerhorn said. "I know 
it's a cliche, but this guy really does make everyone else on his team play at 
a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
 Schermerhorn has at least one excuse for his early reticence. It's hard to 
look at Miglinieks and think basketball. Football, maybe. Hockey, for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 He's 6 feet 3, a broad-shouldered 195 pounds and definitely looks out of place 
among the long, lithe bodies in the gym. But first impressions are soon 
replaced by visions of jump shots settling into the net and the blur of crisp, 
accurate passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't look like much," said Irvine point guard Zuri Williams, who will 
be battling Miglinieks for playing time. "He's just like a block. But he can 
play and he can really pass. He's a great passer." 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks whipped a few passes past the ear of former Irvine star Scott 
Brooks the other day during a pick-up game in Irvine's Crawford Hall and the 
Houston Rocket guard was duly impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raimonds? Yeah, he's good man, really good," Brooks said, wiping sweat from 
his forehead. "I think he can really help them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There seems little doubt of that. Irvine's improbable run to the final game of 
the Big West tournament last March after a dismal regular season is testament 
enough to the Anteaters' under-achievements. A lack of consistency -- from game 
to game and minute to minute -- was their downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks, 24, could be the stabilizing force that unites the Anteaters into 
a cohesive group. 
</P>
<P>
 How much can he mean to a team? 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Coach Rod Baker insists that senior Williams will "compete for the 
job," but Schermerhorn also had originally planned to give Miglinieks about 
half of the playing time at point guard as a freshman. Within two weeks, 
Miglinieks was on the court almost the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged 39 minutes last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks made few moves, spectacular or subtle, that escaped the vision of 
Irvine assistant Greg Vetrone over the last couple of years, but Vetrone was 
hardly the only scout in the stands. The Irvine coaches desperately wanted him. 
But they weren't alone, and these are the sorts of battles Irvine recruiters 
have lost so often in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Miglinieks had a couple of prime choices, such as Cal, which wanted 
him as a replacement for Jason Kidd. And Seton Hall. And Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took Raimonds to a UCLA game last year," Trakh said. "They were No. 1 and 
playing Arizona State. We had good seats and the crowd was going nuts and I'm 
thinking, 'Man, this is the greatest.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I go, 'So Raimonds, what do you think?' And he shrugs and goes, 'Maz, I don't 
care so much about this. I just want to go somewhere where I can play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine offered a place to play and some of the comforts of home. The 
Southland's small, but closely knit Latvian community has embraced the 
Miglinieks. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I have many friends here," he said. "There is a big Latvian 
church near Dodger Stadium. And we meet every Sunday in Riverside and talk 
about what is happening back home and the political situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "That always feels like going home and it's only 45 minutes, if there is no 
traffic. But, you know, 91 is worst freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 He is, after all, a quick study. Even though he admits that he still doesn't 
get 100% of what his professors are saying -- "If she says a 15-word sentence 
and I understand 10 or 12, it is enough," he says -- Miglinieks was able to 
make the dean's list at Riverside City College. 
</P>
<P>
 And while he says the American school system presents obstacles, it also has 
wondrous advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I come here, I never had a test of multiple choice," he said. "We 
always take oral test or writing test. And here there is true and false. It's 
50-50 chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I say, United States is land of opportunity."

GERULAITIS FOUND DEAD IN NEW YORK; OBITUARY: BOYHOOD FRIEND OF MCENROE WON 27 
SINGLES TITLES, INCLUDING 1977 AUSTRALIAN OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vitas Gerulaitis, the shaggy-maned, fun-loving artist with a tennis racket and 
once John McEnroe's Long Island boyhood chum, was found dead Sunday in a 
bedroom at the home of an acquaintance in Southhampton, N.Y. He was 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a preliminary investigation did not reveal any suspicious 
circumstances and the cause of death will be determined after a coroner's 
examination today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared he had been there a while, like overnight," said Sgt. Lars King 
of the Southampton Village Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerulaitis won only one Grand Slam event singles title, the 1977 Australian 
Open, but reached the final in two others, losing to McEnroe in the 1979 U.S. 
Open and to Bjorn Borg in the 1980 French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gerulaitis won 27 singles titles, nine doubles titles, was ranked in 
the top 10 from 1977-1982 and reached as high as No. 4 in 1984, it is generally 
believed in tennis circles that his tennis achievements were curtailed by his 
carefree nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tennis has lost one of its great characters," said John Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Lloyd who was beaten by Gerulaitis on the grass courts of Kooyong in 
Melbourne in the Australian Open final 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd also played Gerulaitis in his last match. 
</P>
<P>
 In a doubles match Wednesday in Seattle, part of Jimmy Connors' Champions Tour 
for players over 35, Lloyd and Borg played Connors and Gerulaitis. 
</P>
<P>
 The production was pure Vitas, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He put on a performance that really was great entertainment," he said. "I 
told Jimmy during the match 'Well, there are three guys out there and there's 
Vitas.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He must have had 50 one-liners. Everything just clicked. He was on. We got a 
standing ovation when we left." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last time Gerulaitis stepped on a tennis court. He suffered a 
pulled muscle in his back during the match and withdrew from a singles match 
scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd said Gerulaitis barely could walk because of his back and wanted to get 
it better because he planned to play a lot of golf, his new passion, this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerulaitis was in Portland on Tuesday and played golf at Oregon Country Club 
in a foursome that included Pete Sampras, Tom Gullikson and Nike tennis 
marketing director Ian Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked fine and felt fine, as far as I could tell," Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd said he remembered something Gerulaitis told him at the U.S. Open a 
little more than a week ago. Lloyd said Gerulaitis complained about being 
unable to lift his arm after taking a three-hour golf lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors was unable to discuss Gerulaitis when reached by telephone at his 
Seattle hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd informed Borg of Gerulaitis' death and he was "totally shattered," 
according to Lloyd, who also said Borg telephoned Gerulaitis' mother in New 
York to express his sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Austin, who worked with Gerulaitis on the USA cable network's tennis 
broadcasts, said she last saw Gerulaitis on Sept. 11, the final day of the U.S. 
Open. Gerulaitis was working as an analyst for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin said she felt the same way she always did when she saw Gerulaitis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I saw him, I smiled," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made everybody feel better. There are certain people in life when you are 
around them, you feel happier. Vitas was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all going to miss him so much. He always had a joke, a smile, a laugh. 
He was just one of the good people." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerulaitis left the tour in 1985 and worked as a television analyst. He 
sometimes played in over-35 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as a skilled shotmaker with dazzling flair, Gerulaitis had some 
problems off the court. He acknowledged that he used cocaine in the late 1970s. 
He also said that his lifestyle undercut his ability as a player. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerulaitis, who in his early teens hung out at the same Long Island tennis 
clubs as McEnroe, won four tournaments in 1979. That was the year that McEnroe, 
five years younger than Gerulaitis, claimed his first Grand Slam title at the 
U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday night, McEnroe defeated Michael Chang in an exhibition match in 
Berkeley and said afterward: "I won this match for my buddy Vitas and I'm too 
distraught to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerulaitis also won five of his six Davis Cup singles matches in 1979, helping 
the United States defeat Italy, 5-0, in the final to defend its title. 
</P>
<P>
 The tennis establishment had long since identified him as a prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I played him when he was 17, in the juniors," said Lloyd, who is 
British. "He was just an outstanding player. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there was more to Vitas. He was just a funny, funny guy. He was just pure 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just liked being around him. He was a great, great character. This is just 
so hard to believe. He is too young for this to happen. It's a waste."

MIKE DOWNEY: OPENING ACT WAS GREAT, BUT THEY CLOSED SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything was beautiful. The Rams looked for their tight end. They found him. 
Touchdown. But a penalty was called on the play. So, the Rams called the same 
play again. They looked for their tight end. They found him. Touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 A tight end is like a mind. It's a terrible thing to waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Me, Troy Drayton said. Throw the ball to me. Here I am. You can't miss me. I'm 
6-3. I'm 255 pounds. Look at me in this mellow yellow uniform. I'm easy to 
spot. I look like a big canary. 
</P>
<P>
 Very next drive, they found him again. A pass to midfield for seven yards. 
Then another pass to the 49er nine, this one for 19 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Not two minutes into the second quarter, and the Rams were moving and 
grooving. They were playing the Drayton Game. They were picking bachelor No. 1. 
They were finally throwing footballs to lonesome Troy. 
</P>
<P>
 And they never threw him another. 
</P>
<P>
 Not once during the final 43 minutes of Sunday's game at Anaheim Stadium did 
either of the Ram quarterbacks, Chris A or Chris B, get the ball back to 
Drayton's waitin' fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 And San Francisco rolled, 34-19. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a game the Rams played on even terms until they stopped using their 
large tight end as a target. 
</P>
<P>
 A game that Drayton personally tied at 7-up with an Act 1, Take 2 touchdown 
catch. A game that became tied again at 10-10 after Drayton personally dragged 
tacklers such as Ken Norton Jr. inside the 49er 10, setting up a chip-shot 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Me, Drayton said. Don't forget me. 
</P>
<P>
 This was all he wanted -- to catch a lousy pass or two. To feel useful. To do 
something positive against the San Francisco 49ers, who love their own tight 
end so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watch the balls Brent Jones catches and I just wish it was me," Drayton 
said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones already has 16 catches this season. Drayton has three. 
</P>
<P>
 The restless Ram had been so encouraged by the way Sunday's game began. People 
even came up to him afterward, patting him on the back, congratulating him, 
even though he spent the entire second half waving his arm and yelling yoo-hoo, 
here I am, only to be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks," Drayton said. "I wish we won, of course. We fought our guts out. 
That was the best we looked so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for my own self, right now I can't complain. I was pretty happy, because 
I'd been beginning to doubt myself. I just hope this isn't just some one-week 
thing. I want them to look for me every week, not yes one week and no the next 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 On their opening drive, already down, 7-0, the Rams dazzled the 49ers with 
their complex offensive scheme. They ran Jerome Bettis up the middle for eight 
yards, then Jerome Bettis around right end for five yards, then Jerome Bettis 
around left end for four yards, then pulled a trick out of their old helmets 
and ran Jerome Bettis up the middle for no gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton's request during the week, to become more involved, apparently was 
still under discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of a shotgun formation, Chris Miller passed to a running back, Johnny 
Bailey, for 16 yards. Then he passed to a wide receiver, Willie Anderson, who 
drew an interference call against the 49ers. The football was placed one measly 
yard from the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 Me, Drayton said. How about me? 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris Miller told me it was my time," Drayton said. 
</P>
<P>
 From a yard out, he might have expected Bettis to be the beneficiary. Not so. 
Miller lobbed the ball into the left corner of the end zone to Drayton, who 
caught it, considered spiking it, then tucked it away to go hand to somebody 
for a keepsake. 
</P>
<P>
 This time it was his teammates who yelled yoo-hoo. Troy got called back to the 
huddle. Seems rookie tackle Wayne Gandy had committed the silliest of penalties 
-- lining up as an eligible receiver but neglecting to report into the game -- 
and the Rams had to do it over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that flag," Drayton said. "I thought it was a face mask thing on them . 
I got my mask grabbed on the catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Take Two: 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, choosing from their cornucopia of plays, ran Jerome Bettis up the 
middle for two yards. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, to the astonishment of Troy Drayton, the people of Orange County and 
the civilized world, they called their tight end's number again for a four-yard 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally," Drayton said. "An opportunity to showcase what I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he watched the 49ers call plays for Jerry Rice, John Taylor, Marc Logan, 
Ricky Watters and Jones, showcasing what they have. It wasn't complicated. 
Somebody threw them the ball.

PRO FOOTBALL: 49ERS 34, RAMS 19; HENLEY RETURNS, BUT ISN'T A FACTOR; FOOTBALL: 
CORNERBACK IS BEATEN SEVEN TIMES BY 49ER RECEIVERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley did his best to put his legal problems behind him for 
a while Sunday and start anew -- as a starter in the Rams' secondary for the 
first time in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But his triumphant return lacked something -- a triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, facing a Jan. 10 trial on federal drug-trafficking charges, couldn't 
stop wide receiver John Taylor in the 49ers' 34-19 victory over the Rams at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at right cornerback in place of an injured Steve Israel, Henley was 
beaten seven times for 112 yards in catches by 49er receivers, including six 
catches and a three-yard touchdown reception by Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can really understand how much pressure I've been under," said Henley, 
who must come up with $40,000 in bail money this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can write about it, but you really don't understand. I've been given the 
opportunity that I have wanted, but it's still not easy because of the other 
stuff (legal problems). 
</P>
<P>
 "But I would much rather be here than at home watching this on TV. I just deal 
with all this and put it all behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 This was Henley's first start since Oct. 3, when the Rams lost to New Orleans, 
37-6, at Anaheim Stadium. The next week, the team gave him a leave of absence 
when it was learned he was under investigation for his alleged role in a 
cocaine distribution ring. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing sparingly in the first two games of the season, Henley tried to 
help a Ram secondary that has been blistered two consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta's Jeff George completed 29 of 38 passes against the Rams last week, 
and 49er quarterback Steve Young was 31 of 39 Sunday. George threw for 287 
yards and three touchdowns, Young for 355 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, a six-year pro and a regular since 1991, said he wasn't surprised when 
coaches told him late in the week that he would start against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the majority of work in practice last week in place of Israel, who was 
out because of tendinitis in his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley rated his performance Sunday "a little above average." He finished 
fourth on the team in tackles with five. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was against the best," Henley said. "I know I can play a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 Chasing Taylor around the field Sunday afternoon brought back memories for 
Henley. He said he made his first NFL start in 1989 against the 49ers, and his 
first assignment was to cover Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming back to this situation -- my first game last week in Atlanta and 
starting this week -- there's a lot of deja vu-type stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley also is one of only a handful of current Rams who beat the 49ers, 
28-17, at San Francisco in 1990. The Rams haven't beaten San Francisco in 
Anaheim Stadium since 1986, and the 49ers have won the past eight meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming in at halftime I knew we had a legitimate chance at beating these 
guys," Henley said, "but (we) would have to play like we did the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 10-10, late in the second quarter, the 49ers needed only 
one minute 30 seconds and eight plays to drive 77 yards. Young scored on a 
one-yard sneak as time expired, and San Francisco had a 17-10 halftime lead -- 
and the momentum starting the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a time when our defense needs to step up and say, 'No, the most you're 
going to get there is a field goal," free safety Anthony Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to play four quarters of flawless football against these guys. They 
played four quarters against us and we played maybe two or 2 1/2 quarters. You 
have to come early and stay late against them. We tried to leave early. You 
have to have some overtime in there to get a victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get things done in the third quarter like we wanted to," he said. 
"When these guys score, you have to match them. We kind of fell behind on that 
in the second half and got off track." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, Henley was glad to be back in the starting lineup. He said 
fans were supportive as he left the field Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard (them say), 'We're glad you're back,' " Henley said. "But it has been 
like that from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard anything (bad), and that really doesn't concern me so much as 
it does trying to come out and win games." 
</P>
<P>
 Was Henley nervous? 
</P>
<P>
 "Very much so," he said. "I was glad I could overcome that and settle in, but 
it took me about one series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some coaxing from No. 90 (defensive tackle Sean Gilbert), and 
everything was fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert's advice was basic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me: 'Just play, you're here now, the time has come,' " Henley said.

PRO FOOTBALL: 49ERS 34, RAMS 19; YOUNG MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 His left knee was wrapped with a bandage. He iced the left wrist. There were 
assorted scrapes and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Steve Young had plenty of marks from San Francisco's 34-19 victory 
over the Rams Sunday. But the emotional scars, if any, have healed. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, he lost to Joe Montana and the Kansas City Chiefs. Well, he didn't 
actually lose by himself, it just seemed that way. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what better way to massage a bruised ego than a day against the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Steve who made all the big plays," said wide receiver Jerry Rice, who 
knows a big play when he sees, or creates, one. "Steve knew what to do and then 
did it. He was really in control out there." 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Young knew what to do, but didn't do it. He threw two 
interceptions -- one that bounced out of the hands of 49er tight end Brent 
Jones -- and fumbled once in the 24-17 loss to the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think stuff gets overplayed," Young said. "As players, we're not on top of 
all that stuff. You guys are reading and watching everything that happens 
through the week, and I don't see a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's vision care time. Not see a thing? 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand part of it, obviously," Young said. "We're on to the next week. 
Maybe we're a little brain dead or something. But it wasn't a big deal. We just 
moved on." 
</P>
<P>
 It helped that what Young was moving toward was hardly an immovable object. 
After all, Atlanta Falcon quarterback Jeff George threw for 287 yards and three 
touchdowns against the Rams last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Young found a cure for what ailed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Young completed 31 of 39 passes for 355 yards and two touchdowns despite 
playing behind a patch-work offensive line, which has lost three starters in 
three weeks. Young also rushed for two touchdowns and threw a block that set 
Rice free on a reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 It was throwbacks weekend around the NFL and Young's performance looked 
awfully familiar to the Rams. As a 49er, Montana had 300-yard games against the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Young has managed to carry on that tradition. He now has thrown for seven 
touchdowns and had only one pass intercepted in five games against the Rams, 
all victories. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasted little time Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was five of five for 53 yards on the 49ers' first drive. He connected 
with John Taylor on a three-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was three of four for 60 yards on the second drive, which ended in a 
33-yard field goal by Doug Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve Young did a hell of a job today," 49er Coach George Seifert said. "We 
need everybody on that same page." 
</P>
<P>
 That came late in the half, when Young took the 49ers on a 77-yard drive in 1 
minute 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Young hit on six of seven passes. The only one he missed was one he downed to 
kill the clock. That had followed a 28-yard completion to Rice that put the 
49ers inside the one. Young scored on a sneak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Jerry it was nice of him to get the ball to the one-foot line so I 
could score," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young paid Rice back in the fourth quarter by throwing a block that sprung 
Rice on a 13-yard run. Young got up slowly on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cringed when I saw him do that," Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rice: "That scared me. From now on I think we ought to keep him from 
making blocks like that. We need him healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Young had your basic daredevil afternoon. There was a 10-yard run in the 
fourth quarter to the Ram three. The reward for which was a swift kick by Ram 
defensive back Marquez Pope, who was penalized for tripping. 
</P>
<P>
 Young got up slowly on that play as well. "I probably shouldn't be out there 
running with the ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the things you do because Montana would have.

PRO FOOTBALL: 49ERS 34, RAMS 19; RAM NOTEBOOK / CHRIS FOSTER AND MIKE REILLEY; 
MEDIA CIRCUS COMES TO TOWN TO HANG ONTO SANDERS' EVERY WORD, DEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Hey everybody, it's Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of touring the country and inspecting football teams, Sanders 
signed with the San Francisco 49ers last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters jammed the walkway outside the 49ers' locker room after their 34-19 
victory over the Rams Sunday at Anaheim Stadium. Then the announcement came. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deion will speak in 40-45 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 A groan from reporters, some of who had come here just to record Sanders' 
every movement and word. 
</P>
<P>
 The movements were few. The words plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders was limited mostly to passing situations. He tipped two passes and was 
also called for pass interference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Constitution sent a reporter to chronicle Sanders' first game with 
the 49ers. CNN was there, asking everybody . . . about Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young, you threw for 355 yards and two touchdowns, but how do you rate 
Deion as a defensive back? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anyone faster than him," Young said. "I think he gets bored 
and let's someone beat him, then catches up and intercepts the ball for fun. 
I've seen him do it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Rice, you caught 11 passes for 147 yards and a touchdown, but are you 
glad you don't have to go up against Deion anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it was time for Deion to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to do what I'm capable of doing, what God blessed me to do," Sanders 
told the throng in his own, personal press conference. "I want to play good 
defensive back and take the other team's main guy out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 But even Sanders saw how ridiculous the situation had become. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait for the season to move along so I don't have to deal with this 
type of stuff," Sanders said. "It's not 'Deion Sanders.' It's 'The San 
Francisco 49ers won today.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball may be gone, but it wasn't forgotten at Anaheim Stadium. The Rams 
were playing and the Angels aren't coming back, but still the infield dirt 
lingers. 
</P>
<P>
 The dirt will be covered with sod today. Greg Smith, the stadium's general 
manager, said the grass needs two weeks to take hold. They hadn't had time to 
do the job because the baseball season wasn't officially called off until last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, San Francisco's Candlestick Park had its infield covered before the 
49ers' season opener. Officials there obviously anticipated the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium's turf will be in place in time for the Rams' next home game, 
Oct. 2 against the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ram tight end Troy Drayton, a second-year pro from Penn State, had not caught 
a pass in the first two games of the season and complained last week that he 
wasn't part of the offensive game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Drayton was smiling Sunday after catching three passes for 30 yards, 
including a four-yard touchdown pass from Chris Miller in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've made my point," Drayton said. "But I don't want it to be 
something that's on for one week, then off for three weeks, then back on for 
one week. I want it to be consistent." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ram quarterback Miller and San Francisco quarterback Steve Young completed all 
of their passes in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Young completed seven of seven passes for 100 yards and a touchdown, and 
Miller completed all four of his passes for 38 yards and one touchdown.

PRO FOOTBALL; RAIDERS SET TO WELCOME DAVIS BACK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defensive end Scott Davis knew last week that he was going to come back to the 
Raiders. But were the Raiders ready to welcome him back? 
</P>
<P>
 There was never any question Davis, who is expected back at the team's El 
Segundo training headquarters today, according to team officials, is 
desperately needed. But what about the players, whom he deserted on Sept. 6 
when he walked out of camp because of what were described only as "personal 
problems," and skipped the next two games? 
</P>
<P>
 Davis made several calls to players last week to talk about those problems, 
and to assure his teammates that he was returning with renewed dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 29, coming back from a two-year retirement, played only in the season 
opener before leaving after a fight with linebacker Greg Biekert. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow defensive lineman Anthony Smith has no hard feelings despite the fact 
that his job was made considerably more difficult by Davis' absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love him," Smith said. "He had to take care of some things at the house. I 
understand. When I came up as a rookie, he was nicer to me than anybody else on 
the team. I welcome him. And his talent."

LITTLE PROGRESS REPORTED IN TALKS ON NHL CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives of the NHL and its players association talked throughout the 
weekend, but neither side would say whether progress has been made in reaching 
an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not even on the same page," a source in the players' camp said.However, 
the source added that both sides are willing to continue talking in hopes of 
avoiding a lockout that would delay or interrupt the season. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman met Saturday in New York with Bob Goodenow, 
executive director of the players association. That followed a five-hour 
session Friday involving several representatives for each side. Bettman and 
Goodenow are tentatively scheduled to meet Tuesday in New York after Goodenow 
briefs players on the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow was in Northern California on Sunday and will be in Anaheim today to 
meet with the Mighty Ducks and in L.A. to meet with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Gartner, president of the players association, acknowledged that the 
proposal his side made on Friday, which involves a 5% levy on club revenues to 
be disbursed to small-market clubs, probably won't be accepted by management. 
While the players say the plan would produce $35 million, owners estimate the 
benefits at $20 million, which they said would be insufficient to help teams in 
smaller cities. NHL officials are expected to respond to the proposal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least there are discussions going on," Gartner said. "We still have some 
philosophical differences, but we are trying to work through them." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners are advocating a system that would penalize teams that exceed a payroll 
limit, reportedly $15 million. The money would go to teams that were under the 
limit.

SPLASH ISN'T LUCKY AGAINST LAS VEGAS; SOCCER: AFTER COMING FROM BEHIND IN 
FIRST-ROUND SERIES, ANAHEIM ELIMINATED IN 8-5 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Castro called it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash had come from behind in its first-round series against Sacramento, 
then lost the first game of the Continental Indoor Soccer League semifinals to 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can only roll a seven so many times," Castro had said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, in Las Vegas, Castro's prediction came true. The house won. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash's season ended in an 8-5 flameout against the Dustdevils, and did 
so in an eerily similar fashion to its 5-4 loss in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In both, the Splash blew a lead, unable to score more than one goal in the 
second half. In Game 1, it was a two-goal halftime lead. In Game 2 at the 
Thomas & Mack Center, it was a three-goal halftime lead. And with the loss, the 
Splash was swept out of the playoffs after a 20-8 regular-season record -- the 
league's second-best -- to a team that finished third in the division with a 
17-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the Splash's Western Division title meant nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the organization, Coach George Fernandez, the players and the 
administration said anything less than a championship series against Dallas -- 
which swept Washington in the Eastern semifinal -- would be a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed because I felt we should have reached the finals," 
Fernandez said. "Anything short of that hurts bad. We've got the talent. 
Obviously, when you get in a playoff situation, talent doesn't take you to the 
top. You need a little bit of bite, a little bit of heart, and that was 
missing, because all Las Vegas did was work their (tails) off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you're in the playoffs, you can't play part of the game, you've got to 
play four quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash played two quarters. Ultimately, it could not protect a lead -- or 
a tie. In its two losses to the Dustdevils, the Splash gave up 11 goals while 
leading or while tied, and eight of those goals came in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest meltdown began early in the third quarter. With the Splash holding 
a 4-1 lead, Las Vegas scored four consecutive goals. And after Doug Neely tied 
it, 5-5, early in the fourth quarter, the Dustdevils scored the game's final 
three goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez told his team at halftime, "the next goal is key," just as it had 
been in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty seconds into the third, Roderick Scott's shot was blocked by Splash 
defender Ralph Black, but it went right back to Scott, who made it a 4-2 game. 
It was the seventh playoff goal allowed by the Splash that was scored inside 
the first two minutes of a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Branko Segota made it a one-goal game when his free kick ricocheted off 
Black's head and past Splash goalie Jorge Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the momentum built. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were unfortunate," Fernandez said. "We were shellshocked, dazed. They were 
pretty much dead in the first half. Those first two goals gave them new life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash launched an assault against Las Vegas goalie Brett Phillips in the 
fourth quarter and Doug Neely tied the score, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash held a 16-2 shooting advantage in the fourth quarter, when Rusty 
Troy took Las Vegas' third shot at 8:15 -- and got it past Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Splash worked hard for its goals, the Dustdevils' scores came with 
apparent ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips was brilliant, especially in the fourth quarter, and about half of 
his 24 saves in the game came in one-on-one situations or snuffing point-blank 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just phenomenal," Fernandez said. "If not for him, we'd be going back 
to Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes after Troy's goal, Ben Erickson made it 7-5 on a 
counterattack at 10 minutes 4 seconds. Dan Barber, who went to Pacifica High, 
put away the final goal against the sixth attacker at 13:06. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash played as if it was buoyed by the closed-door players meeting 
before the game, as Bobby Bruch scored 3:31 in, and Castro, Jaime Francisco and 
Dale Ervine followed to make it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the second half. The Splash rolled a two and left town a loser.

KARIYA'S PLAY RAISES EYEBROWS AS DUCKS SKATE PAST CANUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks are noticing something new about the flair of Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears to be contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were making crisp passes Sunday, their scoring chances practically 
came in flurries, and a power play that was the worst in the NHL last season 
produced some excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just by watching in practice every day, you can see guys trying new things 
that Paul does," said center Bob Corkum, who had a goal and an assist in the 
Ducks' 4-1 exhibition victory over Vancouver. "(But) we all have our own roles. 
We're all not Paul Kariya out there, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya gave the 16,604 at The Pond its first look at his playmaking skill, 
beginning with a shorthanded goal 3:27 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Anatoli Semenov's breakout pass from the Ducks' defensive zone found Kariya 
well ahead of the play, and after a little hesitation move, he beat goalie Mike 
Fountain with a forehand shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went down and for the first time in my life, I think I had my head up," 
said Kariya, who has two goals and an assist in three exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a big goal, it got us going," Corkum said. "We were sort of stuck in 
our own end for a few minutes and then all of a sudden Paul is heading down 
ice. I can tell you, there aren't too many guys in the league who are as good 
as he is right now. He's really incredible, and he's only going to get better. 
That's the scary thing." 
</P>
<P>
 With the addition of rookies Kariya and Valeri Karpov, the Ducks have some 
returning players battling to make the team. Two of them, Peter Douris and John 
Lilley, had strong games, both contributing a goal and an assist. Lilley, a 
winger who played for the U.S. Olympic team before catching on with the Ducks 
late last season, just about has a job locked up, Coach Ron Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going from being on the bubble to popping the bubble," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilley enjoys watching Kariya, Semenov and Karpov, but said he's not going to 
get confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those three are great players," he said. "Guys like myself, I have to play my 
style. I'm not going to be effective if I try to do what they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya's effect on the rest of the team is clear to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of different from watching us play last year," he said. "A lot of 
guys are trying to do things that last year they wouldn't try to do," he said. 
"That's positive. (But) you still have to understand what your limitations 
are."

SAILOR KLEIN DIES DURING SAN FRANCISCO BAY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sailing community has been shaken by the death of San Diego's Larry Klein, 
a multiple world champion and 1989 U.S. Yachtsman of the Year, during a race on 
San Francisco Bay. He was 42. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein was skipper of the 38-foot sloop Twin Flyer, which was leading the fifth 
race of the 31st Big Boat Series on Saturday when the outboard port hiking rack 
collapsed and dumped him and six other crewmen into the water between the city 
front and Alcatraz Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death was not immediately disclosed, although Klein was presumed 
to have drowned during the crew's estimated eight minutes in the water. Klein, 
said to be a strong swimmer, apparently was not injured by any of the boat's 
equipment, and other members of the crew said the water was not particularly 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one report said there was a chilling breeze and the crewmen were 
wearing heavy foul-weather clothing, which could have made swimming or even 
floating difficult in the choppy water. Klein was pronounced dead at the 
California Pacific Medical Center at 5:56 p.m. Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 None of the crew wore life jackets -- not unusual for closed-course sailing, 
during which the prospect of rescue is seldom far away.  
</P>
<P>
 One crewman remained on board and was able to drop the sails. Five, including 
Klein, were picked up by a trailing competitor, X-Dream. One other swam back to 
the Twin Flyer and the last to another racing boat.  
</P>
<P>
 Twin Flyer was sailing upwind in 22 knots of wind at the time of the accident. 
Waves were four to five feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailing upwind, the crew was sitting on the port windward hiking rack outside 
the hull, using body weight to minimize the boat's heel in the extreme 
conditions. The rack was constructed of aluminum tubing. It was not immediately 
known why it collapsed.  
</P>
<P>
 The Twin Flyer is owned and designed by Alberto Calderon of San Diego. 
Calderon is an engineer and scientist known for his innovative boat designs, 
including ideas used on the America's Cup boat USA from San Francisco sailed by 
the late Tom Blackaller in 1986 and Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Klein was added to the U.S. Sailing Team as the top-ranked Soling 
class competitor building to the 1996 Olympics. His crew were Wally Corwin of 
Northboro, Mass., and Steve Burns of San Antonio.  
</P>
<P>
 Klein won world championships in the Soling, J-24 and Etchells classes. He 
competed in the Congressional Cup at Long Beach in 1990. Klein, a member of the 
San Diego Yacht Club, founded the J-World sailing school in San Diego after 
moving from Columbus, Ohio, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein is survived by his wife, Leslie, and their 20-month-old son, Alexander. 
The San Diego Yacht Club will hold a memorial for Klein on Wednesday from 4 to 
6 p.m.

FORMOSA SISTERS POWER EDISON PROGRAM; CROSS-COUNTRY: THE TEAM WITHIN THE 
CHARGER TEAM IS QUITE TALENTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teamwork is stressed at Edison High, but that's not a virtue the Formosa twins 
had to learn when they arrived there in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannie and Jennifer have been an integral part of the Chargers' success, 
which includes two State cross-country championships and three Southern Section 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifetime of sharing made it easy for the identical twins to fit into a 
team-oriented system such as the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like the same things, the same clothes, the same music," said Jeannie. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have $20 from baby-sitting or something," Jeannie said, "I don't 
consider it my $20. It's ours." 
</P>
<P>
 As similar as the two can be, the twins can be told apart by those close to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannie is more outgoing, or as Charger cross-country Coach Kristi McGihon 
puts it, "Jen definitely has more tact than Jeannie." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer's tact helps her to sit back and take in a situation, whereas Jeannie 
will speak her mind on a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the more dominant one," Jeannie said. "I'm better with expressing my 
opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jennifer: "Look, see, she just butted right in before me and answered." 
</P>
<P>
 What Jennifer lacks in the assertiveness department, she makes up for on the 
cross-country course, letting her talent do the talking. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Chargers won the Orange County Championships last fall, Jennifer was 
the first Edison runner across the finish line, finishing 15th. Jeannie was the 
third Charger to finish, 25th overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have earned All-Sunset League honors the past three years in helping the 
Chargers to three consecutive league titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work harder than Jeannie," said Jennifer, who has thus far this fall shared 
Edison's top-runner duties with senior Keri Wright. "She (Jeannie) started out 
better than me, but I caught her." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeannie: "I work hard, too. It's like Jennifer likes to feel pain or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Jennifer who started the twins running by wanting to join the track 
team in elementary school. Jeannie soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how it is when you're a twin and you're a little kid," Jennifer 
said. "You have to do everything together." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes wearing similar clothes and even going so far as to substitute 
for one another in class from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do it when one of us is having a bad day," Jennifer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeannie: "We did it two or three times last year, but that was the first 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the clothes, she added: "We used to do it on the first day of school, 
but we're seniors in high school now, so we're over that." 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing the twins haven't gotten over is their desire to succeed in 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12, they were introduced to race walking, a sport similar to distance 
running. They were an instant success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We qualified for the Pan American Games in Bulgaria," Jeannie said. "And we 
got to train with the best women in the United States at the Olympic training 
center." 
</P>
<P>
 Their mother decided, however, that the travel involved with international 
race-walking competition would be too much for her daughters and instead 
steered them toward running. 
</P>
<P>
 "She decided not to let us go because we would be competing with women 20 
years older than us and it as a long way from home," Jennifer said. "We decided 
that we could always pick up race walking later on, like in college, because 
it's not an event in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 The twins hope to stay together through college, but haven't decided which to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannie would like to prepare for a career in politics at North Carolina, but 
Jennifer said she has no interest in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I do vote," she said, laughing.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; SOTO LEADS THE TITANS TO SOCCER TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eddie Soto scored two goals -- for the second consecutive game -- to lead Cal 
State Fullerton to a 3-1 victory over Vermont in the title game of the 
Reebok/Smith and Barney Invitational Sunday in Burlington, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Helmer broke a 1-1 tie with two minutes remaining and Soto added his 
second goal a minute later.Soto, who also scored two in a 3-1 victory over New 
Hampshire on Friday, was named the offensive most valuable player. Goalkeeper 
Mike Kornock, the defensive MVP, had four saves for the 15th-ranked Titans 
(4-1-1). Vermont is 4-2-1. New Hampshire beat Stanford, 3-0, in the 
tournament's other game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonconference men's soccer: 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine 3, Cal State Northridge 2 -- Bret Cowan, Jon Szczuca and P.J. 
Palowski scored in a two-minute span late in the second half to give the 
visiting Anteaters a 3-0 lead. Northridge (3-2) then got close with two late 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mountain Pacific Sports Federation water polo: 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine 9, UC Irvine 7 -- Jack Kocur's two-point goal with 3:19 left gave 
the sixth-ranked Waves (3-3) a three-goal lead. UC Irvine's Peter Muller scored 
with 1:37 left to make it 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh-ranked Anteaters (2-4) had cut the Waves' lead from 7-4 to 7-6

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER; NOTRE DAME HOPES TO WELCOME TUSTIN STANDOUT 
GOTTLIEB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a few eyebrows were raised in February when Notre Dame football 
Coach Lou Holtz announced he had signed Gus Ornstein, a highly touted 
quarterback prospect, to a letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine that, observers mused, Notre Dame, one of the most prominent symbols 
of Catholicism in the United States, a Jewish kid from the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, less than a year later, Tustin High basketball star Doug Gottlieb, whose 
father, Bob, was a college fraternity brother of Ornstein's father, Steve, at 
Syracuse, might also end up in South Bend -- to play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb will announce his college choice at a news conference at 1 p.m. 
Wednesday at Tustin. He is expected to choose Notre Dame over UCLA, Michigan 
State, Virginia and Connecticut. Basketball players can sign letters during the 
Nov. 9-16 early signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during important summer camps and tournaments that college coaches from 
coast to coast got a good look at Gottlieb. The 6-foot, 180-pound point guard 
was a Times all-county pick and Sea View League most valuable player as a 
junior after averaging 19.7 points and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Nike/Las Vegas national championship tournament in July, playing for an 
Orange County all-star team coached by his father, Gottlieb impressed coaches 
such as Jim Harrick (UCLA), John MacLeod (Notre Dame), Lon Kruger (Florida) and 
Lute Olson (Arizona) with his point guard skills -- leadership, court vision, 
penetrating ability and shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like a coach on the floor," said one talent evaluator. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the offers poured in. Stanford, which received an oral 
commitment recently from 6-9 forward Mark Seaton of Servite, might have been 
the favorite, except for the fact the Cardinal already has a talented young 
point guard in sophomore Brevin Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida was "reluctantly eliminated," according to Bob Gottlieb, when Kruger 
decided it wasn't necessary to fly to California and join assistant coach Ron 
Stewart for a home visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb took his first official recruiting trip to Notre Dame, Sept. 9-11, 
then met with the Irish coaches again at his home last Monday night. Among the 
topics -- whether a Jewish kid could feel comfortable in a Catholic 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was addressed directly when Coach MacLeod was here," said Bob Gottlieb, a 
former college head coach at Jacksonville (Fla.) and Wisconsin Milwaukee, who 
moved his family to Southern California when he served as an assistant at Long 
Beach State (1981-83). 
</P>
<P>
 "Every student at Notre Dame has to take two theology courses," Doug Gottlieb 
said. "It's not like they try to convert you. I talked to the guys on the team, 
and most of them aren't Catholic. I also met Gus Ornstein and he loves the 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Gottlieb admitted that, after helping his son narrow his list of schools, 
the most important factor in the final decision is playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was important that any school recruiting Doug make a commitment 
that they not recruit another point guard in the next class," he said. "Notre 
Dame has made that commitment." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 If Doug Gottlieb commits to Notre Dame, UCLA will have its point guard list 
narrowed to three: 6-foot-1 Jason Terry of Seattle, 6-foot Brandon Loyd of 
Tulsa, Okla., and a longshot, 6-1 Stephon Marbury of Brooklyn, N.Y., the No. 1 
guard in the country. UCLA and Arizona are the favorites for Terry, considered 
by coaches and scouts to be the top point guard prospect on the West Coast. He 
also has trips planned to Washington, Northwestern and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Terry sign with the Bruins, and Marbury stays in the East (Syracuse or 
Georgia Tech are likely), Arizona will probably sign either 5-11 Arthur Lee of

 Loyd, an outstanding shooter who is also considering Oklahoma and Oklahoma 
State, among others, visited UCLA earlier this month, as did 6-3 guard Lenny 
Holly of New Mexico Junior College in Hobbs, N.M. Holly was a freshman star at 
Texas Tech three years ago before transferring. Arizona State and New Mexico 
are among the other schools in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Arizona: The Wildcats have received an oral commitment from 6-10 forward 
A.J. Bramlett of Albuquerque, N.M.

<P>
 USC Coach George Raveling was in Georgia last week for home visits with 6-9 
forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim of Marietta, one of the top players in the country, 
and 6-10 Kenyon Jones of Savannah. Duke and Georgia Tech are among the schools 
actively recruiting Abdur-Rahim. Raveling also visited the home of 6-6 
guard-forward Paul Pierce of Inglewood, perhaps the premier senior in the 
state. California Coach Todd Bozeman was in Pierce's home Sunday. Pierce also 
had home visits recently from coaches at Kansas (considered the favorite), 
UCLA, Arizona, Oregon and Nevada Las Vegas. He plans to sign in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Gottlieb, Notre Dame -- which already has a commitment from 6-5 
forward Gary Bell of Joliet, Ill. -- is expected to receive commitments this 
week from 7-foot, 295-pound Phil Hickey of Wellsboro, Pa., and 6-4 Antoni Wyche 
of Schenectady, N.Y. . . . North Carolina received an oral commitment last week 
from a top forward prospect, 6-8 Antawn Jamison of Charlotte, N.C. Jamison, 
however, has not yet qualified academically.

 Football Report: San Clemente's Brett Samperi (6-5, 275), one of the top 
offensive line prospects in Southern California, is being recruited by 
Washington, Nebraska, Colorado, Cal, Arizona State, UCLA and USC. Samperi 
attended Nebraska's summer football camp and admits he has "always liked 
Washington," but added he would prefer to sign with a school closer to home . . 
. All in the family: UCLA may be tough to beat for two of the Southland's best 
defensive back prospects, Ryan Roques (5-11, 165) of Moreno Valley Canyon 
Springs and Cerritos Gahr safety Corey Scott (6-4, 200). Roques, who has great 
speed, is the brother of UCLA freshman cornerback Aaron Roques; Scott is a 
cousin and former teammate of Bruin defensive backs Paul and Javelin Guidry. 
Besides UCLA, Scott also likes Notre Dame, Nebraska and Colorado.

 Aaron Williams (6-3, 235) of Hawthorne Leuzinger, an aggressive, run-stuffing 
linebacker, said USC is at the top of his list right now, followed (in order) 
by Notre Dame, Florida State, Colorado and Arizona. Williams said he is also 
considering UCLA and Michigan. A teammate of Williams', two-way lineman Ega Usu 
(6-5, 240), has also drawn attention from major college recruiters . . . Add 
USC: Defensive lineman Eboni Wilson (6-3, 250) of L.A. Jefferson told a friend 
recently if the Trojans didn't offer him a scholarship, he would attend the 
school anyway and join the team as a walk-on.

WORKER'S TALES; COATTAIL COMPANIES CRINGE AT DEFENSE GIANT'S PULLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE and ROSS KERBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 The scores of machine shops, parts suppliers and professional firms that fill 
acres of industrial parks in and around Orange County and feed heavily from the 
area's large manufacturing firms are bracing for a famine as Hughes Aircraft 
Co. prepares to shut its Fullerton plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of Hughes' suppliers has been overshadowed by concern for the 6,800 
workers at the 350-acre facility. Company officials say that between 800 and 
1,000 of them will be laid off and the rest will be offered transfers to other 
Hughes plants in Southern California or out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 But the suppliers -- who bend, grind and shape metal, make special tools, 
prepare engineering calculations and supply note pads to Hughes and companies 
like it -- have suffered alongside defense contractors during the industry's 
decline over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fear the Hughes plant closure, expected to be completed at the end of 
1995, will further damage their already ailing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense cutbacks that began under President Ronald Reagan and have 
continued through the George Bush and Bill Clinton years "just killed us," said 
Shayne Jennings, co-owner of Orange Tool Co. in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband employed 32 workers at their machine shop five years ago. 
But a sharp drop-off in work obtained from larger area firms, including Hughes 
and Rockwell, has slashed revenue, leading them to cut their payroll to seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a filter-down situation, it's going to affect all the processes we 
do and the orders we can get," Jennings said of the pending Hughes closing. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Heat Treating in Santa Fe Springs, which works for the 
subcontractors of defense companies, also is heavily dependent on defense 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everything produced by the defense industry needs heat treatment, which 
subjects metal to extremely high temperatures to increase its strength, said 
Continental's owner, Jim Stull. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1989, I have seen three major competitors go under," said Stull. 
Continental is down to 28 employees, from 55 four years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At A&A Tool & Die Machining in Santa Ana, managers plan to keep close watch to 
see which divisions Hughes moves and what the transfers might mean for the 
future. About 80% of A&A's annual revenue comes from sales of custom metal and 
plastic forming tools and stamps to various Hughes divisions, said Art 
Cherkezian, a vice president of the company.  
</P>
<P>
 David Wagner, national sales manager for Santa Ana-based Pioneer Circuits, 
said he worries about losing contacts he has built at the Fullerton plant over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expects to make up the business he will lose in Fullerton by 
selling more to Hughes' El Segundo plant, but is concerned that he'll miss out 
on future contracts as his old contacts from Fullerton move away. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer has been selling circuit boards to Hughes in Fullerton for the last 10 
years. Last year, Pioneer sold $250,000 worth of goods to the company -- 5% of 
total sales of about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter S. Pulizzi, president of a 27-person engineering firm in Santa Ana, said 
he is waiting for official word from Hughes about whether it will continue his 
contracts to work on a power-control system for a highway traffic project in 
Indiana. His firm, Pulizzi Engineering Inc., recently got an order for about a 
dozen prototypes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pulizzi said he is "really not sure what GM or Hughes has in mind," 
he hopes the projects he has worked on will continue despite the move from 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of Cal State Fullerton's engineering department also hopes a longtime 
relationship with Hughes won't fade away as the company abandons the site, 
located a few miles from the Cal State campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saddened. We've always considered them a high-class corporation," said 
Andy Bazar, dean of the school of engineering and computer science. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes contributes about $100,000 a year to the department in the form of 
scholarships, equipment and software, he said, and Hughes traditionally hired 
many of the 350 students the department graduates each year. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Southern California business stands to gain from the Fullerton 
shutdown: Van Nuys-based Pinkerton's Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The company now provides guards for most of Hughes' California facilities but 
has been shut out of the Fullerton plant. Unionized guards there are Hughes 
employees and have blocked the company's attempts to hire subcontractors like 
Pinkerton's. 
</P>
<P>
 But now several of the Fullerton guards say they expect to be among the 
employees laid off. "We're not transferable to other facilities . . . we're not 
optimistic," said one guard, who asked that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hughes' expands its other facilities to accept the Fullerton workers who 
are transferred, Pinkerton's is likely to be asked to supply additional 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes officials declined to comment on their plans for security services at 
other plants or on how their relationships with longtime suppliers might be 
changed by the Fullerton closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people directly related to (government) contracts, and they're 
obviously the main revenue sources for the company. Then there is everybody 
else," said Dan Reeder, a company spokesman, who said he included himself in 
the latter category.

WORKERS' TALES; THREE HUGHES VETERANS FACE UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE and HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Sechman came from a small town in Virginia, a high-school dropout who 
danced at the original Woodstock. Gary Tougas grew up in San Bernardino with a 
yen to build electronic signs and eventually became an electronics engineer. 
And Georgian Browne-Abundis, a graduate of Anaheim High School, was a longtime 
homemaker and Girl Scout troop leader before she set out to find work. 
</P>
<P>
 From nearby and afar, they and thousands of others came to Hughes Aircraft's 
complex here in the 1980s, their jobs created by the bountiful military budget 
of the Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 There were the engineers, some fresh from college or military service; the 
union production workers in search of the top-scale pay of $21 an hour; and a 
host of secretaries and other staff that supported the work of making 
ship-based radar, traffic control equipment and air defense systems. For a long 
time, this divide could be seen in the color of the company badges: green for 
the hourly, union staff and brown for the salaried employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But a week ago today, there were no distinctions when the company announced 
that the 37-year-old Fullerton campus would effectively be shut down by the end 
of 1995, marking the largest plant closure in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a circus-style tent, the plant's 6,800 workers were told that 800 to 
1,000 of them would be laid off and that the rest would be transferred to 
Hughes' buildings in El Segundo, Long Beach, San Diego and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week we all sat around and actually talked, commiserating with each 
other," said one union worker. "Now we're all in the same boat." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a vessel full of growing tension and anguish as workers wait for the 
first wave of layoff notices, expected in about five weeks. With varying skills 
and experience, some already have clues about what awaits them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the thousand or so workers represented by the Carpenters Union -- which 
has been around since the days of Howard Hughes' colossal wooden flying boat, 
the Spruce Goose -- few of its members today with less than 16 years' seniority 
can expect to survive the upcoming job cuts, according to union 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 For the engineers and others, the decision on individual transfers and layoffs 
will also be based largely on the projects they are working on. The unit that 
makes sonar display systems for ships, for example, is expected to be 
transferred mostly to Tucson. About 350 people currently work in that unit. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most others, there are no clear signs of what will happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it's going to affect us," said Eileen Derr, a secretary who has two 
daughters who work at Hughes in Fullerton. "But at this point, I don't think 
any of us know what our plans are." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the stories of three employees of the Fullerton plant, how they came 
to work for the defense giant and how they see their lives changing now that 
the college-like campus will be closed, except for two leased buildings that 
will employ just 700: The Engineer 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Tougas, 38, is in a rush. It's 5:40 p.m. and he must be home by six to 
relieve the baby-sitter. He can do it now: It takes him just 20 minutes from 
the Hughes plant to his three-bedroom home in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 But life is about to change for the technical director of the so-called 
SURTASS-LFA program, which builds sonar equipment for the U.S. Navy. His 
division is expected to be transferred to El Segundo sometime in the next 16 
months, and he with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that he will likely have a job is a comfort to Tougas. Even so, he and 
his family had moved to Yorba Linda from Ontario just two years ago so that he 
could have an improved quality of life outside of work. His two favorite 
pastimes: home improvement and spending time with his two young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great living here, because when I can get home it's still light outside 
and I can dig up the yard and put in sprinklers and I can watch movies with the 
girls," says Tougas, as he and his two daughters -- Nicole, 3, and Caitlin, 8 
months -- sit watching the animated film, "An American Tail." "Before, when we 
lived in Ontario, I would get home and Nicole would be asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tougases paid a handsome price for this family closeness. They traded in 
their $88,000 Ontario house that they bought in 1981 for a $330,000 ranch-style 
house in a neighborhood closer to Hughes, overextending himself in the process, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tougas, though, isn't bitter about what is about to happen, nor does he regret 
the 15 years that he has worked as an engineer. "I became an engineer because 
of the technology," he said, not because he is interested in the military. 
"I'll talk about sonars all night." In fact, Tougas says he and his wife named 
their youngest child Caitlin Rachel Tougas so she would have the initials CRT. 
"You know, it's just like cathode ray tube," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tougas has always been a bit of an electrical wizard. As a boy growing up in 
San Bernardino, he learned about electronics from his father, who ran a small 
business putting up electrical signs on local businesses. "Neon signs, painted 
signs, any kind really," he said of what he built as a youth. "It was very 
exciting. We got to go up in 150-foot cranes." Tougas says he also got into 
other "nerd stuff" like building circuits in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 That interest led to a master's degree in electrical engineering from Cal Poly 
Pomona, which he earned in 1979. From there, he went straight to work for 
General Dynamics in Pomona and after a few years switched to Honeywell. And in 
March, 1984, he switched again -- to Hughes in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tougas has spent the past 10 years with Hughes as one of three managers on a 
project that employs 120 engineers, and as such feels relatively secure in his 
job. But he worries for others who may be laid off or who will choose to leave 
the company because they don't want to make the longer commute and the 
lifestyle change that comes with it. That is something Tougas will understand. 
The Union Worker 
</P>
<P>
 Often in the past week, Scott Sechman's mind has turned to a day in 1976 that 
now seems foreboding. 
</P>
<P>
 Then 22, Sechman was scratching out a living in Tucson as a guitarist. But one 
day, Sechman and his band were called to play '50s music to an audience of 
engineers in the employee cafeteria. The company: Hughes Missiles in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 That gig was worth $500 to Sechman's band, but there weren't many that paid 
nearly that much, so two years later Sechman fled Tucson with his wife and 
infant daughter for Huntington Beach. And in September, 1980, Sechman was hired 
in at Hughes in Fullerton, along with about 10 others who had completed a 
nine-month training program in electronics that was funded by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Sechman, a technician who tests radar display systems, says he would love to 
return to Tucson and work for Hughes there. And in fact, Sechman's division -- 
surface ship systems -- is the one slated to go to Tucson. But Sechman has 
little hope of tagging along. 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday marked Sechman's 14th year at Hughes in Fullerton, but that is at 
least two years shy of the seniority that he will probably need to withstand 
the upcoming layoffs. "I'd be surprised if I survive 1994," says Sechman, a 
tall, lanky man with fine brown hair down to his shoulders and a goatee. 
</P>
<P>
 Sechman, now 40, says he never planned to work at Hughes for more than a few 
weeks. Sechman had marched against the Vietnam War, and he felt strange working 
for a military weapons powerhouse. What he really wanted to do was work for the 
Fender Musical Instrument Co., then in Fullerton. "That was my big dream, to 
work for a guitar manufacturer," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sechman changed his mind when he got his first paycheck from Hughes: "I 
looked at that blue piece of paper, and I thought, 'Wow! I could get one of 
these every week.' . . . I just got sucked into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sechman started at about $7 an hour, but that has since grown to $18.82 an 
hour -- a wage that has helped him to buy part of a four-plex building in 
Anaheim where he lives with his wife and their two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "What am I going to do? What can I do? Do I have transferable skills? Is 
anybody interested in transferring my skills?" Sechman says he has asked 
himself over and over in the past few days. He has no answers. 
</P>
<P>
 What Sechman knows is that he has a job today and that he can play his guitar 
and sing two to three nights a week, for the love of music and for the extra 
income, picking up $75 to $125 a night at places like the Off Campus Pub across 
the street from Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say to musicians, 'Don't give up your day job,' " Sechman says, flashing 
a smile. "But now, it seems, I can't give up my band job." The Support Staff 
</P>
<P>
 It was all an accident, says Georgian Browne-Abundis. 
</P>
<P>
 She never planned to be an executive secretary at Hughes Aircraft's 
communications division. She never planned to work in aerospace. In fact, she 
never planned on being part of the traditional work force at all. 
</P>
<P>
 For years after she got married to Ted Browne, the Anaheim High School 
graduate was committed to raising their three children: Scott, Ted and Allison. 
On top of that, she was a Girl Scout leader, Little League organizer, a 
volunteer for the Republican Party and a member of many women's clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until her children started to go off to college that she wanted to 
get back into the work force and earn a little money to send her son off to the 
University of Redlands in style. "I wanted him to go with linen sheets," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But with few skills in 1982, she sought temporary employment and ended up at 
Hughes in Fullerton as a temporary secretary. "When I got here I could not use 
a computer at all," she said. Two years later, she became a permanent Hughes 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, not only is she an executive secretary, but she is also one of Hughes' 
biggest corporate cheerleaders. Her permanent job at Hughes came along at a 
time when she needed it, she says, and the company gave her the training she 
lacked to survive in the competitive working world. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne-Abundis had worked in a few temporary office jobs in her years as a 
wife and mother. But it was mainly light secretarial work, such as answering 
phones. At Hughes she enrolled in several of the personal enrichment programs 
that are offered after hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could take classes in anything," she said, from personal investing to 
learning to run a personal computer. "Without the skills I learned here, I 
would never have become an executive secretary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the people at Hughes that kept her there, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoyed working with adults for once," Browne-Abundis said. "I had 
raised children and had worked with children as a substitute teacher and it was 
a nice change to be around adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne-Abundis said she is all the more grateful to Hughes because just a few 
weeks after she accepted the permanent job, her husband of more than 25 years 
passed away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this job I would have been without income or medical benefits," she 
said. "I would also never have been able to carry out the plans that my husband 
and I had made for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than a decade at the company, she hopes to retire a Hughes employee. 
But she said, "Nobody really knows what will happen to them." The one thing she 
believes, however, is that everything will work out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might also be an opportunity," she said. "It is written in the Bible that 
God never closes a door without opening a window."

ALASKANS EXPRESS MIXED EMOTIONS ON EXXON VERDICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH and STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Small commercial fishermen in this quiet port, among those pounded the hardest 
by the devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill, aren't throwing any parties to 
celebrate the $5-billion verdict delivered by a federal jury Friday against 
Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most felt a weary triumph, and surprise, at the size of the punitive 
damages award, no one expects that much money to ever get here. Of more 
immediate concern was the job of unloading gear from their boats as they ended 
their halibut and silver salmon seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt better that the jury judged Exxon's story and said, 'Yeah, you should 
pay, you were responsible,' " said Chris Nerison as he gazed over the 1,000 
boats in Cordova harbor during the drizzly Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 But not even the relatively optimistic Nerison, who fishes for salmon and 
herring, is not counting on anything close to $5 billion winding up in 
plaintiffs' pockets. And other fishermen doubt they will get anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," said Thea Thomas, over a cup of coffee at The Reluctant 
Fisherman Inn. She fishes commercially for salmon and herring. At least, that 
is, she fished for herring until the fish failed to show up last year, cutting 
her income by one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any upbeat mood is because we've had a pretty good year for the first time 
since the spill," she said, "not the judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas noted that the grinding pressure of poor fishing in various species, 
squeamishness over the quality of Alaskan fish -- particularly in Japan -- and 
other problems had plagued the fishing community year after year since the 
Exxon Valdez ran aground in 1989, producing the biggest oil spill in North 
American history. 
</P>
<P>
 Families broke up, people committed suicide, parents couldn't send their kids 
to college, and the town's schools and library cut back personnel and hours as 
fishermen had trouble paying boat mortgages while the litigation ground on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The banks let them go for a few years," Thomas said. "Many lost their boats 
just in the last two years. It took a while for people to go broke." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken a series of economic hits," said Margy K. Johnson, an innkeeper 
and the mayor of Cordova. "One knocks you to your knees; a series renders you 
down and out." 
</P>
<P>
 The punitive damage award -- or whatever survives Exxon's planned legal 
challenges -- will be apportioned among all plaintiffs winning claims for 
actual damages from the spill. Those include about 10,000 fishermen and at 
least 4,000 others -- from native villagers who lost subsistence harvests to 
such coastal businesses as fish hatcheries and processors. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian O'Neill, the Minneapolis lawyer who led the plaintiffs' legal team, 
estimated that fishermen will receive anywhere from $25,000 to $250,000 each in 
punitive damages, with the payouts hinging on their former production. An 
estimated $1 billion will be divided up by the 82 law firms representing 
plaintiffs in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5-billion verdict capping the third part of Exxon's trial is second in 
size in the U.S. courts only to the $10.5-billion award Pennzoil won in 1985 
from Texaco Corp. for its interference in a corporate acquisition. Moreover, 
the Exxon decision dwarfs what had been the biggest civil award in an 
environmental case -- the $470 million that Union Carbide paid because of the 
tragic chemical leak in Bhopal, India, in 1984 that killed 4,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill agreed with the skeptics in Cordova that the plaintiffs are unlikely 
to receive punitive damages anytime soon, but he expressed confidence the award 
will eventually arrive. "I guess we'll slug it out for another year or so 
before we get the appeals out of the way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel relieved that I'm not going to go down in history as the world's 
biggest loser," added O'Neill, who has worked on the case since 1989. Given the 
vast environmental disaster in this case, he asked rhetorically, "How could you 
lose to Exxon?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the first phase of the trial, which concluded in June, Exxon and Exxon 
Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood were found to have been recklessly negligent in 
connection with the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, in the second phase of the trial, jurors awarded commercial fishermen 
$287 million for actual damage to their livelihood. Exxon agreed to pay $20 
million as well to 3,500 native Alaskans as compensation for the food they 
normally would have caught in Alaskan waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's biggest expense so far, however, has been its $3.5 billion in 
cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still to come in the Exxon case are smaller trials, including what U.S. 
District Judge Russel Holland is terming the "fourth phase." The next segment 
of the case, which will be played out before a new jury, will include halibut 
fishermen, shrimp fishermen, lodge owners, helicopter leasing firms and others 
citing lost income after the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in Valdez, the petroleum town where the Exxon Valdez took on its fateful 
cargo, most workers and contractors on this end of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline 
were glad to see Prince William Sound's hard-pressed commercial fishermen win 
the judgment on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the clamor of a local rock band Saturday night in The Pipeline Club -- 
where according to court testimony Hazelwood went drinking hours before his 
tanker left port -- oil workers expressed sympathy for the fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oil field reaction is that they go along with the fishermen, that Exxon 
deserves everything they get. They're people too," said one contractor for 
Alyeska, the oil-company consortium that operates the pipeline and loading 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor, who asked not to be identified, said that one factor playing 
on the oil workers' sympathies is the comparatively low earnings of the 
fishermen. As a rule of thumb, a fishing industry worker who doesn't own a boat 
makes $30,000 a year, whereas an oil pipeline or terminal worker makes $70,000 
to $80,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all happy they got something; they haven't had anything, for years," 
said June Morgan, who was tending bar at the Club Bar, a fishermen's hangout 
near the Valdez harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Over coffee Sunday morning, Stan Stephens, who has run tour boats to the 
glaciers and islands around the sound for the past 30 years, added: "Most 
people realize what's happened to the fishing industry." 
</P>
<P>
 An Anchorage newspaper announced the verdict in a spare, bold headline: 
"$5,000,000,000." But one of many Valdez skeptics added to a copy lying in the 
Westmark Valdez lobby: "And they'll never get one red cent." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the ultimate outcome of the court battle, the five-year saga of the 
Exxon Valdez spill has had long-term implications for the U.S. oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
 After the disaster, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, a 
wide-ranging attempt to tighten oil-tanker standards for ships plying U.S. 
waters. The law required standby pollution cleanup boats and imposed tougher 
ship construction standards, along with other changes. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in the oil industry have criticized a provision that could saddle 
shippers with unlimited liability for oil spills caused by negligence or 
employee misconduct. As Friday's verdict suggests, the liabilities could be 
enormous for shippers and their insurers. Critics contend that U.S. energy 
companies, which overall have much better ships and crews than many foreign 
tanker fleets, will simply turn the shipping business over to foreign 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the spill's legacy was to close off the last big oil 
exploration area of promise in the country, the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge, near Prudhoe Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's reduced the opportunity for the industry to find major oil in the United 
States," said Eugene L. Nowak, director of the energy group for Dean Witter 
Reynolds in New York. He said that is one of the factors "why more and more oil 
companies have had to invest overseas."

INVESTOR PERELMAN STILL BENEFITS FROM '88 DEAL; THRIFTS: HE PROPOSES TO USE TAX 
BREAKS DERIVED FROM TEXAS PURCHASE TO HELP SHELTER LIKELY PROFITS FROM FIRST 
NATIONWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When federal regulators awarded a series of extraordinarily generous deals to 
private investors to take over a group of failed savings and loans in late 
1988, an outraged Congress forced the government to pare back the agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the congressional intervention, one of the biggest beneficiaries 
of the '88 deals is still reaping large rewards from the bargain he struck with 
Washington. Now he is proposing to use nearly $500 million in tax breaks 
derived from his 1988 agreement to take over a failed Texas S&L to help shelter 
the profits he is likely to generate from his takeover of one of California's 
largest thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
 New York investor Ronald Perelman and his partners have agreed to buy San 
Francisco-based First Nationwide Bank in a deal valued at $1.1 billion and 
expect to take advantage of the tax breaks they have retained from their 1988 
deal with federal regulators, according to documents filed in the First 
Nationwide acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax breaks "certainly will enhance the profitability" of the investment in 
First Nationwide, noted Gerald J. Ford, who is to become chairman of First 
Nationwide and is a Perelman partner in the acquisition. "They will be used in 
this transaction to offset earnings, and we expect to be profitable at First 
Nationwide from day one." 
</P>
<P>
 Those breaks represent about half the $992 million in total tax benefits they 
received from a December, 1988, agreement to purchase First Gibraltar Bank of 
Texas, according to the documents and interviews with Perelman aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Perelman's First Nationwide purchase has been approved by federal regulators 
and is scheduled to be completed Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The new documents, filed with federal thrift regulators, suggest that 
investors such as Perelman are continuing to benefit from the 1988 deals long 
after the deals were supposedly renegotiated by the federal government. And 
they also show how regulatory policy can have long-lasting -- and unintended -- 
consequences, congressional censure notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "People make this out like it is something sinister . . . ," said Ford, "and 
we received these benefits under the law." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Perelman's acquisition of First Gibraltar was just one of a wave of 
controversial last-minute agreements hammered out by federal regulators with 
investors at the end of 1988 to take advantage of special tax breaks scheduled 
to expire on Jan. 1, 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, then the regulatory agency trying to sell 
off the bankrupt savings and loans, was short of funds needed to dispose of the 
thrifts quickly and in a cost-efficient way. So it struck long-term deals with 
private investors that required little up-front cash from the federal 
government -- but that exacted a steep price later on. 
</P>
<P>
 The price was that investors were given what Congress later charged were 
overly generous tax breaks, plus pledges from regulators that the government 
would cover their losses and guarantee a set return on troubled real estate and 
other assets that buyers inherited. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the government agreed to allow the investors to take tax breaks 
on the losses generated from the thrifts -- even though the government was 
covering those losses. 
</P>
<P>
 That tax break was scheduled to be phased out at the end of 1988. It was 
lucrative enough to attract big investors such as Perelman, which prompted 
regulators to cut deals in haste with investors.  
</P>
<P>
 "Given the lack of options we had at the time, the lack of money, they were 
the best we could do," observed Danny Wall, a Salt Lake City consultant who was 
chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board at the time of the 1988 deals. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon press accounts of the deals' staggering costs quickly led to 
congressional outrage. In early 1989, for instance, Perelman's acquisition of 
First Gibraltar was said to have the potential to require the federal 
government to provide the thrift $5.1 billion in assistance. With the nearly $1 
billion in tax breaks, that brought the total to more than $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Perelman had invested only about $160 million in funds from his Revlon 
cosmetics empire, and First Gibraltar borrowed another $155 million in new 
capital to bring the total investment up to $315 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the First Gibraltar acquisition was complete, Perelman -- through his 
investment vehicle, MacAndrews & Forbes -- was free to use the tax breaks 
flowing from the Texas thrift to help shelter income elsewhere in his 
investment empire. Now, in fact, in addition to Revlon and his financial 
holdings, Perelman is becoming a significant presence in the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He is chairman of New World Communications Group and is involved in a wide 
range of entertainment and media activities, owning a TV production operation 
and a string of broadcast TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Conroy, a senior vice president and special counsel for MacAndrews & 
Forbes, said that the tax breaks from First Gibraltar have been used throughout 
Perelman's operations. And although the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
eventually did renegotiate the original agreement with Perelman, the firm was 
still able to keep the nearly $1 billion in tax breaks.

A HARD INVESTMENT LESSON; TMI STORY SHOWS EVEN TEACHERS NEED REMINDING ABOUT 
RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The teachers lounge at Commonwealth Elementary School in Fullerton seemed an 
unlikely place for financial wheeling and dealing. Visitors would most likely 
find teachers Louise Carmichael and Norma Elgas swapping stories about wayward 
students as they shared their brown-bag lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carmichael was all ears one afternoon in 1972 when Elgas, a popular 
sixth-grade teacher, mentioned a Newport Beach investment company with the 
motto "Teachers Helping Teachers." Elgas talked enthusiastically about Teachers 
Management & Investment Corp., a small company that was giving hundreds of 
Southern California educators access to the booming California real estate 
market for investments of as little as $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 300 school teachers across California were moonlighting as 
part-timers for TMI, using low-key but effective sales pitches. Though Elgas 
was not an official salesperson, she did not hesitate to talk about her success 
investing with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just told me about TMI like you would tell someone: 'Oh, Mervyn's has 
some real pretty T-shirts,' " Carmichael said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmichael, now 62, and her husband, Elmer, eventually invested $195,000 of 
their retirement money through real estate partnerships marketed by TMI. And, 
as California's real estate market thrived in the '70s and '80s, the 
investments paid solid dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 But as real estate prices went sour in recent years, the returns have dwindled 
-- or disappeared altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Elgas, 67, now a retiree living in the San Luis Obispo County community 
of Arroyo Grande, said she has no hope of recovering $10,000 of her funds, as 
several of her TMI investments in raw land sit stagnant with no ready buyers 
for the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmichael, also now retired, says she wonders whether the company's motto 
should have been "Teachers Using Teachers." In August, Carmichael and three 
other investors filed a civil lawsuit against TMI, alleging that the company is 
insolvent and has lost $100 million through fraud by its original and current 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Orange County Superior Court, has prompted an investigation 
by the state Department of Real Estate. TMI's owners deny any wrongdoing, 
blaming the troubled real estate market.  
</P>
<P>
 As many as 60,000 teachers invested their money in TMI properties since the 
company was founded 27 years ago, though the company says that it has only 
16,000 current investors. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, a judge may decide whether to remove control of TMI from its 
current owners and appoint a receiver who would act to preserve any remaining 
TMI assets.  
</P>
<P>
 Carmichael says she regrets her own role in steering peers toward TMI. 
"Teachers are so tired of making decisions for kids all day," she says, "so 
sometimes we want to leave other decisions up to someone else, someone we 
trust. I feel badly because I recommended TMI to a lot of teachers. I wish I'd 
kept my mouth shut." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the outcome of the investors' lawsuit against the company, the 
story of TMI offers lessons for those who might covet seemingly stunning 
returns enjoyed by friends or professional colleagues and who are prone to want 
to get in on the action themselves. It also offers yet another reminder that 
real estate is often riskier than it seems and that jumping unthinkingly on 
today's hot investment bandwagon can put investors on a road to ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, teachers had excellent reasons to talk up the company, which grew 
from an informal investing group led by Woodland Hills resident Donald J. 
Shroyer, now 73, who spent 31 years as a teacher and principal in San Fernando 
Valley elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI incorporated in 1967 with $250,000 invested by nearly 200 teachers. The 
fund took a conservative approach, buying tracts of land that could easily be 
resold and shying away from riskier properties. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two decades, it surpassed its investors' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 During the go-go 1980s when real estate was king in California, TMI had no 
trouble assembling groups of profit-seeking teachers in hotel ballrooms, where 
the company would show slides, videos and charts promoting its various real 
estate opportunities.  
</P>
<P>
 To join TMI, a teacher would pay $1,000 for each unit stake in a partnership 
that would in turn pool investors' funds to buy a real estate project -- either 
a hotel, raw land, a shopping center or agricultural parcels -- on the hope 
that the values would rise, even skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors could pick which of many partnerships they wanted to join. To keep 
the property maintained, investors would pay an additional fee of about $75 
every three months. When the land was sold, investors were to get their 
principal back plus hoped-for double-digit returns. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI hired expert accountants, lawyers and administrators to run the business, 
including real estate broker Robert W. Fitzpatrick, who became president in 
1968. It hired hundreds of teachers to sell its partnerships. About 200 still 
sell annuities and other types of retirement investments for TMI Lifeplans, a 
company affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the moonlighting teachers rang up a $60 commission on every $1,000 
partnership unit they sold, Shroyer was confident that the sales force wouldn't 
oversell: "I thought that, if you're going to be having coffee with the 
teachers the next day, you'd better not be putting them into anything bad." 
</P>
<P>
 That connection -- a company founded by teachers that employed teachers to 
sell exclusively to teachers -- was the key to the young company's growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a familial approach, though, sometimes lulls investors into a false sense 
of security, said Sanford R. Goodkin, a San Diego-based real estate consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers, God bless them, are here to educate the brains of our children and 
doctors are wonderful in healing, but they are both lousy investors," Goodkin 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the early investors who profited was Jim McDonaldof Laguna Beach, a 
professor at Saddleback Community College in Mission Viejo, who still has 
$100,000 invested with TMI. McDonald, now 60, said he reaped returns of 300% on 
two of the more than 20 partnerships he joined. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others say that the only fair way to gauge TMI's performance is to 
track how all of its various investments have performed over the years, rather 
than focus on the recent troubles of some of its partnerships. That the company 
had a successful record, in fact, was the main reason its part-time sales force 
was able to recruit so many other investors. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1980s, cracks began to appear in TMI's foundation and its 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving a 350-page complaint from former TMI employees and sales 
agents, the Department of Corporations in 1984 began a two-year investigation 
into TMI's real estate fees and travel expenses, and into accusations that 
TMI's former management made profits on land sales that should have gone 
instead to TMI investors. Officials concluded the investigation by ruling that 
there was no evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the present case, the department has turned down requests by angry 
investors to investigate the current owners of TMI, though the current 
allegations are different from those of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time as the earlier investigation, two TMI directors decided 
that they wanted to sell their 75% stake. TMI President Fitzpatrick arranged 
for Centennial Savings & Loan in Santa Rosa to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, though, the thrift was in financial trouble, and federal 
regulators took it over, along with its stake in TMI. Fitzpatrick, again 
scrambling for a buyer, turned to James R. Martin, a longtime Peat Marwick 
accountant who had been auditing TMI's books, and entrepreneur Maurice B. 
Shuman. 
</P>
<P>
 The two businessmen combined a $4-million bank loan and $3 million in cash 
from Brentwood Associates, a Los Angeles venture capital group, to buy TMI in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman and Martin said in a recent interview that because they did not think 
Fitzpatrick was in touch with the rapidly changing real estate market or 
familiar with new tax laws, they asked him to leave the company after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzpatrick declined to be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman and Martin are both accountants-turned-investment bankers who met in 
Seattle during the 1960s. The two longtime associates are experienced 
investors, having held stakes in everything from oil and gas partnerships to a 
gold mine, fishing boats, cattle and a wine importing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman once made headlines in Washington state after officials forced him to 
pay $200,000 in restitution when a funeral home company he owned was charged in 
one of the state's largest consumer fraud protection suits. Washington 
officials said Shuman had failed to abide by a state law requiring that his 
company set aside money in a trust fund for people who had prearranged 
purchases of cemetery plots. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman and Martin, despite their long history of investing, said that neither 
they, Brentwood nor the investors realized when they took over TMI that the 
California real estate market was on the brink of a precipitous decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors say that more than the real estate downturn is behind the 
company's financial woes. The four who filed suit in Orange County blame Shuman 
and Martin for their losses, saying that the owners illegally used money from 
profitable properties to prop up losers. The investors allege in their lawsuit 
that the men commingled funds and siphoned off millions of dollars of 
investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
 Maury DeWald, who is a partner with Irvine investment firm Verity Financial 
and served as volunteer chairman of the Los Angles County United Way campaign 
from 1991 to 1993, has nothing put praise for Martin and Shuman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim has always had a reputation as a resourceful, bright and knowledgeable 
guy," DeWald said of Martin. "He's advised any number of businesses in terms of 
operating and tax strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 DeWald, who has known Martin since the 1970s when both men worked for 
accounting giant Peat Marwick, said the lawsuit "strikes me as disgruntled 
investors, and you have to question how many of them there really are." 
</P>
<P>
 When Martin and Shuman bought TMI, DeWald said, "they went into it knowing 
that it was a long, tough road. . . . I think they simply wound up fighting 
fires they didn't know existed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ron Rus, the attorney representing TMI investors in their lawsuit, thinks 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners "inherited these properties seven years ago, and they have had many 
opportunities to get out of the hot spots, which they declined," he said. "But 
they continued TMI in order to collect quarterly assessments from the teachers 
and bleed the partnerships to perpetuate the scheme."

 Forget Florida or Palm Springs. The hot new retirement spot: Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Trends Journal newsletter, which tracks marketing and business 
trends, predicts the United States will eventually work out its differences 
with Fidel Castro, resulting in a lifting of the 34-year-old trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 That in turn will make Cuba not only a hot tourist destination, the newsletter 
argues, but also an attractive retirement spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aging baby boomers will see Cuba as affordable, having a warm climate and 
close to the United States," the Rhinebeck, N.Y.-based journal argues, saying 
Cuba will "be seen as an ideal winter retreat among the next flock of 
'snowbird' retirees." No Knock on Woodstock 
</P>
<P>
 The Trends Journal also says that the recent Woodstock 25th anniversary will 
indeed have some lasting effects, no doubt a disappointment to those hoping the 
hype over the event had finally ended. 
</P>
<P>
 First is "'generation blending," in which baby boom and generation X members 
"are converging in thought to form a 123-million person supersegment." 
</P>
<P>
 Another is renewed activism, which the newsletter says will be less militant 
than in the past "due to the intergenerational mass." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there will be "compassionate capitalism" as evidenced by one 
corporate sponsor at the recent Woodstock music festival letting hypothermia 
sufferers use its "climate-controlled hospitality tent" and a supermarket chain 
providing garbage bags for rain gear. Hits Man 
</P>
<P>
 Who is the most famous man in music? 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jackson? Frank Sinatra? The guy who used to be called Prince? 
</P>
<P>
 Hits magazine, the irreverent music trade publication, awarded the crown to 
unexpected name in its just-published 8th anniversary issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner: O.J. Simpson pal Robert Kardashian. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian is certainly well known, with his face frequently on the news as 
his friend faces murder charges. Although he hardly is known for his music 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian runs a company that supplies music to theaters to play between 
shows, and another that sells compact discs in vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian responds in kind with a full-page ad, featuring a picture of 
Simpson running through the snow as a halfback for the Buffalo Bills, along 
with the words "Justice for the Juice." Briefly. . .

 Neither Rick Bastrup nor Richard Ferrin ever really got Disneyland out of 
their blood. Both worked there as teens. Later, they met and formed a company, 
R & R Creative Designs Inc., while both were working as security guards at 
Disneyland Hotel. These days, they work for the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 14 years, R & R Creative has been building a reputation as "show 
designer" for some of the biggest names in theme parks, including Six Flags 
Magic Mountain, Universal Studios-Florida and MGM Grand Movieworld in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 In themed entertainment, show designers create the theme and design of rides 
and other attractions at amusement parks. Without show designers, rides like 
"Pirates of the Caribbean" would simply be a boat floating through a channel of 
water. R & R and companies like it help decide that it would be better to float 
that boat through battling pirate ships and scenes of pirates' stolen treasure, 
and down waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Bastrup, 44, admits he has been in love with theme parks since visiting 
Disneyland and Pacific Ocean Park in Santa Monica as a kid with his parents. 
The first rides he ever created were at his parents' Anaheim home -- where he 
would cart neighborhood kids around a course in a wagon while he narrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The 34-year-old Ferrin has likewise been a theme park buff since childhood and 
has made it his life's goal to build rides. Ferrin even spent his honeymoon 
carting his bride to every amusement park between Orlando, Fla. -- home of Walt 
Disney World -- and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until the two men met that their dreams became reality. Though 
they insist that all their work is collaborative, Bastrup and Ferrin clearly 
have distinct strengths that make the partnership work. 
</P>
<P>
 Bastrup writes the scripts for the rides and selects and records the music and 
sound effects. Ferrin, an artist by training, sketches the designs, creates 
logos and makes miniature models of the projects. He also has extensive 
training in the technical side of the field -- in computer design and lighting. 
Ferrin is also in charge of checking on the safety and maintenance of the 
attractions that are crucial to selling a design. 
</P>
<P>
 R & R, like many small companies, started operations in a garage. During their 
off-hours, the two avid model builders would get together to design fantasy 
rides. "We had no idea where it was going, we did it for fun," Bastrup said. 
</P>
<P>
 What began as an after-hours hobby has turned into a highly successful 
company. R & R declined to reveal its revenue, but industry watchers estimate 
that such a company would take in more than $400,000 a year. Competing 
companies said the design phase of creating an attraction usually represents 
about 10% of the total cost. So, for a $5-million ride the design group would 
receive about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, R & R has helped open eight major attractions at theme parks 
across the country. Most recently, the company opened two multimillion-dollar 
rides at MGM Grand -- the Backlot River Tour and Grand Canyon Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
 The Backlot River Tour is a riverboat ride that showcases movie special 
effects. The boat captain accidentally steers guests through movie sets where 
fictitious movies, such as "The Temple of Gloom" and "Jungle Storm," are being 
filmed. Among the special effects the rider sees are a volcanic eruption inside 
the temple and a helicopter battle scene in the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Canyon Rapids is a simulated raft ride through high canyon walls, into 
caverns in the canyon, down a creaking mine shaft and through an old Western 
town where a shootout is taking place between the marshal and a pair of 
bandits. 
</P>
<P>
 The rides at the MGM Grand are among the most high-profile projects R & R has 
completed in the past few years. But it is a water ride at a Denver water park 
that has possibly been their best work to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the first totally covered water ride in the world," said Rick Fuller, 
spokesman for Hyland Hills Waterworld, where Bastrup and Ferrin built the 
award-winning water ride "Journey to the Center of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept behind the ride is that while Hyland Hills was being built an 
underground river was discovered by construction crews. The ride proceeds 
through hot springs and swamps that are home to dozens of animated dinosaurs 
living below the water park. It won the 1993 award for best new water park ride 
from the International Assn. of Amusement Parks and Attractions, and a top 
award from the World Waterpark Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, the company has gained respect from those in the 
business. Kate Steinberg, executive vice president of Image Engineering, a 
theme park design company in Burbank, called R & R's work "very creative." Jim 
Hackett, president of Anitech Systems Inc. in Valencia, a manufacturer of theme 
park equipment, said R & R has a reputation for creating original designs that 
integrate all the necessary safety standards. "One of the reasons they are 
successful is because people trust them," said Hackett. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller at Hyland Hills said "Journey to the Center of the Earth" was well 
worth the $2 million the park paid for it. Visitors often wait in line for up 
to 90 minutes for the five-minute underground adventure, which shows clips of 
old monster movies, especially those with dinosaurs, for those waiting in line. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts said there is plenty of work for show designers, a trend that 
should continue. Additional theme parks are being built across the country -- 
Magic Mountain recently announced a water park addition in Valencia, and a 
$700-million theme park is planned at Sheraton's Desert Inn in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the large amusement parks, such as Disneyland, have in-house designers 
who conceptualize the themes of their rides. R & R is one of the few 
independents that has broken through that barrier and done work at major as 
well as minor parks, including Adventure City and Camelot in Anaheim, and 
Castle Park in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the R & R team is "taking a breather," said Bastrup, but not for 
long. As new attractions are scheduled to be built in Las Vegas and California 
during the next few years, Bastrup and Ferrin said they plan to be involved.

 * OWNERS' REFLECTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Where did you get your money to get started? 
</P>
<P>
 We hardly needed any. We both had other jobs when we started and this was a 
hobby that we did at home when we weren't working. We needed only enough money 
to buy glue and tweezers and supplies like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did you go when you needed advice? 
</P>
<P>
 One guy, Dave Bradley, who built carousels, gave us a lot of advice. We talked 
to people who had a lot of experience in the business. They helped us out by 
introducing us to other people in the business and taught us about potential 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 What was your biggest challenge? 
</P>
<P>
 This is a very different business. The most difficult thing was understanding 
how all the different parts of it come together. 
</P>
<P>
 What advice would you give to someone starting a new business? 
</P>
<P>
 Identify who your potential clients are and listen to what they want. Your 
relationship with your client is as important as the product you make. 
</P>
<P>
 Was there something you did not think of when you started your business? 
</P>
<P>
 We did not consider how important it is to please the client. We were 
designing rides that we liked, but now that it is the way we make a living it 
is really important to develop a relationship with clients. We work very 
closely with them and provide a very personal service. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose idea was it? How did you get started? 
</P>
<P>
 We had been designing some rides and we just started contacting some of the 
local amusement parks to see if there might be work for us. We started small by 
designing logos for some of the rides and also by installing music systems for 
some of the rides at parks such as Wild Rivers in Irvine. Source: R&R Creative

as a "show designer" for some of the biggest names in theme parks, including 
Six Flags Magic Mountain, Universal Studios Florida and MGM Grand Movieworld in 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Show designers create themes and story lines, write scripts for narrations and 
design the look of rides and other attractions at amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, R&R's most highly praised creation is a ride through an 
"underground" river at a Denver water park. 
</P>
<P>
 The fantasy ride, created for Hyland Hills Waterworld, was conceived with a 
story line that an ancient river was discovered by the park's construction 
crew, and the ride scene is set with swamps, hot springs and animated 
dinosaurs.

that has broken through that barrier and done work at major parks as well as 
minor ones, including Adventure City and Camelot in Anaheim and Castle Park in 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 With a number of theme parks and expansions planned across the nation, 
industry observers expect show designers to be in demand in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Flags Magic Mountain, for example, recently announced a water park 
addition in Valencia, and a $700-million theme park is planned at Sheraton's 
Desert Inn in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bastrup, 44, says he has been in love with theme parks since visiting 
Disneyland and the now-closed Pacific Ocean Park in Santa Monica as a kid with 
his parents. The first rides he ever created were at his parents' Anaheim home 
-- where he would cart neighborhood kids around a course in a wagon while he

 Business Forum: The recently formed Southern California/Arizona Region of the 
Council for Continuous Improvement will hold one in a series of regional forums 
for local businesses at 9 a.m. Thursday at the Ontario Marriott. The 
Ontario-based regional group, affiliated with the Council for Continuous 
Improvement in San Jose, was formed to accommodate a growing membership in 
Southern California and Arizona, according to CCI officials.The council, a 
national nonprofit organization, was formed in 1989 to help businesses work 
together on common problems and find ways to improve their operations. "One of 
the successes we're already seeing in the region is that through the CCI 
networking and use of our training materials, some of the members have cut 
their training costs by sharing training resources with each other," said Bill 
Nipp, regional manager for the group.

 Workers' Comp Rates: State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi is expected 
on Wednesday to announce an immediate reduction in the minimum rates paid by 
state employers for workers' compensation insurance. Garamendi has previously 
said he was considering a cut in the range of 10% to 15%.The savings are 
available, he said, because insurance companies' expenses have been slashed by 
the stagnant economy, legislative reforms and other initiatives that have 
curbed fraud and abuse in the system. Not all employers will feel the impact, 
however. Insurers will still be free to charge more than the minimum rate, so 
they are unlikely to slash rates for employers judged to be high-risk. And even 
for those whose rates are slashed, the move represents only a one-time gain. 
The state will begin dismantling its complicated rate system in January, 
scrapping the minimum rate in favor of market-set prices.

 Cold Water Thrown on Derivatives Regulation Efforts: In a letter to House 
Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D-Tex.), Undersecretary of the 
Treasury Frank Newman said that, except for certain bankruptcy law amendments 
relating to foreign exchange contracts, legislation regarding derivatives is 
not needed at this time "in light of the progress the private sector and 
financial regulators are making and the further progress we anticipate." A 
House banking subcommittee had been scheduled to vote Tuesday on a Gonzalez 
bill to regulate derivatives. However, Gonzalez decided to scrub that vote 
because of opposition from the Treasury Department and because time is running 
out in this session of Congress.

 Union Approves Lucky Stores Contract: About 1,700 warehouse employees and 
drivers overwhelmingly approved a contract Sunday that guarantees them job 
security and a raise of $1.70 an hour during the next four years.The vote ends 
the threat of a strike that would have interrupted deliveries to 235 Southland 
Lucky supermarkets. A strike set for last week had been stalled while 
negotiators worked out the new terms. About 92% of the members voted to accept 
the contract terms, but Ed J. Mireles, head of Teamsters Union Local 952 in 
Orange, would not release the numerical tally. The contract covers workers at 
warehouses in Buena Park, Fullerton and Irvine.

 Though Gene Birkeland is 72 years old, there are times when she feels out of 
place at the senior citizens apartment complex where she lives. But thanks to 
her recently acquired computer skills, Birkeland feels right at home in the 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I stride through the apartment lobby on my way to work, I pass by people 
who are barely creeping. I'm fortunate to still be able to learn and 
participate," said Birkeland, who took a job at age 43 to support two children 
on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 She developed a career in sales and eventually oversaw a chain of health food 
stores. "But the job required me to travel around to all the stores and by age 
60, driving the freeways was killing me. So I decided it was time to look for 
something in an office environment." 
</P>
<P>
 But Birkeland found that working in an office required computer skills. "And 
at first I wanted nothing to do with them," she said. "But everything I applied 
for absolutely required it." 
</P>
<P>
 Birkeland learned to do cost estimating using a computer spreadsheet program. 
Then she tackled word-processing programs and decided she liked the work. "I 
signed up with the Vicki Heston Personnel Agency in Irvine. They began sending 
me out on assignments, and I have managed to remain employed with my new 
skills," said Birkeland, who types documents for insurance companies, banks and 
law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like working as a temporary because I can move in and out of various office 
environments. I'm not stuck in one place," said Birkeland. 
</P>
<P>
 She admits that constant typing gets repetitive, but she copes with that by 
devising ways to build her typing speed. "It's a game for me sometimes to see 
if I can finish more today than the previous day," said Birkeland, who is 
currently attending computer classes four nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a firm believer in adult education. I have taken classes at Orange Coast 
College, Coastline Community College and UC Irvine since 1967. You can't sit 
still. You have to keep going," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Birkeland hopes to launch a home-based business with her word processing 
skills and eventually branch out into graphic design projects, such as sales 
brochures and flyers. "I am so grateful for these night classes. If they hadn't 
been available to me, I would never have become computer literate. I am looking 
forward to the day I can get to e-mail as well as the Internet." OCCUPATION: 
Word processor 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Typing documents such as letters, reports and legal briefs 
on computers using a variety of word processing software programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Most have at least a high school education. Some have a 
college background. Requires knowledge of personal computers and word 
processing software. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of word processors is expected to increase 9.2% 
to 12,050. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $12-$13 per hour 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Word processors are utilized in a variety of industries, creating a 
constant demand for their services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Repetitive stress injury from long periods of typing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Many word processors work for temporary agencies. Some find 
permanent positions with law firms, banks and insurance companies. Others form 
their own home-based businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "I don't know why computers intimidated me so much at first. Compared 
to typing on a standard typewriter, the computer makes everything so much 
easier." -- Gene Birkeland,word processor

TINY 'SMART CARDS' OUR WALLETS OF THE FUTURE?; CONSUMERS: BUSINESSES ARE 
TOUTING MULTIPLE-USE COMPUTERIZED CARDS THAT COULD REPLACE CASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're like most consumers, your wallet bulges with cards. You have credit 
cards, ATM cards, health insurance ID, drivers license and more. For relief, 
the nation's businesses propose you replace all this with just one card-shaped 
device that serves as loose change as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called smart card has already appeared in subways and at public 
telephones as the "electronic purse." This allows customers to pay for rides 
and calls with a prepaid card that "remembers" each transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 universities issue them to pay for photocopies, laundry machines 
and parking meters. Some cards even have calculators. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, your doctor will be able to stick your card -- embedded with a 
microchip -- into a personal computer for your medical history. In the same 
way, your smart card "checkbook" can be balanced to keep tabs on your spending 
at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the magnetic stripe on today's plastic cards, the microchip is hard to 
tamper with, guaranteeing more safety for you and your bank. Some chips may 
also respond to your voice, eliminating concerns about a lost, stolen or 
forgotten password or identification number. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smart Card Forum -- a group of about 130 businesses and government 
agencies -- is drawing up specifications to promote multiple application cards 
for use everywhere from toll gates to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "What will drive this is the consumer's desire to reduce pieces of plastic," 
Ronald Braco, director of electronic services at Chemical Bank, said at a press 
briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology has been around for 10 years and is commonly used in France, 
Germany, Japan and Singapore to pay for public phone calls. The idea has taken 
longer to catch on here, since a good and fairly inexpensive telecommunications 
system has favored the use of credit and debit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (smart card) technology is now cheaper, the capability has increased, 
there's more demand for convenience and trial results have been good 
internationally," said Braco, who is on the board of the year-old forum. "Cash 
is heavy, dirty and labor intensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Cash transactions, which account for 73.4% of all purchases in the country, 
will probably present the biggest opportunity for smart cards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mastercard International, which began putting chips into its cards in July, 
estimates Americans make more than 237 billion cash purchases totaling $600 
billion each year. It said that 84% of the purchases are for less than $20. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the New York-based company plans to unroll in 1996 its first 
credit and debit cards with a prepaid feature that will replace coins and small 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Details have not been set, but cardholders may transfer up to $50, for 
example, into an "electronic purse" in their smart card at ATMs or at a store 
or restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The cards will reduce paperwork for banks and card issuers and also cut down 
on fraud -- which cost them $1 trillion worldwide last year -- since an 
embedded microchip is harder to tamper with than magnetic strip technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Until smart cards become common currency, they will have both a chip and a 
magnetic strip, Smart Card Forum officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks can also customize services on smart cards, offering a menu of services 
similar to those that come up on ATM screens. As with credit cards, banks may 
link up with health care providers, phone companies, retailers and airlines to 
offer frequent shopping and flyer programs and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks aren't worried that prepaid cards will take away income from credit and 
debit card businesses. In fact, customers transferring money from bank accounts 
to smart cards will save banks from paying interest on the funds.

HERE'S ONE MAN'S WAY TO CUT A PROPERTY'S LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For anyone who has been carrying a hefty mortgage on property that greatly 
diminished in value during the real estate market dive, William Effros says he 
has a way that might help sellers cut their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Effros, a computer consultant, has written a book, "How to Sell Your Home in 5 
Days" (Workman Publishing, New York) that describes a method he says worked for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people if they just do this honestly, they will get the market price. 
You can't fool the market," said Effros. 
</P>
<P>
 Effros had bought a second home in Stamford, Conn., as rental investment 
property for $350,000. Months later, a real estate agent told him that he would 
be lucky to get $225,000 for the five-bedroom, three-bath home. 
</P>
<P>
 Effros took matters into his own hands. He wrote a newspaper ad describing the 
property, naming an asking price of $255,000 or "best offer." He told callers 
there would be an open house over the weekend. No bids would be taken unless 
the buyer inspected the home. The home was to be sold to the highest bidder at 
the close of the inspection Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The result exceeded his expectations. "I sold the house for $271,500," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Effros says this system works because it demonstrates the free market theory 
at its purest: The asking price is low but the sales price is driven higher by 
an unfettered market -- the market being the buyers whose bids are listed on a 
sheet for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an escape clause, too. "The strength of the system is that it has a 
safety valve built in," Effros said. "If you don't get 25 calls by Friday 
night, cancel the open house you planned for Saturday and Sunday. You've taken 
no bids at that point; you have no obligation." 
</P>
<P>
 Effros tells sellers to have their homes pre-inspected and surveyed and to 
have those reports on view at the open house.  
</P>
<P>
 When all of the bids are in, the seller then calls all of the bidders, 
beginning with the top bid and going down, giving bidders chances to raise 
their offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, realty experts point out that there is no such thing as a "simple" 
sales transaction -- especially in California, where real estate law is 
unusually complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers who want to try Effros' method might, as a safeguard, also want to 
hire either a licensed real estate agent or a lawyer -- or both -- for a flat 
fee to review purchase offers and shepherd the deal through escrow.

VIETNAM HOPES TO REFINE ITS OIL INDUSTRY; ENERGY: PETROLEUM IS THE COUNTRY'S 
BIGGEST EXPORT, BUT FOR NOW IT MUST DEPEND ON SOVIET-AGE EQUIPMENT TO DO THE 
JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Grigori Borisov used to struggle in temperatures of 40 below zero to pump oil 
from the icy tundra of Western Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he seeks refuge in an air-conditioned office to escape the heat blanketing 
the oil platform he operates in the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Borisov works for VietSovPetro, the only company producing commercial amounts 
of petroleum in Vietnam. He serves as deputy chief of Platform Four, a rusty 
monument to outdated oil technology in the Bach Ho, or White Tiger, oil field 
75 miles southeast of the southern port of Vung Tau. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam's partner in VietSovPetro, the Soviet Union, dissolved in 1991, 
forcing Hanoi to look elsewhere for funds and expertise to develop its oil 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil is Vietnam's biggest export, and the government has signed 27 contracts 
with foreign companies to explore for more. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the newcomers -- Asians, Europeans and, most recently, Americans -- 
have brought advanced drill bits and computer work stations to aid the search 
off Vietnam's southern coast. But so far, VietSovPetro's aged equipment remains 
the country's only way to get precious petrodollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Borisov's platform is one of the oldest in a cluster of 10 VietSovPetro rigs 
now producing oil at Bach Ho. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been in use for eight years already," he says. "We need to improve and 
upgrade the whole platform." 
</P>
<P>
 Rust acts like a cancer, eating through bulkheads made of poor-quality Soviet 
steel. Control room engineers read old-style pen-and-paper gauges. Rig workers 
wear sneakers instead of steel-toed boots. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you compare VietSovPetro with advanced international oil companies, we're 
just not as good," Borisov says during an interview in his cramped office 
beneath the platform's helicopter pad. 
</P>
<P>
 Borisov, a native of Western Siberia's Surgut City, says he wants to install 
new pumps and compressors made in Britain or Germany and that he hopes to learn 
from the modern techniques of Western companies such as Mobil Corp. and 
France's Total. 
</P>
<P>
 VietSovPetro is a relic of the communist ties that bound Vietnam with its 
former Soviet patron. The two formed the joint venture in 1981 to extract oil 
from a field first identified by Mobil. Ukrainians, Azerbaijanis and Russians 
such as Borisov supervise and labor alongside Vietnamese on the platforms, 
manning alternate shifts of 15 days each. 
</P>
<P>
 Platform Four started pumping oil in 1987. Its wells yield 7,700 barrels of 
oil a day, which are deposited in a tanker moored nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The platform also produces 5.8 million cubic feet of natural gas each day. 
However, VietSovPetro has no way to transport the gas to potential customers, 
so it is burned off. A natural gas flame 30 feet long burns from the tip of a 
boom jutting skyward at Platform Four. A steady supply of gas keeps the fire 
burning day and night, just as it does on Bach Ho's other rigs. 
</P>
<P>
 A gas pipeline scheduled to be completed this month connecting the offshore 
field with Vung Tau should help end the waste, says Ngo Thuong San, 
VietSovPetro general director. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also plans in November to begin producing oil at Rong, or Dragon, 
another, smaller field 12 miles to the southwest. But VietSovPetro is already 
hard-pressed to raise the $300 million it needs each year just to develop Bach 
Ho, San says. 
</P>
<P>
 When not working 12-hour shifts, the employees on Platform Four watch videos, 
play table tennis or swim in the rig's tiled pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol is forbidden, and personal touches are scarce. For the platform's 62 
men, offshore work means long stretches of life without women -- except for the 
companionship of three female housekeepers. Some of the crew seem not to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Vietnamese, 15 days is nothing," says mechanic Vu Hai Dang. "Remember, 
during the (Vietnam) War, soldiers were at the front for a lot longer than 
that."

 No Change in Auto Tariff Plans, Official Says: Australian Industry Minister 
Peter Cook said the government is sticking to plans to reduce tariffs on 
imported cars to 15% by the year 2000, according to Australian newspaper 
reports. The affirmation came in response to persistent speculation that two 
car makers -- Ford Australia and General Motors-Holden's -- are actively 
lobbying for tariffs no lower than 25%. Under the current tariff-reduction 
plan, tariffs on imported cars are being cut by 2.5 percentage points a year 
from the original 45%.

 Real Estate Irregularities Cost Country Billions, Paper Says: China's property 
market is characterized by disorderly, illegal and arbitrarily priced land 
transactions, costing the state as much as $2.3 billion annually in lost 
revenue, according to the official Economic Information Daily. The newspaper 
said some local leaders abuse their powers by approving as many as 500,000 
"hidden" land sales a year, with some property even given away free. Local 
authorities sold land use rights for more than 12,000 hectares of urban land in 
the first half of last year, but only 10% of the contracts were completed 
according to law, the paper said.

 Bankrupt Firms' Debt Rises: The total debt of bankrupt Japanese companies in 
August grew 17.9% from a year earlier to $4.94 billion, according to a private 
research company. Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Co. said businesses 
continued to suffer because of the strong yen, price competition and changes in 
consumer tastes. The number of bankruptcy cases was down 8.9% from a year 
earlier, to 1,083.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEWS; EDITOR'S NOTE: STEELY DAN, LIKE RICHARD NIXON AND 
LENTILS, SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT PEOPLE EITHER LOVE OR HATE. THE 
BAND'S FANS PRACTICALLY WORSHIP ITS SOUND AS ADVENTURESOME AND INTELLIGENT, 
WHOLLY DISTINCTIVE AND UNCOMMONLY ABSORBING, WHILE ITS CRITICS WRITE IT OFF AS 
COLD, SLICK, PRETENTIOUS, HOLLOW AT THE CORE. WHEN THE BAND CAME TO IRVINE 
MEADOWS ON FRIDAY NIGHT, WE SENT A MEMBER OF EACH CAMP WHO'D NEVER ATTENDED A 
DAN CONCERT BEFORE, TO SEE IF A LIVE PERFORMANCE MIGHT CHANGE ANYONE'S MIND. ; 
FROM BOTH SIDES NOW; CON: STEELY DAN'S 2 1/2-HOUR PERFORMANCE AT IRVINE MEADOWS 
ON FRIDAY INCLUDED LITTLE TO DISSUADE ANYONE WHO THINKS THE GROUP'S OEUVRE 
CONSISTS OF A FEW DECENT SINGLES AND A LOT OF EMPTY JAZZ-ROCK NOODLING.

 Walking into Irvine Meadows Friday night for my first-everSteely Dan concert, 
I knew I'd always been among those who didn't quite get it. 
</P>
<P>
 The band -- essentially keyboard player/singer Donald Fagen and 
guitarist/bassist Walter Becker -- had recorded individual songs I enjoyed -- 
admired, even. But I honestly couldn't figure why people like my musician 
friend Paul would, to use his word, "worship" the Dan's albums, "every one of 
'em." 
</P>
<P>
 I was far more inclined to agree with another friend who could never 
understand why "the same East Coast snobs who put down the Eagles for being 
laid-back cokeheads will worship at the altar of Becker and Fagen." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, after seeing Becker, Fagen and 11 skilled hired hands re-create the 
Steely Dan legacy for 2 1/3 hours, I still don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in a small handful of songs -- "Peg," "Deacon Blues," "Black Friday" and, 
especially, "Kid Charlemagne" -- did the signature idiosyncratic chord 
progressions say anything more to me than "Hey, get a load of this!" 
</P>
<P>
 Becker introduced one of two songs he sang from his own forthcoming album "11 
Tracks of Whack" as "a sort of neo-pseudo reggae tune." 
</P>
<P>
 If you ask me, Steely Dan built its whole career around neo-pseudo-something 
tunes. Guitarist George Wadenius' Notes R Us solos Friday crystallized the 
complexity-for-complexity's sake mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with striving to reach beyond the three-chord blues 
structure that is the foundation of most rock. David Lindley comes to mind as 
one who incorporates musical sources from as far as Turkey, Morocco and 
Madagascar, and makes it all sound organic. But Lindley's songs don't sacrifice 
heart in their quest for exotic textures. 
</P>
<P>
 Steely Dan has been tagged "soulless" by some critics. Matters of soul being 
better left to higher authorities, I'll bow out of that debate. But when it 
comes to heart, suffice to say that in Irvine, Steely Dan's beat with the 
mechanical precision of the ticker that the Tin Woodman got from the little man 
behind the curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to "Green Earrings" and "Third World Man" was a lot like watching a 
master bricklayer at work: There was no denying the skill and patience 
required, but when it was done there wasn't much to say beyond "Hey -- nice 
wall." 
</P>
<P>
 The front men epitomized East Coast cool: Fagen in his black suit, shades and 
white tennies, swaying Ray Charles-like at his electric piano; Becker playing 
guitar like a man who had stepped into a bucket of quick-dry concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 They were, as ever, emotionally detached, sardonic and, to me at least, a bit 
stiff -- which is another reason these guys never struck me as the sort anyone 
really could get passionate about. (I must admit that the detachment in the 
music vanished occasionally between songs, when Fagen proved an affable emcee.) 
</P>
<P>
 When everything did fall into place -- and for me that happened exactly once, 
with that knockout version of "Kid Charlemagne" -- the fusion of an askew 
lyrical viewpoint, a careening melody and expert musicianship made it clear 
what all the fuss is about. But only momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
 In all fairness, Friday's show may not have been the best argument for Steely 
Dan's music: An inconsistent sound mix robbed many songs of the crisp sonic 
sheen and impeccable musical balance that characterize the records. On the 
other hand, those records sound superb and still leave me cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiophile issues notwithstanding, far too often Friday night, this listener 
couldn't buy a thrill.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; JOHN TAKES LESS-TRAVELED ROAD AT POND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The surest bet in town Saturday night was that Elton John would open his 
concert at The Pond with "Your Song," the wonderfully engaging pop valentine 
that was his first American hit almost a quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And the odds were overwhelming that the singer-pianist would close with 1973's 
"Candle in the Wind," the bittersweet, Marilyn Monroe-inspired tale of 
loneliness at the top that has become the signature ballad of John and his 
songwriting partner Bernie Taupin. 
</P>
<P>
 Pity, however, the poor gambler who tried to predict much else in the 2 
1/2-hour affair -- a warm, revealing trip down some of the less-traveled stops 
on John's musical yellow brick road. 
</P>
<P>
 Going in Saturday, we knew that John was not bringing along his band on this 
acoustic tour, which continues tonight with the first of four sold-out benefit 
concerts at the Greek Theatre for the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Instead, he 
is being accompanied only by percussionist and showman extraordinaire Ray 
Cooper in a reprise of a triumphant 1979 pairing. 
</P>
<P>
 What we quickly learned after the opening "Your Song" was that John was going 
to concentrate on early album tracks -- songs that he has rarely performed live 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans were undoubtedly restless as they kept waiting for personal 
favorites in John's list of more than 50 Top 40 songs. Even they, however, must 
wonder if it is really necessary to hear "Crocodile Rock" every time the 
Englishman steps on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated at the piano in a white blazer over a red T-shirt, John served, in 
effect, as his own opening act. Playing with the energy and passion of someone 
brand-new on the pop scene, he went through more than a dozen songs during the 
concert's first hour, including such rarities as "The Greatest Discovery" and 
"Talkin' Old Soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Cooper joined him for the final 90 minutes, John initially 
continued to steer away from the expected hits. After a dramatic rendition of 
"Tonight," one of John's darkest yet most hauntingly beautiful compositions, 
the two musicians turned to such lesser-known numbers as "Idol" and the lilting 
"I Think I'm Going to Kill Myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, John showed little of the flamboyance of his early days, when 
his colorful wardrobe and stage manner were at times as liberating as his 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was Cooper who added the visual flair Saturday. From congas and 
cymbals to vibraphone, Cooper played with such dramatic facial expressions and 
gestures that even Madonna would have been upstaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching John go through this unexpected playlist in this relatively naked 
musical setting, you felt a sense of renewal on the part of both the artist and 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a valuable sense of celebration in hearing the hits again and again, 
but John gave us something more -- a chance to be touched anew by music that 
may have been missed or forgotten the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, you were reminded that John is more than simply a commercial 
hit-maker -- he's a singer, pianist and composer of exceptional range and 
talent. Over the years, both his music and Taupin's themes have evolved from 
the youthful innocence and simplicity of "Your Song" to the social 
consciousness of the AIDS-related "The Last Song." 
</P>
<P>
 And not everything was old Saturday: There were "Can You Feel the Love 
Tonight," his current hit, and a new ballad. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of the encore, John caught us off guard once again by performing 
"Crocodile Rock" after all, but with a new, slower arrangement. The song was a 
sweet acknowledgment of the value of celebration in pop music -- how even the 
slightest of tunes can stir all the good feelings associated with it over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fitting summary to a performance that was as dignified as it was 
daring. 
</P>

STAGE REVIEW; MACLAINE GETS UPFRONT, PERSONAL IN CERRITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She sings! She dances! She acts! She tells jokes! What a talent! Shirley 
MacLaine's one-woman performance for the season's opening night Friday at the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts was a nonstop, high-voltage tribute to 
the joys of versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute. Let's keep this in context. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her unstinting enthusiasm and undeniable charm, MacLaine didn't 
actually do most of the above tasks strikingly well, although some were more 
successful than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Her singing, for example, had its good and bad moments. At her best with 
sweet-toned ballads, MacLaine was considerably less appealing when she tried to 
belt out high notes that pushed her vocal skills too far beyond their limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Her dancing, except for one exuberant high-kicking, in-your-face outburst, was 
mostly all posture and movement and manner. Some of her imagery -- "Sweet 
Charity" was a good illustration -- is so well-known from movie posters that 
MacLaine only had to strike the familiar pose to generate spirited applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the youthful vigor of her early years, however, there was no 
denying her remarkable physical fluidity, the dexterity with which she made the 
difficult seem easy, and the startling pliability in every one of her limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jokes? Well, MacLaine didn't so much do jokes; she told stories while tossing 
off spontaneous-sounding lines, often with good- natured jibes at herself. 
Admiring the auditorium, she noted that she'd never worked in it before, "At 
least not in this lifetime." Describing her relationship with Tom Cruise, 
MacLaine suggested that he came to see her show, "to get an idea what his wife 
is going to look like in 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps predictably, for a former dancer who spent much of her professional 
life in films, MacLaine's trump cards were her sheer celebrity presence and her 
unflagging abilities as an actor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Always in command of the stage, always alert to -- and willing to use -- the 
audience's awareness of the details of her public persona, MacLaine made nearly 
every number into a personally oriented mini-drama. 
</P>
<P>
 An opening piece was structured around songs from Broadway musicals that are 
associated with her in one way or another. The obvious irony was that MacLaine 
had started off as a musical theater hoofer (with a much-praised substitution 
for Carol Haney in 1954's "Pajama Game"), but almost never got to sing and 
dance in pictures such as "The Apartment," "Irma La Douce" and "Two for the 
Seesaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Another number was set up by her much-publicized spiritual quests. Quietly 
offering to take the audience into her confidence, she described a trip to an 
underground city in Peru, where she met a wise old guru named Mr. Calabash. 
Remarkably, few of the listeners picked up on the slowly unfolding gag until 
she began to repeat the mantra taught to her by Mr. Calabash: "ink-a-dink-a-do, 
a-dink-a-do. . . ." It was a tale well worthy of Jimmy Durante. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the finest segments in her show involved neither dance nor jokes. The 
first was a lengthy medley of standards arranged to depict MacLaine's view of a 
woman's love life. By singing bits and pieces of songs -- usually choosing only 
the most telling lines -- MacLaine was able to fully apply her acting abilities 
to the material without having to rely too heavily on her vocal skills. 
</P>
<P>
 An equally superb segment was built around a dark, passionate rendering of 
Stephen Sondheim's "I'm Still Here." It is a song that has been reduced to 
musical meatloaf by nearly every aging cabaret chanteuse in the country, yet 
MacLaine made it into something fresh and new and prime. Again, part of its 
impact traced to the lyrics' clear associations with her own career. Equally 
important, she performed the piece with consummate dramatic subtlety, capturing 
and articulating the multilayered meanings in each of Sondheim's lines. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an appropriate climax for the evening. Far more than her hard-working 
versatility, it was the perfect summing-up of exactly what it is that Shirley 
MacLaine does so well. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLaine also appeared at Cerritos on Saturday and Sunday.

THEATER REVIEW; EAST WEST'S 'SWEENEY TODD' REALIZES POSSIBILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attend the tale of East West Players -- the 99-seat theater that took on 
"Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Stephen Sondheim's 
masterwork. It's the musical with a plot that grips like a steel trap and a 
thrilling, operatic score that embraces broad comedy, penny-dreadful gore and 
the height of human rage. Plus, it has a killer act-one finale, one of the best 
in the entire canon of American musicals.  
</P>
<P>
 Set in the grime and misery of late-19th-Century lower-class London, "Sweeney" 
tells the story of a much-wronged barber and Mrs. Lovett, the friendly neighbor 
who helpfully gives him the idea to butcher his customers and at the same time 
turn her sorry meat-pie shop into a thriving enterprise. The majority of the 
East West Players are Asian American, which necessitates a few cuts in the text 
and a change in a line about yellow hair to the oxymoronic "raven hair, like 
wheat." Other than that, it will never enter anyone's mind that East West isn't 
the little company that could. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Dang's direction is both deeply conversant with Hal Prince's seminal 1979 
staging for the huge Uris Theatre and also attuned to the possibilities of 
telling an intimate story, as Sondheim initially imagined it (the 
composer-lyricist adapted the story with book writer Hugh Wheeler from British 
playwright Christopher Bond, who took his cue from an 1847 Grand Guignol tale). 
The minimal choreography, though, is too corny for the piece.  
</P>
<P>
 On Chris Tashima's three-tiered, dark wood set, which is both simple and 
wonderfully complex, the actors move chunks of scaffolding, transforming the 
scene from a dock to a storefront to a parlor to a madhouse and more. They then 
sit down amid the scene they've created, representing the ever-present 
unemployed in a place where, as Mrs. Lovett says, "times is hard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barely obscured by a curtain, four musicians (three on keyboard, one 
percussion) handle the magnificent music with love and energy. As an ensemble, 
the cast sings well, although individual performances cobble the score 
somewhat. Orville Mendoza sings Sweeney better than he acts it, but his 
powerful build and silent seething are effective, particularly when he strikes 
a tableau, holding his razor out, like a Greek statue representing the 
archetypal attitude of revenge. As Mrs. Lovett, Freda Foh Shen acts better than 
she sings, and her unceasing cheerfulness in the face of (or possibly because 
of) all the gore is just right. In the secondary parts, there are two 
outstanding performances: Radmar Agana Jao's touching, funny Tobias, the young 
urchin whom Mrs. Lovett takes under her wing (so to speak), and Linda 
Igarashi's Johanna, a boilerplate ingenue that she makes fresh and vital. This 
is especially impressive because Paul Wong, as her lover Anthony, is hopeless. 
Deborah Nishimura is a terrific beggar woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Uneven cast notwithstanding, East West makes "Sweeney" come to life. Although 
it is a world so cruel that even songbirds are blinded because "not knowing day 
from night, they sing without stopping," it is a world infinitely worth 
knowing. This "Sweeney" sings with all its heart.

PLAYERS CRY FOUL; VOLUNTEERS ARE UPSET BY FEES OXNARD PLANS TO CHARGE AT NEW 
SOCCER FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With formidable gusto and Bermuda sod, Oxnard's soccer zealots turned a 
blighted patch of dirt and weeds at Oxnard College into a pristine field for 
Cameroon's World Cup soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders and Oxnard College trustees promised hundreds of volunteers that 
Oxnard's talented soccer leagues would be free to compete at the vaunted venue 
once the Cup was over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cameroonians went home after quickly stumbling months ago. But Oxnard's 
soccer fans are still waiting to play on the flawless, tournament-quality field 
they built. 
</P>
<P>
 City and college officials have finally devised a plan to open the field to 
the public. But a costly new catch has some ex-volunteers railing about the 
exclusive use of their labor of love: Officials plan to charge $40 to $50 an 
hour to play on the lush field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to volunteer to create these fields, something the city should have 
done, and on top of it we're being asked to pay," said Oxnard United Soccer 
Clubs President Edmundo Mendez, who shepherded the volunteer effort. "I don't 
really think that's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard contributed about 20% of the $100,000 needed to piece together the 
field. The soccer clubs and Oxnard College raised the remaining $80,000, 
college administrator Irene Pinkard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkard said she sympathizes with the soccer fans. But the field, burdensome 
and costly to maintain, has become one of the school's best-known attractions. 
The Pumas, a professional soccer team from Mexico, rented the field in July, 
bringing the school added recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I laid some sod myself," Pinkard said of the world-class field that has now 
been split in two for local use. "But I think that one has to realize that 
someone is taking care of them, watering them, cutting them. There is a lot of 
interest in the fields. We now have something the college can use for economic 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkard said the field fee would vary, depending on who wants to use them, but 
would average between $40 and $50 an hour for each. Soccer teams now pay $4 to 
$25 an hour to use city fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Robles, coach of the Necaxa adult team, said most older soccer 
enthusiasts are laborers who cannot afford to pay that kind of money. And most 
younger players come from poor families, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles did not expect overseers to charge volunteers to play, and feels 
betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never told us that they were going to charge that kind of money to play 
there," Robles said. "A lot of people worked very hard under the belief that we 
would be allowed to use those fields. The city did not have enough people to do 
that job in time." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said that Mendez and other soccer league 
representatives have attended meetings between the college and the city and 
have not complained before about the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and college still must approve the plan, and there is plenty of time 
for detractors to object, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 College trustees are set to discuss the proposal Oct. 4, and the City Council 
is expected to review the matter soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the great failings we have in the city is that recreation has suffered 
due to budget constraints," Lopez said. "This is especially true when it comes 
to soccer fields. We have a huge soccer-playing community here, and we haven't 
been as accommodating as we need to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Oxnard's soccer fans say the city's 100 soccer teams only have three 
tattered fields to play on: Del Sol Park, Colonia Park and the older facilities 
at Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-year-old Del Sol Stadium hosts so many games that teams now play 
largely on dirt. Players complain that the little grass that remains routinely 
causes ankle injuries, disrupts passing and takes away from the artistry of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, there is no turf in the center of the field, from one goal to 
another," said Ramon Diaz, president of the Ventura County Soccer League. "It's 
pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 soccer fans marched through La Colonia last month and crashed a 
meeting of the normally sleepy city Parks and Recreation Commission to protest 
a request by a semipro football team to use Del Sol Park for its home games. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission rejected the request, and the City Council on Tuesday approved 
a plan to renovate Colonia, Thompson and Del Sol parks, including re-sodding 
the soccer fields. 
</P>
<P>
 But soccer league leaders are now worried that the improvements will cut short 
their season, which starts in October. So more than ever, they say they need 
another place to play -- and the Cameroon Field, as it has become known, is 
clearly the best candidate around. 
</P>
<P>
 "The surface is perfect for soccer," Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over Cameroon Field -- and last month's march -- have served as 
reminders to city leaders that the soccer leagues are tired of being ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the best amateur teams in California come from Oxnard," Mendez said. 
"The level of play is very high. But the fields are in very bad condition. . . 
. We work hard to give these kids something to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Others also said recognition of deteriorating conditions is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're progressively playing on more and more dirt and less and less grass," 
said Richard Menken, commissioner for American Youth Soccer Organization in 
south Oxnard and Port Hueneme. "I contend the city would be better off buying a 
plot of land and having six or seven soccer fields on it. They seem more intent 
on building softball fields so they can charge adults." 
</P>
<P>
 City recreation Superintendent Karen Burnham said the city does not have the 
money for such a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 A possible alternative, Mayor Lopez said, is the two football fields used by 
the Los Angeles Raiders for six weeks each summer, but are unused the rest of 
the year.

STREET SMART: HOW TRAFFIC SIGNALS ARE TIMED IS A MATTER OF PRIORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I moved to Ventura two years ago and have been trying to understand the 
sequencing of the traffic signals ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 At many intersections, the timing doesn't seem to permit the even flow of 
traffic in any direction and the time sequence seems unusually long. 
</P>
<P>
 One intersection that seems particularly illogical is Johnson Drive and 
Telephone Road. 
</P>
<P>
 At many times during the day, all traffic at the intersection is at a stop in 
all four directions (including left-turn lanes on Telephone and all lanes on 
Johnson). 
</P>
<P>
 These lights obviously can be demand-controlled, since they sequence 
differently in the early morning and late-night hours and, it seems, on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Crosser, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same old question that comes up over and over again," traffic 
engineer Nazir Lalani says. "Why can't I have a green light when I get to an 
intersection?" 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, he says, is simple. When it comes to traffic flow, the needs of 
the individual are secondary to the greater good of moving the most traffic as 
expeditiously as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Telephone Road and Johnson Drive, that means traffic on 
Telephone, by far the busier street, is given priority over cars on Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Signals on Telephone are synchronized from Petit Avenue to Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekdays between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m., the lights operate on a 110-second 
cycle. From 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. the cycle drops to 100 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the time and on weekends, the lights operate on demand -- when 
traffic nears the intersection, it triggers a signal change. 
</P>
<P>
 At no time during any of these cycles is all traffic at a complete standstill, 
Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 On-demand signal changes would not work during peak traffic hours, he says, 
because they would cause major backups on Telephone. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm writing about the need for better traffic control at the intersection of 
Westlake Boulevard and Bridgegate Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, this intersection has gotten busier and busier with the 
development of the Lake Sherwood area. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, people trying to get to and from work and school have a very 
difficult time getting through this intersection safely. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, the Westlake-Bridgegate intersection should be a four-way 
stop. A signal would be better. 
</P>
<P>
 I've tried calling the police, who refer me to the city's traffic department, 
who refer me back to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you can help us get some action here. I have five young children and am 
concerned about their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Dietz, Westlake Village 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The city, too, is concerned about the safety of your children, along with your 
safety and that of the rest of the city's residents, assistant traffic engineer 
Jeff Knowles says. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Knowles says that after studying the Westlake-Bridgegate 
intersection, the city has determined that it does not meet state and federal 
requirements for stop signs or a signal. 
</P>
<P>
 While there may seem to you to be a lot of traffic, he says, in the larger 
scheme of things it's really not that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowles suggests comparing the amount of traffic at Bridgegate with that on 
the nearby intersection of Potrero Road and Westlake Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,200 vehicles a day pass through that intersection, which has stop 
signs on Potrero, but none on Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also stop signs on Bridgegate where it intersects with Westlake. 
About 3,500 vehicles a day pass through that intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just isn't enough traffic coming from Bridgegate to warrant more 
traffic control," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He also urges you to keep in mind that stop signs and signals sometimes 
increase the accident rate at an intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be very careful to make sure we're not just going to make things 
worse," Knowles says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In your Sept. 5 column, you mention that car-pool lanes are being added to the 
Simi Valley Freeway and that these lanes will increase the freeway capacity by 
11,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
 True. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue, however, is to reduce the number of vehicles on the freeway, 
therefore reducing air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is not necessarily to increase the number of vehicles or people, but 
to rearrange them and improve the air quality at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirck Meengs, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Right you are. 
</P>
<P>
 The $22.4-million project to add 12 miles of car-pool lanes to the Simi Valley 
Freeway is designed not only to add more space but also to get cars off the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The central concept in the (car-pool lane) program is moving more people 
rather than more cars," a Caltrans spokeswoman says. "Some (car-pool lanes) 
carry up to 50% of the people carried on the entire freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, expected to begin within the next few weeks, will stretch from 
the Golden State Freeway to just west of the Ventura County line. BRIDGE 
DEMOLITION 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, Caltrans is scheduled to shut down portions of the Santa Paula 
Freeway to tear down the old Kimball Road bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The westbound freeway will be closed from 9 p.m. today until 5 a.m. Tuesday 
between Wells Road and Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The eastbound freeway will be closed from 9 p.m. Tuesday until 5 a.m. 
Wednesday.

USE OF DNA AS TRIAL EVIDENCE IS DEBATED IN COUNTY CASE; COURTS: A JUDGE WILL 
DECIDE THIS WEEK WHETHER TO GRANT SEXUAL ASSAULT SUSPECT DENNIS FREDMAN A 
HEARING. SOME QUESTION THE SCIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years after a Ventura County judge broke new ground by allowing DNA 
evidence at a murder trial, the legal debate over "genetic fingerprinting" has 
returned to the local courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Fredman -- a 32-year-old drifter accused of five sexual assaults in Oak 
View and Ventura -- wants a judge to throw out the DNA evidence that is central 
to his prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting a trend in DNA cases across the state, including the highly visible 
O.J. Simpson prosecution, Fredman's lawyers have argued that genetic evidence 
is not admissible in California courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors are vigorously fighting Fredman's request. 
</P>
<P>
 They will not talk publicly about the Fredman motion. But in court papers, 
prosecutors have argued that the historic 1989 conviction of Lynda Axell in 
Ventura County favors admitting DNA evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Axell was convicted of murdering a man who worked at a downtown hamburger 
stand after police found strands of the defendant's long, dark hair in the 
victim's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Axell, who worked across the street from the hamburger stand, appealed her 
conviction but lost in October, 1991. From that point on, prosecutors statewide 
have used DNA evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least three cases since the Axell decision, however, California trial 
judges have agreed to keep DNA evidence out of their courtrooms. State appeals 
jurists also have thrown out DNA evidence in two cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the judges have cited concerns by some scientists who question the 
accuracy of the process used to statistically analyze DNA results. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fredman motion is based on those arguments. And acting Ventura County 
Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark said he would decide this week whether to 
grant Fredman a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredman is charged with 27 criminal counts, including sexually assaulting five 
women and girls in the Ventura area. Prosecutors say he committed the crimes in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested in 1992 for attempting to break into his girlfriend's home, 
his attorney said. Police collected saliva and blood samples and matched them 
to DNA material discovered at the scene of the sexual assaults, said Deputy 
Public Defender Gary Windom. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only evidence connecting the defendant to the crime," Windom 
said. "Without this DNA evidence, (Fredman) would have been home two years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Motions to exclude DNA evidence are becoming more popular with criminal 
defendants statewide, authorities said. Since the Axell case, prosecutors 
estimate that five dozen defendants have been granted hearings to challenge the 
admissibility of DNA evidence. But the vast majority have lost, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the O.J. Simpson case, the judge has delayed a ruling until after a jury is 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say DNA is foolproof evidence and characterize motions by Fredman, 
Simpson and others as frivolous and a waste of taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 Some prosecutors blame recent appellate court decisions that conflict with the 
Axell ruling for encouraging defendants to request the costly DNA hearings, 
which can last up to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it make any sense that almost the entire rest of the country has allowed 
the same evidence, has allowed people to be executed based on this evidence, 
and California is still stuck in denial?" said Alameda County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Rockne Harmon, a national expert on the use of DNA in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Others agree that some judges are allowing criminal defendants to exhaust 
precious judicial resources on DNA hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the admissibility of DNA evidence, it should be admitted," said 
Carol Nelson, the prosecutor who won the Axell case. To not admit it is "just 
silly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in body tissues and fluids and 
contains genetic coding unique to an individual. Through DNA analysis, 
investigators can compare a suspect's DNA pattern with the coding found in 
hair, blood, semen and other substances to show guilt or innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on the admissibility of DNA began shortly after the Axell 
conviction was upheld by the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Ventura in 
October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The first major volley came from a state appeals court in Northern California 
that dismissed the evidence in two Alameda County cases, including one tried by 
prosecutor Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1992, the California Supreme Court let that ruling stand and 
defense attorneys have been emboldened ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean that DNA evidence is not admissible forever," said William 
Thompson, a defense consultant in many high-profile DNA cases, and a UC Irvine 
law professor. "But the burden of proof is on the prosecutor to show that DNA 
is admissible." 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputes the basic notion that DNA testing can link suspects to crime 
scenes. Even someone as critical of the current method of DNA testing as 
Thompson acknowledged: "Nobody on the defense side is saying that DNA is bunk." 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers such as Windom, who represents Fredman, argue that the science has 
not yet been perfected and should be barred from deciding issues of life and 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my case, I'm going to argue that you can do things better," said Windom, 
whose small office at the Ventura County Hall of Justice is filled with books 
on genetics and biology. "I may get myself kicked all over the courtroom in the 
process, but I'm going to try. You can't convict someone on voodoo science. 
</P>
<P>
 "Admittedly," he added, "DNA is a very powerful tool if done correctly, and I 
believe it will be done correctly in the future. Presently, it has not been 
proven. They are railroading this down people's throats." 
</P>
<P>
 Windom's argument and the two appellate decisions are rooted in a little-known 
legal precedent set by a federal appeals court in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Frye Rule, it governs the admissibility of new scientific evidence. 
It has led to the exclusion of such technology as lie detector tests, attorneys 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the Frye Rule says that any new technology must have "general 
acceptance" in the scientific community as to its reliability before it can be 
used in court. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the Axell ruling, both sides of the DNA debate agree, there was 
not significant debate about the reliability of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
 But that has changed. In April, 1992, for instance, a report by a national 
committee formed to study the DNA issue found that "substantial controversy" 
surrounded one aspect of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA testing involves a three-step process. The first step is processing a 
suspect's DNA coding and the genetic evidence found at a crime. The second is 
to compare the two DNA patterns. These two steps work perfectly, both sides 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
 But the third and final step -- the calculation of how often a defendant's DNA 
code is found in society -- has prompted the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 study by the National Research Council said some scientists did not 
believe that the statistical methods used in DNA analysis were reliable. The 
critics said that statistical error could exaggerate the probability that a 
suspect committed a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine's Thompson cited a New Mexico case where the FBI estimated a 
suspect's DNA was present once in every 6.2 million people. Thompson said he 
retained an expert who used another statistical method to show that the 
suspect's DNA could be present in one in 84 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference in how you compute the statistics can make a meaningful 
difference," Thompson said. "In some cases, the difference is one in a billion 
or one in a 100 million. But if we're talking about something that gets it down 
to triple digits or double digits, that leaves some reasonable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura lawyer Willard P. Wiksell, who defended Axell, said the probability of 
suspects having a common DNA is greater in those of mixed race. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Axell case, we had an individual who had some Indian in her, she had 
some Hispanic in her, she had some white in her," Wiksell said. "It's a 
legitimate challenge. It's not just legal mumbo jumbo." 
</P>
<P>
 The NRC report reinforced points made in an article in the leading scientific 
journal, Science. 
</P>
<P>
 In that article, Richard C. Lewontin of Harvard University and Daniel L. Hartl 
of Washington University attacked the reliability of DNA statistical analysis, 
while other leading geneticists defended the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of DNA sharply criticize many of the detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call them the flat-Earth society," said former Ventura prosecutor Nelson. 
"These people have made a darn decent living saying something almost equivalent 
as the Earth is flat. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can take simple things and pretend they are complicated," added Nelson, 
who retired earlier this year, "you've got a heck of an industry going." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Harmon of Alameda County was even more caustic. "These scientists 
are saying, 'I don't think that's the right number.' And you say, 'What's the 
right number then?' They say, 'I don't know. I just don't think that this is 
the right number.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And until defense experts come up with the right number, he said, they will 
continue to lose the court battle over DNA evidence.

PLAN FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING A TOUGH SELL; VENTURA: HOMEOWNERS SAY THEY'VE HAD 
ENOUGH. THEY'RE FIGHTING A NEARBY PROJECT WITH A PETITION SIGNED BY 700 
RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ventura homeowner Bill Roderick has attended all the neighborhood meetings and 
engaged in extensive arguments with the developer, and he remains convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Build houses and apartments for poor people on nearby farmland, and he can say 
goodby to his neighborhood as he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Los Angeles area, everywhere they've put in low-income projects . . . 
the neighborhoods turn into ghettos," Roderick said one afternoon last week, 
sitting in the immaculate living room of a house in the Heather Glen 
subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the residents of Heather Glen -- a well-tended 135-house community 
northeast of Wells Road and Carlos Street -- have lived there for years. The 
first house went up in 1963, and the development was complete by 1970. The 
houses now range in price from $200,000 to $250,000, according to Sue Judd, an 
agent with Jon Douglas Co. Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1960s, mobile homes were built to the southwest, and 10 years 
later the first tenants moved into a new apartment complex to the southeast. An 
affordable-housing community is under construction to the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Saticoy-based Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. wants to build about 
140 low- and very-low-income houses and apartments between the existing 
apartments and the affordable-housing community. The new units will be targeted 
at families of four who earn $20,000 to $45,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Glen residents say they have had enough, and they are fighting back, 
armed with a petition signed by 700 residents who live within a mile of the 
proposed development. Let low-rent housing go up in someone else's back yard, 
they say -- as for Heather Glen, it has seen its share. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are what you call WAMBYs," Roderick said. "Why-Always-in-My-Back-Yard? We 
would like the council to put it in their back yard, in Ondulando, in the Keys. 
It's someone else's turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners in Heather Glen and nearby communities have landed on the front 
lines of Ventura's battle to build more housing for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police and Cabrillo officials say the homeowners' fears are largely 
unfounded, the homeowners worry that a low-income development will bring 
increased crime, snarled traffic and plummeting housing values. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the residents' objections, federal law obligates the city to 
construct a certain amount of low- and very-low-income housing, and the 
proposal by Cabrillo would make a dent in that mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 As of the first of this year, Ventura was 638 units short of the low-income 
requirement and 496 units short of the very-low-income requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear what the consequences will be if the city continues to fall 
short of these goals, city officials say. No laws exist to mete out punitive 
measures for such transgressions, but the city does risk the possibility of a 
lawsuit by civic activists, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, a portion of Ventura's 900 housing allocations downtown are 
supposed to be set aside for inexpensive housing. But council members say they 
hope to target those units for moderately priced housing to help revitalize the 
business community in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to get our low-income housing inventory up in other parts of 
the city," said Councilman Gregory L. Carson, specifying the eastern Ventura 
suburbs as one area to locate the lesser-priced units. 
</P>
<P>
 As dictated by federal law, Ventura has designated a local developer to 
receive its Housing and Urban Development Department funds and has told that 
developer, Cabrillo, to find land on which to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo executives chose 23 acres at the end of Citrus Drive and came up with 
a plan that includes a day-care center, a community center, and, tentatively, 
80 houses and 58 apartments. The housing would sell for about $100,000 to 
$120,000, and the three- and four-bedroom apartments would rent for $600 to 
$700 a month, Cabrillo officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council already has promised Cabrillo the city's 1993 HUD funds, totaling 
about $284,000, and tentatively has pledged the 1994 sum of about $345,000 
toward construction of a low- and very-low-income project somewhere in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether over the next few years, Cabrillo officials say, they hope to 
receive about $1.4 million in HUD money from Ventura, which they would leverage 
to raise the additional $23.6 million they need for the Citrus Drive project. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, if the development wins City Council approval, a step by no means 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be an uphill challenge," said Everett Millais, Ventura's 
director of community services, "because of the vociferousness of the 
opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents began organizing last spring on the eve of a meeting in which the 
council was to consider giving conceptual approval to the Cabrillo project. 
When council members realized how uneasy neighbors were about the project, they 
refrained from taking any action and ordered Cabrillo officials to meet with 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the residents and developer have held five meetings. Neither side 
emerged very happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have been rather close-minded about the whole thing," said 
Rodney Fernandez, Cabrillo's executive director. "They never opened their minds 
to negotiating this in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 The Heather Glen activists, for their part, believe the Cabrillo officials are 
underhanded and secretive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have not told us the truth from the start," said resident Julia Millsap, 
who is spearheading the petition drive and the opposition effort. "They give us 
inadequate answers or they won't answer us at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Roderick said he asked Cabrillo for addresses of its other single-family 
developments, and that Cabrillo refused to provide them. Fernandez denies the 
accusation. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the two sides cannot agree on a basic premise -- should 
the project exist at all near Heather Glen? 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors lobbying against the development believe it should not. When their 
development was approved, they never expected to end up surrounded by 
lower-priced housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo officials say they will negotiate the project's layout and its 
proportion of houses to apartment units. But they have a five-year purchase 
option on the property, and say they plan to build if the council approves the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the residents' fears concern crime, which they say is escalating in 
their once-quiet neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Anne Cormode's car was broken into three times in the past two years. 
Millsap fears the neighborhood so much that she now walks the area, even in the 
daytime, with a gadget in her hand that sounds a piercing scream at the push of 
a button. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police, however, say the neighborhood is not especially dangerous. 
"It's probably one of our higher locations for calls for service, but that's 
not to say it's a constant problem," said Lt. Steve Bowman, a spokesman for the 
Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman added that just because a development houses low-income residents does 
not mean it is a hot spot for criminals. In the 1970s, he said, homeowners near 
Petit Avenue and Telegraph Road raised a furor over a low-income housing 
project planned for that area, citing many of the same objections the Heather 
Glen residents list today. None of the concerns materialized, he said, and the 
complex remains quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are never the problem people say they will be," he said. "Property 
values never suffer dramatically and crime never rises dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 That has proved true of two other Cabrillo developments built in Fillmore and 
Ojai. Although neighbors strongly objected to both projects when they were 
proposed, police in Fillmore and Ojai say the complexes have been quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 But Heather Glen residents say they do not want to take the chance that this 
Cabrillo project will be the exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be accused of being a bunch of rednecks," homeowner Dick Harp 
said. "But there's got to be a better solution than what they are proposing."

OUTGOING MAYOR GETS AN ONGOING TESTIMONIAL; THOUSAND OAKS: ALEX FIORE'S THREE 
DECADES OF SERVICE TO THE CITY IS BEING RECOGNIZED BY THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
AT WEEKLY COUNCIL SESSIONS.

<P>
 Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore will retire this fall after 30 years on the 
City Council. And before he goes, local business people would like to clear up 
just a few tiny misconceptions about the veteran politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the notion that he's a pro-growth zealot, eager to chop down oak trees 
and pave over parks. Or the concept that he's a reckless legislator, willing to 
bend laws to appease developers. 
</P>
<P>
 In this heated election season, as candidates attack the political 
establishment that Fiore represents, the mayor's legacy is on the line. And his 
supporters want to be sure he has a fair shot at defending it. 
</P>
<P>
 So they have cooked up a program to recognize Fiore's many contributions to 
Thousand Oaks. They call it the "Fiore Moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Directors of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce will take turns preparing 
five-minute tributes to the man who did so much to shape Thousand Oaks. They 
will offer personal reminiscences, recount political battles, or simply 
describe the initiatives Fiore has championed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 They plan to present the Fiore Moment weekly, during the public comment period 
of council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the chamber's way of honoring someone who has so selflessly, so 
willingly, so gracefully and so thoroughly made Thousand Oaks such a wonderful 
place to live and work," accountant Jack Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynics -- and Fiore's political foes -- offer a slightly different take on the 
weekly praise-fest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first Fiore Moment, at last week's council meeting, Tucker described 
the mayor's longstanding support for preserving open space and protecting oak 
trees. He also mentioned that Fiore founded the Crime Prevention Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Both topics -- the environment and crime -- have become hot campaign issues, 
especially for Fiore's ardent political enemy, incumbent Councilwoman Elois 
Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah has long crusaded for slow-growth policies that would preserve more 
open space, and has voted against several developments on the grounds that they 
would pollute the Conejo Valley's air. In her campaign, she has also emphasized 
her accomplishments as chairwoman of the Crime Prevention Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's Fiore Moment seemed to establish Fiore as a leader in areas Zeanah 
considers her turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a very clever tactic for the chamber to take," former Councilwoman 
Madge L. Schaefer said. Never a Fiore fan, she added with a chuckle: "There 
would only have to be one or two Fiore Moments to cover the highlights of his 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber directors say they intend the weekly Fiore Moment as a nonpolitical 
tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chamber President Steve Rubenstein acknowledged that the continuing 
plaudits could boost Fiore's popularity -- and indirectly generate support for 
the candidates he endorses, including incumbent Judy Lazar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that we're necessarily doing this as a political statement," 
architect Gary Heathcote said. But given the rough-and-tumble campaign season, 
Heathcote added, "We recognize that certain people might want to take credit 
for things (Fiore) has done. We feel that should be corrected." 
</P>
<P>
 In politics, however, one faction's facts are another faction's fiction. Some 
see the Fiore Moment as rewriting, rather than clarifying, history. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Crime Prevention Task Force. Both Zeanah and Schaefer claim they 
originally proposed the concept, though Fiore formally established the 
committee. In any case, Zeanah said, she has always made crime a priority while 
Fiore and other council members long ignored Thousand Oaks' gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
 On the mention of Fiore's oak tree protection drive, Schaefer responded only, 
"Oh, baloney." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her concern about the facts, Zeanah praised the spirit of the Fiore 
Moment. In fact, she said, she started the concept several months ago, when she 
suggested naming the Civic Arts Plaza after Fiore during her State of the City 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything any group or individual wants to do to help make his retirement 
special to him, I support," Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Fiore said he doubted the weekly comments would influence the 
upcoming election. He had permitted the presentations, he said, only because he 
will not be running. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he says he is flabbergasted by all the attention, Fiore added, "I like 
the idea of someone coming down and actually saying something nice." 
</P>
<P>
 He showed his pleasure last Tuesday, when Tucker inaugurated the Fiore Moment 
to a smattering of applause. As Tucker was winding up his speech, mindful of 
the ticking electronic timer, Fiore called out, "You can have more than five 
minutes, if you wish." 
</P>
<P>
 That remark was vintage Alex Fiore. And the mayor continued to toss out 
wisecracks all evening, showing the quick wit that many friends have singled 
out as his defining trait. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Little League baseball coach took the podium to describe how his team 
rallied from a 5-1 deficit, for instance, Fiore grinned at his colleagues on 
the council and said, "Wow. I like to go home when I'm losing, 3-2." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a speaker's image mysteriously flashed on a 20-foot screen behind the 
council dais. "Oh, God," the speaker said in horror, looking embarrassed at his 
hulking frame magnified to giant, and menacing, proportions. "Now you know what 
you look like to us," Fiore retorted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex has a tremendous sense of humor," Councilwoman Lazar said. If she had to 
select a single Fiore Moment," Lazar added, she would choose an off-the-cuff 
remark that illustrated his wit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the first Fiore Moment didn't mention the mayor's wisecracks, the 
tribute did contain several humorous anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker recounted Fiore's first ride-along in a police patrol car, back in 
1970. Like all police cars at the time, this one lacked air conditioning -- and 
Fiore was soon sweating in heat that climbed to 120 degrees. "After that, he 
was pretty instrumental in getting funding for air conditioning in police 
cars," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker also recalled a period early in Fiore's political career when he began 
traveling frequently for his day job as a vice president at Rockwell 
International. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members would send him the council agendas to read -- and after 
weeks of mailings, Fiore figured out that each pound of paperwork represented 2 
1/2 hours worth of debate. 
</P>
<P>
 That ratio might be a lot different now, when one page of paper can clog up a 
good two hours on its own. "But that's a different story," Lazar said.

KIDS, COWBOYS STAR AT SIMI DAYS RODEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Save for the snorts of angry bulls and the whoops of rodeo lovers, the annual 
Simi Valley Days carnival ended Sunday a bit more quietly than it has in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance was down slightly from previous years, organizers said, estimating 
that 20,000 people ambled through the dusty gates between Wednesday and Sunday 
night. Last year's event drew more than 23,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher gate prices made some fans kick, but they were actually getting a 
bargain, said Mary Ann Fiore, gate chairwoman of the Simi Valley Days 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the rodeo and rodeo dance were free to anyone who paid the $5 
entrance fee, while past rodeo fans paid $3 at the gate plus $7.50 for the 
dance and up to $12 for the rodeo, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This was also the first time the Simi Valley Days committee ran the rodeo, 
which was previously managed by the Elks Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs for the five-day carnival, including rides, contests and a parade, along 
with the rodeos Saturday and Sunday, have come to about $100,000, said 
committee chairman Wes Miller. The gate prices and the new stewardship of the 
rodeo may take a little getting used to, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's breaking new ground," Miller said of the committee's role. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the crowds may have been smaller overall, they have been steady, 
said Shari Schultz, the committee's promotions chairwoman. Attendance was 
strong for special events such as Wrist Band Night on Wednesday, when $6 would 
buy a night's worth of rides. And the Rodeo Dance on Saturday packed the floor, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's parade also had the most participants ever, with 3,600 people 
marching or riding floats. 
</P>
<P>
 While the organizers tallied and figured, cowboys and cowkids twisted and 
jerked atop reluctant mounts in the rodeo ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing helmets and grim faces, would-be cowpokes ages 4 to 7 tried their 
might at "mutton-busting," clambering onto the backs of runaway sheep and 
holding on for dear life. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Holly Hall clamped both knees around her sheep's middle and dug her 
fingers into its fleece as it galloped through the ring. She slipped down its 
flank and clung to its side before hitting the dirt, then gamely brushed 
herself off and traded high fives with a clown. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came hard-core, hyphenated rodeo sports -- bull-riding, steer-wrestling, 
bronco-busting and calf-roping -- and cowboys who drove far to compete for $500 
purses. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, riders lashed themselves to 500-pound bulls and burst from the 
gate, thrashing around the ring until they were thrown. One by one, steers 
bolted out of a blue steel cattle chute, horsemen charging behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Green of Valley Springs raced after his target and leaped on its neck, 
his boot heels gouging the dirt. He twisted the steer's left horn to its right 
shoulder, pulled up on its chin and wrenched it onto its back in less than five 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, two dozen members of Animal Emancipation Inc. decried what they 
called needless cruelty, pointing to the flank straps that are cinched around 
bulls' and broncos' groins to make them buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are born and bred to buck," said rodeo operator Alan Miller of Flying U 
Rodeos. "We're not hurting them. It's a sport that's been going on for years." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's classy lookin' and it's fun, it's very stylish and graceful," said 
Justin Denton of Murrietta, who has broken his collarbone, arm, rib and ankle 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying from the gate, keeping your timing and riding eight long seconds to the 
whistle, said Denton, "is a really sweet thing."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MOMS OF TWINS SAY 2S ARE NOT SO 
TERRIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Barbara Wexler's day goes more or less like other mothers' days. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning bustle includes dressing and driving her two rambunctious toddlers 
to preschool. Afternoons are consumed by work on her home computer. 
</P>
<P>
 And evenings fly by in a tizzy of dinners, baths and bedtime stories. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a busy schedule, but not nearly as hectic as the Thousand Oaks writer's 
life was 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when she gave birth to twins Sam and Dillon. The strain of endless 
feedings, constant diaper changes and sleepless nights took its toll, Wexler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember anything from the first four months of their lives," she 
said. "Mothers of single babies, no offense, have no idea what it's like to 
handle two infants at once." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why the Conejo Valley Mothers of Multiples club was formed. At their 
monthly meetings, club members appreciate the chance to share the trial and 
tribulations of raising babies, said club historian Raylene Epling. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, Epling said, and 
members hope to find previous participants to invite to a reunion luncheon, 
planned for later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the club is open to any mother who has delivered more than one child 
at birth, nearly all of its 70 members are mothers of twins, Epling said. There 
are just three families with triplets, she said, and no members with 
quadruplets or quintuplets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how many multiples there are in the Conejo Valley," said Epling, 
who has 7-year-old identical twin daughters. "It must be something in the water 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 The mothers meet once a month at the Sunset Hills Country Club in Thousand 
Oaks to discuss issues pertinent to parents of twins. Topics range from whether 
the babies should sleep in the same crib to the pros and cons of dressing twins 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Wexler said her obstetrician recommended that she join the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have moms who have gone through what you're going through, it's 
great," Wexler said. "You don't feel so alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Club members also arrange weekly play dates and field trips for their 
children, plan potluck picnics and organize fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of the mothers in the group carried multiple fetuses after taking 
fertility drugs, Wexler said. But the rest conceived two or three babies with 
no medical intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twins run in the family," Wexler said. "And it's documented that once you hit 
35, you have a higher chance of giving birth to multiples." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that her life is back on track, Wexler can better appreciate the 
experience of rearing twins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get your sleep caught up, it's really a joy," she said. "They always 
have someone to play with, and they learn how to get along with another child 
right from the beginning. And they have this incredible bond that other 
siblings don't have." KAY SAILLANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; FREE COMPOSTING WORKSHOP PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to reduce yard waste and free up landfill space, Simi Valley officials 
will hold a free workshop Saturday to teach back-yard composting. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructors will explain a variety of methods to recycle plant material, 
including worm composting, special landscaping techniques and basic composting. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is open to any Simi Valley resident, said Joe Hreha, deputy director 
of environmental services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone -- from a college student to someone who lives in an apartment to a 
person who lives on 20 acres -- can benefit from this," Hreha said. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the program is to help the city meet a state-required 25% cut in 
waste by 1995, Hreha said. Yard waste makes up 28% of the garbage sent from 
Simi Valley to local landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Two composting workshops are held each year. 
</P>
<P>
 This event will take place from 10 a.m. to noon Saturday at Rancho Tapo 
Community Park. For more information, call 583-6874. MATTHEW MOSK

NEWS ANALYSIS; COMPROMISE WAS CLINTON'S BEST OPTION; DIPLOMACY: PRESIDENT 
ACCEPTS LOWERING U.S. GOALS TO AVOID UNPOPULAR WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton faced two unpalatable alternatives in his showdown with 
Haiti's military rulers Sunday: launch an unpopular war that he wanted 
desperately to avoid, or accept a potentially messy compromise with men he has 
denounced as tyrants and thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 As he has before in his career, Clinton chose compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 His pragmatic choice spared 20,000 U.S. troops the risk of fighting their way 
into Haiti, and spared the President the burden of explaining a war that almost 
no one wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement . . . minimizes the risks for American forces," Clinton 
emphasized, bowing to the nation's post-Cold War resistance to military 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like most compromises, it came with risks of its own: the risk that the 
deal will break down, that Haiti's wily generals will use the next four weeks 
to find a way to stay, or that U.S. troops will find themselves patrolling 
battle zones in an underground guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his aides want Haiti to be another Grenada, where the 1983 landing 
of U.S. troops produced calm within days. But they fear it could be another 
Somalia, where U.S. troops sought to bring peace but instead became targets. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why there were no broad smiles of triumph among the President and his 
advisers Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, officials seemed relieved but wary -- relieved that they were not 
sending young Americans into battle but worried about the tricky steps to come. 
</P>
<P>
 They were nervous, too, about how the deal would look, asking reporters 
whether it would look like a waffle for the President -- who last week told the 
Haitians, "Your time is up" -- to grant them, on Sunday, four more weeks of 
grace. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, Clinton and his aides are counting on the American public's 
welcoming any solution that avoids war while appearing to meet the United 
States' main policy objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, they have quietly redefined those goals downward -- dropping 
their earlier insistence that the recalcitrant Haitian military leader, Lt. 
Gen. Raoul Cedras, should move "as far away (from Haiti) as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Cedras, who wants to stay in Haiti and run for president in 1995, can at 
least test the idea, even if it proves impractical, as U.S. officials predict. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the U.S. forces that begin landing on the island today will depend 
explicitly on Cedras' cooperation for their success. One of the first tasks of 
the commander of the U.S. expeditionary force, Lt. Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton, 
will be an official call on Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, as the showdown neared, U.S. officials focused increasingly 
on making sure that the American troops' entry is orderly, not chaotic. And 
that, officials say, meant working with the generals to bring about an orderly 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goals of our Haiti policy were to achieve democracy and restore President 
Aristide," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, adding, perhaps 
prematurely, "We achieved the goals of our policy." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Christopher acknowledged, there are several steps yet to go before 
Haiti sees either democracy or Aristide, who will remain in exile in Washington 
until Cedras steps down. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. forces must land. The Haitian armed forces must quietly submit to 
their tutelage. The paramilitary thugs who have terrorized the poor of 
Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, and other towns must melt away. The 
fractious Haitian Parliament must pass an amnesty for Cedras and his chief of 
staff, Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, and Cedras and Biamby must keep their 
promise to step down by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between U.S. forces and Haitian authorities during the 
four-week transition could prove nettlesome. The agreement negotiated by former 
President Jimmy Carter states only, "The military activities of the U.S. 
Military Mission will be coordinated with the Haitian military high command." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry acknowledged some of the potential 
problems. "The risk of paramilitary or guerrilla activity has always been 
there," he said. "We believe that risk is minimized by the agreement of the 
leaders of the Haitian military to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our entry plans are not based on trust," he added. "Our protection will be 
our arms." 
</P>
<P>
 But Perry also noted that U.S. troops will not actually police the streets of 
Port-au-Prince; that job will remain in the hands of Cedras' forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the de facto government is still in charge, they will be in charge 
of the police," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That arrangement could well put U.S. forces in the odd position of exercising 
suzerainty over a country in which the remnants of a dictatorship still have 
enough guns -- and enough leeway -- to continue murdering their opponents and 
dumping bodies in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials insisted Sunday that the leaders of the Haitian junta 
had accepted that their time is over, and were willing to cooperate fully in 
exchange for the exit with dignity that Carter's agreement offered. 
</P>
<P>
 But in any case, they put such concerns firmly in second place -- after the 
primary objective of avoiding an ugly little war. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best news of the day is that we're going to do this in a permissive 
environment," Christopher said, " . . . less risk to American lives, less risk 
to our troops than would be achieved otherwise."

<P>
NO QUICK ACTION BY PARLIAMENT ON AMNESTY SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Passage of an amnesty for Haiti's military, a key part of the agreement for 
the resignation and removal of the Caribbean nation's military leaders, will be 
troubled at the very least, Haitian observers said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Any expectation of quick action by the Haitian Parliament is likely to be 
frustrated, they said, by the complexities of Haitian politics both before and 
after the ouster of democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord negotiated by President Clinton's three emissaries calls for 
Haitian military commander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, chief of staff Brig. Gen. 
Philippe Biamby and the Port-au-Prince police chief, Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph 
Francois, to give up power when an amnesty law is passed, or on Oct. 15, 
whichever comes first. Supporters of the military regime predicted Sunday that 
the matter would be pushed to the Oct. 15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans may not be in danger, but we could drive them crazy with 
frustration," said one Haitian opponent of Aristide. "It'll take the Americans 
ordering Cedras and Biamby to leave on Oct. 15, and that will prove that this 
is an occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 "This amnesty business is going to make the Americans look like fools," said 
another Haitian political source after the agreement was announced. "They think 
Aristide's return will mean democracy. It looks to me like the Americans are 
going to have to carry this thing out right to Oct. 15." 
</P>
<P>
 One problem will be that Haiti has two rival Senates. There is the Senate that 
existed before the military-led coup that ousted Aristide on Sept. 30, 1991. 
And there is the Senate that was voted in last year in an election called by 
the military's appointed puppet government, then headed by Prime Minister Marc 
Bazin. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 election was never recognized by the international community or 
accepted by Aristide or his followers. 
</P>
<P>
 But an additional complication is that Aristide, who never formed a real 
political party, did not command a majority in either house of Haiti's 
Parliament. Many of the parliamentarians who backed him when he was elected had 
already dropped their support before he was sent into exile. So it is not 
certain that there are enough votes to pass a bill that could hasten the 
restoration of Aristide's government, even with the return of those legislators 
who had fled in fear in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many legislators having fled or gone into hiding, the Parliament has 
not been able to form a quorum for most of the last two years and there has 
been no official meeting of the entire legislature this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A Haitian source close to Col. Francois said there will be little resistance 
to the American military presence, "but that does not mean there will be 
cooperation with either the Americans or Aristide." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will drive them crazy by doing what we always do -- delay, refuse to 
cooperate and even lie. Aristide is still supported by the people, but not by 
the elite or the military and not by the government work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you (Americans) going to do? Make government workers go to work? And 
what if Aristide tries to fire a bunch of them?" 
</P>
<P>
 This source laughed when told that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
called the Haitian judicial system "a sound legal structure" that could deal 
with people suspected of crimes and human rights violations not covered by an 
amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in good times, it didn't work," the source said. "The idea that it will 
be able to deal with disputes, particularly if Aristide does try to prosecute 
anyone, is both funny and horrifying." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the agreement to remove the military leaders left 
unspecified the fate of Haiti's 7,000-man army. U.S. policy regarding the army 
has varied over the last three years; at times, officials have said that it 
would have to be completely dismantled, but at others, they have called for it 
to be left intact but retrained.

NIGHT STALKER VICTIM WINS LONG BATTLE TO LIVE AGAIN; CRIME: SHOT IN THE HEAD 
NINE YEARS AGO, A MAN SLOWLY RECOVERS FROM BRAIN DAMAGE. BUT MUCH IS LOST 
FOREVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunshot wounds mark Bill Carns' forehead and neck. His arm rests in a sling. 
His left leg is strapped in a brace. A bullet remains lodged in his skull. "At 
first," he says, "I would tell people I fell off a bicycle, because I didn't 
want to get into it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, now, I can tell people I was the final victim of this guy called the 
Night Stalker." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California has had nine years to get over the summer when it lived in 
fear, when the man the newspapers called the Night Stalker crept in unlocked 
windows and doors after dark and murdered and raped and robbed at random. 
Richard Ramirez, who expressed his allegiance to Satan, was eventually 
convicted of killing 13 and committing 30 other felonies on his way to Death 
Row. 
</P>
<P>
 For those nine years, Carns, 38, has been in and out of hospitals, 
rehabilitative therapy programs and group homes, reassembling his life, 
relearning the basics and coping with short-term memory loss that can sometimes 
leave him frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 But this month he finished the last of the programs. Now living in his home 
state of North Dakota, Carns putters in his garden, tackles crossword puzzles 
and volunteers at a local radio station where he reads the news for the 
visually impaired. Having a job, he says, was a requisite for being discharged 
from his rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can take care of myself," he said. "I have my own house with an automatic 
ice maker. Have you ever tried to get ice out of an ice tray with one hand?" 
</P>
<P>
 Carns' re-entry into the world of mainstream living is a story of personal 
triumph -- an inspiring postscript to a crime spree that for one uneasy summer 
held a region in its grip. 
</P>
<P>
 Carns has no memory of what happened to him that hot August night in Mission 
Viejo. But it is a chilling story, told and retold. It was 1985. For five 
months, the Night Stalker had terrorized Southern California residents with his 
random nocturnal killings. 
</P>
<P>
 As the murder spree continued unchecked, the manhunt intensified, the public 
became more frantic, and news of the Night Stalker spread nationwide. But 
living in south Orange County, Bill Carns felt pretty secure. "Don't worry, 
Mom," he told his mother one day when she called him long distance and asked 
about the killings. "He's up in L.A., miles away from Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 25, the one night when Carns should have heeded his mother's advice, 
the heat was unbearable and he left the living room window open. For Ramirez, 
it was an invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in black, he entered the house through the window and crept into the 
bedroom where Carns and his girlfriend were sleeping. He pumped three bullets 
into Carns, then bound his girlfriend with neckties, beat and raped her. He 
dragged her around the house by her hair looking for valuables and forced her 
at gunpoint to say she loved Satan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the couple lived through the ordeal, the Night Stalker had forever 
altered their lives in a terrifying 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Carns, once an active outdoorsman, was left partially paralyzed, unable to use 
the left side of his body. He suffered significant brain damage, losing his 
short-term memory. The injuries ended his career as a computer engineer, and 
not long after, he and his girlfriend -- the woman he had planned to marry -- 
broke up, both unable to handle the aftermath of the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the crime sent a chill through Orange County, where 
residents like Carns had, until then, considered the Night Stalker mostly a 
distant threat. Carns and his girlfriend became the stalker's 21st and 22nd 
victims -- and as it turns out, the final ones. An alert teen-ager on his 
bicycle got part of Ramirez's license plate number, and on Aug. 31, he was 
arrested. In 1989, he was convicted of 13 murders and other charges and 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 It took years of specialized treatment at more than six hospitals around the 
country for Carns to retrain his once-sharp brain and muscular body. His 
short-term memory has been replaced by a pocket notebook and a small tape 
recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 But he still calls himself lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be so independent and now it's slowly coming back," he said. "The 
use of my left hand is coming back. I can even make a fist." 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers when the computer company granted his wish and transferred him to 
Mission Viejo. He and his girlfriend left North Dakota, bought a fixer-upper 
house on Chrisanta Drive in February, 1985, and completed renovations that 
summer. Carns remembers nothing from the shooting, only that he found himself 
in a hospital room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up and wondered what in the world happened -- I knew I was in 
trouble," he said. In the mirror, he saw a man with a shaved head and a hole 
almost the size of a golf ball above his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Carns' younger sister, Kathy, said she will never forget the first time she 
saw her brother in the hospital. "I was seeing this muscular guy lying there 
with tubes and wires and machines," she said. "At first it was a touch-and-go 
situation. We waited for seven days before we knew whether he would live or 
die." 
</P>
<P>
 Carns was in a coma. When he regained consciousness, doctors told him what had 
happened. One bullet in his neck, another lodged at the base of his skull that 
remains there today because it was too risky to remove. A third bullet went in 
through one cheek and out the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I was in total denial and disbelief. I thought, 'What did I do to 
deserve this?,' he said. "I thought it was like a cold or flu and would go away 
-- but it didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, Carns was in and out of rehabilitation homes, each one 
specializing in different areas of treatment for people with severe head 
injuries. He was filled with anger, he said, because he was an average, 
law-abiding citizen and couldn't understand why he had been victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 His doctors advised him to channel his anger into getting better. In addition 
to countless therapy sessions, he had to take mood-altering drugs that he said 
sometimes took him on an emotional roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an awful experience," he said. "One minute I was higher than a kite, 
the next minute I was so low I would be reading a newspaper article about a boy 
getting hit by a car and I would cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "When your brain is injured, you have to retrain it. I had to learn how to 
walk again, tie my shoes, cook with one hand." 
</P>
<P>
 His journey to recovery began at Saddleback Memorial Hospital in Laguna Hills, 
where he was a patient for five months. Then he was admitted to a hospital in 
Long Beach, where he endured intense, daily eight-hour sessions for mobility, 
speech therapy and memory training. 
</P>
<P>
 Next he was moved to a hospital in Texas for behavior modification work. And 
finally, to three different group homes and adult learning centers in the 
Midwest to learn how to live on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Carns' medical bills escalated to tens of thousands of dollars. Members of the 
community in Mission Viejo, from restaurants to schools, held fund-raisers to 
defray his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, months before the attack, his dad had encouraged him to sign up 
for his company's disability insurance program, telling his son, "you never 
know what could happen." Carns said he now lives off that disability insurance, 
which pays him about $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Carns moved back to North Dakota to start life anew near his 
two sisters and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was shot, his hobbies were electronics, whittling and tinkering with 
cars. Now he concentrates on his love for music. He rebuilds amplifiers and 
speakers with help from his brother-in-law. Sometimes he goes to clubs and 
listens to bands. Bowling is his latest passion. Recently, he joined an adult 
bowling league for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 His sister said that although his rehabilitation is completed, he still needs 
someone to take care of his finances, help him do laundry and other household 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill has always been my guardian. Now the tables are turned," Kathy said. 
"I'm with him every day. Sometimes it's like taking care of a child." 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle to remember is ongoing. He has good days and bad days when it 
seems like he has regressed and he forgets what day or time it is. In telephone 
conversations, he has to write down the caller's name as a reminder. He has a 
talking message machine on his refrigerator. A blinking red light signals him 
that he has something to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little tape recorder," said Carns, who never leaves the house without 
a pocket notebook. "You push a button and it will say, 'Bill, remember to buy 
milk.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Everyday he has to take potassium supplements, anti-depressants and medication 
to help him replace the functions that were lost when his brain was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 But his progress exceeds what doctors predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has come so far in the last nine years, beyond what doctors told our 
family," Kathy said. "It's really incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first year, his girlfriend took care of him: She drove him to the 
doctor, fed him, bathed him. But the strain of the attack and its permanent 
physical and mental effects on both of them were overwhelming, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second year after the attack, he and his girlfriend, whom he still 
calls his "sweetheart," went their separate ways, hoping to put their lives 
back together. "She nursed me until she couldn't handle it," Carns said. "She 
decided we both needed to do our own thing because she took care of me and 
became more like a mother than a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was awful. I cried and cried. It took a year to get over (the breakup)." 
</P>
<P>
 Now living in Northern California, the former girlfriend said in an interview 
that, although she loved him, the pain and burden of caring for Carns were 
unbearable. She has moved away, but still occasionally talks to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first full year, I was sure I could care for him for the rest of my 
life. He's the greatest guy I've ever met," she said, her voice breaking with 
emotion. "I still miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 She was there when Carns took his first step after the injury. She had to 
teach him how to shower and dress. She had to watch him constantly. "I have 
emotional scars, but Bill has mental and physical scars," she said. "A head 
injury is devastating. I tried for two years to be able to hang in there, but 
he's a different person." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two have moved away, they are not forgotten in Mission Viejo. 
Roger Bradshaw and his wife, Sandy, who lived across the street, were close to 
the young couple. Bradshaw remembers Carns as very intelligent, friendly and 
outgoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a good couple," he said. "Everybody was in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 With the attack, the neighborhood changed overnight, becoming the focus of the 
state's collective fear. Its quiet, tree-lined streets were jammed with 
looky-loos, police and television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents rushed to install security systems and deadbolts. "It put a pall 
over everything; you didn't know who you could trust," Bradshaw said. "My wife 
was a basket case." 
</P>
<P>
 Fear escalated to a near-panic stage until Ramirez was captured Aug. 31, six 
days after his Mission Viejo attack, by a group of angry citizens in East Los 
Angeles. "There was a collective sigh of relief," said Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Carns' girlfriend testified for five hours at Ramirez's trial in Los Angeles. 
On Sept. 20, 1989, Ramirez was found guilty on 43 counts: 13 murders and 30 
felonies including burglary, sodomy and rape. On Nov. 7 of that year he was 
sentenced to die in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to be there to flip the switch," Carns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because his girlfriend didn't want to testify twice and because Ramirez was 
already sentenced to death in Los Angeles, prosecutors never brought him to 
trial in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Carns says he has put it all behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful that I'm still here," he said. "I look at other handicapped 
people and am glad I can walk and talk. I'm taking one step at a time."

COLUMN ONE; JOURNEY HOME FOR A BRIDE; MEN LIKE HENRY PHUOC PHAM OF GARDEN GROVE 
ARE RETURNING TO VIETNAM TO FIND TRADITIONAL WIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The wedding was held one sunny day last spring on a wooden porch bedecked with 
blinking Christmas lights. Barefoot village children lined the street and 
watched with quiet curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 The bride looked bewildered as she stared into the small crowd of 
well-wishers. The mustachioed groom, debonair in a white suit with a red bow 
tie, stole a couple of furtive glances at his new spouse, then looked away 
uncomfortably when she continued to gaze ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Phuoc Pham and Vo Ngoc Dai were understandably edgy; they had just met 
10 days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have every right to be nervous, and I am too because they haven't known 
each other very long," the groom's mother, Tran Thi Kim, confided to a guest at 
the wedding held in this rural district about 130 miles southwest of Ho Chi 
Minh City, formerly Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I am also happy that my son is finally starting a family and that he 
found a wife so soon on this trip home." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham had traveled from Garden Grove to Vietnam to look for a wife. He had 
spent much of his savings on the trip and had been introduced to three women 
who, sight unseen, wanted to marry him. But none had appealed to him and he was 
about to head back when he met Dai. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had girlfriends in America, but it all just didn't work out," Pham, 34, 
said. "I thought I'd come home to Vietnam where I could meet someone 
compatible. And I wanted to make my mother happy. She had been worried for a 
long time because the last of her three sons was still single and had no wife 
and children." 
</P>
<P>
 In the five years since travel resumed between Vietnam and the United States, 
Vietnamese Americans have been steadily returning to visit their homeland. Many 
are men hoping to find a mate. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration lawyers and travel agents in Orange County, home to the largest 
Vietnamese community outside of Southeast Asia, estimate that 20 to 25 men 
return each month looking for wives. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many -- and complicated -- reasons that Viet kieu, or "overseas 
Vietnamese" as expatriates are called here, seek wives in Vietnam. Most are 
rooted in the Asian values and traditions in which they were raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Some men say they want a "traditional Vietnamese wife," one who places the 
happiness and comfort of her parents, husband and children above all else. Such 
a spouse, they say, would have to be raised in Vietnam and not influenced by 
Western attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some men who say they have not assimilated into the American culture believe 
they cannot meet some Vietnamese American women's expectations about education 
and income. 
</P>
<P>
 Other men say the 9-to-5 pace of the Western lifestyle is too hectic and 
hampers their ability to meet people. In Vietnam, they are more at ease meeting 
and flirting with women. 
</P>
<P>
 "For these expatriates who are ready to settle down, the main reason they come 
here to seek wives is because it is the easiest course for them, " said Phan 
An, a professor of ethnology at the Institute of Social Sciences in Ho Chi Minh 
City. "They feel it is easier to find a woman who is raised to value her family 
. . . and who does not -- and this is probably the most important reason -- 
find the man's reason for doing this comical or offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many Vietnamese women who are raised in America probably do not and cannot 
relate to these reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese American experience is relatively new; the community started 
making its home in the United States in 1975 after the fall of Saigon. However, 
the practice of emigres turning to their homelands for spouses dates to 
America's birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was it popular with Asian American groups such as the Chinese, 
Japanese and Koreans, but European Americans such as the Germans, Scandinavians 
and British also have looked homeward, says Marion Goldman, an associate 
professor of sociology at the University of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, Cornish miners would return to their English villages to 
look for wives, she says, because the single women in America's mining towns 
were not considered suitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these men were concerned with respectability," said Goldman, who in 
1981 published a book called "Gold Diggers and Silver Miners: Prostitution and 
Social Life on the Comstock Lode." "In the 19th Century," she adds, "having a 
trustworthy wife partly meant marrying a religious woman . . . and a woman who 
had not had relationships with other men." 
</P>
<P>
 An says most Vietnamese Americans who seek wives back home want to maintain a 
connection to their que cha, dat to, or land of their fathers, earth of their 
ancestors. When a man yearns for "a traditional Vietnamese wife," An said, "it 
is not so much for one who cooks his rice, cleans the house and watches after 
the children -- although that is a part of it -- as it is someone who will 
strengthen his memory, his mentality of the land he left behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Women who marry Americans also benefit. Many see the union as their ticket out 
of the Communist country and a visa to a better life. Even if a wife decides to 
remain in Vietnam -- which is not uncommon -- marriage to a Viet kieu means her 
standard of living will improve dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-year-old "Anh" was excited at the prospect of being interviewed for 
this story, but also nervous that she might say something wrong, something that 
would offend her husband, "Nguyen," who is in the process of sponsoring her 
move to the United States. In an interview at her home in Ho Chi Minh City, Anh 
insisted that neither she, nor her husband who lives in Southern California, be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 A relative introduced Anh to Nguyen, who is more than 10 years her senior. The 
first time they met in early 1992, Nguyen told Anh she was pretty. He also told 
her he wanted a wife, but he was leaving that week. Perhaps she would consider 
marrying him? He would probably be back within a year. He would write and call 
her in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 The two got married after 10 months and lots of letters and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I be bothered that he came home to look for someone to be his 
wife?" Anh asked, clearly puzzled at the question. "A lot of Vietnamese men do 
that, we all know that. All of us would like to get married, and it is nice 
when we have a chance to marry someone who could bring us to America." 
</P>
<P>
 The young woman wants to come to the United States. "It's not poor like 
Vietnam is," said Anh, a street vendor who gives her parents the money she 
earns selling noodle soup. "My husband will take care of me there; I won't have 
to work as hard and worry if my family will have enough food for the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Hung Joseph Vu, a 42-year-old real estate agent from Midway City, had worried 
that Vietnamese women would only be attracted to him because of his American 
money and Viet kieu status. Ma My Van, the 23-year-old he met in a dance club, 
dispelled his fears when she told him she didn't want to immigrate to the 
United States and leave her parents. They were married in March, and Vu divides 
time between the countries on three-month tourist visas. 
</P>
<P>
 Vu once was married to a Vietnamese American. He blames the breakup of that 
10-year marriage on cultural differences. If his ex-wife had not been raised in 
the United States, he says, their marriage would not have ended in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Vu says the beginning of the end of their relationship came about three years 
ago when his real estate office wasn't making money. His then-wife wanted him 
to change professions; he didn't. She suggested she get a job; he scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted me to just settle for flipping hamburgers, pumping gas," Vu said. 
"She wanted to start working, and not stay home with me. That wasn't the 
supportive wife I married." 
</P>
<P>
 After the breakup, Vu dated extensively. He vowed that when he remarried, his 
new wife would have been raised in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 1992 visit, Vu found Van. He courted her -- via letters -- for 18 
months after he returned to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Vu is pleased that Van wants to remain in Vietnam with her parents; it is "a 
proof," he said, of her love for him and not his ability to bring her to 
America. His new wife's decision also ensures "she won't be changed by American 
ways," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Western feminists may find such statements jarring. But Emily Honig, a 
professor of women's studies and history at UC Santa Cruz, says that what may 
be offensive to American women is considered normal to some women from other 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so patronizing to say that I find this practice deplorable or 
insulting," said Honig, whose research focuses on 20th-Century Chinese women 
but who also teaches about women in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we should understand is that even if some of these men are looking for a 
traditional wife -- whatever traditional may mean to them -- the women, by 
marrying these men to go to a better life, are by no means the passive victims 
we're assuming that they are. They actually come up as quite calculating . . . 
in that they are manipulating the situations that actually promote their own 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the planning and cultural support that goes into these marriages, 
the relationships sometimes fall apart when they hit U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Husband and wife frequently get disillusioned because they realize all is not 
what they thought it would be," said Mai Cong, who chairs the Vietnamese 
Community of Orange County Inc., a refugee service center. 
</P>
<P>
 Some men become disappointed and angry when their "traditional" wives adapt to 
the progressive ways of their new country. "The women will want to get jobs, 
maybe go back to school to better themselves," Cong said. "If the husband is 
insecure, he will try to prevent her from doing so. No happy endings here if 
there is no compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, it is the women who become disenchanted. 
</P>
<P>
 In impoverished Vietnam where stories about the richness of America abound, 
people sometimes dream unrealistically of what their new life will be like. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman who this year joined her husband in the United States wrote home of 
her rude awakening. Her story was mirthfully reported in Cong An , a government 
newspaper in Ho Chi Minh City. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the newspaper, a man from California had typed " danh ca ," 
meaning "fisherman," on an immigration form requiring a job description. 
Because his typewriter had no accent marks -- which can give the same 
Vietnamese word different meanings -- his wife believed she had married a 
singer. The husband never corrected her misconception. On her arrival in 
California, she wrote home bemoaning the unglamorous fate of a fisherman's 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The impersonal, not to mention unromantic, idea of Vietnamese American men 
leaving the United States in search of a spouse may raise some eyebrows. But 
the practice is perfectly legal, immigration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The new couple must use records, letters and other material to prove to the 
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service that their relationship is 
long-term and legitimate. Given the red tape, it takes nine months to three 
years before a spouse can come to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this stringent process, fraud can occur. In both Orange County and 
Vietnam, stories are told about Viet kieu men who are paid to marry or become 
engaged, just to bring women to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Vietnamese community leaders talk about one man who arrived 
to meet his bride at Los Angeles International Airport with a dozen red roses 
only to watch her blithely wave goodby before she left with friends for San 
Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 How many of these Viet kieu marriages will succeed? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too soon to tell because people have only been doing this in the past 
five or so years," Mai Cong said. "But marriages of convenience are nothing new 
in our culture, and they have worked for centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 "Time has changed and life here in the U.S. is different, so no doubt people 
will change as well," Cong added. "Many things can go wrong, but if people are 
willing to take the chance, why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are risks," said Henry Phuoc Pham, the groom from Garden Grove. 
"But many of my friends have done it and it works for them." 
</P>
<P>
 After years of bachelorhood, Pham was ready to settle down. Vo Ngoc Dai 
wouldn't talk about why she married a man she barely knew. But her relatives 
said she did it to please her mother, who wanted her youngest daughter to have 
a comfortable life far away from a thatched hut in a Vietnamese village. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear the couple recount the prelude to their wedding, it almost seems 
romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham had gone to Dai's tailor hut to have a suit made. He noticed the 
seamstress's demure smile and eyes that wouldn't quite meet his as she shyly 
took his measurements. 
</P>
<P>
 After he picked up the suit the next day, the manicurist casually told Dai 
that he was looking for a wife. When he returned on the third day -- his slacks 
were a tad too big and needed hemming -- Pham stuttered out a proposal. Dai 
said she had to ask her mother first. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a week, the two were married. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not as fast and hurried as it sounds," said Dai, 24, several days 
after the wedding. "We talked extensively for a couple of hours each of those 
days, so we did have an opportunity to get to know each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The mothers of the bride and groom are concerned about the brevity of the 
courtship, but each says she is pleased with the match and with the way her 
child would benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can now rest easy when my son goes back to the U.S.," said Tran Thi Kim, 
72, who lives in Ho Chi Minh City. "My son will have a wife who will take care 
of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Huynh Thi Le, 58, said her daughter "knows how lucky she is to have this 
chance to go to America. But (Pham) is also blessed because he has a wife who 
was brought up to cherish the family." 
</P>
<P>
 "The marriage is a good one and has all of our blessings," Le added. "Bride 
and groom both get everything that they want."

DEAL WAS RACE AGAINST CLOCK FOR U.S. ENVOYS; NEGOTIATIONS: THREATENED INVASION 
WAS PUT IN MOTION. WORD OF LAUNCHING MOVED CEDRAS TO YIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dusk was gathering in Port-au-Prince as retired Gen. Colin L. Powell picked up 
the secure telephone line kept open for the U.S. negotiating team from the 
Haitian military headquarters to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end of the line, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Powell's successor 
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sounded an urgent warning in his 
Polish accent: Wrap this thing up and get out of there. This operation is on a 
very tight schedule, and it is not going to wait, Shalikashvili said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, four hours earlier, at about 1 p.m. in Washington, Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry had walked into the Oval Office with a message from the 
Pentagon command center: If the invasion was to take place Sunday night, as 
scheduled, the paratroopers who were to be its spearhead had to start loading 
into their planes at Ft. Bragg, N.C. President Clinton, uncertain if Powell, 
former President Jimmy Carter and Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) would be able to get a 
deal, decided not to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pack 'em," he told Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hours after that decision, as the afternoon wore on with no agreement 
in sight, tensions rose, both on the ground in Port-au-Prince, where followers 
of the military government were surrounding the site of the talks, and in the 
Oval Office, where Clinton and his advisers were growing increasingly concerned 
both that the talks would break down and that Carter's determination to "grind 
it out," as one senior official put it, could put the delegation in harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it was only a breach of military security that saved the day. 
Shortly after 5 p.m., as Haitian military leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and 
Carter held yet another round of inconclusive talks, Cedras' second-in-command, 
Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, burst into the room holding a cellular phone to his 
ear: "We have word they're on the way," he said. In just over an hour, Carter 
was on the phone to Clinton to tell him a deal had been sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how the Haitians came to know the invasion had been launched remains 
unclear. At the White House, some officials speculated that the Haitians may 
have had spotters near Ft. Bragg who saw the 61 planes take off. Others, 
knowing that television networks had pictures of the planes that they had 
agreed to keep off the air, believe one of the networks let word slip. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the news had a dramatic and decisive effect on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of inconclusive negotiations, Cedras and Biamby had finally 
agreed to the one point that had hung up the deal for the entire day -- a date 
by which they would cede power. Until then, the Haitian leaders stubbornly had 
insisted they would leave only after the Haitian Parliament had passed a new 
law granting them and their followers amnesty for human rights violations. 
Clinton had made clear to Carter and his colleagues that such language would be 
unacceptable, fearing the generals could use their power to intimidate the 
Parliament into not voting on the law and thereby stalling the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the sticking point," a senior Administration official said. "We 
needed that date certain." 
</P>
<P>
 The day had begun inauspiciously. Early in the morning, Clinton held a meeting 
with National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, Perry and 
Shalikashvili. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had talked with Carter in the wee hours of Sunday morning, after 
Carter had completed a late-night meeting with Cedras. The message from that 
meeting had not been reassuring. There were "glimmers" of hope, an official 
close to the talks said, but little more. That morning, Clinton had talked with 
Powell as well. He, too, had offered few reassurances. 
</P>
<P>
 Closeted in the Oval Office, Clinton and his advisers reviewed plans for the 
invasion they expected to have to launch that night. The President departed 
shortly thereafter, heading to the nearby Foundry United Methodist Church to 
attend Sunday services. Even there, however, the possibility of a war to come 
was not far distant. 
</P>
<P>
 As the President bowed his head, the church's pastor, the Rev. J. Philip 
Wogaman, asked the congregants to join him in prayer for the oppressed and 
hungry people of Haiti, for America's troops and for Clinton as he confronted 
"the awesome and sometimes very lonely responsibilities of leadership and 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 For Clinton, aides say, the prospect of military action had become very real. 
"We were not at all sure if the negotiations would work. He didn't know. But he 
didn't want to be deterred," an official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Carter was insisting on letting the negotiations go as late 
as possible, ever hopeful that, somehow, something would happen at the last 
minute to make the Haitians yield. 
</P>
<P>
 As the afternoon wore on, the tension became unbearable to some. Lake and 
William H. Gray III, Clinton's special envoy to Haiti, both developed agonizing 
toothaches. Lake rushed to the dentist in the middle of the afternoon. Gray 
stayed behind, preparing to brief exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide on the lack of progress in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the breakthrough. As Haitian resistance began to crumble, Powell was 
once again on the telephone to Washington, urging that the Administration take 
the deal. Some of Clinton's advisers were concerned -- much of the agreement 
was vague. The pledge that the Haitian generals would resign, for example, did 
not even mention their names, referring only to "certain military officers of 
the Haitian armed forces." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry, Powell argued, according to a senior official present in the Oval 
Office for the discussions. "Let's not get too hung up on the refinements of 
this. Once you've got 15,000 troops down here, the dynamics of this place are 
going to change dramatically," the official recalls Powell saying. "That's your 
assurance." 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have spent the next three days going back and forth. We needed to 
get to closure," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of this was face-saving, things to allow these guys (the generals) to 
save face," the official noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was inclined to agree, but, characteristically, he wanted to take one 
final look before signing off. At roughly 7 p.m., Carter called to say the deal 
was in place. But Clinton, a senior aide said, wanted to "walk it around the 
room one more time" to make sure no one had missed anything. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Embassy officials rushed to fax a copy of the one-page document, signed 
by Carter and Emile Jonassaint, Haiti's military-installed president, to the 
White House. An aide was summoned to ensure that the French and Creole 
translations matched the English. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:45, Clinton gave his assent. The planes were recalled.

PATIENCE AND FAITH PAY OFF FOR CARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Jimmy Carter was ushered into early retirement by the 
American voters because they saw him as ineffective at home and weak abroad, 
but he has shown again this weekend that he retains two surpassing virtues: a 
preternatural patience and an unshakable faith in his fellow man. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks led by Carter to arrange for three Haitian junta leaders to leave 
power dragged on for many hours beyond their informal deadline of early 
afternoon Sunday, at least in part because of the former president's 
unwillingness to take "no" for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 In this instance, Carter had an even more persuasive hole card -- the 
launching of invasion troops. The breakthrough in negotiations came after the 
Haitian military chief, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, and his fellow junta members 
were informed that American paratroopers were airborne and on the way to their 
drop zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's doggedness in pursuing a bloodless conclusion to the Haitian standoff 
came as no surprise to those who have endured previous negotiations with him. 
Several recalled the marathon Camp David talks that created the breakthrough 
peace accord between Israel and Egypt in 1978 as an example of Carter's 
endurance in the face of apparently insurmountable odds. 
</P>
<P>
 His fellow U.S. negotiators in Haiti -- retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, the 
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Georgia Democratic Sen. Sam 
Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee -- brought other skills 
to the lengthy talks in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell is a man of imposing accomplishment, rising from the son of Jamaican 
immigrants of African descent in the South Bronx to the nation's highest 
military office. Cedras and his cohorts could not fail to get Powell's blunt 
warning: that the American military was prepared to violently depose them very 
soon unless they stepped down peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nunn, while cautious in the extreme in public, is known as a difficult foe 
in private negotiations. He enters talks with his bottom line firmly fixed 
before him and seldom leaves without achieving it. President Clinton saw that 
side of Nunn, to his embarrassment, in his losing battle with him over gays in 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Carter's imperturbability in the face of Cedras' demands that kept 
the talks alive Sunday long after the Haitian leaders were supposed to have 
accepted exile or the U.S. attack irreversibly under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing again President Carter's single-mindedness and persistence, as 
he demonstrated at Camp David," said William B. Quandt, who handled Middle East 
issues on the National Security Council during the Carter Administration. "What 
came through there and elsewhere is that he is someone who believes there are 
solutions to problems, and men and women of goodwill can find solutions if they 
work hard at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an article of faith with him. He also has an aversion to the use of 
force; he would always rather find other ways to solve problems. That hasn't 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Camp David dragged on for 13 days before Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin 
and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat announced their historic accord ending three 
decades of war. There were numerous occasions during the tense discussions when 
the game looked lost and the participants were ready to pack up and go home. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carter essentially kept them under house arrest at the Maryland 
presidential retreat, insisting that they keep talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, when the deal was on the verge of unraveling, Carter undertook a 
series of visits to Jerusalem and Cairo to put the agreement back on track, 
refusing to return to Washington until he had nailed down the final details. 
</P>
<P>
 Again in June, Carter refused to accept defeat in talks with North Korean 
President Kim Il Sung over Pyongyang's nuclear weapon program. Although many in 
the Clinton Administration contend that Carter exceeded his negotiating 
instructions from Washington and was duped by the late North Korean leader, his 
tenacity and desire to find a solution eventually found a face-saving formula 
that at least temporarily defused the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Powell, a longtime aide and confidant of the general's said Sunday that 
the nation's former top soldier carried with him not only decades of military 
service but years of diplomatic experience, gained during his tenure as 
military aide to former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, as national 
security adviser in the Ronald Reagan Administration and as chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He met with countless heads of state, presidents and prime ministers as well 
as defense and foreign ministers. He has incredible experience at this level," 
the Powell associate said. 
</P>
<P>
 "More importantly, he brings credibility, a most important commodity when 
you're dealing with stakes this high. He knows the strength and will and 
commitment of the (U.S.) force and he can speak to it with authority," the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that Powell's ethnic background added an important element. 
Cedras must have found it easier to talk to another man of Caribbean-African 
descent rather than face a roomful of white men from Washington, the Powell 
aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn, President Clinton's third emissary to the Haitian leaders, avoids 
histrionics in negotiations, whether with congressional adversaries or 
presidents of either party, said a senior Senate official who has watched him 
operate for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn's emphasis is always on the outcome, not on the process, and he makes a 
fetish of knowing his brief in intimate detail, the Senate official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are 40 points, he will know every one of them and will know at any 
given minute exactly where they are on each and every one," added the official. 
"He knows the bottom line and understands how to get there -- or how to get up 
and walk away." 
</P>
<P>
 The official pointed to Nunn's success in numerous negotiations with 
Republican and Democratic presidents, on issues ranging from gays in the 
military to the interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Nunn used 
his knowledge of the fine points of the problem and his unswerving dedication 
to reaching his bottom line to ultimately prevail.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CAMPAIGN JOURNAL; FOR REPUBLICAN FAITHFUL: SAME PLACE, 
SAME HOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When California Republicans gathered this past weekend at the Town and Country 
Hotel on Interstate 8, the venerable, sprawling resort complex looked much as 
it did when it was the venue for a similar meeting 24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 11, 1970, Republicans were riding high. Richard Nixon was in the 
White House. Ronald Reagan was governor of California and a virtual shoo-in for 
reelection. Two future governors, George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson, were 
rising moderate politicians in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other well-liked moderates, Bob Monagan and Howard Way, were speaker of 
the Assembly and president pro tem of the state Senate. The old movie hoofer 
George Murphy was one of California's two U.S. senators. 
</P>
<P>
 On that Saturday -- sunny and balmy as usual -- Vice President Spiro T. Agnew 
came to town to address the convention, which in effect was a giant pep rally 
to inspire the political foot soldiers for the crucial stretch drive of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The silver-haired Agnew gave a snarly little speech best remembered for one of 
his barbed alliterative gems: He lashed the media and the eastern liberal 
elitists as "nattering nabobs of negativism." 
</P>
<P>
 But the real message of Agnew's oration was a stern warning that the Nixon 
White House, on a zealous crusade against crime and civil dissent, would not 
tolerate any candidate who asked for, or accepted, support from "radical 
elements." 
</P>
<P>
 The great question to be decided that Nov. 3, Agnew said in his droning 
speaking style, was whether the nation would be led by a popularly elected 
President or "will we be intimidated and blackmailed . . . by a disruptive 
radical and militant minority, the pampered proteges of the radical liberals in 
the U.S. Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Agnew was not just railing at Democrats. He also meant any moderate Republican 
who dared criticize the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 California Republicans expected a resounding victory that year -- and probably 
should have -- thus building on the watershed gains of 1966 that brought Reagan 
to office and ended the political career of Democratic Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) 
Brown Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 But they did not foresee the dampening effect in California of a nationwide 
loss brought about in part by the negative style of the Nixon-Agnew campaign. 
Across the country, it was a debacle. Democrats swept scores of congressional 
seats and governorships. Many of the victims were GOP moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not quite so bad in California. Reagan did win, but he defeated the 
onetime "Big Daddy" speaker of the Assembly, Jesse M. Unruh, by only 500,000 
votes, half his margin of victory over Brown. Murphy lost the Senate seat to 
Democrat John V. Tunney. Democrats won back control of the Legislature. Reagan 
subsequently allowed himself to be cornered into a legislative redistricting 
plan that resulted in 20 years of uninterrupted Democratic control, to this 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, Nixon and Agnew were both gone from the scene in disgrace. 
Reagan opted not to run for a third term. The Republican mantle in California 
fell to state Controller Houston I. Flournoy, another of the moderate GOP 
"Young Turks" in the Legislature who had hewed a fine line between the 
conservative Reagan and Democrats in the Legislature to continue the tradition 
of moderate-progressive programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1974 campaign matched Flournoy against Democrat Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr., the secretary of state. Brown won. The aspirations of a generation of 
bright, problem-solving GOP moderates in California were virtually eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 There were many reasons for the Democratic resurgence in California. Watergate 
was a major one. But the seeds were planted in the 1970 campaigning of Nixon 
and Agnew, and its effect on California. 
</P>
<P>
 National midterm elections are often referred to as "off-year" elections. The 
euphoria of a President's first two years in office has begun to pale. The 
warts begin to show. Traditionally, first-term Presidents lose support in 
Congress in these elections as members who were swept into office on his 
coattails fail to win reelection, even if he has done a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this phenomenon Nixon and Agnew were trying to counteract in 1970 with 
a negative campaign that sought to crack down on both crime and civil dissent. 
In 1974, Watergate greatly amplified the expectable GOP losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The term off-year implies that these elections are not as critical as those in 
presidential election years. Nationally, they are not. But in California, the 
off-year elections are big ones. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the governorship, all other statewide offices and most of the 
Legislature. The conventional wisdom of political analysts has been that 
California is so big and so independent of national politics that the Golden 
State is largely immune from national political trends. 
</P>
<P>
 That is something of a jingoistic fallacy, though, as state Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown, the current Democratic gubernatorial nominee, may be finding out. 
National trends do count. And in the 1990s, they can shift rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans meeting at the Town and Country this past weekend bubbled with the 
anticipation that anti-Clinton sentiment will sweep them back into office in a 
big way, bigger perhaps than in any year since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a dramatic contrast with the 1992 convention. By September two years 
ago, George Bush -- never very popular in California -- had all but conceded 
the state to Democrat Bill Clinton. California Republicans knew that. What 
mattered to them was the effect on the state ticket of the absence of a 
vigorous GOP presidential effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact was dramatic. Behind Clinton, Democrats won both U.S. Senate seats. 
They thwarted GOP hopes of significant gains in the Legislature and 
congressional delegation under the favorable redistricting plan hammered out by 
Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the trend appears to be sharply reversed. Wilson's popularity has 
rebounded dramatically from the dreary budget battles of 1991. Clinton's is 
heading downward. GOP hopes are soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was going to come to Los Angeles on Sunday to help Brown raise 1.5 
million badly needed campaign dollars at one of those big, glitzy California 
fund-raising events. He had to cancel because of the Haiti crisis, sending 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson hopes he comes back, because he'd love to tie Kathleen Brown to Bill 
Clinton whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch on Saturday, an unusually perky Wilson joked: "In fact, if he will 
come before the election, then I will pay for his air fare." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's fortunes do not rest entirely with Clinton's. But the 
"nationalization" of the California election, as the GOP strategists are 
calling it, could cost her the margin of victory in a close contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Footnote: For the first time in years, crime was not an issue of hot debate at 
this convention. Republicans are confident they have won the battle with tough 
sentencing laws pushed to election-year passage by Wilson's get-tough rhetoric. 
He has done what Nixon and Agnew failed to do in 1970.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / NEWS ANALYSIS; GOP SPOTLIGHT FALLS ON WILSON, NOT 
HUFFINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington has already done what many thought 
was impossible by forcing one of the Democrats' most formidable incumbents into 
a tough fight for her political life. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he is a big reason for the high hopes of Republicans who gathered 
this weekend at their semiannual convention with visions of a GOP tide that 
might sweep out Sen. Dianne Feinstein, keep Gov. Pete Wilson in the Statehouse 
and make President Clinton's job in 1996 much tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not Huffington who won the hearts of convention delegates as the 
man responsible for their possible good fortune. Instead, the show belonged to 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor was symbolically hoisted onto GOP shoulders and hailed as the 
Democrats' conqueror. Huffington's reception was more like a warm handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must make it difficult for Huffington to comprehend how they cannot 
perceive him as being a hero," said Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). 
"This man is doing what they hoped in their wildest dreams somebody would do. . 
. . You would think the Republicans would roll out the red carpet for him." 
</P>
<P>
 But like the rest of California, the Republican Party is still getting to know 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Times poll found that more than half of the state's voters don't know 
much about the freshman congressman from Santa Barbara. And Republican Party 
delegates have not had a chance to learn much more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a negative value judgment, it's just a matter of how long they've 
known him," said one Huffington supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day Republican convention, which drew about 1,500 delegates from 
throughout the state, ended Sunday with a notably uneventful close. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention was held to cheer on the party's candidates and inspire its 
activists. The delegates heard pumped- up speeches from two of the party's 1996 
presidential prospects, Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) on Saturday night and Sen. 
Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every now and then your party gets the opportunity to make a real 
difference," Dole told the delegates. "This time is ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Party officials worked behind the scenes to avoid any controversial 
resolutions Sunday that might distract from their candidates. As a result, the 
convention quietly adjourned well before noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The unity was a good sign for Huffington, indicating that in his first 
statewide race he can count on official GOP support. As Wilson knows, 
convention-goers are usually not shy about staging embarrassing protests when 
they are unhappy with their own party's candidates, even if it sometimes 
jeopardizes election chances. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a possibility for Huffington because he shares many of the moderate 
positions on social issues that have provoked demonstrations against Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike Wilson, Huffington has defused some of the potential problems by 
reaching out to conservatives, meeting with their leaders, hiring several key 
people for his campaign staff and speaking at their functions. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP regulars said the party's relationship with Huffington is characterized 
more by a lack of understanding and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is still trying to develop an emotional attachment," said Steve Frank, a 
conservative party official from Los Angeles who supports Huffington's 
campaign. "He does not have the background with the grass roots and that takes 
time to develop." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican Party apparatus is also traditionally more interested in a 
governor's campaign than a U.S. Senate race. The membership is more 
Sacramento-savvy in its personalities and its issues -- and governors have a 
more direct impact on California life than a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 But Senate candidates do run at the top of the state's ticket and, when they 
push the right buttons, they can inspire an enthusiastic following. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, however, has not pushed a lot of those buttons, said political 
analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. In this election, those buttons are crime and 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington voted for the crime bill that passed in Washington recently -- a 
popular vote for most state voters, but the bill was opposed by many Republican 
activists, who believe that the legislation contained too many social programs. 
Party officials seeking not to embarrass Huffington successfully scuttled a 
resolution in which the party would have condemned the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 On immigration, Huffington has yet to take a position on Proposition 187, 
which would deny most public benefits to illegal immigrants. Wilson endorsed 
the measure in his convention speech Saturday, sparking one of his biggest 
applause lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (delegates) are thinking about ideology and about issues," Jeffe said. 
"You're not talking about pragmatics here." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also comes to the party through an untraditional route. By relying 
largely on his own money to pay for his campaign -- so far, at least $10.5 
million -- he has not needed party officials in the same way that most 
standard-bearers have. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Dole joked about Huffington's wealth, saying, "I've said in 
jest, you go to his fund-raisers and he gives you money." 
</P>
<P>
 And there are some Republicans who are still suspicious of Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 He boasts in speeches that he is an independent outsider and, as proof, he 
notes that he has been willing to stand up to powerful influences, including 
his own party. He tells the story that he defied Republican leaders such as 
Wilson and Vice President Dan Quayle in 1992 when they asked him not to run for 
Congress against a fellow Republican. Huffington ended up unseating a veteran 
GOP incumbent in the most expensive House race in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has done a very good job of availing himself to the party," said 
Steve Brody, vice president of the California Republican Assembly, the state's 
largest grass-roots conservative organization. "I just don't know if they're 
ready to embrace him. People are still unsure of him."

HOMEOWNERS GROUPS A LOVE-HATE AFFAIR; COMMUNITIES: IN INCREASING NUMBERS, 
ASSOCIATIONS ARE FORMING TO HELP DEAL WITH NEIGHBORHOOD ISSUES. BUT THE 
ORGANIZATIONS CAN TRIGGER PROBLEMS AS WELL AS SOLVE THEM.

 John Drews' life has never been quite the same since he took the Harbor Ridge 
Assn. to court eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A Newport Beach heart surgeon, Drews sued the homeowners association when it 
refused to allow him to trim the trees that had grown to obstruct his panoramic 
view of Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 As the resulting legal battle heated up, Drews took leave from his medical 
practice to give the case his complete attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our case went longer than the Iran-Contra trial of (former President 
Reagan's National Security Adviser) John Poindexter," he said. "And it was all 
over a bunch of trees." 
</P>
<P>
 After running up legal bills that topped $150,000, Drews prevailed in court. 
As soon as the trees were trimmed, he sold the $950,000 house. 
</P>
<P>
 But it all left such scars -- "I felt so wronged" -- that Drews, 52, decided 
to chuck a lucrative medical career to enroll in law school. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of homeowners' associations in Southern California is full of such 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two decades, these "residential governments" have multiplied 
dramatically and now number an estimated 150,000 nationally and 20,000 in 
California, covering communities where some 5 million people live. 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction can be one of simple economics. Residents pay monthly fees to 
maintain attractive neighborhood landscaping or for access to common 
recreational amenities such as golf courses, parks, clubhouses, lakes, tennis 
courts and swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 But growth has not come without problems. Courthouses are full of association 
disputes, some of which have grown from a tiny neighborhood battle to a legal 
cause celebre.  
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the California Supreme Court gave more clout to homeowner 
groups throughout the state when it ruled that associations could ban cats and 
other pets from homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just unbelievable," said attorney Joel Tamray, who represented a woman 
seeking to keep her three cats, Boo-Boo, Dockers and Tulip. "Anybody buying a 
condo these days really should take a hard look." 
</P>
<P>
 In the higher reaches of homeowners association bureaucracy, however, Debra 
Bass of the Community Association Institute in Arlington, Va., said decisions 
in the "Cat Case" and others like it are working to maintain the "sense of 
order" people expect when they buy into communities governed by their 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homes are the largest investments in people's lives," Bass said. 
"Associations provide people stable and predictable environments. They also 
give residents access to neighborhood things like swimming pools and tennis 
courts -- amenities that were once the exclusive domain of the wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
 At their best, Bass said, homeowners groups serve the common interests of the 
residents. In the up-and-down world of the real estate marketplace, for 
example, rules governing neighborhood neatness and uniformity can help keep 
property values somewhat stable, even though some residents might gripe about 
having to cut their grass or weed their gardens according to association 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 A united homeowners association can also prove to be a worthy opponent for 
powerful developers or home builders in disputes over home construction defects 
and shoddy workmanship. Bass said there were "numerous examples of associations 
which have won multimillion-dollar judgments against big developers because of 
problems they have caused in the neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, people such as state Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata) have seen 
associations at their worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people have no idea what they are getting into," said Hauser, chairman 
of the Assembly's Committee on Housing and Community Development. "They thought 
they were buying a house -- their castle -- and then find out they can't paint 
the house blue; they gotta pull weeds when somebody tells them; and they can't 
put a gazebo or hot tub in the back yard because it's really not your back 
yard." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more unusual disputes drove a woman from her Santa Ana condo a 
couple years ago, when the Townsquare Owners Assn. cited the 51-year-old 
grandmother for kissing her date good night in the driveway of her complex. Her 
transgression: "doing bad things for an hour" in a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
 And consider the case of Marty Goodman: 
</P>
<P>
 When Goodman purchased her Fullerton condo 17 years ago, she also bought into 
a belief that the local homeowners association would maintain the attractive 
landscaping and the "delightful" water fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, the 76-year-old widow has dutifully paid her monthly maintenance 
fees -- now hovering near $200 per month -- even though the fountain was turned 
off years ago and the grounds have long lost their luster. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Goodman said, her Amberwood-Fullerton Homeowners Assn. went too 
far when it asked her to dig up her rose bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 In its letter, the association stated: "It's been brought to the attention of 
the Board of Directors that you have been planting roses outside of your patio 
area. This is in violation of the Common Area Rules and Regulations of your 
association. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman will be able to keep her roses, after all. Amberwood President Mary 
Lee Todd said the letter was the work of one board member who might have had "a 
personal thing" against Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems often involve association directors taking their authority too 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, in my opinion, you have people in charge of these associations who 
always wanted to be the fire chief, or the police chief," Hauser said. "Because 
nobody wants to take on the responsibility of managing these things, you have 
these people with all the power and, by God, they are going to enforce the 
rules." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, some relief for residents has come in the form of state 
legislation that requires homeowner associations, like all other forms of 
government, to hold their meetings in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, new legislation requires all warring parties in association disputes 
to first seek some form of mediation before bringing their fights to court. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the boom in association living -- it is estimated that one in eight 
Americans lives in a community governed by an association -- comes a 
corresponding increase in problems that require some form of attorney-assisted 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is no surprise that some attorneys have tailored their entire practices 
to deal with the legal vagaries of association living. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, for example, the law firm of Fiore, Nordberg, Walker & Racobs has 
represented about 2,000 associations in Orange, Riverside, Los Angeles and San 
Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Southern California, San Diego attorney Sandra Brower is known as 
one of the best advocates in business for the owners of satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Her most-publicized victory involved the Trabuco Canyon community of Portola 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident John James said he knew about the association's ban on satellite 
dishes, but put one up in his back yard anyway, because he thought the board of 
directors would be "reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the added entertainment channels it provides, James said the dish 
was important for capturing weather forecasts from around the world for use in 
his work as a pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, James said, the $40,000 he spent to keep his $1,000-dish was well 
worth the effort. As part of the decision, the court ordered the association to 
pay James' attorneys fees plus $3,000 in sanctions for bringing a frivolous 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach attorney Stanley Feldsott has represented about 300 associations 
in California and some homeowners -- including Drews, the heart surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Obscure legal files involving associations have found their way to his 
briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 One involved a Palos Verdes man who withheld $500 in association fees, saying 
the association used an insecticide inside his unit that killed two goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing the Palos Verdes Bay Club Assn., Feldsott said his clients won, 
and the resident was forced to pay legal fees totaling $20,000 per goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
 In Marina del Rey, the attorney has taken the case of a woman who is fighting 
her association's rules against the type of bamboo shade she put on her 
condominium balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 The shade in question is a three-piece model. The association prefers a 
one-piece shade. The legal bills have passed the $100,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, nothing is quite like the 1992 case involving a couple of overweight 
dogs named Katie and Kahlua in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Feldsott was representing the Jasmine Park Homeowners Assn., 
which banned dogs exceeding a 35-pound weight limit, and sued homeowners whose 
canines tipped the scales. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Roberts, the owner of a 48-pound Labrador retriever, and Tania Allard, 
who had a 100-pound, partially blind and arthritic Airedale, decided to 
challenge the regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first," Roberts said, "I thought it was a joke. I laughed. (The 
association) sent me a letter requesting a certificate of weight from a 
licensed veterinarian. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldsott said the association eventually changed its policy and the lawsuit 
was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 But out-of-court settlements are not always in the cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Assemblyman Hauser, Feldsott said association residents generally are not 
interested in the association's workings and are unaware of the rules until 
they become involved in disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 In their encounters with association management, some residents are likely to 
meet long-serving directors who are in those positions because nobody else 
wanted the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are designed as little democracies, but they start to take on the 
appearance of malevolent dictatorships after a while," Feldsott said. "It 
becomes a dictatorship because no one wants to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Bass of the Community Association Institute in Virginia acknowledges that 
there have been problems, but they are the "ones that tend to make the 
headlines." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the institute's mission, she said, is to educate association directors 
and homeowners about friendly coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love thy neighbor," states one of its 116 "tips to ensure a happy community 
association experience." Other commandments include: "Curb thy dog, don't play 
the stereo too loud, park in your own space and don't be a six-car family." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first few "tips" for association board members: "Serve because you 
care, not because you have a hidden agenda." And "don't go on a power trip."

ALTERNATIVE CARE EDGES INTO MEDICAL MAINSTREAM; HEALTH: HOSPITAL CONGLOMERATE 
OFFERS INDIAN FOLK TREATMENTS. THE RESULTS INTEREST U.S. GOVERNMENT, INSURANCE 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The regimen is very Californian: Hot oil massages. Aroma therapy. A special 
diet tailored to the season and your particular dosha (body type). Doses of 
yoga, meditation and other mental exercises to cleanse the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds right at home in Southern California, fertile territory for every 
alternative medical treatment from acupuncture to Zen. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spin here is that the 6,000-year-old form of Indian folk medicine 
called ayurveda is now available at the Sharp Institute for Human Potential and 
Mind-Body Medicine, an offshoot of the Sharp HealthCare medical conglomerate, a 
charter member of the medical Establishment. Sharp operates a string of good, 
gray hospitals where Marcus Welby would feel right at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Welby's world is changing. Alternative medicine, once relegated to free 
clinics and storefront practitioners, is slowly gaining acceptance within the 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 A widely quoted study in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that a 
third of Americans spend $14 billion a year on alternative medical methods. 
Eighty percent of those continue to see their regular doctors, a strategy that 
fits with how the Sharp institute sees ayurveda blending with conventional 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Through aggressive marketing and adroit deal-making, the not-for-profit Sharp 
chain -- which includes six hospitals, 18 clinics and five affiliated medical 
groups -- has come to dominate the hospital market in affluent and conservative 
San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp executives are determined that Sharp will be a major player in the 
alternative medicine market. 
</P>
<P>
 And to lead the charge, Sharp has teamed up with New Age superstar Dr. Deepak 
Chopra, the nation's best known pitchman for the notion that thinking healthy 
is the first step toward being healthy and that toxic emotions are as deadly as 
carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government, which holds the purse strings for medical research, is 
watching for signs of success at the Sharp Institute. So too is the insurance 
industry, which has shown flickers of interest in paying for alternative care. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James S. Gordon, a clinical professor of psychiatry and family medicine at 
Georgetown University and an adviser to the federal government on alternative 
medicine, said the creation of the Sharp Institute is an important development 
in the movement to incorporate alternative methods into current medical 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp Chief Executive Officer Peter Ellsworth thinks the mind-body devotees 
just might be on to something important that could reduce the American 
dependence on surgery and drugs. In other words, more massages and meditation 
just might mean fewer bypass operations and prescriptions for blood pressure 
pills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellsworth is bullish on mind-body but careful not to make claims about its 
effectiveness that cannot be substantiated. He feels that Sharp, with its large 
patient base, is the perfect place to assess the mind-body theories. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something there," Ellsworth said, "but we don't know what." 
</P>
<P>
 He makes two points quickly: One, that mind-body therapies supplement 
conventional treatment, they do not replace it. And two, that mind-body may 
offer a solution to the nation's runaway medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this country does not address lifestyle abuse, we are going to keep 
running out of money regardless of how we change the system," Ellsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Simon, the board-certified neurologist and meditation master who 
serves as the institute's medical director, is convinced that ayurveda, or 
something like it, is the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want their physicians to be more than just technicians of illness," he 
said. "They want them to be educators about health." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, who was chief of staff for two years at Sharp-Cabrillo Hospital, became 
interested in meditation in medical school: "I realized that conventional 
Western medicine often lacks human values." 
</P>
<P>
 To spread the gospel of ayurveda, Chopra and Simon keep an ambitious lecture 
schedule that includes seminars for health professionals and lectures for 
prospective patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Chopra's books and tapes extolling ayurveda (from the Sanskrit words for 
health and life) are perennial bestsellers. His credentials and celebrity have 
brought him invitations to chat with Oprah, Donahue and Geraldo, and to lecture 
at Harvard Medical School and hospitals throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very close to a critical mass in mainstream medicine and mainstream 
America of people who are interested in consciousness," Chopra said. "The 
medical profession and the intellectuals are always behind the times." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the federal government is funding research into the 
effectiveness of alternative medicine, particularly in the areas of stress, 
chronic pain and life-threatening illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nudged by a senator intrigued by bee pollen treatments for allergy sufferers, 
the National Institutes of Health in 1992 opened an Office of Alternative 
Medicine. The research budget for 1994 is a modest $3.5 million. Thirty 
researchers and institutions -- including Sharp's mind-body institute -- were 
selected from among 452 applicants for grants of up to $30,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Included for funding were projects testing acupuncture, hypnosis to relieve 
pain and heal bones, massage therapy for surgical patients, dance movement for 
cystic fibrosis, macrobiotic treatments for cancer, biofeedback for diabetes, 
yoga for heroin addiction, tai chi for balance disorders and massage therapy 
for AIDS babies. 
</P>
<P>
 The NIH definition of alternative medicine is any method that is not taught in 
medical schools, not covered by insurance, and not considered to have 
sufficient documentation in the United States to prove its safety and 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 The NIH grant will allow the Sharp Institute to study two groups of patients: 
one that follows Western practices of diet and exercise, one that is dedicated 
to ayurveda. After a year the two groups will be compared on the basis of blood 
pressure, cholesterol, weight and stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Sharp, other researchers and hospitals are exploring the heretofore 
off-limits world of alternative medicine: 
</P>
<P>
 * Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons has begun 
evaluating scientific and anecdotal evidence about the effectiveness of 
alternative medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Chicago Holistic Center announced a cooperative agreement with a 
community hospital in Chicago whereby doctors can consult with alternative 
practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stanford University medical school professor Dr. David Spiegel, in his book, 
"Living Beyond Limits: New Hope and Help for Facing Life-Threatening Illness," 
described his studies of women with breast cancer that found that women with 
strong support groups live longer than those without. In one of Spiegel's 
studies, group therapy and hypnosis helped reduce the pain of women with 
advanced breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other studies cited by Spiegel, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral 
sciences, have shown that depression can suppress the immune system and that 
prolactin, a stress hormone, might be a cause of prostate and breast cancer. 
Spiegel notes a "small but growing body of evidence" that psychological and 
social factors can help fight illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel wrote, "It is not simply that mind can triumph over matter, but that 
mind matters." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, an introductory session for mind-body treatment can begin with a 
two-hour evaluation by an ayurvedic practitioner for about $250. Half a dozen 
practitioners are aligned with the Sharp institute and take referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 Aroma therapy consists of sniffing your favorite fruits, flowers, resins and 
barks. Music and sound therapy provides melodious chords to reach your inner 
being. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentals such as massage oils and Chopra's books and tapes are extra. A 
panchaka , or purification treatment, goes for $825 for three days, $1,125 for 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who want to know more before committing their bodies and checkbooks, 
the institute is developing a series of eight two-hour lectures, "From 
Prevention to Renewal. The 8-Step Guide to Physical, Mental and Spiritual 
Well-Being," to be held at Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 For patients seeking the deluxe treatment, a one-week stay at the swank Inn 
L'Auberge in Del Mar (the institute offices are just down the block) goes for 
$3,250. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next year, Simon foresees holding seminars for doctors in specialties 
such as oncology, cardiology, gastroenterology and obstetrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the patients who have contacted the institute in the past year in 
search of mind-body treatments, Simon said, are probably looking for a spa-like 
rejuvenation. The other half have chronic medical problems, including AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Duckworth, 52, of Lakeside decided to try the Sharp Institute when 
conventional methods had failed her. She had seen Chopra on "The Phil Donahue 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
 She had been diagnosed several years before as having fibromyalgia, an 
exceedingly painful muscular disease of mysterious origins that predominantly 
strikes women between 30 and 50. 
</P>
<P>
 At the institute, Duckworth was diagnosed as a vata , one of the three basic 
constitutional types, or doshas . The typical vata is lean, restless and prone 
to insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
 A vata should eat rice and wheat but stay away from corn, rye and oats. A vata 
is advised to eat cooked vegetables, not raw, and to favor avocados, bananas 
and berries over apples and pears, according to a handbook given to patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Duckworth was sent home with a daily regimen tailored to vatas and three 
months later she returned for three two-hour tuneups called panchakarma.  
</P>
<P>
 "These things have made it possible for me to have a life again," said 
Duckworth. For the first time in years she is virtually pain-free. 
</P>
<P>
 An articulate and cautious woman, Duckworth probably would have been leery of 
a mind-body clinic if it smacked of flakiness or experimentation. But she lost 
all reluctance when she found that the institute is affiliated with Sharp. She 
is undisturbed that there is almost no Western scientific evidence to support 
the techniques of Chopra. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care," Duckworth said. "I'm living proof. It works for me. Western 
medicine wasn't working." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chopra and Sharp have come under strong, if narrowly based, criticism from 
within the medical profession. Two devoted quackery hunters have put Chopra 
near the top of their lists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's nothing but a promoter of Chopra," said William Jarvis, a 
professor of public health at Loma Linda University and president of the 
National Council Against Health Fraud. "As far as ayurvedic medicine is 
concerned, all Chopra is doing is promoting prescientific nonsense in the name 
of medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvis is no less displeased with Sharp and Ellsworth, the chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand the thinking of a hospital administrator who uses 
pseudo-science as a marketing tactic for good medicine," he said. "I think 
that's irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Barrett, a retired physician from Allentown, Pa., and author of "The 
Health Robbers: A Close Look at Quackery in America," devotes a chapter to 
Chopra and ayurvedic medicine in an upcoming book. He takes particular aim at 
the notion that all people can be classified as vata , pitta or kapha and 
treated accordingly. "It's absurd," Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chopra and editors at the Journal of the American Medical Assn. engaged in a 
public and nasty dispute that began in 1991 when Chopra and two other 
Indian-born doctors published an article in JAMA that discussed ayurvedic 
medicine in glowing terms. 
</P>
<P>
 JAMA later printed a lengthy clarification saying that if the editors had 
known of the trio's supposed financial stake in selling ayurvedic products, 
they would not have published the article. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later a JAMA editor published a lengthy, exhaustively documented 
article that, in effect, accused the trio of doing nothing more than peddling 
warmed-over transcendental meditation with no scientific basis. Chopra was a 
devotee of TM guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi until the two split in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Chopra struck back at JAMA with a lawsuit and accused it of reacting like an 
intolerant religion trying to stamp out heresy. The suit has since been 
dismissed, but Chopra remains furious at JAMA, and there is no indication that 
JAMA has softened its view of Chopra. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everybody else in organized medicine, Simon and Ellsworth were aware of 
Chopra's dispute with JAMA before they recruited him for Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 "He definitely pushes the envelope," Simon said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; FIRST LADY AGAIN CAMPAIGNS FOR BROWN; 
ELECTION: HILLARY CLINTON, SUBBING FOR THE PRESIDENT, MAKES HER SECOND 
APPEARANCE IN AS MANY WEEKS. AN ESTIMATED $1.5 MILLION IS RAISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in two weeks, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton came west 
to lend support to state Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- this time at a Los Angeles 
fund-raiser Sunday night that was expected to net Brown's gubernatorial 
candidacy $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in for her husband, who was scheduled to be here but stayed in 
Washington to monitor the fast-breaking events in Haiti, the First Lady urged 
the 1,500 business leaders and Brown loyalists who attended the $1,000-a-plate 
dinner at 20th Century Fox Studios to work hard to help Brown defeat Gov. Pete 
Wilson and what she called his "politics of negativism." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking just hours after the Haiti situation appeared to have been peacefully 
resolved, Mrs. Clinton called the agreement a step that would "benefit of the 
people of Haiti and . . . every single American. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very grateful," Mrs. Clinton said, her voice echoing across a huge 
soundstage where the television series "NYPD Blue" is sometimes shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ten days earlier, Mrs. Clinton had joined Brown at a $500-a-plate 
luncheon in San Francisco that added about $750,000 to Brown's campaign 
coffers. At Sunday's dinner, Democratic Party state chair Bill Press -- who is 
heading a vigorous voter registration drive into the pre-election stretch -- 
joked that "Hillary has been here so often, she qualifies to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown clearly welcomes the help. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Sunday, she pledged that if she defeats Wilson, she will return the 
favor. "Californians deserve a governor who will be a partner with President 
Clinton," she said, urging voters to elect "a Democrat named Brown who can then 
help a Democrat named Clinton go back (to the White House) for that second 
term." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Wilson has said he is glad the Clintons are associating 
themselves so closely with Brown. Speaking at the Republican Party state 
convention over the weekend, the incumbent crowed about the President's growing 
unpopularity and jokingly offered to pay his air fare anytime he wants to 
campaign on Brown's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson told a story of an unnamed Democratic candidate in Tennessee who 
supposedly "got a call from the White House this summer asking if he wanted 
President Clinton to come campaign in his district," Wilson said. "The 
candidate's answer was, 'Only if he's coming to endorse my opponent.' " 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment she arrived, Hillary Clinton made it clear whose side she was 
on. Stepping off an Air Force jet at Burbank Airport, she stopped to shake the 
hands of the Northridge All Stars, the champion Little League team that came in 
second in the world playoffs despite the Jan. 17 earthquake that ravaged their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton then took the podium and accused Wilson of putting those 
children's future in peril. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it mean for the future of these young men . . . for the state of 
California to be declared by the financial world the worst managed state in the 
country?" she asked an enthusiastic crowd of about 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it mean that for the first time since the Depression, the (state) 
government handed out IOUs to state employees?" during the state's recent 
budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you elect Kathleen Brown, you'll have a hard-working governor in the 
tradition of two other governors named Brown," Mrs. Clinton said, referring to 
Brown's father and brother, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's try what's worked. Let's elect another Brown in California."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: THE REAL ISSUE IN THE RACE FOR U.S. SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cut through all the attack ads and twisted facts, the egos and riches, the 
spirituality and triviality, and California's U.S. Senate race gets down to 
this: One candidate believes in government, the other doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 It's more than insider vs. outsider. That's sloganeering, created by 
strategists for the Republican candidate, Rep. Mike Huffington. It's a lot more 
than New Age narcissism or Huffington's supposed ties through his wife to a 
religious cult, as gurus for Sen. Dianne Feinstein would have voters think. 
</P>
<P>
 This even has little to do with whether a recent Texas transplant -- a 
carpetbagger -- is trying to buy himself a California Senate seat with a 
fortune acquired from the sale of his father's oil and gas company. Although 
that, indeed, would turn the political world on its head. 
</P>
<P>
 And it absolutely has nothing to do with whether an aide -- a taxpayer-paid 
chauffeur -- drives the senator to work. Huffington drives himself. That 
enlightenment can be found in one of his latest TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver tip is a gimmick to remind voters that Feinstein is a "career 
politician." She is and she's proud of it. "Basically, my life is government," 
she once told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington calls himself a "citizen politician," as did another handsome, 
neophyte California candidate, Ronald Reagan. Huffington talks about his 
election "sending a tidal wave across this country." Reagan talked of "lighting 
a prairie fire." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Huffington last February whether he aspired to follow in Reagan's 
footsteps to the White House. "Let's put it this way," he said. "I wouldn't 
exclude any options." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Reagan, Huffington has little regard for government. "I'm not going to 
the Senate to offer a lot of legislation," he says. "I'm going there to cut 
programs (especially welfare). . . . Feinstein believes in the power of 
government to solve problems. I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 True, Feinstein is from the old school of senators who believe in delivering 
for their states. Call it bacon, call it pork. But without it, California 
wouldn't have gotten freeways, ports and water systems -- plus a lot of defense 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raytheon case is a good illustration of these candidates' contrasting 
philosophies. Last year, Raytheon officials in Santa Barbara asked Huffington, 
their new congressman, to help them obtain a State Department waiver so they 
could bid on a Taiwan defense contract. It meant $100 million and roughly 250 
jobs. He rejected them. "I'm not here to be your lobbyist," he said. "Companies 
should compete against each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington thought it "inappropriate" for a congressman to interfere with a 
foreign treaty. If an Administration wants to change a treaty, "fine," he said, 
"but for all companies -- not just Raytheon." 
</P>
<P>
 So Raytheon went to Sen. Feinstein. No problem, she replied. It got the 
waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the sort of thing that prompted super rancher John Harris to endorse 
Feinstein and help raise $100,000 for her campaign last Friday at his Coalinga 
restaurant. One hundred farmers showed up with checks in what normally is 
Republican country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a gut shot deal," said Harris, who in the last two elections 
raised money for Feinstein's GOP opponents. "We're confident when push comes to 
shove, she's going to do the right thing (for agriculture). . . . She has a lot 
of experience in government and knows how to be effective. Once she decides 
something needs to be fixed, she's real tenacious." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's philosophy was illustrated recently at a Pasadena civic luncheon, 
where she bragged of the bacon -- pork -- she helped deliver to California with 
the crime bill. Pasadena should get $3.9 million to hire 40 new cops, she said. 
There'll be $2.5 million for jails and boot camps, $518,000 for the drug court 
program, $448,000 to fight domestic violence. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line," she said, "is I've produced as much or more for my state in 
two years as any senator in history." 
</P>
<P>
 At a GOP state convention in San Diego on Saturday, Huffington explained to 
reporters his attitude about delivering for constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd seek federal funding if the program "was something I believed in," he 
said. "If I really didn't think it was a good use of money, I wouldn't ask for 
it. . . . I've obviously been willing to say 'no' before." 
</P>
<P>
 But would he help California get its fair share? "I'd like to cut back (on) 
money going to Washington so we didn't have money to give away for 'fair 
shares,' " he replied. "People are ready for a sea change. And this election is 
all about that: The person who wants to bring home the bacon vs. the one who 
wants to shrink the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, that's what is on the voters' menu.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; COMMENTARY; CLINTON MELLOWS IN TV ADDRESSES; MEDIA: 
THURSDAY'S WARNING WAS CALLED HIS 'MOST BELLIGERENT.' ON SUNDAY NIGHT, HE WAS A 
CALM VICTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three days after his aggressive TV assault on Haiti's military leaders -- 
telling them to step down -- President Clinton was comparatively subdued on the 
home screen Sunday night in declaring apparent victory. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Clinton, using TV as a bully pulpit to warn of an imminent 
invasion by a 25-nation multinational force, bluntly told the three top leaders 
of the Haitian military junta: "Your time is up. Leave now or we will force you 
from power." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, in a television address of about 5 minutes, he told the American 
public: "Tonight, I can tell you they will go." 
</P>
<P>
 After Clinton's speech Thursday, CNN's Judy Woodruff said she felt it was the 
President's "most belligerent" statement. Thus began three days of intense 
concern, debate and some skepticism about whether the United States again 
should play world cop -- a drama that CNN dominated on television with 
compelling, thorough and committed coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The other networks were on hand at some high points and in their regular 
newscasts, but mainly stayed with their regular entertainment programming. 
</P>
<P>
 CNN viewers, however, received the full impact of the drama, particularly 
through the reports of correspondents Christiane Amanpour and Tom Clancy in 
Port-au-Prince, and White House correspondent Wolf Blitzer in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, before Haiti's military leaders agreed to step down, Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher described the riveting events as "negotiating by 
television." And that's the way it was for the three days, culminating with 
Clinton's announcement Sunday evening that U.S. troops on a peacekeeping 
mission would start landing in Haiti today in the face of reduced but still 
present risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Television was part of the negotiations from the very start, when CBS anchor 
Dan Rather, in a reporting coup, not only landed one of the three targeted 
Haitian leaders -- Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras -- for an interview, but actually 
watched with him as Clinton threw down the gauntlet Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after Clinton's speech, Cedras -- questioned on live air by 
Rather, vowed to fight. But the journalistic coup was cheapened when, during a 
CBS newscast surrounding the interview, the network, through Rather's 
co-anchor, Connie Chung, twice threw in plugs for a new entertainment series, 
"Due South." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Rather's interview, CNN, through sheer volume of coverage, took over 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama heightened extraordinarily when Clinton announced Friday that former 
President Jimmy Carter, retired Gen. Colin L. Powell and Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) 
would fly to Haiti for a final attempt to persuade the military leaders to 
depart and avoid an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the spin by some television pundits was that the mission was not a 
negotiation so much as a logistic procedure. But as the talks stretched on 
through an unexpected four sessions of meetings and much of Sunday, TV suddenly 
was freely using the words "negotiation" and "deal." 
</P>
<P>
 CNN's cameras steadily remained trained on the military headquarters where 
most of the talking was going on. Figures such as Carter and Cedras could be 
seen while a crowd remained outside. It was a surreal image. But as the day 
wore on, the length of the talks gave rise to speculation -- mostly on CNN -- 
that matters were taking a positive turn. 
</P>
<P>
 According to several network spokespersons, ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN had agreed 
not to disclose the location of any invading forces in order to avoid adding to 
their risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Network representatives said the departure of American planes from Pope Air 
Force Base in North Carolina on Sunday night, even as negotiations were 
continuing, was not originally broadcast for security reasons although the news 
organizations knew about it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the news finally made it to the air, according to ABC spokeswoman Sherrie 
Rollins, after a Clinton Administration adviser gave the go-ahead.

 The deal had been struck, the planes had been turned around, the President had 
addressed the nation on television, but before leaving the White House, the 
nation's top military leaders had one last chore to complete -- who gets to go 
on the "Today Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Just after Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, completed a White House news conference Sunday night outlining the deal 
reached in Haiti, reporters gathered near the office of White House Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers.Down the corridor, the reporters could hear Myers, 
Perry and Shalikashvili engaged in an urgent discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," Myers could be heard saying, addressing one of the two men, "you do 
'Nightline' tonight. Now who's going to do the morning shows?"

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; U.S., ALLIES READY TO PAY FOR PEACE; AID: PLAN SEEKS 
TO STIMULATE GROWTH, FOSTER DEMOCRACY. TAB IS LIKELY TO BE $550 MILLION IN 
FIRST YEAR ALONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No matter how or when Haiti's military leaders leave power, U.S. officials 
promise one sure thing about the reconstruction effort that will follow: It 
will cost real money. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and its allies have already promised to shoulder much of the 
burden of rebuilding Haiti's ravaged economy, a task that will cost an 
estimated $550 million in the first year alone and stretch well into the 21st 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The first U.S. aid workers will land in Haiti with military troops, tackling 
immediate problems of getting food, water and electricity flowing. The Clinton 
Administration has made plans to feed as many as 2 million of Haiti's 6.6 
million people for a year or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Once emergency aid is flowing, U.S. officials plan to launch an ambitious 
reconstruction plan to lift Haiti from its poverty. But the economic aid 
program has an explicit political aim as well: to help democratically elected 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide break the power of the country's monied 
oligarchy by building a new capitalist class. 
</P>
<P>
 The money won't all be American; more than half will come from other wealthy 
countries. The United States has already pledged at least $100 million in 
direct aid in the first year, with more to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aim is to lift Haiti out of its position as the poorest country of the 
region, and that is a long-haul proposition," said Mark L. Schneider, assistant 
administrator of the Agency for International Development, the U.S. foreign aid 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an economy that has suffered three years of devastation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the September, 1991, military coup that overthrew Aristide and led 
to a series of increasingly punishing international trade sanctions, most 
Haitians survived on an annual income of less than $100 per person. Even then, 
the country had to import food, its farm production held back by poor soil and 
backward technology. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, both industry and agriculture have virtually collapsed. 
Even under the embargo, the United States has been providing food relief for 
about 1 million Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the international aid program designed by AID, other donors and 
Aristide advisers, however, is not merely to feed Haiti's impoverished masses. 
Instead, U.S. officials say, they hope to help transform Haiti's economic and 
political structure so democracy can take root in the island nation for the 
first time in its history. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to wipe away a corrupt political system of overlords from the 
top down that has robbed and stolen what the society has been able to produce," 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key part of this is reawakening and stimulating the private sector -- but 
not the same private sector that has dominated the country until now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To address that problem, he said, the United States and other donors have 
agreed to support a plan proposed by Aristide to break up Haiti's 
state-protected monopolies in such sectors as sugar and cement, and turn those 
enterprises over to their employees and other small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will also include loans and other support for small businesses and 
farmers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider and other officials said a major aid program will be needed for at 
least five to seven years, and probably beyond that, with the total bill 
impossible to estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $550 million needed for the first year, the United States has promised 
$100 million and other countries and international organizations have promised 
$350 million, for a total of $450 million already pledged. The United States 
has offered to help make up the remaining $100 million if others join in. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, as a key part of the planning, the United States and other donors 
met in Paris with Aristide advisers and agreed on the basic terms of an 
economic recovery plan. The plan, formally proposed by Aristide, would cost 
$770 million over two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The donors agreed to a U.S. proposal to quickly write off $81 million in 
overdue foreign debts owed by the Haitian government, enabling international 
lending institutions to extend about $150 million in credit for new projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would begin with an immediate shot in the arm to Haiti's economy, 
about $95 million for food, health services and the creation of about 50,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those jobs, largely in road-building and other infrastructure repair 
projects, would be available to former soldiers drummed out of Haiti's armed 
forces, Schneider said. But the number of former soldiers is likely to be 5,000 
or fewer, so they would receive only a small fraction of the public works jobs, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $85 million would be available for political reforms, including 
training a new police force, setting up a new judicial system, establishing 
better protection of human rights and holding parliamentary elections at the 
end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 If all this sounds like nation-building -- a mission Clinton and his aides 
have forsworn -- Schneider said it should not turn out that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Haitians have to do most of the work themselves," he said. Besides, he 
added, "the international community is fully involved," meaning Haiti won't 
just be a U.S. responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest danger, he said, is that Americans and others may hope for too 
much progress too soon in a country that has long been an economic basket case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be sure that our expectations are based on what Haiti has been in 
the past," he said. "The change is going to be gradual."

CANADA LEADER VOWS TO DEFEAT SEPARATISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first speech since the election of a separatist government in the 
province of Quebec, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien vowed Sunday to 
defeat the separatists in an upcoming referendum battle and "put the issue (of 
Quebec independence) behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 "The first responsibility of a prime minister of Canada is to ensure the unity 
of the country. Let there be absolutely no doubt: This I will do," Chretien 
said in a nationally televised address to the annual meeting of the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce in Quebec City. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chretien also sought to reassure those who fear that the pressures of the 
Quebec situation will divert him from tough decisions on the economic front. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will make the case for Canada by concentrating on providing good 
government, on providing jobs and economic growth, on getting our fiscal house 
in order and on modernizing the roles and responsibilities of the federal 
government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, he said his government this fall will encourage national debate 
on a "discussion paper" of proposed social service program reforms aimed at 
cost-cutting, increased efficiency and removing disincentives to work. He also 
reiterated a pledge to reduce the federal deficit from the 6% of gross domestic 
product it was when he took office last year to 3% by the end of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals to change social services and reduce the deficit are certain to be 
controversial and may place greater financial burdens on the provinces. Thus, 
they could give Quebec separatists ammunition in their campaign to leave 
Canada. But Chretien must balance those concerns against protests elsewhere in 
the country that Quebec has dominated the national agenda for too long, forcing 
aside more important issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister's speech came six days after the Parti Quebecois, dedicated 
to Quebec independence, won 77 of 125 seats in the provincial Parliament. Parti 
Quebecois leader Jacques Parizeau, who will be the new Quebec premier, has 
promised a referendum to ask the province's voters if they want to establish 
their own country. 
</P>
<P>
 Chretien said the vote was for a change of government, not for separatism. He 
also gently mocked Parizeau's oft-repeated statement that it is "normal" for 
Quebeckers to want a "normal" country of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Quebeckers should ask themselves if it is "normal" to break up such a 
successful nation as Canada. And, drawing a standing ovation, Chretien asserted 
that Canada is no "normal country," but an exceptional one, the finest in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for that remark, and a spirited "Vive le Canada" at the end, Chretien's 
speech was lacking in emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking alternately in English and French, as is typical of political 
speeches in Canada, Chretien said he will share leadership in opposing the 
referendum with Daniel Johnson, the outgoing Quebec premier. Johnson, head of 
the province's Liberal Party, was defeated in the election but impressed many 
with a stronger-than-predicted showing. The Parti Quebecois and the Liberals 
split the popular vote almost evenly, but the PQ won more seats because of its 
popularity in the more numerous French-speaking districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chretien is a veteran of the 30-year struggle between federalists and 
separatists and played a key role in the campaign that defeated the previous 
referendum on Quebec sovereignty, in 1980. His hometown is Shawinigan, a pulp- 
and aluminum-manufacturing center about 80 miles northeast of Montreal.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; ANXIOUS TROOPS WATCHED, WAITED TO LEARN THEIR FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 First came cheers, then an uncertain silence. 
</P>
<P>
 In anxious barracks and day rooms at the base for the military units that 
would have borne the brunt of an invasion of Haiti, officers and enlisted 
personnel watched President Clinton's speech Sunday night to learn what their 
future would be. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton singled out Ft. Bragg and the 82nd Airborne Division for praise, 
the headquarters of the 327th Battalion of the 35th Signal Corps here erupted 
with cheers and youthful woofing. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the speech was over, confusion replaced elation. 
</P>
<P>
 Commanders of units of the 18th Airborne Corps, the umbrella organization for 
the land forces that were scheduled to lead the invasion, scrambled to find out 
whether they were still going to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. James David Bryan, commander of the 35th Signal Brigade, was to have 
overall command of communications in Haiti if the invasion had occurred but now 
didn't know which of his units would move and which would stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just sitting here watching CNN," said Lt. Col. James Thomas, Bryan's 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 A big problem for the Army, officers said, was that so much equipment was 
already on cargo ships at sea that it would be difficult to reorganize for a 
peaceful entry into the country. Some officers were told Sunday afternoon to 
prepare contingency plans for a peaceful landing requiring a smaller force, but 
most were in the dark until the speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, troops made it clear that they were ready for the invasion 
and eager for a final decision from the White House. In fact, officers here 
said they had been planning the invasion for months, and allowed reporters into 
last-minute briefings to see the level of detail that had gone into the 
invasion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been ready to go for two weeks," said Cpl. Mark Anthony Bolden, a 
communications operator in the 35th Signal Brigade, which was scheduled to land 
in Haiti an hour after the initial assault by the 82nd Airborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some were willing to question whether the invasion was worthwhile. "I 
don't understand how our national security is at stake, but I guess in an 
economic sense when we see boatloads of Haitians coming over, it is good to 
stop that," said Chief Warrant Officer Kevin Painter. "But is that reason 
enough to invade? Probably not."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; 1,800 MARINES POISED AT BRINK OF INVASION: THEN A 
STAND-DOWN; ASSAULT SHIP: COMMANDER SAYS TROOPS FEEL 'A NATURAL LETDOWN.' THEY 
WERE READY TO SECURE BEACHES, CLOSE ROADS. 
</P>

<P>
 The letters had been written, the machine guns loaded, the landing craft 
readied. This amphibious assault ship was steaming ever closer, and the captain 
was on the bow. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,800 young Marines were at the brink of war. 
</P>
<P>
 And then -- peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two hours after the fighting men of the Wasp were told that they were 
headed for combat in Haiti, and just four hours before the helicopters were to 
whop off the flight deck, their commanders announced a stand-down. 
</P>
<P>
 These Marines would not be going in as warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 When Marines are trained, crammed into a ship for a month at sea, carried to 
Haiti and told that Raoul Cedras is the bad guy, they want to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a natural letdown," said Rear Adm. William H. Wright IV, commander 
of the amphibious task force that was supposed to have hit the north shore of 
Haiti, secure the beaches, take out a heavy weapons battery and close the 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got yourself prepared and you're moving very rapidly toward an 
objective and then you suddenly hear there will be no ball game tonight," the 
admiral said. 
</P>
<P>
 How prepared were they? Navy SEALS were in the waters at Cap Haitien, the 
Marines' target on the northern beach of the Caribbean island. In the air, 61 
planes from Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina were aloft and heading south 
to Haiti with paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wasp itself was about 20 miles from shore when it was told to hold off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never come this close up the ramp before," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the berths below, hundreds upon hundreds of Marines, their faces darkened 
with camouflage but enthusiasm for battle shining in their eyes, got the word 
just as they were being handed their ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 They had not slept all day, and now they were not going to sleep at night, 
either. In the mildest of Marine parlance, they were upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Cpl. Prentis Lee Jr., 22, of Fairless Hills, Pa., felt cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no good," he said. "Don't they know the sooner we get in, the sooner 
we get out?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Cpl. Rian Smith, who had ridden bulls at high school rodeos in Tampa, 
Fla., broken his ribs and two shoulder blades and once had had a bull stomp on 
his head, had been just hours away from a helicopter ride into Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so pumped up and ready to go," he lamented. "Now this!" 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was feeling his oats, but he was also feeling fear. He had written 10 
letters earlier in the day to his parents, his girlfriend and other friends. It 
was Sunday, and he also had attended Methodist services aboard ship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prayed to the Lord that everybody got in safe," he said. "Now we're not 
even getting in." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy Capt. Robert Chaplin, skipper of the Wasp, had told the Marines at 6 p.m. 
that H-hour would be 12:01 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it is time for us to reflect," he had said over the public address 
system. "Now is the time to get all of our lives in order." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Marines did not seem to believe public opinion polls that showed a 
majority of Americans opposed to an invasion. And they acknowledged that the 
certainty that some of their own would die in an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Damon White, 26, a platoon leader from Pittsburgh, was sure there would be 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take casualties," he said. "People dying, people not making 
it. Some Marines are not going to make it home." 
</P>
<P>
 At a Catholic Mass, Father Dennis Rochefort, of Boston, led 50 Marines and 
sailors in song and prayer. In his sermon, the chaplain called this "Super 
Sunday." His themes turned to family and friends. With several of the Marines 
wiping tears from their cheeks, Father Rochefort said: "You have no idea, men, 
of the thousands and thousands of people who are praying for you right now." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mess hall at noon, Capt. Rich Diddams and his platoon leaders were 
reflecting on the virtue of high morale and the gut-tugging pain of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Diddams, 32, of Jackson, N.C., would have been leading a company into his 
first battle. As a Marine for 10 years, a husband and father of two, and a 
soldier about to face action for the first time, he was well aware of the 
uncertainty that comes with combat. 
</P>
<P>
 His task would have been to lead 150 men from the beach to a weapons battery 
in the downtown section of Cap Haitien. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think about policy and politics," Diddams said. "We think about each 
other, the man on your right and the man on your left."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; 'MISSION STILL HAS RISKS AND WE MUST BE PREPARED,' 
CLINTON SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is the text of President Clinton's announcement Sunday night about Haiti: 
 
</P>
<P>
 My fellow Americans, I want to announce that the military leaders of Haiti 
have agreed to step down from power. The dictators have recognized that it is 
in their best interest and in the best interest of the Haitian people to 
relinquish power peacefully, rather than to face imminent action by the forces 
of the multinational coalition we are leading. 
</P>
<P>
 Our objective over the last three years has been to make sure that the 
military dictators leave power and that the democratically elected government 
is returned. This agreement guarantees both those objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 It minimizes the risks for American forces and the forces of the 24 nations of 
the international coalition. And the coalition maximizes the orderly transfer 
of power to Haiti's democratically elected government. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a good agreement for the United States and for Haiti. The military 
leaders will leave. The United States and coalition forces will arrive, 
beginning tomorrow (Monday), and they'll do so in conditions that are less 
dangerous, although still not without risk. Human Rights 
</P>
<P>
 It will be much easier to preserve human rights, and there is a real chance of 
a more orderly and less violent transfer of power. And to the supporters of 
President (Jean-Bertrand) Aristide, he will be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask that all Haitians remember what President Aristide said just a couple of 
days ago, no vengeance, no violence, no retribution, this is a time for peace. 
That is what the United States is going, along with our coalition partners, to 
work for. 
</P>
<P>
 As all of you know, at my request President (Jimmy) Carter, Gen. Colin Powell 
and Sen. Sam Nunn went to Haiti to facilitate the dictators' departure just 
yesterday (Saturday). I have been in constant contact with them for the last 
two days. They have worked tirelessly, almost around the clock, and I want to 
thank them for undertaking this crucial mission on behalf of all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, I want also to thank the men and women of the United States 
armed forces. It was their presence and their preparations that played a 
pivotal part in this agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this agreement the dictators have agreed to leave power as soon as the 
Haitian Parliament passes an amnesty law as called for by the Governor's Island 
agreement. But in any event, no later than Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 They've agreed to immediate introduction of troops from the international 
coalition, beginning, as I said, as early as tomorrow (Monday). 
</P>
<P>
 They have also pledged to cooperate fully with the coalition troops during the 
peaceful transition of power, something we have wanted very much. I have 
directed United States forces to begin deployment into Haiti as a part of the 
U.N. coalition and (Army Lt.) Gen. (Henry) Sheldon, our commander, will be 
there tomorrow (Monday). 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of the 15,000-member multinational force will guarantee that the 
dictators will carry out the terms of the agreement. It is clear from our 
discussions with the delegation that this agreement only came because of the 
credible and imminent threat of the multinational force. In fact, it was signed 
after Haiti received evidence that paratroopers from our 82nd Airborne 
Division, based at Ft. Bragg, N.C., had begun to load up to begin the invasion 
which I had ordered to start this (Sunday) evening. Indeed, at the time that 
the agreement was reached, 61 Americans planes were already in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this agreement, the United States and other coalition troops now 
going to Haiti will be able to go in under much more favorable conditions than 
they would have if the generals had not agreed to relinquish power. 
</P>
<P>
 But let me emphasize that this mission still has its risks and we must be 
prepared for them. Haiti is still a troubled country and there remain 
possibilities of violence directed at American troops. But this agreement 
minimizes those risks and maximizes our chance to protect the human rights of 
all Haitians, both those who support President Aristide and those who oppose 
him; and to create an environment in which President Aristide can return, as he 
said, without violence, without vengeance, without retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution 940, an international 
coalition from 25 nations will soon go into Haiti to begin the task of 
restoring democratic government. President Aristide will return to Haiti when 
the dictators depart. Brutal Atrocities 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday night, I told you that the United States must act here to protect 
our interests to stop the brutal atrocities that threaten tens of thousands of 
Haitians, to secure our borders and preserve stability and promote democracy in 
our Hemisphere, to uphold the reliability of commitments that we make to others 
and the commitments others make to us. This agreement furthers all these goals. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning I have said that the Haitian dictators must go. Tonight I 
can tell you that they will go. And to our troops tonight who are headed to 
Haiti under less risky conditions, I am confident that you will carry out your 
mission as you already have, effectively and professionally. We depend upon you 
to do well tomorrow as you have done so very well today, and in the weeks and 
days before, when you planned this exercise, prepared for it, and then began to 
carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
 To all of you, I say thank you, your nation is proud of you. 
</P>
<P>
 Good night and God bless America. The Terms 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement negotiated between the United States and Haiti calls for: 
</P>
<P>
 * DEPARTURE: Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby will leave 
power by Oct. 15. The post of Lt. Gen. Michel-Joseph Francois, Port-au-Prince 
police chief, will be eliminated. The military leaders do not have to leave the 
country, though Cedras and Biamby at least are expected to do so. Francois' 
future remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 * RETURN: President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted in September, 1991, will 
return to Haiti after the military leaders leave power. 
</P>
<P>
 * INTERVENTION: The first of 15,000 U.S. troops will begin entering Haiti 
today to make sure the terms of the agreement are carried out. This force is 
just slightly smaller than the planned invasion force and will enter during the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 * PEACEKEEPING: An international coalition from 25 nations will follow the 
U.S. intervention force into Haiti to begin the task of restoring democratic 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 * AMNESTY: Parliament will pass an amnesty law to protect the military leaders 
and their supporters from retribution. The military leaders will leave power 
after the law is passed, no later than Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 * EMBARGO: The agreement says the United Nations' economic embargo will be 
lifted 'without delay' and the needs of the Haitian people will be met 'as 
quickly as possible.'

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; DEMOCRATS RELIEVED BY AGREEMENT TO AVOID INVASION; 
CONGRESS: BUT A KEY GOP SENATOR SAYS WHITE HOUSE SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT TO END THE 
CRISIS SOONER BY NEGOTIATING DIRECTLY WITH HAITI'S MILITARY LEADERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill expressed relief Sunday night at the 
eleventh-hour agreement that avoided a U.S. invasion of Haiti, but a key 
Republican said the Clinton Administration should have negotiated earlier with 
Haiti's military rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God for the Carter delegation. Diplomacy has won over force," said Rep. 
Bill Richardson (D-N.M.). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm immensely pleased, and I think all Americans will be pleased, that our 
forces will not be going in under combat conditions," said Rep. Lee H. Hamilton 
(D-Ind.), the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman. "This points up the 
importance of a credible show of force. It represents a considerable victory 
for President Clinton, and certainly President Carter deserves the highest 
praise for managing this to a successful conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who strongly opposed the planned 
invasion, said he was relieved that the invasion was averted. "Fortunately, the 
threat of force worked this time. This was a game of chicken, with real 
stakes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), a critic of the Clinton foreign policy 
team, said an agreement could have been reached earlier if the White House had 
negotiated directly with Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the Haitian military leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement was there all along. Cedras said he was interested in amnesty 
and in leaving in a way where he would not be disgraced. But our government has 
been so wedded to the Aristide position that we never bothered to listen to 
Cedras. For some reason, the President's advisers took the view that we should 
not negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
 It took the "intervention of some people who are not in the normal orbit" of 
the Clinton Administration to get an agreement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who met with Cedras in July, agreed that the Haitian general could 
have been talked into leaving earlier. "I always believed that he (Cedras) 
would leave if he were allowed to save face," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lugar said he was pleased an invasion had been avoided, he said he 
remained concerned about an apparently open-ended commitment of money to aid 
Haiti's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are once again headed down the same trail" that led to trouble in Somalia, 
he said. "This will be an extremely expensive operation, fraught with potential 
problems, and the Administration has bent over backward avoiding debate on it 
in Congress," Lugar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute agreement avoids what could have been an ugly floor fight in 
the House today, when returning members of Congress were slated to begin debate 
on Haiti. The Senate planned to take up the issue Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The House was prepared to vote on a resolution authored by Rep. David E. 
Skaggs (D-Colo.) that would have sought to block a military action without 
prior approval from both houses. Like other Presidents before him, Clinton has 
taken the position that the Constitution does not require him to obtain 
congressional approval before sending U.S. troops into action in situations 
short of all-out war. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody in Congress is pleased to avoid a constitutional 
confrontation over this," Skaggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and Lugar noted with dismay that the planned invasion almost seemed 
timed to avoid any debate in Congress. "I'm still troubled about the executive 
branch mythology in regard to the President's war powers," Skaggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) went so far as to say Sunday in a 
televised interview that Clinton would violate his oath of office if he had 
unilaterally ordered an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted the charter of the Organization of American States, which the United 
States signed, says, "No state has the right to intervene directly, or 
indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any 
other state." The U.N. Charter has a similar provision, said Moynihan, a former 
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Charter "is not a social science experiment. It is a treaty about the 
use of force," which the President is legally obliged to follow, Moynihan said.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; L.A. AREA HAITIANS REACT WITH HOPE AND SUSPICION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Haitians in the Los Angeles area reacted with hope and suspicion Sunday night 
to the news that the military leadership in their homeland would be leaving 
soon, making way for the return of the nation's first democratically elected 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it a time for celebration? I don't think so," said Gilbert Perpignand, 
president of the Crenshaw-based Haitian Community Refuge Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Perpignand estimated that most members of Los Angeles' small Haitian community 
probably share his suspicion that the wily military regime will try to prolong 
its stay in power beyond the Oct. 15 deadline for departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not satisfied yet," said Frantz Beliard, a local Haitian political 
refugee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This settlement reminds me of the Governors Island accord and it was not 
respected by the generals," he said, referring to Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras' 
agreement last year to hand over power to ousted President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. Cedras, the troubled island nation's military leader, subsequently 
refused to abide by the terms of that U.S.-brokered pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Beliard, 33, a former Haitian journalist now living in Culver City, said the 
time for celebration won't arrive until the military regime's leaders leave the 
country and Aristide is restored to power. After attending a conference in 
Miami in January, where he spoke hopefully of Aristide's return, Beliard 
obtained political asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Haitian community members who gathered Sunday night at Perpignand's 
office to discuss the latest developments also expressed reservations about 
relying on the good faith of the generals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three out of four people from our country are suspicious of this accord," 
Perpignand said. "But we are hopeful. I am happy there will be no military 
intervention, because it would have caused many casualties among the innocent."

HAITIANS IN MIAMI UPSET ARMY CHIEFS WON'T LEAVE IMMEDIATELY

 Hundreds of angry Haitian Americans blocked the streets in Miami's Little 
Haiti neighborhood Sunday night and chanted in protest against the agreement 
reached between Haiti's military leaders and the U.S. delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials in Washington expressed happiness at Sunday's agreement to 
avert a U.S. invasion of Haiti, the initial reaction from Miami's large Haitian 
exile community was anger at its terms. 
</P>
<P>
 As cars passed through the Little Haiti neighborhood north of downtown Miami 
during President Clinton's news conference, many drivers honked their horns and 
cheered and waved. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crowd grew larger and more disappointed as the news spread that Cedras 
would not be leaving immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian exiles said they were angry because the agreement will allow their 
homeland's military leaders to remain in power for up to another month and 
because it set no date for the return of democratically elected President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted in a military coup three years ago.

INTERIOR DEPT. AIMS TO RECHANNEL WATER POLICY IN WEST; RESOURCES: U.S. PLUNGES 
INTO POLITICAL RAPIDS WITH NEW PLAN FOR STATES TO SHARE COLORADO RIVER BOUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the arid West, where local authorities used to joke that "whiskey is for 
drinking, water for fighting," the competition for Colorado River water is 
getting a bit edgy again. 
</P>
<P>
 At the direction of Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, the Bureau of 
Reclamation is trying to reapportion the liquid bounty among the states of 
California, Arizona and Nevada, which now share about 7.5 million acre-feet, or 
2.44 trillion gallons, of river water annually. 
</P>
<P>
 As it recalculates how the three "lower basin" states should share their 
water, the federal government will seek to shift some of the precious resource 
from powerful agricultural interests to the West's burgeoning city populations. 
In addition, it wants to leave more water in the Colorado to sustain fisheries 
and other networks of living things that rely on the river's natural flow for 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are enormous. On the table is the Colorado River Compact, a 
72-year-old accord negotiated at a time when California agricultural interests 
ruled the West, when growing metropolises such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas and 
Phoenix had considerably less clout than today. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to begin building a consensus behind the potential changes, 
Bureau of Reclamation chief Dan Beard literally plunged into the policy rapids. 
In August, he invited a group of Western water users to join him on a five-day 
rafting trip so they could see for themselves some of the stresses and strains 
placed upon the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Beard repeatedly whooped with delight as the raft plowed through the churning 
brown rapids of the Colorado. But the river trek, which was interspersed with 
sober discussions of water rights and resource demands, is likely to appear 
tame compared to the political whitewater that Beard and Babbitt are attempting 
to navigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstream from here, the 34.5 million residents of California, Nevada and 
Arizona await the refreshment that these waters bring. And thousands of 
newcomers are arriving daily in these states, clamoring for more. Their sheer 
numbers are creating dangerous fissures in the legal and political foundations 
of the current allocation scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colorado River Compact and a series of subsequent court rulings are known 
collectively as the "law of the river." And that body of law, by design, favors 
California in general and irrigated farming operations in particular, by 
granting them the biggest shares and the first rights to the waters of a river 
so important to the West that it has been called the American Nile. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada, which had only 70,407 residents and virtually no agriculture in 1920, 
fares poorly under the compact. While California and Arizona enjoy annual 
allocations of 4.4 million and 2.8 million acre-feet, respectively, Nevada is 
entitled to only 300,000 acre-feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada is demanding a bigger share, and the federal government is sympathetic. 
The Las Vegas area grew by 62% from 1980 to 1990. It ranks as the 
fastest-growing urban area in the nation, with nearly 1,000 newcomers arriving 
weekly. The Clark County area is projected to exhaust its river entitlement 
before the year 2010, according to Patricia Mulroy, general manager of Southern 
Nevada's Water Authority. Without a new supply, the county will be forced to 
stop its growth by the year 2000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the law of the river favors farms over cities and California over its 
lower-basin neighbors, it is seen by some critics -- and by Babbitt and Beard 
-- as an outdated arrangement that does not reflect the needs of the new West. 
California farmers, for example, use 3.85 million acre-feet of the state's 
yearly entitlement to irrigate their crops, leaving only 550,000 acre-feet for 
the state's other 30 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Department will stop short of trying to renegotiate the states' 
actual legal shares to the Colorado. Instead, they hope to persuade the states 
to adopt new procedures enabling them to trade and store water among themselves 
more freely. 
</P>
<P>
 Accomplishing even that would be a feat on the order of Moses parting the 
waters. Beard and Babbitt, already viewed with some distrust throughout the 
West, must find common ground among state officials and water users who 
jealously guard their entitlements and are suspicious of "water grabs" by 
rivals. Farmers, who typically have held their entitlements longer than about 
anyone else, already are claiming that any move to reduce their share would 
constitute an uncompensated and illegal "taking" of private property by the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Bureau of Reclamation probably would have taken an easier 
route. Officials would have answered the clamor for more water by building more 
dams, reservoirs and irrigation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But those days are over, Beard said. Tight budgets, environmental concerns and 
a lack of cost-effective building sites on the Colorado have brought such 
projects to a virtual standstill. The bureau -- once regarded primarily as the 
nation's premier dam-building organization -- is recasting itself as a manager 
of existing water resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In its new role, the bureau is expected to unveil rules this fall to let 
California, Arizona and Nevada sell any unused Colorado River water to each 
other. Only Arizona has water to spare; its surplus of 700,000 acre-feet would 
be thirstily snapped up by its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Such marketing schemes have met with stout resistance. Arizona is reluctant to 
go along because it fears it might lose its rights to any water not retained 
for its own use. California is opposed because it gets nearly 1 million 
acre-feet of water each year at no cost. It can do so because it is, before 
Mexico, the last user of Colorado River water, and the existing law of the 
river contains no explicit sanction against diversion of any water allocated 
to, but not taken by, upstream states. If the states agree to a scheme under 
which Arizona could market its surplus water, California would have to pay for 
water it now gets free. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada would like to renegotiate a larger entitlement and, if possible, avoid 
paying for any additional water it receives. But it is willing and able to pay 
more if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Department proposal gives the federal government an expanded role 
in defining the uses to which Colorado River water can be put. It would broaden 
Washington's traditional role in setting conditions, such as the establishment 
of conservation programs. At a time when the federal government has been 
accused of waging a "war against the West," any such expansion is likely to be 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior proposal could overturn a fundamental precedent that has been 
observed since the compact took effect: Farmers must be allowed their ironclad 
grip on river water because they established their rights long before cities 
came into the picture. Under current law, for example, Las Vegas cannot buy 
Colorado River water from a farmer in the Imperial Valley, even if both sides 
are willing to make a deal. The Interior proposal creates a mechanism for such 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law of the river, marginally profitable crops such as hay and 
alfalfa have been drenched with Colorado River water in the desert-like 
environment of Arizona while urban dwellers in Southern California have been 
subjected to strict water rationing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, the driving force behind these negotiations is urbanized southern 
Nevada and the feeling of leaders there that they're close to the edge," Beard 
said. More generally, he added: "The big change that's going to come is meeting 
the needs of Western urban communities. When millions of people in Southern 
California need water, you just can't say, 'Sorry, we need this water to grow 
alfalfa or hay.' That's just not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 For California -- and for the 16 million people in the Southern California 
Metropolitan Water District -- the stakes in the coming negotiations could not 
be higher. Slightly more than a quarter of Southern California's water -- about 
1.2 million acre-feet annually -- comes from the Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado River water is the Southland's cheapest source of water, costing less 
than one-tenth of the next-cheapest source. MWD officials have said they want 
to increase their supply of river water by 350,000 acre-feet by the year 2005. 
A renegotiation of the compact's terms could offer the best opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the traditional interstate rivalries, metropolitan areas, such as 
Southern California and Nevada's Clark County, along with other states have 
reached across borders to join forces. They have created an organization called 
the Western Urban Water Coalition to lobby for changes in Colorado River water 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, the Interior Department's efforts to increase cooperation 
among lower-basin states will be stopgap. The battle royal over the Colorado's 
water lies somewhere beyond the next river bend. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona has water to sell today, but it expects to need its full entitlement 
by 2040. In the coming decade, the populous lower-basin states are expected to 
open negotiations with the upper-basin states of Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico 
and Utah in hopes of procuring some portion of their yearly entitlements of 7.5 
million acre-feet. 
</P>
<P>
 That will expose new rifts among the seven states served by the river, and it 
is certain to cause more resentment toward the federal government. Unless the 
upper-basin states can persuade Washington to build dams and irrigation 
projects, they will be unable to use all of the river water they were promised 
in the 1922 accord.

FOLLOWERS FLOCK TO HEAR MIND-BODY GURU DEEPAK CHOPRA

<P>
 Dr. Deepak Chopra walks to center stage and his followers erupt in applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him, my brain had trouble accepting the fact I was seeing him in 
the flesh," said Vivian Lozano, 37, of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano was among 300-plus Chopra followers who paid $165 each -- or $300 a 
couple -- for his seminar titled "The Mirror of Relationships" at the Red Lion 
Hotel in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 47, Chopra has the world by the tail with his books, tapes and 
alluring, intellectually opaque message that thinking healthy is the first step 
toward being healthy and vanquishing the frets and fevers of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
 His book "Ageless Body, Timeless Mind" has sold upward of a million copies, 
building on the success of his "Quantum Healing," "Perfect Healing" and 
"Unconditional Life." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New Delhi and educated at India's best medical school, Chopra 
immigrated to Boston and built a lucrative practice in endocrinology and 
internal medicine. He became disenchanted with American life and turned to the 
ancient mind-body science of ayurveda. 
</P>
<P>
 He started a stress clinic using ayurveda in 1986 and last year accepted an 
offer to move to San Diego and become the executive director and guiding spirit 
of the Sharp Institute for Human Potential and Mind-Body Medicine there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a new science," Chopra told the Red Lion gathering, "and the new 
science aims at nothing less than the climactic overthrow of the superstition 
of materialism." 
</P>
<P>
 His books and lectures offer an intriguing yet often inscrutable glimpse of 
the infinite intellectual possibilities available if only one could pierce the 
veil. He sprinkles his lectures with poetry and references to quantum physics. 
</P>
<P>
 He glides from 5,000-year-old Sufi poetry to a discussion of the information 
highway as a metaphor for a new medical paradigm. "To the extent we can change 
our consciousness," he says, "we can change our printout." 
</P>
<P>
 His lectures have lists of threes and lists of sevens and pithy propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 An example: "If you just relinquish your need for control, approval and power, 
all your relationships would be healed." And: "Intuition is nothing more than 
slipping into the gap (between thoughts) and tapping into the cosmic computer." 
</P>
<P>
 He has a tape for people trying to lose weight and a book for people trying to 
make money. He is writing four more mind-body books and a novel about two 
levels of simultaneous reality. 
</P>
<P>
 His seminars attract believers, skeptics and those in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gary Foresman, an internist from Mission Viejo, attended the Culver City 
seminar and one in San Diego for health professionals. But he is not without 
some doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 He finds Chopra charismatic but told him during a question-and-answer period 
that he finds his logic hard to follow. Chopra replied calmly that Foresman 
should not worry: A new way of thinking is not easily absorbed. Foresman was 
impressed. "He has a great inner peace about him," he said.

EX-HERO ARRESTED IN ALLEGED SLAYING PLOT; CRIME: SAN DIEGO POLICE ARE SEEKING A 
THIRD SUSPECT IN SHOOTING THAT WOUNDED SURGEON. ANOTHER SUSPECT KILLED HIMSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Marine hero has been arrested and San Diego police are searching for 
another suspect in the freeway shooting of an orthopedic surgeon that 
investigators believe was plotted by the surgeon's former partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The case took a new turn Saturday when former Marine Ronald Gene Self, 28, 
surrendered and was booked on suspicion of possessing a silencer. Police seized 
the device Friday at the La Jolla guest house that Self rented from Dr. Ronald 
Neufeld, who committed suicide hours after the search. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld was a former medical partner of Dr. William Shoemaker, who was shot 
twice Tuesday as he drove to work on a San Diego freeway. He was recovering at 
home from chest and wrist wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego police homicide Detective Tim Muren, the lead investigator, 
confirmed that Self and Neufeld were suspects in the attempted slaying. (Self 
had not been booked on attempted murder charges Sunday, and was free on bail.) 
</P>
<P>
 "There is at least a third suspect" in the case, Muren said Sunday. He 
confirmed that at least two people were in the truck from which they believe 
shots were fired at Shoemaker. The truck, registered to Self, was later found 
outside a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Muren refused to identify the third suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 As a corporal, Self was awarded the Marine Corps' highest peacetime honor 
after he rescued 15 comrades from a burning helicopter that crashed in South 
Korea in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe that the shooting may have stemmed from a bitter legal 
dispute between the two former partners. Neufeld sued Shoemaker, contending 
that his ex-partner had failed to repay a $100,000 promissory note and had 
stolen patients from Neufeld's practice. Shoemaker countersued, claiming that 
Neufeld had misled him about his medical qualifications when they became 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also learned that Neufeld had taken out a $1-million life 
insurance policy on Shoemaker to secure repayment of the $100,000 note.

 COACHES ON HOT SEATS . . .  
</P>
<P>
 . . . and how they fared. Buddy Ryan, Arizona: Ryan was obviously confused. 
This "NFL Throwbacks Weekend" was supposed to involve uniforms, not players. 
Keeping with the theme, Ryan benched Steve Beuerlein and trotted out an old 
relic, 35-year-old quarterback Jim McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
 Final score: Cleveland 32, Buddyball zilch. Ryan yanked McMahon in the second 
half and replaced him with . . . Jay Schroeder? Beuerlein was not activated for 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddyball falls to 0-3. Coincidentally, that's Ryan's playoff record as a head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mora, New Orleans: Like Ryan, Mora has never won a playoff game in the 
NFL. But Coach Creole lives to coach another game thanks to his kicker, Morten 
Andersen, whose three first-half field goals were enough to nip Tampa Bay, 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Pardee, Houston: Maybe it's Pardee's turn to punch Kevin Gilbride, the 
offensive coordinator. The Oilers avoided a shutout with a late touchdown pass 
from plucky Bucky Richardson, but Houston is 0-3 for the first time since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston rallied from 1-4 last year to make the playoffs, but the Oilers don't 
have Warren Moon anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Phillips, Denver: Son of Bum said on a Sunday morning pregame television 
confessional that he'd rather lose with dignity than win with the tactics used 
by the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips must be a mighty proud man today. John Elway's passing statistics be 
damned, it's mile-high time the Broncos give him the Denver boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Shula, Cincinnati: Is General Manager Mike Brown the only person who 
still thinks Dave will one day coach like Don? The Bengals put up a fight 
against New England, but fell a few players short to drop to 0-3, three games 
under .500 and $5 million under the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Marchibroda, Indianapolis: Still needs only two wins to guarantee his 
contract for 1995, but learned in Sunday's loss to Pittsburgh that Marshall 
Faulk (61 yards rushing) can't do it all. The Colts have dropped two straight 
after an opening-day win. Remember, they passed twice on drafting quarterback 
Trent Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe GM Bill Tobin owes Mel Kiper Jr. an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 George Seifert, San Francisco: Despite a Super Bowl title and a 68-21 record 
entering play Sunday, some have actually suggested his job might be in jeopardy 
if he doesn't win the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Seifert got what he needed Sunday: the Rams. INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle running back Chris Warren left the game against San Diego with a bone 
chip in his elbow but returned later. New Orleans' quarterback Jim Everett 
completed 10 of 19 passes for 108 yards in the first half before leaving with a 
groin injury and hip pointer. . . .Cleveland receiver Michael Jackson sat out 
his team's victory over Arizona because of a pulled hamstring. Browns' 
linebacker Carl Banks left in the first half because of a pulled groin, and 
center Steve Everitt left in the third quarter because of a sore right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami cornerback Muhammad Oliver, replacing the injured Troy Vincent, injured 
his right knee in the second half and missed the remainder of the game. Dolphin 
safety Gene Atkins re-injured his hamstring in the second half and didn't 
return. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're playing with our best people. We've just got to play better 
with them . "  
</P>
<P>
 -- Arizona Coach Buddy Ryan, following his team's 32-0 loss to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired of losing to the Jets. Tell all the New Yorkers that live down 
here that we kicked the Jets' butt."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Miami defensive back J.B. Brown, whose interception helped the Dolphins 
defeat the New York Jets for only the second time in the last seven tries. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's obviously going to be ... No, he IS one of the finest quarterbacks in 
the league right now. He has tremendous arm strength. He knows when to let the 
ball go when he's going to get hit."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Cincinnati Coach Dave Shula on New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who 
completed 30 of 50 passes fro 365 yards in the Patriots' 31-28 victory over the 
Bengals. TONIGHT'S GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit at Dallas 
</P>
<P>
 6 p.m., Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Rodney Peete? Last year he was quarterbacking for the Lions. This 
year he has spilled Detroit's innermost secrets to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Peete won't be on the field tonight when the teams meet unless Troy Aikman 
gets hurt or there is a rout. Peete is being paid $1 million this year as 
injury insurance, backing up Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cowboys also get a bonus this week because of Peete's knowledge of the 
Lions' run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Peete started 47 games for the Lions and passed for more than 1,000 yards in 
each of his five NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can help the Cowboys most with the Lions personnel," he said. "I know who 
can beat whom, who you can throw deep, which linemen aren't good. The system 
has changed a little this year, but I pretty much know what they are going to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Peete said the main thing he told the Cowboys was to concentrate most of their 
efforts on stopping running back Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders has rushed for 136 yards in two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put so much emphasis on Barry that if a team stops him the rest of the 
team pretty much goes flat," Peete said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping the Cowboys' Emmitt Smith is something Detroit will have to do, and 
no one has been able to do it yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith entered this week's games on top of the NFL in rushing with 261 yards, 
averaging 4.5 yards a carry. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo's Andre Reed caught a 10-yard pass in the first quarter for the 600th 
of his career. Reed became one of 13 players to reach 600 catches. . . . By 
averting the shutout, the Oilers extended their string to 77 games without 
being shut out, dating to a 34-0 loss to Kansas City on Nov. 26, 1989. . . . 
New York Jet Art Monk extended to 167 his streak of consecutive games with at 
least one reception. . . . Miami's Keith Byars has caught passes in 106 games 
in a row. . . . Dan Marino has thrown at least one touchdown pass in his last 
16 games against the Jets. . . . Randall Cunningham had thrown 94 consecutive 
passes without an interception before Terrell Buckley picked him off in the end 
zone with 6:21 left in the first quarter. . . . The Packers' Chris Jacke still 
needs two field goals to become Green Bay's top career kicker. Chester Marcol 
had 120 field goals from 1972-80. . . . Sterling Sharpe caught six passes for 
108 yards for the 25th 100-yard game of his career, moving him past Don Hutson 
(24) into second place on the career Packer list behind James Lofton (32). . . 
. The Colts are 0-8 in Three Rivers Stadium. . . . Neil O'Donnell's 
interception in the third quarter was the Steelers' first turnover this season 
and was his first interception in 165 attempts. . . . The Colts have the two 
longest fumble returns in their history the last three weeks. Quentin Coryatt's 
78-yarder Sunday bettered Tony Bennett's 75-yarder against Houston in the 
season opener. . . . The Steelers are 16-3 when Barry Foster gains at least 100 
yards. . . . Foster's 179 yards matched the second-highest game ever against 
the Colts. The Rams' Dan Towler had 205 yards in 1953. The Lions' Barry Sanders 
also had 179 yards in 1991. . . . Eric Green has 21 touchdowns in just over 
four seasons, breaking the Steelers' record for a tight end held by Bennie 
Cunningham (20). . . . Eric Turner's 93-yard interception return in the fourth 
quarter was the second-longest in Cleveland history, behind a 97-yarder by 
Najee Mustafaa against Miami last year. . . . Monte Coleman tied Dave Butz for 
second place on the Redskins' list of games played at 203. Art Monk, now with 
the Jets, is the leader with 205. . . . This is the 10th time in their 70-year 
history the Giants have opened 3-0. . . . Stan Humphries (6,130) moved to 
third, past Jack Kemp (5,996), on San Diego's all-time passing yardage list 
behind Dan Fouts (43,040) and John Hadl (26,938). . . . Chris Warren of the 
Seahawks set a club record by rushing for a touchdown in his sixth consecutive 
game. The previous mark was five in a row by Curt Warner in 1983. . . . Eugene 
Robinson had six tackles for Seattle, giving him 812 for his career, one shy of 
the team record held by Keith Butler (1978-87). . . . Denver quarterback John 
Elway has a 6-15 record as a starter against the Raiders. CHANNEL SURFING 
</P>
<P>
 The surest way to success in sports broadcasting? Forget the Columbia School 
of Journalism. Get a degree from the National League of Football. 
</P>
<P>
 Former NFL coaches and players are tripping over each other on the Sunday 
morning airways: Jimmy Johnson, Joe Gibbs, Mike Ditka, Howie Long, Terry 
Bradshaw, Phil Simms, James Lofton, Tom Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it would be cynical to suggest some of these "reporters" were often 
critical of the media before joining ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Johnson, sportswriter Skip Bayless said on Sunday morning's ESPN show, "The 
Sports Reporters": "He used to suggest to writers and broadcasters that they 
get real jobs. Now I suggest he do the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Sunday, Johnson filed his Fox pregame report pool-side at home in south 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalism sometimes gets tricky, though. Fox's Long, a made-for-TV former 
jock, predicted doom for Cleveland quarterback Vinny Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look for Testaverde to be replaced," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 Testaverde passed for two touchdowns and rushed for another in the Browns' 
32-0 victory over Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scoop" Ditka had better luck. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Chicago Bear coach was dead on in his pregame chide of Buddy Ryan's 
knee-jerk decision to switch quarterbacks this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditka suggested Ryan, a former Bear defensive coordinator under Ditka, was to 
blame, not the quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sid Luckman couldn't run this offense," Ditka said. BIG DUDDY? 
</P>
<P>
 He was the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft. An instant impact player out of Ohio 
State. A 6-foot-5, 300-pound can't-miss behemoth. The Cincinnati Bengals paid 
defensive lineman Dan Wilkinson $14.4 million to wreak havoc and help return 
the hapless Bengals to respectability. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still early, but so far the Bengals are winless and Wilkinson has pretty 
much been missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bengals' 31-28 loss to New England, Wilkinson recorded only one tackle, 
which came with 8:30 remaining and drew a bronx cheer from the home crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson has five tackles and one assist in three games. MISTY WATER-COLORED 
MEMORIES 
</P>
<P>
 In celebration of the NFL's 75th anniversary, teams wore uniforms from a 
significant period in the franchise's history. The Miami Dolphins, for example, 
donned the uniforms they wore in 1972, when they were 17-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviews are in: William (Refrigerator) Perry of the Philadelphia Eagles 
looked just as heavy in his "throwback" uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no discernible difference between the Browns' uniforms of today and 
the ones they wore in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of the lot? San Diego, circa 1961, the Rams of 1951 and the New 
Orleans Saints' inaugural uniforms of 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst? A tie between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Green Bay Packers, whose 
throwbacks looked like junior varsity high school hand-me-downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Chicago Bear 1926 uniforms -- orange pinstripes on blue jersey with gold 
pants -- were also eyesores and didn't even serve as a distraction in 
Minnesota's 42-14 victory over Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe said he didn't get caught up in the 
nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we got on the field, I really didn't notice it," Bledsoe said. "The only 
time I noticed was when I looked up to see a replay on the scoreboard and saw 
myself. That looked really weird." HOW THEY STAND

TO HELL AND BACK WITH ROD STEIGER; RECOVERY: APPEARING AT UCI, THE ACTOR TALKS 
ABOUT HIS CAREER AND HOW IT ALMOST ENDED BECAUSE OF CLINICAL DEPRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By M.E. WARREN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Picture Rod Steiger. The Oscar-winning actor is still solidly built, powerful 
looking, at age 69. His head is shaved clean. His brown eyes come at you like 
magnetic tractor beams out of a jowly face that softens magically when he 
smiles. But don't picture him smiling. Picture him as "the kind of guy who goes 
into a bar and everybody tries to sneak out the back." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a role that the star of "On the Waterfront," "The Pawnbroker" and "In 
the Heat of the Night" has taken on? No. This is the person Steiger says he 
probably would have become, if he hadn't become an actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Or picture him unshaven, unwashed, unspeaking, sitting in a stupor staring at 
the ocean day in and day out for years. This is the Rod Steiger who suffered 
from clinical depression, before drug therapy rendered his disease manageable 
and allowed him to live again. 
</P>
<P>
 On stage at the Irvine Barclay Theatre on Saturday night, Steiger shared these 
and many other visions of his personal life and creativity to benefit the UCI 
Brain Imaging Center, which produced "An Evening with Rod Steiger" in 
association with the National Alliance for Research in Schizophrenia and 
Depression (NARSAD). 
</P>
<P>
 Steiger first came to be associated with the BIC last year when he received 
its Silver Ribbon Award for his unstinting efforts to eliminate the stigma of 
mental disease. He has testified before Congress. He has spoken candidly many 
times on television and on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Few audiences could have been better primed to receive his message than the 
one at the Barclay, where silver ribbons glinted from nearly every lapel. It 
was a crowd of psychiatrists, researchers, nurses, activists, fans, but more 
than anything else, a gathering of people whose personal lives had been 
rerouted by the tragedy of mental illness. They gave Steiger a standing ovation 
when he came in, to which he quipped: "I didn't know I had that many 
relatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Answering questions from Prof. Richard Brown, who hosts an interview program 
on the American Movie Classics channel, Steiger amply embodied his own 
definition of an actor as a mobile poet. Ensconced in an armchair, he 
nonetheless communicated passionately, humorously and articulately on his life. 
His powerful voice threatened to overwhelm the audio equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture Rod Steiger as a member of Spanky and Our Gang. As Spanky himself, in 
fact. There was a national competition for the role into which young Rod was 
entered, "in a big straw hat, a diaper and a giant pin. And I won!" he boomed, 
looking surprised. "I was supposed to go to Hollywood the next day, but I had a 
big boil on my rear end. I fell down some stairs and burst the boil, got a 
fever and couldn't go. They used the runner-up, and it's the best thing that 
ever happened to me . . . Or you!" he added, fixing the crowd with his 
laser-lock eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until years later, after a stint in the military, that he stumbled 
into his calling. 
</P>
<P>
 He told of filing used checks in a civil service office, a block-long building 
that employed thousands. He and the boys found out where all the good-looking 
girls were spending their Thursday nights. There was a social program, a little 
theater group. "Need I say how we descended?" Steiger growled, rising from his 
chair, his hands extended like great bear paws. "I didn't want to be an actor. 
I wanted to do something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Fate had plans for him, however -- a cheap rooming house in Manhattan, acting 
lessons, and eventually stardom. Fate also pulled him into the "stinking, icy 
swamp" of chemical depression. 
</P>
<P>
 After a heart bypass operation in 1979, something went wrong. He has a 
"private theory" that the anesthesia given him during the surgery may have 
triggered the depression he has suffered ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mind is so impressionable," he said, shaking his head. "The man said to 
me, 'You might have a small depression.' " Steiger looked at the audience. "You 
think I do anything small?" he asked to a roar of laughter. This is an actor 
who has played Capone, Napoleon and Pope John. "Small" is not an adjective that 
springs to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he loves playing historical characters. Far from being intimidated by 
comparison with the original, he said, he relishes the opportunity for a kind 
of spiritual fusion. "Suppose you're playing Beethoven. If for even a split 
second you can feel the way Beethoven felt -- that is such a high! There's no 
narcotic can match it."  
</P>
<P>
 Researching these roles, he added, has given him a better education than most 
people have, in spite of his one year of high school. "When I was a kid, we had 
to go to art appreciation. Rembrandt," he sighed. "I was from Newark. I thought 
Rembrandt was a delicatessen downtown. Yeah, next to Gauguin, the clothes 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 He grew to become an actor whose performances would synthesize paintings, 
symphonies, poetry. Picasso's "Guernica" inspired the famous "silent scream" in 
Steiger's majestic performance as a Holocaust survivor in "The Pawnbroker." 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw 'Guernica' years ago in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and 
Picasso has those women in profile and their tongues come out about this far 
and they're sharp, like tacks. That was the loudest damn scream I had ever 
heard." 
</P>
<P>
 When the time came to shoot the scene, and the script said "he screams," "I 
put my head back and I thought of 'Guernica' and my instinct said 'Don't you 
make a sound. It's the loudest damn scream you've ever done.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That scene, one of several in a series of clips that started the program, 
epitomized a very different kind of silence from the one which engulfed Steiger 
for eight years in the depths of his depression. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't want to get out of bed. When he would come downstairs, he said, he 
would mutter "good morning" to his wife, sit and stare at the tea and bagel she 
would bring him, lose himself in the view of the ocean for eight hours, then 
mutter "good night" and go back to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by a sense of survival, he sought help. "I did one-on-one (therapy) for 
a while . . . then a group." Neither helped very much. "I was doing a picture 
and waking up every morning with icy perspiration. I didn't think I could act 
anymore. I couldn't talk to anybody, because the worst thing you could do in 
this town is admit weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he discovered psychopharmacology. He takes medication now, nightly, 
"whether I like it or not." But he says it's "only oil on the water. There are 
always some days that are scary -- when the water pops through the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky," he pointed out. "I had the money to bounce around for a while. 
I don't know what poorer people do." 
</P>
<P>
 He then recalled that a doctor once told him what poorer people do: "They kill 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiger said he was donating his services to the BIC/NARSAD fund-raising 
effort because they are doing the kind of research and producing the kinds of 
drugs that have kept him and many others from seeking that desperate solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big disease," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled reading a poem about it before a congressional committee and later 
on the air for CNN where he dared them to keep the camera on his face for the 
whole five pages. "And I warn you," he had challenged them, "I can barely get 
through it. I break down." Afterward, he said, they received more than 100 
phone calls per hour for days. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the cause has come to mean more to him than his acting does. But 
again, fate has her plans. Steiger's career is going through a rebirth. He is 
on his way to Toronto to shoot a film about Margaret Sanger in which he plays 
her nemesis, a religious fanatic. His film "The Specialist," in which he 
co-stars with Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone and James Woods, is due in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Specialist' is like a $60 million commercial for me," he chortled. " 
'Hey,' it's saying, 'He's still alive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Alive." It's too small a word for the likes of Rod Steiger.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; 'QUIZ SHOW': THE PATTERN STILL LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Redford's "Quiz Show" is almost as entertaining as the fraudulent 
television it depicts. Like its subject, though, it doesn't tell the entire 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The just-released movie spans the late 1950s, when scores of TV quiz shows 
were a diverting ritual and a catharsis for a nation experiencing its most 
severe recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 TV's big payoffs to ordinary citizens were a vicarious release at a time of 
ebbing prosperity, just as movies had brightened the gray lives of Americans in 
the 1930s during the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder, then, that such live quiz shows were the soul of prime time during 
this period, with the likes of "Twenty-One" and "The $64,000 Question" zooming 
to such dizzying heights of popularity that one particularly edgy episode of 
the latter show attracted a whopping 84% of the households with TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
 The golden bubble exploded in 1958 with disclosures that some of the shows 
were rigged, and a year later the celebrated Charles Van Doren confessed that 
even he -- the wavy-haired academic whose heroic run on "Twenty-One" made him a 
national poster boy -- had been fed answers by the producers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Quiz Show," how ironic that a movie so judgmental about the TV 
industry's dishonesty in the 1950s should itself play loose with the truth for 
the sake of putting on a good show. Given its omissions and distortions, its 
moral tone is unbecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a section of Richard N. Goodwin's book, "Remembering America," the 
movie to a large extent narrows the widespread scandals to a personal duel 
between Van Doren and Goodwin, then a young attorney interrogating witnesses 
for the congressional subcommittee investigating the fixes. Although this 
"Columbo" device serves Paul Attanasio's screenplay, it vastly overstates 
Goodwin's role in the case and in exposing Van Doren. 
</P>
<P>
 Some dramatic license is unavoidable; you expect and accept it. Yet one could 
argue that Redford's movie -- in apparently making up some dialogue for the 
sake of drama (talks between Van Doren and his poet father, Mark Van Doren, for 
example) -- is no less crooked than the TV hoaxers it portrays. How can one set 
of deceits be appropriate while another is not? 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the movie's laser focus on "Twenty-One" conspirators give a sense of 
how many quiz shows were on the air -- from giant prime-time spectaculars to 
the likes of "Brains and Brawn," "Music Bingo" and "Haggis Baggis" -- so deep 
was their penetration into the American psyche and so widespread was the 
cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's marvelous how long it went on, considering the number of Americans who 
had to be corrupted to keep the camera whirring," the New Yorker magazine wrote 
after the lid had blown off the scandals. "We are fascinated by the 
unimaginably tactful and delicate process whereby the housewife next door was 
transfigured into a paid cheat." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's prevailing wisdom is that the quiz scandals somehow robbed the nation 
of its innocence -- a questionable thesis given that, only a few years later, 
Americans naively allowed their government to involve them in Vietnam, as if 
"Twenty-One" host Jack Barry and executive producer Dan Enright were in the 
Oval Office instead of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The more fascinating question -- one unasked by "Quiz Show" -- is why dozens 
of essentially decent, upstanding, ordinary Americans knowingly participated in 
these scams, presumably ignoring their values and allowing themselves to be 
co-opted. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the relatively few participants who lied to a New York grand jury, 
no one broke any laws, making this a hoax without any real victims. Yet these 
people, from all across the country, were cheats, pretending to be something 
they weren't. Did they do it purely for money? For fame? Or was it that 
television appeared so unreal to them that their own participation seemed 
benign? 
</P>
<P>
 Some viewers appeared to feel that way. In fact, some contestants were either 
ignored, belittled or reproached when they sought to blow the whistle on the 
shows. "Why in the hell did you wanna get up and blab your big mouth for?" 
Tennessean C.E. (Stoney) Jackson, a former clergyman, recalled being asked by a 
fellow townsperson after publicly confessing to getting help from the producers 
in winning $20,000 on "The $64,000 Question" and "The $64,000 Challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 The question being asked today, even with legislation now forbidding such 
practices, is whether it could happen again. The answer? It is happening again. 
</P>
<P>
 Not on the few remaining quiz shows, but surely in other areas of television. 
That includes the built-in deceit of some daytime talk shows, whose theatrics 
make "Twenty-One" look like amateur night, and where spectacle is valued over 
honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "20/20" reported Friday, for example, that a "Ricki Lake" producer urged 
three guests to "ham it up" when telling a story about their "gay love 
triangle" (which they now say they concocted). According to one of the trio, 
the producer told him in advance to "play with the audience, but don't do too 
much, and don't forget to bring in scandal, and we want to make it look like . 
. . Mitch is jealous." He claimed that the producer even fed him a titillating 
line to say in front of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 And consider the case of Jerome Stanfield, whose claim of raping 90 
prostitutes in a two-year period became a "Montel Williams" two-parter that was 
aired even though Stanfield had claimed after the taping that he was lying and 
police could find nothing to verify his rape-rampage story. Stanfield charged 
on "20/20" that the Williams show knew "from the start" that his story was a 
"fabrication." The show denies the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the case, TV fibs in so many other ways: deceptive infomercials 
designed to resemble regular programs, faux network documentaries such as "The 
Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark" on CBS, local news programs that air promos 
that intentionally mislead or are presented as news stories. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest example of the latter came last Thursday when a KNBC-TV Channel 4 
evening newscast gave several minutes to a "story" about "Extra" anchor Arthel 
Neville's story about NBC's "Frasier" and its star, Kelsey Grammer. A story 
about a story? It was the daily double, advertising both Channel 4's new 
syndicated series "Extra" and one of its prime-time series under the guise of 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 So widespread are these practices that viewers have become desensitized to 
them, few appearing to care that the ethical vacuum in television today is 
every bit as large as it was during the quiz show scandals. 
</P>
<P>

PLAYBOY FEST TO OFFER RARE JAZZ FOOTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first-ever Playboy Jazz Film Festival, coming next week to the Laemmle 
Sunset-5 Theatres in West Hollywood, will feature the world theatrical premiere 
of "A Great Day of Harlem," which chronicles the 1958 gathering in New York 
City of dozens of America's jazz legends for a magazine photograph, a rarely 
seen documentary on the immortal Bix Beiderbecke and "Let's Get Lost," the 
definitive and highly intense documentary on the life of trumpeter Chet Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, entitled "Bix to Bird," will offer classic jazz features, 
documentaries and short subjects. According to Hugh M. Hefner, the founder of 
Playboy Magazine and the festival's executive producer, the festival represents 
a nationwide search for the best and most historically significant jazz films 
available through both formal archives and private collections.  
</P>
<P>
 "With the Playboy Jazz Film Festival, we will be able to share with jazz fans 
the cinematic record of the roots of this uniquely American music, from 
Dixieland to Bebop -- the music of the 1920s, '30s, '40s and '50s," Hefner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual presentations will be shown on two separate screens in a 
variety of formats. Selected short subjects will accompany many of the 
features. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of the festival's feature schedule follow: 
</P>
<P>
 TUESDAY, SEPT. 27 3:30 p.m. * "Glenn Miller: America's Musical Hero": This 
documentary traces Miller's career, from his early days as a Dixieland-style 
jazz trombonist to his peak years as one of the most popular dance band leaders 
of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Swing Swing Swing": This 1985 movie is the story of a group of middle-age, 
middle-class musicians who play for their own entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 6:30 p.m. * "Bird": Clint Eastwood's film stars Forest Whitaker in a dark and 
moody portrait of the great improviser, Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Great Day in Harlem": In the fall of 1958, 60 legends of jazz gathered in 
Harlem to have their group picture taken for an Esquire Magazine feature on 
jazz. This documentary is the story of that photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Jazz Portrait: Joe Williams": Williams, one of the greatest remaining jazz 
and blues singers tells his story and performs with Gerald Wiggins, Harry 
(Sweets) Edison and others. 
</P>
<P>
 9:30 p.m. * "Lookout Sister": This 1948 film, produced for theaters catering 
to all-black audiences, features Louis Jordan who has been called one of the 
greatest black musical entertainers ever. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Satchmo": The life of Louis Armstrong, arguably the most influential 
musician in the history of jazz, is featured in this 1989 documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 WEDNESDAY, SEPT, 28 3:30 p.m. * "Celebrating Bird": Charlie Parker's complex 
life and rich musical legacy are examined in this documentary.

immortal Bix Beiderbecke. 
</P>
<P>
 6:30 p.m. * "Let's Get Lost": The life of Chet Baker as told by the filmmaker 
Bruce Weber. This documentary probably tells us as much about Weber as it does 
about Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bix: Interpretation of a Legend": This 1991 feature shares both the tragedy 
of his short life (Beiderbecke died at the age of 27) and the triumph of his 
music. This is an uncut version of a rare film that has never been released in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 9:30 p.m. * "Blues Banquet": Drawing on a wide variety of sources, film

</P>

from the lives of Bud Powell and Lester Young and features Dexter Gordon in the 
starring role. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lady Day: The Many Faces of Billie Holiday": Holiday's troubled life, which 
nevertheless produced music of astounding depth, sensitivity and power, is 
examined in this 1991 documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 9:30 p.m. * "A Duke Named Ellington": This 1988 documentary is believed by 
many to be one of the best on Duke Ellington.

FREE ROCK ON MONDAY: TOO GOOD TO LAST?; POP MUSIC: FIRST, CLUB LINGERIE TRIED 
IT. THEN THE WHISKY AND HELL'S GATE. WITH ALL THE COMPETITION, THEY MIGHT 
SELF-DESTRUCT.

<P>
 It's an L.A. anomaly that the best nights to venture into clubland have never 
been Friday or Saturday, the reigning philosophy among scenesters being that 
weekends in Hollywood are for amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Mondays of late have been the night not to miss. And for good 
reason. That's when three venues -- Club Lingerie, the Whisky and Hell's Gate 
-- each let you sample up to a half dozen of the city's most promising 
alternative acts. Bonus: the shows are free. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, while the rest of the world is either watching football or cursing 
Monday's name before tucking in by 10 p.m., alternative music fans are just 
gearing up for an eventful night out. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, for example, you can see the Dead Pets and Loungefly at Club Lingerie 
or Dashboard Prophets and Michael Petak at the Whisky. Looking ahead, Hell's 
Gate, whose free-admission policy is only offered the second and fourth Mondays 
of the month, is showcasing the Jigsaw Seen and Ultraviolet Eye on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 If it sounds too good to be true, it may be. The slice of slacker heaven may 
be a victim of its own success. 
</P>
<P>
 The free showcase concept was popularized in recent years at Club Lingerie, 
where the theme night was titled Gashouse. The Whisky and Hell's Gate joined 
the action in June -- complete with their own theme names: Bianca's Hole and 
Bubblegum Crisis respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers fear that all this competition may self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imitation is the highest form of flattery, but there are only so many 
(alternative clubgoers), and if you cut that up, there isn't going to be any 
scene," says Mary Nixon, the 33-year-old promoter behind the Lingerie's Monday 
series.  
</P>
<P>
 Kim Adams, the Whisky's in-house promoter, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to laugh at that," says Adams. "If L.A. can't sustain three places 
then . . . the music scene is dead. And since it's not dead, I don't see a 
problem with it at all. We live in L.A., not Boise, Idaho. People drive out 
here from Riverside, Orange County, San Bernardino, just to come to the clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old promoter denies stealing Club Lingerie's recipe. Adams says 
the Whisky introduced its Monday night showcase as a way to attract the 
under-21 crowd that composes much of the fan base for alternative rock music. 
(The other two clubs have 21-and-over policies.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The style of music is changing so fast, which is also changing the audience," 
she says. "Kids are out there buying all the Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Green 
Day records. They can come out and see the new bands." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Base, one of the promoters at Hell's Gate -- the new moniker for Club 
Maxx on Yucca Street -- says he's not concerned with what happens at the Whisky 
and Lingerie. He's just trying to find something that works. "We just want to 
get people to take a risk checking out music they might not know," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But longtime supporters of Club Lingerie worry about the competition. On a 
recent Monday, there wasn't the usual line of clubgoers stretching far down 
Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why couldn't the Whisky have done a free Tuesday or Wednesday?" asks Erin 
Cook, a regular at Lingerie on Mondays. "While they were still doing 
pay-to-play, Lingerie was giving us something good for free."  
</P>
<P>
 Complains promoter Nixon: "(The Whisky) is trying to empty my club out every 
Monday. Adams didn't go after creating her own night; she just wants the 
business that I've taken four years to build." 
</P>
<P>
 In that time, fans have been able to see, for free, bands such as Tool, 4 Non 
Blondes and Rage Against the Machine at Club Lingerie. Among current faves who 
play the club: Weezer (which just released an album on Geffen Records), the 
Dashboard Prophets, 1,000 Mona Lisas, Loungefly and Careless. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other Club Lingerie regulars, the popular Dashboard Prophets say 
they were hesitant when first approached to play Mondays at the Whisky. Despite 
a sense of loyalty to Club Lingerie, they finally agreed to tonight's gig. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Club Lingerie) wasn't popular just 'cause it was free," says Chris Dye, the 
Prophets' lead singer and guitarist. "Mary booked bands from a certain scene 
and helped to actually create the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, we refused and refused to play the Whisky on Mondays. They 
had nothing to do with (building) the scene and everybody knows that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the opportunity to play an all-ages show, coupled with the Whisky's 
excellent sound system, proved to be too enticing for the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The news disappointed Nixon.  
</P>
<P>
 "In another six months, all the rooms are going to be empty," she warns. "They 
don't understand that something is special only if there's one of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Counters the Whisky's Adams: "I didn't start doing this by saying, 'I'm going 
to put (Nixon) out of business.' If there's a good band I want to see, I'll go 
there too." 
</P>

ANN CONWAY: DRESSING THE PART; OPERA BOOSTERS WILL DON GARB OF FAVORITE 
CHARACTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So you think an opera ball is all about arias, white-tie and tails and 
bejeweled matrons making grand entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 Think again. When Opera Pacific stages its 12th annual gala at the Hyatt 
Regency in Irvine on Oct. 29, about 500 guests will dress as characters from 
their favorite opera, dance to the music of the Stonebridge orchestra and, 
well, have a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think opera balls are about a bunch of stuffy people at a stuffy 
event," says Barbara Venezia, gala co-chairwoman with Laila Conlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "But our ball is about fun. We're inviting guests to come as opera characters 
because our ball is just around the corner from Halloween -- perfect for an 
opera-style masquerade." 
</P>
<P>
 The $175-per-person gala will be staged with an enchanted garden theme, where 
gala-goers, who have the option of wearing costume or attire appropriate to a 
black-tie affair, will mingle among spraying fountains, stately columns, carved 
stone benches and greenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the second in a series of ball-booster events was staged at the 
Hyatt Regency when Mary Ann Wells and Mary Lou Hornsby coordinated a 
luncheon-fashion show featuring clothes by David Hayes from I. Magnin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opera can be a hard sell," whispered Wells, a society maven from Newport 
Beach. "So Mary Lou and I have tried to make this luncheon a beautiful little 
preview of the ball. We want everybody here to attend the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Tall floral centerpieces -- done in the colors of "a peacock's tail" explained 
committee member Cerise Feeley -- were accented by jeweled and glittered masks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tables and chairs were draped in flowing black skirts -- an ultra-dramatic 
touch for a midday get-together. "We wanted drama," explained Wells. (And they 
wanted to cover up the Hyatt's new ballroom carpeting -- a nightmare of 
cavorting swirls -- explained a committee member.) 
</P>
<P>
 On hand to advise guests on appropriate ball attire was Noddie Weltner, 
fashion director of I. Magnin at Fashion Island in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 She loves the idea of an opera masquerade ball. "But the important thing for 
guests is not to look like they're on their way to a Halloween party," Weltner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to look regal and elegant at a ball, so, for an opera character 
masquerade, it would be clever to use a lovely gown that suggests a general 
idea, then top if off with a headpiece that would give you a costume effect ." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Hardin, for one, can't wait to dress for the ball or for the opening 
night "Supper on the Nile" gala on Oct. 1 that will follow Opera Pacific's 
production of "Aida" in Segerstrom Hall. (Hardin is co-chairing the "Nile" do 
with opera buff Marla Patterson.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I love tradition . . . dressing up for the opera season," said Hardin, who is 
known in society circles for her stylish evening ensembles. "Being a native 
Southern Californian who has always felt the influence of Hollywood glamour, I 
can't think any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want glamour and beauty around me. I think it's shame when people just want 
to brush it under the table and be too casual. It just doesn't seen like 
they're according the evening its proper respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests at the $75-per-person "Nile" gala, which is open to the public, will 
enjoy dancing and an alfresco sit-down supper taken at tables set with gold and 
silver palm trees surrounded by sparkling jewels. 
</P>
<P>
 Large palms on the orchestra stage will also help provide the Egyptian 
ambience, which will be highlighted by a huge suspended Tutankhamen mask and 
gold and silver streamers swagged in the shape of a pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This party is all about enjoying the excitement that marks the opening of the 
opera season," said Patterson (who confided she won't get too 'costumey' for 
the opera ball. "I plan to wear a gown and mask," she said.) "It is a very 
elegant time for Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 It also promises to be one of Opera Pacific's most popular seasons, opera 
director David DiChiera said last week at the I. Magnin fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Aida' is the grand opera of all grand operas. We're already far ahead of 
last year's opening-night ticket sales and subscriptions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask DiChiera "why opera?" and he'll tell you: "Opera is the consummate 
entertainment, because it brings all of the arts together. If one loves 
theater, music, then the combination of the two makes a whole that is greater 
than its parts." 
</P>
<P>
 "Aida" is one of world's favorite operas, according to DiChiera. "They say the 
three most popular operas are 'A,B,C -- Aida, Boheme and Carmen' and it's 
true."

BUILDING A NETWORK FOR BLACK LEADERSHIP; POLITICS: THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE 
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS PUTS THE PROBLEMS AND PROGRESS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS 
IN CENTER STAGE -- FOR A WEEK, ANYWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Congressional Black Caucus' 24th Annual Legislative Conference is ground 
zero of black political meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 From its epicenter in the serpentine lobby of the Washington Convention Center 
to its informal outposts in nearby hotel suites and cocktail lounges, the 
luminaries of black political life sparkle with the prestige that comes to 
those holding an elected or appointed position in the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 But to appreciate the glitz of this gathering, you must first understand 
something: For 51 weeks a year, few people beyond the limited and isolated 
world of inside-the-Washington-beltway know -- or, so it seems, care -- much 
about the African-American lawmakers on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 During this one special week, however, the Congressional Black Caucus 
Foundation -- a nonprofit educational and policy-making wing of the black 
lawmakers -- does its darndest to place the caucus at the hub of the political 
universe. For the 40 black caucus members -- 39 House members (including the 
non-voting delegate from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton) and 
one senator, Carol Mosely Braun of Illinois -- the conference, which ended late 
Saturday night, is a celebration of their existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are selected sights and sounds of black legislators and their friends at 
work and play: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.) glides past the bank of television cameras and the 
crush of well-wishers. He is late. The introductions of his colleagues seated 
on the riser are done as Mfume ascends to the head table. He prepares himself 
to deliver his 1994 Legislative State of Black America address, to officially 
open the five-day conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Mfume, chairman of the black caucus, is the most charismatic icon of the week 
and, perhaps, its most influential. His term ends in two months when the 
current legislative session closes. This speech -- with its references and 
quotations from President Abraham Lincoln, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and 
the Hon. Elijah Muhammad -- is his valedictory address. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike many in this room," he says, his almond-shaped eyes narrowing into 
slits, "I came out of a disjointed family structure. I grew up in the worst 
possible conditions: I became homeless after my mother's death, hit the streets 
and dropped out of school, flirted with every temptation that was around, 
became a teen parent before my time, felt left out and victimized." 
</P>
<P>
 Life turned around "because of a blessing . . . (I) found myself," he says. 
And the challenge of the black caucus is to live up to its conference theme -- 
"Embracing Our Youth for a New Tomorrow" -- to reform political institutions so 
other young black people may live by his example. 
</P>
<P>
 Mfume adds that his tenure as leader of the black caucus was bittersweet. 
"Many Americans see the black caucus as this wide-eyed, crazy, pinko-Communist, 
liberal, twisted group that can't think for itself, that's out of step with 
everybody, everything and has nothing better to do except to stand up and to 
put forth and to advance positions." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact of the matter: "We exist because we have no choice," Mfume says. "We 
all would like to believe we could live to see the day there would not be a 
need for the Congressional Black Caucus. Ladies and gentlemen, that day has not 
arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This year's conclave is special because the caucus membership is swollen with 
new-found influence and power -- indeed, black federal lawmakers in the age of 
Clintonian governance are a growth industry, enjoying a historic, high-water 
mark for black political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, when the Congressional Black Caucus was organized, there were 13 
members, a record achievement unmatched since Reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,700 people attended the first CBC legislative dinner held in 1971 
at the Sheraton-Park Hotel in Washington. Then as now, the affair was showy, 
causing concern among the organizers and participants that a $100-a-plate 
dinner "signaled a catering to rich corporations and the abandonment of our 
commitment to the poor," Rep. William Clay (D-Mo.) wrote in "Just Permanent 
Interests: Black Americans in Congress 1870-1991," his semi-autobiographical 
history of the Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Amelia Parker, CBC executive director, calculated off the top of her head that 
25,000 people would participate in conference activities. Allowing for multiple 
counting (assuming everyone does everything every day), her figure jibes with 
an unofficial estimate of 5,000 registrants for the week of panel discussions, 
receptions and meals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Busy with other matters, Parker is in no mood to answer questions or sit still 
for an interview. But when asked about how difficult it would be for people to 
get tickets to the convention-sponsored events, Parker stops in her tracks to 
set the record straight. From the earliest days down to the present, 
suggestions of elitism at its annual meetings will extract a rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 67 events at this convention, all of them are free and open to the 
public except three of our fund-raising events," she says. "There are brain 
trusts (meetings) and panels on a wide range of issues that are intended to 
benefit and empower all African Americans, so it would do us a great disservice 
to only focus on how hard it is to get tickets to the fund-raisers." 
</P>
<P>
 There are, in fact, a wide array of activities, meetings and panel 
discussions. Most go unnoticed, Parker says, citing the Wednesday morning 
breakfast where caucus members served homeless people in a Washington shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Her unspoken message is loud and clear: the CBC does more than party during 
this week. Those fund-raisers -- two fashion shows, a cocktail reception and a 
black-tie awards dinner -- do draw the biggest crowds and most media attention, 
she notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But those events are the only way we can raise money for scholarships for 
young people," Parker says. "They pay for the educational and public policy 
activities of the caucus. It is most unfair to suggest that this is just about 
expensive partying when 99% of what happens is free." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard in a corridor: "I guess they think we're the X-generation because of 
our Malcolm X caps."  
</P>
<P>
 There are young people everywhere. Fraternity-boy types in power suits and 
kente-cloth neckties. High-school-aged girls jotting notes furiously on lined 
paper. Freshly minted professionals whispering into cellular telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 It is early morning and a spotlighted event is about to take place. Since Bill 
Clinton rode to the White House on town hall meetings aimed at young folks, it 
seems everybody is trying to corner that market with the same approach. 
CBC-style, it is a celebrity-attended discussion titled on "Generation X: Black 
Voices of Reason, Rage and Responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping faith with the convention theme and seeking to break perceptions held 
by many young blacks of Establishment leaders as out-of-touch old fogies, this 
convention struck a hip vogue. In addition to the Generation X town hall, there 
was a mentor lunch for 200 Washington-area high school students, a mock 
Congress where students from across the nation drafted and passed laws as 
though they were U.S. Representatives and workshops on issues such as hip-hop 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one dared arrive here without those ubiquitous 3-inch-by-2-inch slips of 
paper embossed with their name, title, phone number and, increasingly, e-mail 
address. Dealing business cards with one hand and raising a cocktail glass with 
the other is a skill conventioneers master early. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask DeNatalie Phillips, vice president for public relations at Atlanta-based 
World African Network, a 2-year-old firm that programs news about the African 
continent to U.S. cable providers. She draws business cards from her pocket 
faster than Billy the Kid unholstered his six-shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on line waiting to enter a ballroom where Vice President Gore spoke 
at a Democratic National Committee luncheon for the black lawmakers, Phillips 
shuffles cards to a variety of congressional aides, reporters, business 
executives and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had endless pockets, we would spend a lot of money on advertising," she 
says. "But we have to make the most of our limited resources. Hence, we come 
here to meet with key decision makers in African-American community. We're 
trying to maximize opportunities to meet with people who influence other 
African-American people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here," she says, "take my card."

JACK SMITH: ON FOOTBALL, WEDDINGS -- AND TEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday, my wife and I found out that not everything in urban 
life has turned sour. We can still be engrossed in some of the old rituals that 
make America dear. In the morning we went to a high school football game. In 
the afternoon we went to a wedding. The football game was at Pasadena 
Polytechnic. The opponents were Poly and the Brentwood junior varsity, for 
which my grandson Casey plays linebacker and running back, a job that keeps him 
on the field throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly was clearly superior. The final score was 32-6, or something like that. 
There was no scoreboard and I lost count. But there was a lot of huffing and 
puffing and bruising collisions. The Poly boys seemed bigger than ours, and I 
cringed whenever my grandson made a tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandstand was in the sun and was empty. We sat with a small crowd on 
benches across the field. Despite the scarcity of rooters, the Brentwood 
cheerleaders were indefatigable, shouting and kicking and leading yells. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was followed by a varsity game for which Brentwood's varsity 
cheerleaders, including my granddaughter Alison, took over. I don't know how 
that game came out. We had to get on to the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't have been more traditional. It was held in San Marino Community 
Church. When we entered, the church was filled with organ music: Bach, Purcell, 
Tchaikovsky. There were enormous bouquets of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The groom's parents and the bride's mother came down the aisle to the 
Meditation from "Thais." There was a vocal solo, Grieg's "Ich Liebe Dich," and 
then the processional of bridesmaids, groomsmen, flower girls, ring bearers and 
ushers. At this point my wife invariably cries. She doesn't know why. It's 
become part of the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect it's the flower girls that set her off. They are so pretty and so 
innocent in their white dresses and garlands of white flowers. Their behavior 
is solemn and restrained, but one can sense the mischief in restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, she may cry because she is reminded of her own wedding, so many years 
ago. She may think of the hardships it brought her, and, I hope, of the joy. 
Perhaps she cries because she knows it will not be all hearts and flowers for 
the bride. Or perhaps she cries because the ceremony itself is so beautiful, 
the vows so touching and the hope so abundant. 
</P>
<P>
 The bride, dressed traditionally all in white, came down the aisle on her 
father's arm to Wagner's triumphant Wedding March. I attended a wedding a few 
years ago in St. Sophia's Cathedral and wrote that the organ had played 
Wagner's Wedding March. I was shocked to receive a sarcastic letter from a 
couple (both lawyers) informing me that Wagner never wrote a wedding march -- 
that I must be thinking of Mendelssohn's. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course Wagner's Wedding March is the one we most often hear in America. It 
is played and sung at every wedding in every hamlet across the nation. I 
believe it comes from "Lohengrin," but every schoolchild knows that the words 
are "Here comes the bride, all dressed in white. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Next came Beethoven's glorious "Ode to Joy." The wedding couple ascended to 
the altar and Michael Horton sang the Lord's Prayer with such tender passion 
that it almost made a Christian of me. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional wedding ceremony followed, with two ministers officiating. 
There was the ring ceremony and then the newlyweds kissed -- rather longer than 
was necessary, I thought, but I haven't been just married for quite a long 
time, and I've forgotten what it's like. Then the young couple walked back up 
the aisle to Mendelssohn's stately recessional. 
</P>
<P>
 The bride, by the way, was Cynthia Camille Varga and her bridegroom was James 
Anthony Sabin. The parents of the groom were William and Ellen Sabin, and the 
parents of the bride were Dr. Alexander and Olive Varga. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the father of the bride is a mere functionary at a wedding; 
theoretically he gives the bride away, but of course modern women give 
themselves away. But I mention Dr. Varga because he probably paid for the 
wedding and for the sumptuous wedding feast that followed at the Varga home. 
</P>
<P>
 It was altogether a traditional and gratifying Saturday. I would have been 
happier if Brentwood had won the football game, but most of those boys still 
have wedding bells ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
 We know it will all turn out all right. 
</P>
<P>
 I had too much champagne at the reception, but that's what I do at weddings. 
My wife cries.

 Bonnie Carlson had invited a new gentleman friend over for a home-cooked 
dinner. Carlson, a 44-year-old resident of the Santa Clarita Valley, fixed 
pasta, simmered her special homemade tomato sauce, tossed a Caesar salad and 
put candles on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 The romantic spell was broken just after dinner, however, when her date, Greg 
Frank, 39, broached a delicate subject. "He asked whether I'd been married 
before," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, she had been married and divorced, Carlson told him. "Four times." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he had been divorced once, he understood how marriages can disintegrate. 
So they talked. And dated. And over Labor Day weekend -- two years after that 
candlelight dinner -- they wed in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson's after-dinner scenario reflects two facts of life for the multiply 
divorced, as this group is now called by researchers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fearing social stigma, they carefully choose whom to tell about their past. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite failures and caustic remarks, most remain committed to finding a 
lifelong spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 7% of divorced people in the United States have been through three 
or more marital splits, according to federal government estimates from 1988, 
the latest year for which statistics are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts have begun to monitor this group more closely and some say the figure 
could reach 10% this year. The reasons for the rise, they say, include no-fault 
divorce, which since becoming law more than two decades ago has made 
dissolution easier, and clinical papers suggesting a greater likelihood for 
divorce among those who have been through it before. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiple divorce is "the new scarlet letter," contends Patricia Emerson, a USC 
sociology graduate student who presented her study recently at the annual 
meeting of the American Sociological Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she says, those who have divorced several times face the same social 
stigma endured by those who divorced once a few generations ago. While she 
predicts that this stigma will fade eventually, she says it's still very much a 
part of life now. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies about multiple divorce have been scarce partly because the population 
has been small. Craig A. Everett, co-author with his wife, Sandra Volgy 
Everett, of "Healthy Divorce" (Jossey-Bass, 1994), recalls that his graduate 
students in the mid-'80s at Florida State University wanted to conduct such a 
study but could not gather enough subjects. Another barrier has been a 
reluctance to talk by those who have divorced many times. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Emerson embarked on her study, she promised confidentiality to her 12 
subjects -- all Los Angeles residents, 35 to 73, divorced three or more times, 
first married at age 17 to 25. Overall, the group was highly educated, with at 
least a high school diploma. More than half have college degrees or 
postgraduate degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the six men and six women were guaranteed anonymity, the floodgates 
opened. In two-hour interviews, they detailed their turmoil and experiences. 
Many said they had received support and encouragement from family and friends 
during each divorce. But once the tally had risen to three or more, the 
reaction from society in general was often not so tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 While celebrities seem to be forgiven for their inability to hold a marriage 
together, the everyday folks Emerson polled said they often heard rude comments 
by co-workers and bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, recently divorced, told Emerson: "I do not want to hear that old 
phrase 'three-time loser' one more time, from anybody! I hear it every once in 
a while . . . supposedly in jest, but it bothers me because somebody is saying 
that you are stupid, you made a mistake, and you made three of them." 
</P>
<P>
 To cope, many said they divide the world into those they can trust and those 
to whom they do not confide details about their past. 
</P>
<P>
 A common stereotype -- that multiply divorced people take marriage lightly -- 
was disputed. "They see a marriage as (until) death do us part, and that's 
their goal," whether the marriage is the first or the fifth, Emerson says. Many 
told her that they were opposed to living together before marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Splitting up does not get easier with practice, the subjects also said, even 
though friends would make such comments as, "Well, this divorce ought to be 
easy. You've done this before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some, but not all, of Emerson's findings are borne out in clinical practice, 
says Everett, now a Tucson family therapist who often counsels multiply 
divorced people. He and others say the stigma is already fading, partly because 
it is becoming more common. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not nearly so embarrassed (as in years past) to come into my 
office and say 'I've been divorced three times,' " says Dr. Robert M. Counts, a 
psychiatrist at New York University Medical Center and medical director of the 
Center for Marital and Family Therapy in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Second and third divorces began to dramatically show up in the overall 
divorce rate in 1986," Counts wrote in a recent article in the Journal of 
Divorce & Remarriage. The trend will continue for at least another 20 years and 
probably longer, says Counts, who has practiced psychiatry for 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 When statistics are analyzed for 1994, Counts says, "it is likely that 10% of 
divorces will be No. 3 or beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have experienced several divorces say they find truth in both 
Emerson's research and the therapists' observations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are uneasy, at least initially, about divulging their marital history to 
a new dating partner. Carlson tried to keep a sense of humor. She still laughs 
when she remembers reactions from new dates after hearing about her four prior 
marriages. "They either think, 'You're really good . . . ' or 'You're really 
baaad .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Young, a well-known Beverly Hills real estate broker, used to dread 
being asked about her divorces. "I'd hold up fingers, like a little kid 
(telling age)." Actually, Young, 59, would hold up one whole hand and another 
finger. But the stigma, she believes, has diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Fletcher, 46, a Burbank insurance broker who is in the midst of a divorce 
from his third wife, simply volunteers the information. "Most women say, 'Gee, 
you're such a nice guy. How did this happen?' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finding another partner is a typical goal. "In my experience, probably 90% are 
still hopeful about pursuing a new relationship," Everett says. It lends weight 
to the old saying, attributed to Samuel Johnson, that remarriage is "the 
triumph of hope over experience." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is hopeful. Fletcher is wary of taking the plunge again. 
"Today, I'd have to say 'No.' " But, he's quick to add, "I still believe in 
marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 Young's outlook is more the norm: "I'm looking for No. 7," she says brightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this perseverance mentally healthy? 
</P>
<P>
 Counts isn't so sure it's healthy for everyone. In his research, he has 
identified those he calls "divorce prone," who are surprisingly similar to 
never-married people he terms "marriage phobic." Both groups have difficulties 
with intimate relationships, he says, "but they manage the problem 
differently." The divorce-prone are more likely to bail out when they face a 
major challenge in the relationship; the marriage phobic simply avoid the whole 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether marriage-minded or not, experiencing a second or third divorce often 
leads to an intense personal assessment, family therapist Everett says. 
Carlson, for instance, examined the reasons for her four divorces before 
marrying for the fifth time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was brought up in a home where I was taught it is not right to live with 
someone," she says. The men she divorced, however, turned out "not to be the 
people I thought they were." Her many attempts at marriage are also tied, she 
believes, to "an overwhelming need for family life and a need to fit in," which 
she attributes to her discovery, at age 31, that she had been adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone contemplating marriage -- for the second time or the 10th -- would be 
wise to examine, as Carlson did, their motives and what caused past divorces, 
experts concur.  
</P>
<P>
 Counts, while acknowledging that some divorces are more the result of bad luck 
than bad judgment, stresses: "The problems will be repeated unless there is 
treatment to understand why they've made bad choices." Multiple Divorces

THREE TIMES DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE A LOSER

 People who have been married and divorced three or more times face a social 
stigma, some research suggests. Others say the stigma is fading quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the responses of single men and women, either divorced or never married, 
when asked: "Would you date a person divorced three times?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * "No. I am only 27, so I probably wouldn't date anyone beyond his mid 30s. 
And if he's been divorced three times by that time, it would make me nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Victoria Clayton, 27, single, Encino public relations account executive 
</P>
<P>
 * "Yes, I would take it as it goes and see what happens. I'd give it a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dennis J. Noor, 43, single, Hermosa Beach photographer and entrepreneur 
</P>
<P>
 * "Yes, I would. I give them credit for keeping on trying. You can fall in 
love more than once. As you . . . mature . . . different people appeal to you. 
I would prefer, though, that he not have 14 kids with each marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wendy Taylor, 49, divorced once, Redondo Beach, Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority 
</P>
<P>
 writer and editor 
</P>
<P>
 * "Yes, but I would be looking for a sense that the person had learned 
something from the three experiences. Then I would feel the value . . . was 
somewhat like having children. Anyone who's done either, had children or gotten 
divorced, has clearly been humbled." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Warren Farrell, 51, divorced once, Encinitas author, "The Myth of Male 
Power" and "Why Men Are The Way They Are" 
</P>
<P>
 * "If I wasn't in a relationship now, I would consider it. I wouldn't judge 
the person based only on whether they'd been married or not. My question would 
be, has the person repeated similar mistakes and is there a pattern? 
Unfortunately, we are unable to call past relationships for references."

SOMETIMES, EVEN GOOD PEOPLE MUST COEXIST WITH EVIL; SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS BY 
DAVID GUTERSON ; HARCOURT BRACE $21.95, 368 PAGES

 David Guterson's haunting first novel works on at least two levels. It gives 
us a puzzle to solve -- a whodunit complete with courtroom maneuvering and 
surprising turns of evidence -- and at the same time it offers us a mystery, 
something altogether richer and deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, off the island of San Piedro in Puget Sound, salmon fisherman Carl 
Heine is found drowned and entangled in his boat's gill net. It seems to be an 
accident. Soon, however, darker suspicions bubble to the surface, and a 
fisherman of Japanese descent, Kabuo Miyomoto, is put on trial for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Heine, the coroner discovers, has a fractured skull; before drowning, he hit 
his head on something, or was hit. Evidence confirms that Miyomoto boarded 
Heine's boat on the foggy night when he died -- a rare occurrence among these 
solitary and self-reliant men. Yet Miyomoto's initial statements to 
investigators failed to mention such a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Miyomoto had a motive for foul play. When San Piedro's Japanese 
population was interned in 1942, his parents had nearly paid off their mortgage 
on a seven-acre strawberry farm bought from Heine's parents. Heine's mother, 
Etta, promptly sold the land to another farmer. Stoic in the face of legalized 
injustice, Miyomoto and his wife, Hatsue, waited patiently to repurchase the 
farm when its owner grew old, but instead Heine bought it just before his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the puzzle: We are led to believe that Miyomoto, who fought with the 
legendary 442nd Regimental Combat Team in Europe, is an honorable man, although 
his stern bearing revives anti-Japanese prejudices that nine postwar years have 
only lightly buried. We are led to believe that distrust of whites -- his 
family and Hatsue's were shipped to the Manzanar camp in California's Owens 
Valley -- and guilt over the German soldiers he has killed make him accept his 
arrest as fate. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Miyomoto is innocent, why does a net of circumstantial evidence bind 
him as tightly as any struggling fish? 
</P>
<P>
 Ishmael Chambers covers the trial for San Piedro's newspaper, which he 
inherited from his father. A former Marine who lost an arm fighting the 
Japanese at Tarawa, Chambers was Hatsue's high school sweetheart; before her 
crowning as Strawberry Festival Princess in 1941, they secretly met and necked 
in a hollow cedar tree. From Manzanar, however, Hatsue wrote denying that she 
loved him, and in the Pacific he felt his love turn into hate. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, love and hate alike have faded. "You went numb, Ishmael," his mother 
tells him. "And you've stayed numb all these years."  
</P>
<P>
 Just as Miyomoto is obsessed with getting back the exact acreage that his 
family lost, so Chambers sleepwalks through life in the vague hope of 
reclaiming Hatsue. The contrast between these two obsessions -- one conscious 
and potentially fruitful, the other unconscious and debilitating -- is 
Guterson's main device for leading us into the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is: How can people in a small, tightly knit community be neighbors for 
generations, even love one another, yet be torn apart by racism? 
</P>
<P>
 During the three-day trial, an epochal snowstorm intensifies San Piedro's 
isolation. Island people, Chambers' father once told him, can't afford to make 
enemies.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one trod easily upon the emotions of another. . . . This was excellent and 
poor at the same time -- excellent because most people took care, poor because 
it meant an inbreeding of the spirit, too much held in, regret and silent 
brooding . . . fear of opening up." The ordeal of the storm, coupled with the 
shock of Heine's death, forces them to confront the past and cracks the ice of 
their reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Guterson (whose previous work includes a story collection, "The Country Ahead 
of Us, the Country Behind") convinces us that he knows or has researched 
everything essential here -- details of fishing, farming and lawyering; of 
Coast Guard and coroner's procedures; of Japanese American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 With a stately pace and an old-fashioned omniscient voice, he describes the 
beauty of the Puget Sound islands, the bloody chaos of Tarawa, the desolation 
of Manzanar and the inner life of every major character. 
</P>
<P>
 What he finds there is usually nobility. The only semi-villains are Etta 
Heine, a couple of FBI men and the anonymous callers who curse Chambers' father 
for his editorials defending the island's Japanese residents after Pearl 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone else -- Hatsue, Heine's widow, the judge, the sheriff, the aged 
defense attorney, tough and silent Heine himself -- is human and often 
admirable. 
</P>
<P>
 How can so many good people coexist with a major historical evil? The mystery 
remains even after the puzzle is satisfyingly solved.

RSVP; HUNTINGTON GALA BLOSSOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The setting was straight out of a 17th-Century painting. Besides the three 
dance floors, 100 dinner tables and more than 1,000 guests on the lawn of Henry 
E. and Arabella Huntington's 130-acre back yard, in clear view were the 
Huntingtons' illuminated beaux-arts mansion and 28 17th-Century garden statues 
on the North Vista, site of Saturday night's gala. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilies, roses, delphinium and ivy spilled out of urns on candle-lit tables 
covered with ivory satin. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the ball," said Renee Segerstrom, who, with her husband, Henry, first 
stopped to admire the Huntingtons' most famous possession, Thomas 
Gainsborough's portrait, "The Blue Boy."  
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Boy posed on the cover of the engraved, four-page invitation to the 
Blue Boy Ball, celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Huntington Library, Art 
Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino. The plume of his hat adorned 
the menu and place cards.  
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit institution -- beacon to both scholars and garden enthusiasts -- 
was established by the late Henry and Arabella Huntington with a trust 
indenture in 1919.  
</P>
<P>
 "On your 75th, you have to go for broke," said Huntington Overseer Maria 
Grant, as she sat down to the three-course dinner following cocktails on the 
mansion's south terrace. Timed with the pouring of Acacia Brut, 1988, Robert 
Erburu, chairman of the Huntington's Board of Trustees and chairman of the 
Times Mirror Co., led a toast that was followed by a pyrotechnic program that 
one wag said was "better than Dodger Stadium."  
</P>
<P>
 Not only was the main house aglow from the show in the sky behind it, but a 
facsimile of the Blue Boy shot up dramatically in flaming blue lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally dazzling was the announcement that the event surpassed its 
fund-raising goal of $250,000, earmarked for the conservation of the Italian 
garden statues, by an additional $500,000. The extra money will be used to 
establish a fund for conservation of the Huntington Botanical Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we had Henry looking down from above," said Boyd Smith, co-chairman 
of the gala with William Steele, who added: "I had never seen such an 
outpouring of support from some big name people in my life."  
</P>
<P>
 The event was sponsored by Tiffany & Co., J. P. Morgan and the Times Mirror 
Co., parent company of The Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 After the funding was promised, Huntington's historians discovered some "fun 
facts," as Tiffany's Western regional vice president John Petterson put it, 
including the address of Henry and Arabella Huntington's New York mansion. 
Their home at 727 5th Ave. is now Tiffany's flagship store. 
</P>
<P>
 In another anecdote, "Old J. P. Morgan" and Henry Huntington bid against each 
other for books when they were building their respective libraries, said Dennis 
Weatherstone, J. P. Morgan chairman and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were Mayor Richard Riordan and Nancy Daly, Alice O'Neill 
Avery, Lloyd Cotsen, Alice and Joe Coulombe, Jean Smith and Ross Barrett, 
Frances Brody and Peter Paanakker, Nancy and Leo Denlea, Andrea Van de Kamp and 
Marc Selwyn, Judi and Gordon Davidson, Cynthia and Henry Yost (who underwrote a 
patron reception for large contributors), Joyce and Kent Kresa, Louise Taper, 
Anne and Robert Wycoff, Huntington president Robert A. Skotheim and his wife 
Nadine, Anne and Michael Armstrong, Suzanne and Fred Rheinstein, and 75th 
anniversary committee chairman Mary Lou and George Boone.
