DANA PARSONS: FOR STUDENT WHO WAVED FAKE GUN, 1 STRIKE MAY BE OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a story about what our increasingly violent and dangerous society is 
doing to our collective wisdom and judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Roseli is a 17-year-old senior at Western High School in Anaheim. He's a 
three-year varsity water polo player and four-year trumpet player in the school 
band. In eighth grade, he won a prestigious John Philip Sousa award for 
outstanding bandsman. He's an average high school student, active in church, 
works as a busboy after school and has missed an inordinate number of classes 
this year because his single-parent mother has been on medical disability since 
last June and occasionally needs his help. Neither he nor his mother attempt to 
portray him as any kind of angel. "He's a typical 17-year-old kid," his mom 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 24, the school was giving a spring concert in the gym. Apparently a 
day or so earlier, the band teacher had asked whether any student had a toy 
popgun that the percussionist could use as a sound effect for a particular 
song. That night, one of the students brought an unloaded, handgun-sized BB 
gun, but it was quickly determined that it didn't make the requisite noise. As 
high schoolers will do, however, they passed the gun around and joked about 
having it in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Roseli arrived about 25 minutes late for the pre-concert warm-up. He 
started tuning his trumpet and plinked a note on the piano in the band room, 
until a campus security monitor, in charge in the band director's absence, told 
him to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened next is the nub of the matter. Partly for laughs and partly to 
irk the monitor, Rick got the empty BB gun and went back into the band room. 
Humorously, he says, he waved it around the room and, as if mockingly helping 
the monitor, said something like, "Everybody clear out!" He then said something 
to the monitor along the lines of, "Who was that yelling at me?" and pointed 
the gun in her general direction and, as he recalls, imitated Clint Eastwood 
doing a "Make my day" impression. He pulled the trigger, with the unloaded gun 
making its faint pop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right after it happened, it crossed my mind, 'That was pretty stupid,' Rick 
said. "Then I thought, everybody's laughing, so nobody was scared." Of the 
monitor, he said, "She didn't act scared, just extremely mad." Rick told his 
mother about it when he got home later and she said it was a stupid stunt. 
"Don't worry,"he says he told her, "everybody knew it was fake, it's no big 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick played the concert that night, a Thursday. He attended a church camp over 
the weekend and came to school the following Monday. On Tuesday, he was called 
to the principal's office and asked to write a statement about the incident. 
Later that day, he says, police arrived and read him his rights. He wasn't 
arrested but was told he was on five-day suspension for violating the policy 
against having a gun, either toy or fake, in his possession on school property. 
</P>
<P>
 That was March 1. Rick hasn't been back in class since. School officials 
indicate they are recommending expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials won't discuss the case, citing student confidentiality. At my 
request, Rick's mother, Frankie Repine, authorized Principal Warren Stephenson 
to discuss the case with me, but he chose not to. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson told me there's more than meets the eye but can't tell me what. 
Rick's attorney, Jack Fleischli, disagrees, saying he has seen all the school 
district reports on the situation and that the details don't vary significantly 
from Rick's version. 
</P>
<P>
 The district hasn't disputed, the lawyer says, that the band teacher 
authorized a student to bring a popgun to school for the concert. The teacher 
also saw the gun before the concert and knew it was on campus, Fleischli says. 
</P>
<P>
 I spent an hour with Rick this week. He concedes the impropriety of flashing 
the gun around the campus monitor. Fleischli says a school report notes that a 
young child was standing nearby, but Rick says he doesn't remember seeing a 
child. Had he caused a serious disturbance that night, he says, school 
officials could have pulled him from the concert on the spot. Besides, he says, 
no one said anything about the incident until five days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick concedes that the monitor may not have known the gun was a band prop. He 
concedes the stupidity of waving it at her, if only in her general direction. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the no-gun-on-campus rule: "Oh, yeah, I totally agree with that. My 
only beef is that the sign is telling me if you have a gun, real or fake, 
you're going to get in trouble. Now here's a teacher saying, 'Bring in a gun, 
please, for our song.' The fact that it was authorized and was going to be used 
in the piece makes it the same to me as my trumpet, the same as the drum. It 
puts it in the 'everybody knows it's here, everybody knows it's fake' 
category." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Rick to forget for a minute that the gun was requested by a teacher. 
What does he think about what happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "The most reasonable punishment, disregarding for a minute the fact that she 
authorized bringing the gun -- but on my actions alone -- would be a five-day 
suspension," he says. "I would think that would be reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of all, I want to graduate with my class. I spent four years working my 
butt off, 12 hours a day, coming in on Saturday for band. . . . I don't think 
this one little mistake should override four years of hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischli says the district is acting illegally by continuing the suspension 
without a formal hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what more, if anything, the district has on Rick. His mom and his 
lawyer said they told me the most damning things the district has told them, 
which don't sound very damning to me. 
</P>
<P>
 What may be at work here is the upshot of our current "three strikes and 
you're out" mentality. When it comes to students with guns, the mentality is 
one strike and you're out. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, that's fine. For the 1992-93 school year, Orange County districts 
reported more than 400 incidents of students with guns. The threat is real and 
should be dealt with decisively. 
</P>
<P>
 But in school officials' zeal or fear or concern -- call it what you will -- a 
zero-tolerance policy overlooks that all crimes are not created equal. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseli may have stupidly frightened a woman, but he knew the gun wasn't 
loaded. He wasn't brandishing it around other students who didn't know it was 
unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not the same as the kid who brings a gun to school. A prankster who 
doubles as a trumpet player isn't the kid a zero-tolerance policy should be out 
to get. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, this would have been a stupid prank. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still a stupid prank today. What's different is our fear of youth 
violence, which transported this incident to a level it doesn't warrant. And so 
Rick Roseli, who should be sitting in class for the final quarter of high 
school, sits at home, having his homework sent to him. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother asks: "Are we so intimidated because of what we're bombarded with 
on TV and in the news, associating our youth with gangs and killings, that a 
child can't even make a mistake now? Are we that frightened? It's scary."

 A motorcycle exhibit and street fair near the Dana Point Harbor on Saturday 
will be part of national weekend festivities for the third annual Ride for Kids 
to benefit pediatric brain tumor research. 
</P>
<P>
 The local event will run from noon to 5 p.m. at the Pavilion Lantern Bay, at 
Street of the Golden Lantern and Dana Point Harbor Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcycle expo will feature new and vintage two-wheelers. The featured 
motorcycle will be a 1965 Honda CB-450 Super Sport known as the "Black Bomber." 
</P>
<P>
 "With the help of the motorcycling community, we can give these children a 
second chance," said Mike Traynor, founder of the charity event, which will 
take place at 12 other locations across the country. "We're excited to continue 
our national effort to conquer this serious childhood disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Other benefit activities taking place during Saturday's event will be a fine 
art reception and a charity auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit ride from Dana Point to Del Mar Fairgrounds in San Diego County 
will follow on Sunday. Registration and breakfast will take place at 7 a.m. at 
Selva Road and Pacific Coast Highway, with riders leaving at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorcyclists must collect a $35-minimum donation to participate. Those

 Maybe Clinton could use a second-grader on his staff: Valerie Williams 
Zarrillo asked her class of second-graders at John C. Fremont School in 
Glendale to write essays on the topic, "If I Were President for a Day." 
</P>
<P>
 The students seemed to be up on current events, possibly more so than some of 
the President's older advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 One student, Dustin Boxer, is obviously a close follower of Bill Clinton. 
Dustin wrote, in part: "In the afternoon I would eat a cheeseburger." 
</P>
<P>
 Some other examples of political awareness:

 * Whitewater influence: "I do taxes and read papers and then I watch the news 
again to see what happened." (Emineh Noravian) 
</P>
<P>
 * The Reagan influence: "In the afternoon, I do my check signing. I take a 
nap." (Jorge Alvarez) 
</P>
<P>
 * The Socks influence: "In the evening I would take a shower and I would get 
my bajamas on and I would get my cat -- well, if the President is allowed." 
(Michael Johnson)  
</P>
<P>
 * The Quayle influence: "In the evening working doing statistics on the 
computer and typing and doing papers and talking to the Vis President and 
testing him." (Corey Golden)

 Abe! We're shocked!We recently published a photo of some Downtown 
demonstrators standing alongside Abe Lincoln's statue while brandishing signs 
that said, "Down with Dirty Movies" and "Hollywood Repent." It was an 
inadvertent juxtaposition -- the picketers were protesting the nearby Academy 
Awards, not Honest Abe. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that's what we wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine our surprise when we received a copy of the cover of Scientific 
American from Gerry Thompson of Arleta. It showed Honest Abe arm in arm with a 
grinning Marilyn Monroe. Monroe's dress is blowing in the wind, allowing her to 
show a lot of leg (a lot of both legs, actually). 
</P>
<P>
 Did the demonstrators know something we didn't? We're a little hazy on 
American history but we don't remember Monroe being involved with that 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 We felt better when we saw the magazine caption, which said: "Digital forgery 
can create photographic evidence for events that never happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, we're happy the magazine didn't show Abe in his bajamas. miscelLAny:

Escondido is 15 miles inland. The competition will be staged in an area known

GOVERNMENT WATCH; DIRTY WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beware of big doings in small, out-of-the-way places. The criminal charges 
against two former officials of an obscure water district in Orange County 
serve as a reminder of what can happen when important public business is 
conducted largely out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, scarcely anybody had ever heard of the Santa Margarita Water 
District, a $28-million-a-year special district providing water and sewer 
service to the sprawling suburbs. Then The Times reported that Walter W. (Bill) 
Knitz, district general manager, and Michael P. Lord, assistant general 
manager, had accepted tens of thousands of dollars in gifts and lavish trips 
from local business people, many of whom the two officials recommended for 
hefty contracts, apparently in violation of state law. Knitz and Lord later 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 This week the Orange County district attorney's office weighed in after a 
yearlong investigation with charges that what the two did was out and out 
illegal. The counts centered on alleged failure to meet reporting requirements 
for the gifts and alleged actions taken on behalf of gift-givers in violation 
of conflict-of-interest laws. The misdemeanor counts carry fines or jail time 
or both. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger lesson lies in the potential for funny business at that most local 
level of government, the special district. There is a compelling need for 
public officials to keep special interests at arm's length, whether they 
function in the glare that falls on City Hall, Sacramento and Washington or in 
dimly lit places like small water districts.

MORE COPS AT A BARGAIN PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime-weary Americans are counting on President Clinton to make good on his 
promise to provide 100,000 new cops. The Senate is already on board. Now, the 
House must deliver. One way to do that would be to support the police corps. 
</P>
<P>
 The police corps would work like the ROTC. Students would sign up after high 
school. They would receive federal scholarships for college in exchange for a 
four-year commitment, and the feds would pay for law enforcement training. 
After graduation, the new rookies would work for local departments. They 
wouldn't be eligible for pensions so they would cost less then traditional 
rookies. What a bargain! 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for some unstated reason, the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Rep. 
Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), did not consider the police corps bill last week when it 
took up the other anti-crime bills reported out of subcommittees. What's the 
holdup?  
</P>
<P>
 The White House and Senate would earmark anticipated savings from deep cuts in 
the federal work force to pay for more prisons, drug treatment and other 
anti-crime measures, including the initial appropriation for the police corps. 
Over five years the police corps would cost $2.5 billion, if limited to 50,000 
participants as proposed by the Senate. That's a sound investment in public 
safety, but several House members are reluctant to cut federal jobs to pay for 
an anti-crime package that they justifiably believe is much too heavy on 
punishment and too lean on prevention. A better balance should be negotiated, 
but without sacrificing the corps. 
</P>
<P>
 If the powerful Chairman Brooks doesn't have a problem with the police corps, 
he should get the bill out of his panel so House-Senate conference committee 
members can tackle the differences. If he does have a problem, he should put it 
on the table and work out a timely compromise. Americans want more police, but 
most cities, including Los Angeles, have to scrape around to expand beyond a 
symbolic increase. A good chunk of a new police corps could shore up a Los 
Angeles force that is woefully too small to protect and serve this sprawling 
and diverse metropolis.  
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton repeated his promise of more cops last month. Did the House 
hear? America did.

THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING; MEXICO MUST ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexico's political and financial leaders were relieved at Tuesday's decision 
by Manuel Camacho Solis to not run for president. But with him out of the race, 
outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari must take unambiguous steps to 
guarantee the fairness of next August's presidential voting. Otherwise, a 
victory by Salinas' handpicked successor will be tainted. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho, the former Mexico City mayor who is negotiating peace with 
anti-government rebels in Chiapas, was the wild card in Mexico's presidential 
race. Public opinion polls indicated that he could strongly challenge Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, who was tapped by Salinas to be the nominee of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). 
</P>
<P>
 A Camacho candidacy clearly would have erased the predictability of the cycle 
of Mexican politics -- every six years the PRI wins. The concern over the 
prospect of a forcefully contested race was such that when Camacho's no-go 
decision was announced the Mexican stock market soared. 
</P>
<P>
 The near-certainty of six more years of PRI rule is worrisome in some 
respects. Although the PRI has given Mexico 65 years of stability, it has done 
so at the cost of real democracy. The ruling party's grasp on power is so firm 
that most Mexicans are politically apathetic, if not cynical; when the PRI wins 
an election, many automatically assume fraud has been committed. A wide-open 
presidential race could have shaken the public's apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 The national Congress must press forward with the electoral reforms recently 
proposed by President Salinas, such as fair campaign financing and new 
technology to preclude fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 From the perspective of the United States and other foreign countries, the 
most important of Salinas' proposed reforms would allow international observers 
to monitor the coming election. This is a sensitive issue, one involving pride; 
Mexicans don't want foreigners acting as if they are the final arbiters of 
Mexican elections. But 1994 is a special year, with the memory of violence in 
Chiapas still fresh and the future of the country's dealings with the rest of 
the world pumped up by last year's North American Free Trade Agreement. This 
year, Mexicans must be prepared to swallow their resistance and not only accept 
foreign election observers but invite as many as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what Salinas says he wants, so the United Nations, the Organization of 
American States and the rest of the world should take him up on it. If Colosio 
is to be Mexico's next president, so be it. But let him be elected in an open 
and honest vote, with the whole world watching.

VA HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cessation of total inpatient care at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration 
Medical Center is an inappropriate solution ("Sepulveda VA Hospital to Be Torn 
Down," March 15). While it may be necessary to temporarily relocate surgical 
and long-term-care cases to other facilities until complete reconstruction is 
accomplished, the care provided to veterans from Bakersfield, Ventura County 
and the San Fernando Valley must not be disrupted or deferred in the wake of 
the events of Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, there is one service provided by the Sepulveda VAMC that is so 
crucial and so necessary that its continuance should be of paramount concern to 
the current Administration. That function is the Chemical Dependency Treatment 
Unit, a three-pronged program that involves a five-to-seven-day inpatient 
detoxification, a 21-to 28-day inpatient rehabilitation program and finally an 
open-ended daily outpatient program with an initial 12-week patient commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 If the decision to partially relocate or otherwise disjoint this program is 
tolerated, veterans will die. It is a fact that because of the Sepulveda CDTU a 
great many lives have been saved. One of them is mine.

<P>
 Since outpatient services are running in many functional buildings at the 
Sepulveda VA, why waste millions on some new building dedicated solely to 
outpatient care? 
</P>
<P>
 The Sepulveda VA is also one of the teaching and research arms of the UCLA 
medical complex. If you want to cut off one of the arms of UCLA because the 
public can't afford it, then I suppose that's just a grim fact of economic 
reality. But be intellectually honest enough to admit that this is a step 
backward, not forward.

G-7 JOB SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The job summit is another exercise in futility and casuistry (March 15). The 
leaders of the G-7 are crying in their soup about the high unemployment in 
their respective, heretofore affluent democracies, and yet put in place 
mechanisms and incentives in the name of free trade and global competition that 
tend to make unemployment and underemployment a structural and long-term, 
rather than cyclical, phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 The blame is often placed on the victims of unemployment: They are not 
sufficiently trained, lack of basic skills, too expensive, too much regulation, 
too much taxation, etc. It is difficult to swallow the "lack of training" story 
when you hear that IBM, Apple, GM, and dozens more Fortune 500 companies lay 
off hundreds of thousands of workers, most of them highly skilled and college 
graduates. Does our government propose to retrain them to flip hamburgers? 
</P>
<P>
 In this country we have created tax incentives to destroy jobs. Every 
announcement of a downsizing, merger, restructuring is inevitably followed by a 
statement of how many workers will be let go, and of how much it is going to 
cost and impact profits for the period: hundreds of millions, billions in some 
cases. Read: The taxpayer is going to subsidize the layoffs by sheltering 
corporate profits. Which, of course, is a double hit since the taxpayer is also 
paying for unemployment compensation and all the other programs designed by 
government to fix the problem. A problem that, by its own policies, the 
government had a major role in creating.

</P>
<P>
 Whether embraced or not, there are growing concerns that the improvement in 
technology leads to layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The industrial nations must admit that unemployment, whether 6% or 16%, is 
inevitable when advanced technologies cause substantial reductions in 
employment. They must move beyond President Clinton's symbolism and carefully 
crafted rhetoric about future benefits generated by technological changes. They 
must provide jobs for the jobless.

NRA AND '3 STRIKES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the more than 2,000 words in your March 7 story about Mike Reynolds and the 
"three strikes and you're out" movement, not one mention was made of the group 
that's done more than anybody else to make it a reality -- the National Rifle 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA has pushed three strikes laws for years now.In Washington state, a 
citizens' movement to put a "three strikes" initiative on the ballot failed -- 
until the NRA stepped in with financial, organizational and grass-roots 
support. From there, it's taken off, and the NRA has been deeply involved all 
along. With the NRA's $40,000 contribution to Mike Reynolds' organization, 
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of NRA magazine publicity promoting it 
and countless California NRA members and activists all doing their part, you 
could have said NRA was a crucial element in the California "three strikes" 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA's 3.4 million law-abiding members deserve that recognition.

'A BEAUTIFUL CITY, A HELL ON EARTH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONELLA H. MEADOWS, Donella H. Meadows is an adjunct professor of 
environmental studies at Dartmouth College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All the praise and all the complaints about Los Angeles are justified.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a beautiful city, it's hell on Earth, it exemplifies every dream and 
every excess of the human race and its destiny is to run into problems sooner 
than the rest of us. Los Angeles pioneered freeways, earthquake-proof 
construction, the catalytic converter and air-pollution emission trading. It is 
working hard on multilingual, multiracial human relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The next problem that L.A. has to solve ahead of other cities is growth. There 
is a limit to the number of people, buildings, cars, smokestacks that can be 
crammed in between the mountains and the sea. At some point the growth of Los 
Angeles will stop. There are two ways it can stop. One is that the city becomes 
so ugly, so polluted, so overwhelmed with the problems caused by growth that 
more people and businesses move out than move in.  
</P>
<P>
 The other way is to stop growth deliberately, with the intention of having a 
city that is not only manageable, but responsible to the large hinterland from 
which it draws its resources and to which it returns its wastes. No city has 
ever done that. In a land where freedom of movement is a right, and where 
growth is the supposed solution to all problems, the question of how to develop 
without growing, to differentiate, to innovate, to get better without getting 
bigger has never been taken seriously.  
</P>
<P>
 But it is the ultimate question before all of us, with L.A. out in front. The 
next challenge for the incredible spunk and drive of L.A. is not how to keep 
growing against all bounds -- that was the problem of the 20th Century. The 
problem of the 21st is how to live good and just lives within limits, in 
harmony with the Earth and each other. Great cities can rise out of cruelty, 
deviousness and a refusal to be bounded. Livable cities can only be sustained 
out of humility, compassion and acceptance of the concept of "enough."

PERSPECTIVE ON POLITICS; WE DON'T NEED A WHITEWATER PHOTO OP; HEARINGS WOULD 
YIELD NOTHING; CLINTON AND CONGRESS NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO 
GOVERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT C. McFARLANE, Robert C. McFarlane served as President Reagan's 
national security adviser from 1983-1985. He pleaded guilty to four 
misdemeanors and was fined and sentenced to 200 hours of community service for 
withholding information from Congress in the Iran-Contra case. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can any member of Congress honestly say that decision-making in the White 
House will be improved, that systematic wrongs will be righted, that the 
American people will gain enhanced respect for their leaders or that any other 
gain will be achieved from holding hearings on the Whitewater affair? The idea 
of a "serious examination of the issues" by Congress brings a smirk to the face 
of anyone over 12 years old. Such is the result of media-driven politicians and 
scandal-driven media, which together dominate and corrupt the political process 
in our country today. My qualifications to offer objective comment may be in 
doubt; as a central figure in the Iran-Contra hearings, a bias would not be 
unexpected. I would only offer that I'm prepared to condemn both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again during the Iran-Contra hearings, there were examples of 
congressmen who had been kept well-informed -- who knew everything I did about 
Ollie North's activities -- looking down at me from the dais, intoning with 
false gravity, questions to which they knew the answers, criticizing policies 
and actions for which they had been devoted advocates months before. Theater, 
pure theater. 
</P>
<P>
 We know what those hearings produced: a popular outpouring for North, the 
basis for his escaping successful prosecution; and no initiatives, laws or 
rules that hold any promise of preventing the same thing from happening again. 
Let's face the facts, congressional hearings present opportunities for Congress 
to get on the evening news back home -- period. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars have identified the roots of our political decline over the past 30 
years. They include loss of confidence among Americans in the very idea of 
"reposing special trust and confidence" in political leaders, which started 
with a President's abuse of that trust during the Gulf of Tonkin episode and 
the Vietnam War. Popular mistrust of politicians deepened with episode upon 
episode of lying by public officials over the bombing of Cambodia, Watergate, 
congressional check-kiting and Iran-Contra. 
</P>
<P>
 The angry expressions of voter backlash to these events unfortunately, haven't 
done much to help. The election after Watergate of a huge tide of young 
"reform-minded" congressmen who swept away the seniority system did more harm 
than good. So-called election reform gave us political-action committees, which 
have led to everyone having a voice in Washington except the majority of the 
people. The separate but related phenomenon of each legislator now having his 
or her own financial base has left the party leaderships and machinery much 
less powerful and much less able to deliver votes to a President or to a cause. 
It also gives a President less incentive to bother trying to engage with them 
if they can't deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 In times of crisis, our country has been extraordinarily fortunate to have 
produced heroic leaders -- men or women of vision and courage who were not 
susceptible to the temporary lure of political expediency. I'm convinced that 
those in office today are capable of doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 What would be your reaction if the following events occurred? 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Robert Dole engages privately in heart-to-heart talks with President 
Clinton. The larger point Dole would make would be that both men face only two 
choices. One choice is hearings, which will produce much confusion and one 
awful sentiment among Americans: that their leaders are playing political games 
again. The alternative is for the President to acknowledge errors. With a 
pledge from Dole to discontinue the push for hearings (probably with the 
President's agreement to accommodate a few GOP legislative priorities), Clinton 
agrees to go before the people and lay everything out (to Dole's satisfaction). 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day, Dole makes a statesman's speech, recalling the aforementioned 
benchmarks of decline over the past generation and his wish to set a new course 
in our political discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time not so long ago when a President of one party -- Dwight 
Eisenhower -- could engage candidly with congressional leaders of the other -- 
Lyndon Johnson and Sam Rayburn -- and argue but in the end agree that they 
shared a responsibility to govern, not to engage in sustained playground fights 
with one another. The political upside of that kind of behavior -- Dole's and 
Clinton's numbers would go way up immediately -- is as clear today as it was 
then. But it does take courage to do the right thing.

REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PASSE; WHEN THE CORAL AND CRIMSON AND RUBIES OF HER LIPS 
CAN BE BOUGHT AT THE DRUGSTORE AND SAVED FOR A LIFETIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIJOY La BELLE, Jenijoy La Belle is a professor of literature at Caltech 
and author of Herself Beheld: The Literature of the Looking Glass (Cornell 
University Press, 1988).

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people save the first dollar they ever earned; I have my first lipstick. 
In my closet is a large box of lipsticks, a few kept for more than three 
decades. Most are useless as cosmetics, but they are reminders, as exact as 
excerpts from my diaries, of what I used to be and how I came to be what I am 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 My passion for lipstick goes back to childhood. One of my early memories is of 
standing before a mirror trying to color my mouth with a red crayon. I liked to 
open my grandmother's handbag, search for her Tangee, and swivel it slowly up 
and down. I still recall the sweet fragrance and vivid orange color that 
somehow became muted when applied to the lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I don't associate a particular lipstick with my mother, I remember 
her process of application: upper lip, lower lip, blot, reapply. She now wears 
lipstick if my sister or I pick it out for her, but she's never shared our 
delight in going to cosmetic counters and trying on different shades for the 
better part of an afternoon, always seeking the perfect hue with the perfect 
sheen that will transform our faces, and thus our lives, forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Often it's not the color but the name that lures me. Who could resist Honey 
Amber, Plum Silk, Iced Rubies? I'm seduced by the rhetoric of lipstick, the way 
the adjectives kiss the nouns. Even Susan Brownmiller, whose book "Femininity" 
is strongly anti-cosmetic, can reel off the names of the five shades she wore 
in high school. Yet she maintains that "a brightly painted mouth" never did 
anything positive for her face, conversation or kissing. For me, a lipsticked 
mouth can dramatically enhance all three. Perhaps Brownmiller gets by just fine 
with a swipe of Vaseline, but my lips cry out for color. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not alone in thinking that lipstick improves my words, maybe even my mind. 
A colleague who teaches philosophy swears that her lectures grow dull as she 
nervously gnaws off her lipstick. A poet assures me she finds it impossible to 
write unless her lips are glossed. My friend Terry insists she could never have 
learned a syllable of French without her rouge a levres: "Lipstick makes it 
easier to pronounce eu. "  
</P>
<P>
 You discover much about yourself by looking at your old lipsticks. "Was I 
really like that?" you ask. "Was I once brave enough to use up almost a whole 
tube of Stormy Scarlet?" Sometimes I like to dig through the box in my closet. 
The past is hidden there, a clue in every hue. 
</P>
<P>
 I find the Golden Brandy I wore in college, the Soft Sea Spice my sister wore 
on her wedding day. Here's the burgundy that perfectly matched my coat one 
winter. More memories, long abandoned, return as colors become flowers -- 
geranium and hibiscus, lilac and violet. And every shade of roses, roses, 
roses. To stimulate remembrance, Proust had his madeleine: I have my 
Maybelline. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the cases are so worn that I can no longer read the names on the 
bottoms. A few must have changed color over the years. Would I really have 
purchased a blue lipstick? Here's one I can't part with because my father 
bought it for me. Goodness knows how many decades I've had this Mucho Gusto 
Coco Loco, and yet it still smells like fresh chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the lipsticks I've saved so long have never been used at all. Why 
haven't I tossed them out? Because lipstick fuels not just our memories but our 
great expectations, our dark desires. It helps narrow the distance between the 
real and the imagined self. I always convince myself that next summer I will be 
tan and that shade I've never worn will at last look right. Or I might yet 
become dramatic and be able to get away with fiery fuchsia and torchy red. This 
Bare Berry didn't look good on me but was dazzling on Cheryl Tiegs on a 
magazine cover in the spring of 1980. Maybe I'll try it again. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never agreed with those who suggest that cosmetics are camouflage. 
Makeup isn't a way to cover your face, but to discover it. Lipstick isn't a 
means of oppression, but of expression. Do feminists wear it? Read my lips.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; WHY HUMAN RIGHTS IS THE REAL ISSUE IN FIGHT FOR GAY 
RIGHTS; A MORE PERFECT UNION; WHY STRAIGHT AMERICA MUST STAND UP FOR GAY RIGHTS 
BY RICHARD D. MOHR ; BEACON PRESS; $15, 140 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A More Perfect Union" is specifically addressed to heterosexual readers. "Why 
Straight Americans Must Stand Up for Gay Rights" is the book's provocative 
subtitle, and it is more correctly described as a book about human rights than 
"gay rights," a term the author himself uses. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an invisible minority, gay men and lesbians also need civil rights 
protections," argues Richard D. Mohr, "in order for them to have reasonably 
guaranteed access to an array of fundamental rights which virtually everyone 
would agree are supposed to pertain equally to all persons." 
</P>
<P>
 Homophobia, Mohr asserts, is merely another expression of the same ugly bias 
that is sometimes directed at Jews, African Americans or Latinos. And gay 
bashing is "a form of vigilantism that bears a striking resemblance to the 
lynching of black men." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus defined, gay rights is part of the civil rights movement in America, a 
movement that is entitled to the support of blacks, Jews, Latinos and every 
minority that has known the sting of hatred, violence and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr, a professor of philosophy at the University of Illinois, gives us an 
all-embracing manifesto that starts out as an essay on the philosophical and 
jurisprudential underpinnings of civil liberty and quickly escalates into an 
unrestrained call to arms for gays and straights alike in the name of "gay 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr is blunt and unsparing in his arguments in favor of gay rights. While he 
is hardly an in-your-face activist -- and even though his prose is always 
courtly and well-considered -- Mohr is not the least bit shy about demanding 
that gay men and lesbians be afforded the freedom to pursue their own vision of 
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Mohr condemns the closing of gay bathhouses as a prophylactic 
against the spread of AIDS precisely because, as he puts it, such meeting 
places are so important to a sense of community and identity among gay men. 
</P>
<P>
 "With some slight exceptions like the gay choral movement, gay political 
organizations, and . . . . AIDS support groups, sex is the only mode in which 
gays in current culture are allowed to identify themselves to themselves," he 
writes. "Self-respect, such as it is, for gay men in our culture is often the 
product of a robust sex life." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Mohr devotes a good deal of his book to the suggestion that 
"committed gay relationships" ought to be recognized as legal marriages. He 
argues that "gay life, like black culture, might even provide models and 
materials for rethinking and improving family life." And then he makes the 
startling proposition that "a commitment to monogamy" is one condition of 
marriage that is not necessarily an element of gay marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The central argument in "A More Perfect Union" is rooted in the constitutional 
right of privacy -- the same concept that is the basis for the right of women 
to seek an abortion. As Mohr reads the right to privacy, it assures all 
Americans, men and women, gay or straight, the freedom to express themselves 
through their sexual identity without fear of a law against abortion or a law 
against sodomy. Even the threat of AIDS, he seems to argue, is no reason to 
abridge the right of sexual freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "If independence -- the permission to guide one's life by one's own lights to 
an extent compatible with the like ability on the part of others -- is, as it 
is, a major value, one cannot respect that value while preventing people from 
putting themselves at risk through voluntary associations." 
</P>
<P>
 Again and again, Mohr draws intriguing linkages between sexuality and 
politics. Mohr depicts "coming out" as not merely a moment of self-discovery 
and self-revelation, for example, but also an overtly revolutionary gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Far from signaling immorality," he writes, "coming out to others affords one 
of the few remaining opportunities in ever more bureaucratic, technological and 
socialist societies to manifest courage." 
</P>
<P>
 How does the advocacy of gay rights work to the benefit of "straight America"? 
Mohr holds out the bland promise of a better world for all of us if only we can 
acknowledge that gay men and women are entitled to genuine civil liberties and 
not merely the back-to-the-closet policy of "Don't ask, don't tell."  
</P>
<P>
 "Society would be richer for acknowledging another aspect of human diversity," 
he exhorts. "Families with gay members would develop relations based on truth 
and trust rather than lies and fear. And the heterosexual majority would be 
better off for knowing that they are no longer trampling their gay friends and 
neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mohr does not quite deliver on the straightforward promise of his 
subtitle -- he tells us why we should stand up for gay rights, but not why we 
must do so. To a reader who is not already convinced, the distinction may turn 
out to be crucial.

 Oscar Ratings Hold Steady: ABC's coverage of Monday night's Academy Awards 
ceremonies garnered almost identical ratings as last year, which was the 
highest-rated Oscar telecast in 10 years. Monday's program earned a 31.1 
Nielsen rating (meaning it averaged about 29.3 million homes from start to 
finish) and attracted 49% of available viewers. Last year's show got a 31.2 
rating with 51% of the viewers. ABC estimated that about 78 million people 
nationwide watched at least part of Monday's show.

 'Geraldo' Suit: Geraldo Rivera and the production staff of his TV talk show 
were sued in Los Angeles Superior Court by a man claiming he was reunited with 
his birth mother on the air against his wishes. Brent Jasmer says he had an 
agreement with the show's producers that he would only talk about his search 
for his mother and would not be reunited with her on the air. He alleges breach 
of contract, bad faith, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, invasion of privacy 
and infliction of emotional distress. PEOPLE WATCH

 Pavarotti Performs: Opera star Luciano Pavarotti performed in the Philippines 
Monday night, gulping down what his doctor said were as many as 37 pills before 
his show, which had been postponed from Friday because of a cold. Although he 
stepped away from the microphone to cough during pauses in the music, attendees 
said the tenor still hit the high notes. "I came here tonight to give all I 
can," a feverish Pavarotti told the cheering crowd. "I never thought it 
possible to arrive to this last song." The Manila show had been criticized for 
ticket prices as high as $900.

 Dudley Moore Arrested: British-born actor Dudley Moore was arrested at his 
Venice home Monday night after a woman identifying herself as the actor's 
girlfriend claimed he "battered" her, police said Tuesday. Moore, 58, was 
booked for investigation of domestic abuse and released on $50,000 bail. Police 
said the district attorney's office will decide whether criminal charges of 
"cohabitational abuse," a felony, will be filed. Ironically, it was Moore who 
first involved police in the incident by calling in what police termed "a 
possible domestic dispute" at about 7:35 p.m. A short time later, another call 
came from Moore's residence, this time from the unidentified woman. Police said 
a preliminary investigation found the woman had "sustained minor but visible 
trauma to the neck area" from a "physical altercation" with Moore.

 Gov. Stern?: Radio bad boy Howard Stern instantly became the best-known 
challenger to Mario Cuomo when he announced plans Tuesday to run for governor 
of New York. And he appeared to be serious, offering a platform that included 
passing the death penalty, getting road crews to work only at night and 
staggering highway tolls to prevent traffic jams. Once these three goals were 
achieved, Stern said, he would resign and turn the state over to his 
as-yet-unnamed lieutenant governor. Stern said he hopes to run as a Libertarian 
candidate, but he didn't address potential problems with federal regulations 
that would require New York stations carrying his syndicated show to give equal 
time to his opponents. "I'm going to win," he told his roughly 3 million 
listeners nationwide. "I'm going to be the next governor of New York." POP/ROCK

 Chili Peppers Suit Dropped: A Los Angeles judge on Tuesday threw out a former 
band member's lawsuit against the Red Hot Chili Peppers, ruling that guitarist 
Jack Sherman had waited too long to attempt to collect damages from his 
expulsion from the band in 1985. Sherman claimed he was wrongly kicked out of 
the group and was not paid his full share of profits from the Grammy-winning 
band's first two albums to which he contributed. Sherman had contended he was 
unable to bring the case within the three-year limit because of debilitating 
childhood abuse that made him passive, but the judge discounted that argument.

 Madonna is ready to enter the major leagues. In the upcoming issue of New York 
magazine, the pop star says she wants to buy a National Basketball Assn. 
franchise. On the top of her shopping list: the Chicago Bulls, followed by the 
Detroit Pistons, Miami Heat and Orlando Magic. . . . Film critics Gene Siskel 
and Roger Ebert pulled out of a scheduled appearance on the "Arsenio Hall Show" 
Tuesday night because the talk-show host "never distanced himself from anything 
(Nation of Islam leader Louis) Farrakhan said" on the program three weeks ago, 
Siskel said. The film critics were scheduled to give a post-Oscar review. . . . 
Pop star Morrissey will be the first music act to play Los Angeles' refurbished 
Olympic Auditorium. Tickets for the April 8 show, a preview of his upcoming 
tour, go on sale Thursday. SHAUNA SNOW

KIDS' THEATER REVIEW; 'BIG FEAT': A SKILLFUL COMIC PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Mark Taper Forum's latest P.L.A.Y. (Performing for Los Angeles Youth) 
production, touring Southland public venues and schools, turns out to work 
quite nicely as a complement to the clown hit "Fool Moon," finishing its run 
Sunday at the Doolittle Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harold's Big Feat," a short comedy created and performed by Wolfe Bowart and 
directed by Peter C. Brosius, is billed as "a day in the life of an Everyman 
clown." Bowart, a professional actor with a trim athletic build, gives a 
skillful comic performance that starts giggles sputtering as soon as he walks 
on stage in red nose and nightshirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowart plays a music-loving clown named Harold, combining slapstick and other 
nonsense with facile timing and just a hint of European-flavored pathos. But he 
can't understand how to play the clarinet, no matter how loudly young audience 
members shout advice; his violin snaps, and his accordion rips. Surely he'll be 
able to get the hang of his new piano? 
</P>
<P>
 Not without a struggle. This is no ordinary piano. 
</P>
<P>
 The big brown upright (designed by Martin Zboril, who also did the cartoony 
set), has eyebrows, arms, toothy keys and a mind of its own. The mad interplay 
between clown and piano builds to a comic crescendo until Harold is swallowed 
by the musical monster, then returns a changed man, in top hat and tails, with 
a newfound talent.  
</P>
<P>
 Bowart's sojourn inside the piano, represented by shadow puppetry, slows the 
pace a bit, and the piano manipulation was somewhat clumsy at a recent 
performance at the Los Angeles Public Central Library's Mark Taper Auditorium. 
But the show triumphs thanks to Bowart's cleverness, timing and confident 
interaction with the audience, punctuated by talented composer Michael 
Silversher's whimsical sound design. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Petrovich did Bowart's clown costumes, and Michael Gilliam provided 
the mood lighting.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'ABOVE THE RIM' BOUNCES BETWEEN SPORTS, MELODRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kyle (Duane Martin) is a high school basketball phenom in Harlem who wants to 
be a college whiz and an NBA all-star. Irked that the big college recruiters 
have yet to sign him, he showboats on the court in the closing games of his 
final season. It's bad teamwork but great to watch: Kyle is totally fulfilled 
as he soars through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Above the Rim" would have been better had it stuck with Kyle's love for the 
game and depended less on a mess of tired melodrama about his involvement with 
a brutal drug dealer, Birdie (Tupac Shakur), and his estranged brother Shep 
(Leon), who had been a great neighborhood basketball star before he skipped 
town. It's not that this material is inappropriate to Kyle's story; it's just 
that it never comes to life in the way the basketball scenes do. That's the 
problem with sports movies: If the ball-playing footage is any good, the rest 
of the action tends to look like filler. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Jeff Pollack, who co-created NBC's "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," shoots 
the basketball scenes with vigor and understanding. (Some sports movies look as 
if they were directed by couch potatoes.) But he isn't aided by Barry Michael 
Cooper's script, which has Kyle rebounding among confrontations with his mother 
(Tonya Pinkins), his coach (David Bailey), Shep, Birdie and just about 
everybody else. He's supposed to be an Angry Young Man pulled between crime and 
ethics, but he doesn't seem to be all that angry. His fights have a 
trumped-up-for-high-drama feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is much better when it drops the arch theatrics and just moves along 
to the great rap soundtrack. The hang-loose scenes between Kyle and his dotty 
friend Bugaloo (Marlon Wayans) are the best not only because they seem the most 
realistic but also because they don't make a big fuss about how socially 
conscious they are. 
</P>
<P>
 They make you want to shoot a few hoops.

TV RATINGS; 'HOME IMPROVEMENT' HELPS ABC HAMMER OUT A WIN 
</P>

 Sparked by a double-dose of "Home Improvement," ABC sailed to its second win 
in as many weeks in the prime-time ratings, according to figures released 
Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. A new episode of the sitcom, starring Tim Allen 
and Patricia Richardson, was No. 1 and a repeat was No. 9 among last week's 94 
network programs. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC had three other shows in the Top 10, including its 2-week-old news series 
"Turning Point." And its new sitcom "Thunder Alley," despite losing 13% of its 
opening-week audience, still finished No. 11 with the "Home Improvement" 
episodes bracketing it. 
</P>
<P>
 The debut of "Someone Like Me," NBC's new comedy about a teen-age girl, ran 
second in its Monday time slot and finished No. 32 overall. But NBC said the 
show posted the highest ratings of any entertainment program this season among 
girls 12 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, meanwhile, was crowing about the ratings for "Melrose Place," which 
finished second in its Wednesday time period. But Tuesday night continues to be 
an abyss for Fox: A special hosted by Magic Johnson attracted only 7% of the 
viewers and ranked 94th for the week. Southland Ratings

 Here are A. C. Nielsen's Top 10 prime-time programs in the Los Angeles area 
during the same week. Each rating point equals 50,064 households.

STARS THWART DUCKS' DRIVE FOR THE PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once or twice a year, the elements all come together for a perfect moment. The 
planets align, and something special happens on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Once or twice a year, Stu Grimson scores a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimson, the 6-foot-5 Mighty Duck enforcer, broke the longest streak without a 
goal in the NHL this season when he scored his first goal at 19:16 of the 
second period of a 4-3 loss to Dallas at Reunion Arena Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But the playoff hopes of Grimson and his teammates slipped a little further 
into the distance as they fell six points back with 11 games left after San 
Jose tied Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all for naught," Grimson said. "It doesn't really feel that thrilling 
when it doesn't count for much. It's a lot better when you can assist on a 
winning cause. It takes the edge off it. I really thought it might have been 
the lift we needed, but it turned out it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal -- only the fourth of Grimson's 242-game career -- set off a 
celebration as Grimson skated in front of the bench, high-fiving with 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a beaut," Coach Ron Wilson said, after Patrik Carnback put a pretty 
pass on Grimson's stick on the right side of the net, and Grimson handled it 
deftly at his feet to beat goalie Darcy Wakaluk. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimson hadn't scored since Dec. 31, 1992, a stretch of 106 games without a 
goal. That is not the longest streak in the NHL -- Philadelphia's Rob Zettler, 
for one, hasn't scored in at least 125 after not scoring all last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grimson's streak this season was distinguished by how many games he has 
played without scoring a goal, showing the team appreciates his work enough to 
put him out there almost every night. The goal came in his 71st game. Only 
eight skaters who have appeared in at least 50 games haven't scored. Only two 
who have played at least 65 games -- Dallas' Doug Zmolek (70) and Ottawa's Gord 
Dineen (68) -- haven't scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas took a 3-1 lead with the help of Mike Modano's 43rd and 44th goals -- 
both on power plays -- but Grimson's goal cut it to one just before the end of 
the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spark he hoped for didn't come. Derian Hatcher made it 4-2 at 2:23 of 
the third, and the Ducks' third-period comeback was stopped short. 
</P>
<P>
 They went on the power play with 2:12 remaining when Hatcher was called for 
holding, but they didn't capitalize until it was too late. With the Ducks using 
an extra attacker in the final 1:18, Carnback scored off a rebound with 7.9 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know how much time was left, but when I saw seven seconds, I 
understood it was over," Carnback said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' goaltending situation, seemingly resolved when Ron Tugnutt was 
traded to Montreal last month, has changed again. Guy Hebert's brief hold on 
No. 1 is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt's replacement, Mikhail Shtalenkov, has been sharp since arriving and 
has started the past three games. Wilson says he's essentially back to 
alternating, with Hebert set for the next game, though a standout performance 
can earn a goalie another start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guy's worked hard in practice lately and I think he's gained some respect for 
Mikhail that might have been lacking," Wilson said. "Mikhail played well again. 
There's nothing wrong with having two good goalies." 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with having a tough guy who can knock in the very 
occasional goal, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously scoring this late in the season, there were a lot of nights where 
it was starting to get kind of frustrating," said Grimson, who has contributed 
five assists for a career-high six points. "The opportunity has been there. 
I've had some near-misses, so you have to be encouraged by that. I just don't 
want to put myself in the position psychologically now where it's, 'OK, the 
pressure's off, and I can float.' I'd like to make that kind of contribution 
every night." Ducks Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Left wing Troy Loney will join the team in Boston today after remaining in 
Anaheim with his wife, Aafke, for the birth of their son, Clint Teagan, on 
Monday. . . . About $400,000 was raised at Fan Fair, a team fund raiser for the 
Disney GOALS youth hockey program.

MIKE DOWNEY: GARVEY IS MAGAZINE'S NEW MVP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every so often, someone will wonder if I happen to know, "What's Steve Garvey 
doing these days?" Particularly in springtime, when camps are training baseball 
players to be half the player Garvey was, inquiring minds will be curious as to 
what Garvey is up to, whether instead of running the bases he is running a 
business, or running for office, or what? 
</P>
<P>
 Garvey is the new publisher of Sport magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalist Steve has been on the job at the L.A.-based magazine for a few 
weeks now, ever since the January earthquake, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my first day at work," he remembers. "I was supposed to start that 
morning, but the quake hit us around 4:30. Well, you know me, mister 
never-miss-a-game. I get dressed and go to the office on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guard is standing there at the building saying, 'What the heck are you 
doing here?' He's looking at me like, 'We had a little earthquake around here 
this morning, buddy, in case you hadn't noticed.' ' 
</P>
<P>
 Garvey was eager to get to work, same as always. This is his spring training 
in the magazine business. He intends to be a hands-on publisher, not some 
figurehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sport is one of the most venerable monthlies in the magazine trade, one that 
in the past has known much success. But black ink or red, it was in need of 
some new blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate executives got the idea of bringing in someone who would be an ideal 
crossover choice, someone who could exist comfortably in each of a sport 
magazine's worlds -- sport and magazines. Garvey was a natural. He was someone 
who could be as at ease inside a boardroom meeting with business leaders and 
advertisers as he generally has been with writers and photographers. 
</P>

 "It just seemed to be the perfect idea at the perfect time," Garvey says. 
</P>
<P>
 Already he has taken an active role in a new design for the magazine, and will 
reshape some of its editorial content. He also will write a publisher's column 
in each issue. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first issues he could address, were it not so self-serving, could 
be, "What's wrong with those Hall of Fame voters?" 
</P>
<P>
 I can only speak for myself when I say that Garvey has gotten one of my votes 
for baseball's Hall of Fame in Cooperstown ever since he became eligible. So 
far, though, I have not been able to successfully push him over the top for the 
necessary number of votes, any more than I did Orlando Cepeda. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who reviews Garvey's numbers would be hard-pressed to explain why he 
isn't a Hall of Famer. His batting totals alone are noteworthy, but when you 
take into account his astounding fielding percentages at first base, his World 
Series and All-Star achievements and his consecutive-game streak, it is not 
easy to ascertain exactly where Garvey is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, as they say, if getting there was easy, everybody would do it. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if Garvey had ever weighed making a comeback after his retirement, a 
la Jim Palmer. After all, he kept himself in pretty good shape. Probably could 
have padded his numbers a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 He said: "I did think about it after my injury healed. But the first team I 
contacted told me, 'We can't offer you a contract, but you could come down and 
try out.' And the next team I contacted told me, 'We can't offer you a 
contract, but you could come down and try out.' 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, that was another example of the collusion among baseball executives. 
Every one would give exactly the same answer, in virtually the exact same 
words." 
</P>
<P>
 Back when he was playing for the Dodgers and later for San Diego, there was no 
telling where Garvey's post-career interests might take him. He dabbled in 
broadcasting, ventured into various business areas and had often expressed a 
curiosity about politics. There was some much-publicized upheaval in his 
personal life, then a quiet time when he didn't make the news much. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he publishes it. Sport magazine used to sponsor the trophy presented to 
baseball's most valuable players. Now, the National League's most valuable 
player of 1974 is running Sport magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone over to the other side," Garvey says. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not really. The man can never be a true sports journalist. He works hard 
and dresses well.

CLIPPERS LOSE THE BATTLE OF BOARDS AS NETS WIN; PRO BASKETBALL: WILKINS SCORES

 Derrick Coleman and Kenny Anderson each scored 25 points as the New Jersey 
Nets beat the Clippers, 105-102, Tuesday night for their sixth straight home 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. Brown scored six of his 12 points in the final 1:44 and grabbed 16 
rebounds for the Nets, who have won 14 of their last 16 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey opened the fourth quarter with an 8-0 run to take an 84-79 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers pulled to 97-95 on a three-pointer by Dominique Wilkins with 1:36 
left before Brown hit a jumper to give the Nets a four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who finished with 33 points, got a three-point play with 1:09 
remaining to make it 99-98. Armon Gilliam hit two free throws to give the Nets 
a 101-98 lead, but Elmore Spencer's dunk off a pass from Wilkins with 38 
seconds left cut New Jersey's lead to one again. 
</P>
<P>
 A jumper by Brown and two free throws by Anderson helped the Nets take a 
105-102 lead. The Clippers had a chance to tie in the closing seconds, but Mark 
Jackson missed a three-pointer.Ron Harper and Spencer each scored 21 for the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets only made 34 of 90 shots (38%), but they outrebounded the Clippers, 
70-49, including a 27-13 advantage on the offensive glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We struggled tonight," said Net Coach Chuck Daly. "They're a very tough team 
to defend and we struggled to get it done offensively. P.J. was the open guy 
tonight. He hit two big shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said he has tried to encourage Brown to take the open shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep telling P.J. to drill those shots and that's the bottom line. We all 
know he can make them," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, whose 12 points was one shy of his season high, said he took Anderson's 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kenny told me not to lose my confidence and to take the shot if it was 
there," Brown said. "At the end, I took those shots with confidence and that's 
the whole key to this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said rebounding was the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a frustrating loss," he said. "We scrapped but just couldn't keep 
them off the offensive boards."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky is going to break the NHL goal-scoring record any minute now, 
but, funny, I have always admired him more for his assists. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He broke the NHL assist record six years ago. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He has led the league in goals four times and in assists 12 times. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't won a goal-scoring title since 1987, but is about to win his fourth 
assist title in the last five years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He is Magic Johnson on a fast break, usually preferring to feed a teammate 
rather than shooting. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky lends a helping hand off the ice, too. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 His charitable contributions are numerous, and most are made without attention 
being called to them. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He is a tireless promoter of his sport. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He makes my job more pleasant by giving thoughtful, quotable answers to 
questions, often even after losses. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Prediction for tonight's King-Vancouver game at the Forum: Gretzky will get 
goal No. 802 and assists Nos. 1,647, 1,648 and 1,649. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Craig Janney's Canuck career sure was disappointing. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Cam Neely won't play another game for the Boston Bruins this season, but I 
would still vote him NHL most valuable player. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks must not be very confident about their playoff chances if 
they trade their only Western Conference All-Star, defenseman Alexei Kasatonov, 
to St. Louis for a junior player and a sixth-round draft choice. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The New York Rangers now lead the Kings in former Edmonton Oilers, 7-5. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You have to be impressed when Dodger pitching coach Ron Perranoski, not given 
to hyperbole, says rookie Darren Dreifort's fastball moves better than any 
right-hander's he has ever seen. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pitching in the Pittsburgh Pirates' minor league camp is Damon Allen, brother 
of Marcus and most valuable player in the Grey Cup last year as a quarterback 
for the Edmonton Eskimos. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, baseball season will open on a Sunday night, St. Louis at 
Cincinnati on April 3. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The guy carrying the biggest stick in the majors is third baseman Charlie 
Hayes of the Colorado Rockies, whose bat weighs 38 ounces. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A young Baltimore Oriole to watch is Jeffrey Hammonds, the left fielder from 
Stanford. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the 16 finalists for the Wooden Award, Clifford Rozier of Louisville 
and Khalid Reeves of Arizona, will meet Thursday in the West Regional at the 
Sports Arena, which used to be home court for Wooden's UCLA Bruins. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the prohibitive favorite is Glenn Robinson from Wooden's alma 
mater, Purdue. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Kidd -- a brilliant playmaker and defender but a mediocre shooter -- 
figures to be selected second, third or fourth behind Robinsion in the draft. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Consider yourself a college hoops fanatic if you can recite the names of the 
teams remaining in the National Invitation Tournament. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The two-point conversion rule is another reason the Raiders should pick a 
running back in the first round of the draft, or, if they have the money after 
cutting some veterans at other positions, sign a free-agent runner. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If Burt Bacharach's Soul Of The Matter faces Powis Castle, the Santa Anita 
Derby won't be missing a beat April 9. Powis Castle is owned by the Vistas 
Stables of Motown's Berry Gordy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Even though Strodes Creek and Numerous missed the two major prep races for the 
Santa Anita Derby, I'm not discounting them for one simple reason: trainer 
Charlie Whittingham. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs-up to ABC for putting good-humored Al Trautwig on its World Cup 
announcing team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Herbie Hide's seventh-round knockout of Michael Bentt that sent Bentt to the 
hospital didn't exactly flatter Tommy Morrison. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bubby Brister could become the Jody Reed of the NFL. The quarterback who 
turned down a $2-million contract from the New Orleans Saints might re-sign 
with the Philadelphia Eagles for $1 million. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The defensive tackle expected to be drafted No. 1 overall by the Cincinnati 
Bengals -- 6-foot-4, 313-pound Dan Wilkinson of Ohio State -- ran 40 yards in 
4.72 seconds at the scouting combine. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among free agents who have worked out for the San Francisco 49ers is Tony 
Bennett.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT REPORT; OTHER REGIONALS; TULSA'S 
COACH EMERGES AS HOT PROSPECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With three consecutive winning records and the school's surprising run through 
the NCAA tournament, Tulsa Coach Tubby Smith is one of the hottest coaching 
prospects around. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee has asked for permission to meet with Smith, and outgoing Tulsa 
athletic director Rick Dickson said he has received a couple of other feelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just telling everybody they need to wait until basketball is over," 
said Dickson, who will leave next month to become athletic director at 
Washington State. Tulsa will play Arkansas in the Midwest Regional semifinals 
Friday night in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he is willing to listen to offers, "but I'm really going to listen 
to the University of Tulsa first." He said that Tennessee was an offer he would 
listen to, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where I want to be at this point," Smith said. "I think we've got a 
program well on its way to being what we all hope we can do. You've got to do 
the best job you can where you are. If you do, people are going to recognize 
you're doing a good job, and you're going to always be in demand. That's what I 
want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was left with no returning starters when he took over for J.D. Barnett, 
but still managed a 17-13 record and lost by three points in the Missouri 
Valley Conference tournament final. The next year, Tulsa learned it was banned 
from postseason play only three days before the season started because of NCAA 
violations by the track team. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Tulsa won the MVC regular-season title and 20 games for the first 
time since 1987. Throughout the season, Smith has had a five-year contract 
extension on his desk. Smith said he hasn't signed it because he wanted to 
concentrate solely on basketball. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Starting forward Donyell Marshall has a sprained ankle and has been unable to 
practice, Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun said. However, he said there is no 
ligament damage and not much swelling, and team doctors expect Marshall to 
recover in time for Friday's game against Florida.

 Rick Barnes, who coached Providence to the Big East tournament championship 
this year, was hired to replace Cliff Ellis as coach at Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said in January that this would be his last season at Clemson after 10 
years.

<P>
 Western Kentucky's Ralph Willard is expected to be hired at Providence within 
a week, The Providence Journal-Bulletin reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes was 108-76 in six seasons at Providence and took the Friars to three 
NCAA tournaments and two NITs. Providence, 20-10 this year, ended its season 
Thursday with an NCAA tournament loss to Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson ended the regular season 15-14 and lost to Duke in the second round of 
the ACC tournament. The Tigers beat West Virginia in the second round of the 
NIT Monday night and will play Vanderbilt tonight.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT REPORT; WEST REGIONAL; REMATCH OF 
'89 IS SPECIAL FOR STEWART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter what happens at the Sports Arena on Thursday night, Missouri Coach 
Norm Stewart is in better shape than he was the last time the Tigers played 
Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a better deal for me," Stewart said in Columbia, Mo., on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Orangemen beat Missouri, 83-80, on March 24, 1989, Stewart was in 
no shape to be behind the bench. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer 
and a diseased gallbladder and was too weak to even think about getting back to 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just trying to get well," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 59, has made a full recovery and will not miss the final 16 matchup 
this time around, although he acknowledges that while he hasn't slowed down 
much, there is a difference. He said the simple knowledge that he is "on the 
right side of the grass" has given him a new perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not as instinctive as I used to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, seeded No. 1 in the West, are making their fifth trip to the final 
16. Their best finish under Stewart was in 1976, when they lost in the regional 
finals to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville Coach Denny Crum says defense has been the difference for his 
Cardinals this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've not gotten any credit for our defense," Crum says. "Nobody thinks of 
Louisville playing defense, but defense is what has carried us." 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville has limited 21 opponents to less than 42% shooting and 40.5% 
overall in 33 games. The Cardinals also average nine steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville, which has won eight of its last nine games, will be tested by an 
Arizona offense that is averaging 90.2 points. The Wildcats have made a 
school-record 258 three-point shots.

 The National Invitation Tournament is not a consolation prize for every team

 When it's your first postseason appearance in 36 years in Division I, the NIT

 "There are 13 kids down here, and they are all crying because it means a lot 
to them," said Gonzaga Coach Dan Fitzgerald after his Bulldogs (22-8) were 
beaten, 66-64, by Kansas State (19-12) at Manhattan, Kan. "I told them this was 
something that we will remember for the rest of our lives."

FISHING REPORT: LAKE PERRIS SWIMMING WITH REGULAR-SIZE BASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Castaic and Casitas might be the lakes for trophy-sized largemouth bass, but 
Riverside County's Lake Perris seems to be the place for regular bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys have been catching 25 bass a day," said Mark Hamann, an employee at the 
lake.  
</P>
<P>
 The bass have moved into the shallows to spawn. They are averaging only 14 
inches, Hamann said, but there are exceptions. Ted Ford of Los Angeles landed 
an 8-pound 12-ounce bass while fishing a Power Worm at the dam, and Gary 
Marshman of Murrieta caught a 6-pounder while fishing a plastic worm at the 
east end.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: RUDY FINALLY GOES HOME, IN A PINCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Free Rudy!" 
</P>
<P>
 That was the cry for the last few weeks in Rancho Cordova, until a 
100-year-old Maine lobster presumably destined for the dinner table was shipped 
back to its home waters and set free. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant lobster, caught in a fisherman's net and flown west to Rudy's 
Hideaway, a restaurant in the Sacramento suburb, spent weeks in a tank before 
arrangements could be made for it to be flown back east. Rudy, as the 
crustacean had been dubbed by restaurant personnel, was released Monday at an 
undisclosed site off New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told he arrived in good shape," said Steve Ryan, owner of Rudy's. "He 
was lively when he got there, and when he saw the ocean he became even more 
lively. He was released and then he really took off." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan thought he was merely getting an unusually large lobster from his East 
Coast broker, who normally ships 2 1/2- to 3 1/2-pound specimens. He had no way 
of knowing that when the giant crustacean arrived, so would the TV cameras and 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out after it arrived that it was not so much an 18-pound lobster, 
but a 100-year-old lobster," Ryan said, adding that Rudy "would have probably 
fed a small neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 An animal-rights group got involved in the lobster-liberation movement, and 
with Ryan's permission made plans to have Rudy sent back to the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as well, Ryan said. "It was the size of the Buick. It had huge claws. We 
probably would have needed a buzz saw to get through the shell." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strong winds practically blew the Del Mar off the water, but a fishing trip 
promoting next month's Santa Monica Bay Halibut Derby wasn't a total bust. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew gave the fishery a boost of sorts by releasing 100 hatchery-raised 
fish into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all 8- to 10-inch fish," tournament chairman John Bourget said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip was cut short when a huge wave slammed against the side of the boat 
shortly before noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was choppy at first, but we caught five nice halibut," Bourget said. "Then 
all of a sudden one big, big wave came in and soaked half of the guys. After 
that, the skipper said it was time to head in." 
</P>
<P>
 The derby, proceeds from which benefit youth groups and the halibut hatchery 
project, will be held April 16-17. Details: (310) 450-5131. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barracuda have made their annual springtime showing at various locations from 
San Diego to Palos Verdes, an indication that bottom-fishing for sluggish rock 
cod and rockfish will soon give way to surface fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the better bites has been at Horseshoe Kelp outside of L.A. Harbor, 
where large female barracuda are mixed in with smaller fish. The Matt Walsh 
returned with 42 fish on Saturday and the First String had 25 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a catch, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have the anchovies for bait if you want to catch them," said Mark 
Larson, a spokesman at L.A. Harbor Sportfishing. "And they've been hard to come 
by."  
</P>
<P>
 Strong winds hampered the fishing effort Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Gate appears to have finally lost some of its luster. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular fishing area off Cabo San Lucas had been the site of an 
outstanding marlin bite since last November, but seasonal winds appear to have 
finally shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water turned green and the mackerel the marlin were feeding on have 
disappeared," Mario Banaga of the Pisces Fleet said. "So far (Tuesday), only 
one boat had some fish, three yellowfin tuna . . . small ones, about eight 
pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Banaga said there is an abundance of larger tuna offshore and when the winds 
let up, the Cabo fleets should have no trouble finding porpoises and the tuna 
that feed beneath them. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- The Inland Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation will 
hold a seminar and calling contest Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Sizzler in Corona.

NBA ROUNDUP; KNICKS GET VICTORY, BUT NO RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether they score 68, 78 or 28 points against New York, the Chicago Bulls 
aren't giving the Knicks any respect until they do once what Chicago has done 
for the last three years -- win an NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Knicks talk about respect a lot, but the only way they'll get it from us 
is to win a championship," Scottie Pippen said Tuesday night after the Knicks 
beat the Bulls, 87-78, at New York for their 10th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks held the opposition under 90 points for the ninth time during their 
longest winning streak since they won 11 straight in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubert Davis scored 24 points for New York, including a 3-pointer with 1:51 
left that capped a decisive 7-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 108, Milwaukee 94 -- Mahmoud Abdul Rauf scored 22 points and Dikembe 
Mutombo had 14 rebounds and six blocks in the Nugget victory at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 LaPhonso Ellis had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Nuggets, who outscored 
the Bucks, 33-18, in the third quarter. Eric Murdock led Milwaukee with 30 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 124, Miami 118 -- The Suns rallied from an 18-point deficit against 
the Heat at Phoenix and won the game in overtime. A.C. Green had seven points 
and three rebounds in the overtime.  
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Johnson sparked the comeback, scoring 24 of his 35 points in the second 
half and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 83, Houston 81 -- Chris Smith rebounded his own miss and scored with 
five seconds left to lift the Timberwolves over the Rockets at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey King scored 19 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and blocked a career-high 
seven shots for the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 125, Philadelphia 91 -- Alonzo Mourning and Dell Curry scored 24 
points apiece at Charlotte as the Hornets posted their largest victory this 
season and sent the 76ers to their 19th loss in 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Muggsy Bogues had 12 points and 11 assists for Charlotte. Jeff Malone paced 
the Sixers with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 93, Indiana 61 -- The Pacers were held to their lowest point total 
ever in their loss to the Cavaliers at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The 61 points were the third fewest scored by an NBA team since the 24-second 
clock was introduced in 1954. The lowest output since then was 57 by Milwaukee 
against Boston in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 117, Orlando 116 -- The Warriors overcame a 16-point deficit in 
the fourth quarter at Oakland and beat the Magic on Billy Owens' tip-in with 21 
seconds remaining. Chris Webber then blocked Dennis Scott's shot in the lane 
with just over five seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic argued to no avail that Webber should have been called for 
goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 105, San Antonio 89 -- Sam Perkins scored nine of his 27 points in the 
fourth quarter at Seattle as the SuperSonics beat the Spurs for the third time 
in a row this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Payton had 21 points and six assists for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson led the Spurs with 27 points and eight rebounds. Willie 
Anderson added 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 96, Sacramento 94 -- Clyde Drexler scored with one second remaining 
at Sacramento as the Trail Blazers snapped a five-game road losing streak. 
Drexler scored 28 points for Portland. Lionel Simmons led the Kings with 26.

UCLA, KENTUCKY TO MEET IN WOODEN CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first John R. Wooden Classic, featuring a game between UCLA and Kentucky, 
will be held Dec. 3 at Anaheim Arena, it was announced Tuesday. Kansas will 
meet Massachusetts in the second game of the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA and Kentucky have not met since the 1975 NCAA final that marked Wooden's 
last game as a coach and his 10th national title. Both games will be nationally 
televised, the first starting at 10:30 a.m. Tickets will go on sale in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden joined three of his most famous former players -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 
Bill Walton and Michael Warren -- for Tuesday's announcement in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm flattered and proud," he said. "You have to keep your ego in the proper 
perspective, but I'm glad they saw fit to name this event in my honor. I think 
it can become something very worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a busy past seven months for Randy Ryan, who will serve as the 
event's president, and J.T. Visbal, who will be executive vice president. The 
two dreamed up the event and organized it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said response from college coaches has been positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly didn't take lot of effort to get people involved who wanted to 
honor Coach Wooden," Ryan said. "Every major basketball program that we've 
talked to has indicated that they want to participate whenever they're 
invited." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said no commitments have been made after the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of Abdul-Jabbar, Walton and Warren at a news conference 
underlined the magic Wooden's name adds to the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Wooden and the word classic go hand in hand," Walton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, noting Wooden's philosophy, said playing was more important than 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I think having an event of this type named after him is so 
fitting," he said.

COLLEGE BASEBALL / GARY KLEIN; NO. 1 USC THINKING BIG AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took almost three years, but USC has finally returned to the top of college 
baseball's rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who entered the week 21-6 overall and 8-4 in the Pacific 10 
Conference Southern Division, are ranked No. 1 by Baseball America for the 
first time since May 6, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, USC won two of three Pac-10 games against Stanford, the first 
time since 1981 that the Trojans won a series at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which has won 12 of its last 13 games, is in first place in the Pac-10 
Southern Division with a half-game lead over California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being ranked No. 1 is not going to bother us because teams are always out to 
get us anyway," said senior infielder Lionel Hastings, who was seven for 13 
with a home run and five runs batted in against Stanford. "That's just part of 
playing at USC." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Boone is batting .384 and Walter Dawkins has hit nine home runs for the 
Trojans, who feature one of the country's best offensive lineups. The key to 
the Trojans' success, however, has been a pitching staff that has compiled a 
3.16 earned-run average. Freshman Randy Flores, a left-hander, is 4-0 with a 
1.46 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's shown a lot of moxie for a freshman," USC Coach Mike Gillespie said. 
"He's not intimidated by any situation." 
</P>
<P>
 USC is hoping to ride its No. 1 ranking to a Pac-10 title, a regional 
championship and its first trip to the College World Series since 1978. The 
Trojans will try not to stumble tonight against Loyola Marymount or this 
weekend against UCLA, which is 6-17 overall and 2-4 in conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've scuffled in a big way," Gillespie said of the Bruins. "But they're 
most definitely going to win some big games and ruin someone's season." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: If former Wichita State right-hander Darren Dreifort makes the 
Dodgers' opening-day roster, he will become the third player from the 1993 
draft to break into the major leagues. Who were the first two? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to L.A.: Sixth-ranked Wichita State is completing its first 
regular-season visit to California since 1983, and Shocker Coach Gene 
Stephenson sounds as if he will be glad to leave Southern California behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked our driver how long it would take to get from our hotel in Costa Mesa 
to Cal State Fullerton," Stephenson said. "He told me, 'It could be 40 minutes 
or it could be gridlock.' I said, 'Gridlock? What's gridlock?' 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have gridlock in Wichita." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Shockers have, once again, is a team that appears capable of reaching 
Omaha for the College World Series. After winning two of three against 
14th-ranked Long Beach State last weekend, Wichita State (11-5) opened a 
two-game series against fourth-ranked Fullerton that concludes tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson, in his 17th season at Wichita State, has built his program into 
one of the nation's best. The Shockers, the 1989 national champions, regularly 
draw crowds of 5,000. Stephenson has popular radio and television shows. Even 
pitching coach Brad Kemnitz has a radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Long Beach and Fullerton will visit Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do enjoy coming out here," Stephenson said. "As long as the people we play 
return the favor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Got your number: Pepperdine's 2-1 victory over Fullerton last week was the 
Waves' eighth in a row against the Titans, a streak that dates to 1990 and 
includes the 1992 national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain it," Pepperdine Coach Andy Lopez said. "I wouldn't even know 
where to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine begins an important three-game West Coast Conference series Friday 
against first-place Santa Clara, which entered the week 17-9 overall and 8-1 in 
conference. The Broncos have not won a conference title since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (19-5) opens Big West Conference play Friday at San Jose State. Long 
Beach (17-5) travels to Nevada, and UC Santa Barbara (9-16) travels to New 
Mexico State in other Big West openers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Left-hander Brian Anderson of the Angels, the No. 3 pick 
overall out of Wright State, and left-hander Jeff Granger of the Kansas City 
Royals, the fifth pick overall out of Texas A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's end: Cal State Northridge outfielder Kevin Howard entered the week 
having hit four homers in his last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 The run started two weeks ago when he hit a grand slam in a come-from-behind 
victory over Hawaii to help the Matadors complete a Western Athletic Conference 
series sweep. Howard was one for 11 in the series before his homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get that excited -- that's not really my game plan," Howard said. "I 
just watch the game and kick back." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard hit for the cycle and added an additional homer in a nonconference 
victory over Hartford, then homered against Cal State Sacramento last weekend. 
He is batting .283 with six homers and 30 RBIs. The Matadors (15-2) play host 
to Fresno State this weekend.

 Dodger left-handed reliever Steve Wilson was released Tuesday after clearing 
waivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 29, had never equaled the success he had in helping the Dodgers down 
the stretch in 1991.After the Dodgers had claimed him on waivers that September 
from the Chicago Cubs, Wilson did not give up a run and yielded only one hit in 
11 games, a total of 8.1 innings. But he faltered early during the 1992 season 
and lost confidence, as did Manager Tom Lasorda.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson struggled as a starter at triple-A Albuquerque last season before 
suffering torn knee cartilage. He pitched well in winter ball and was average 
this spring, but left-handed reliever Gary Wayne has pitched 11 scoreless 
innings in eight appearances and taken the lead for the spot in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers will pay Wilson $88,525 of his non-guaranteed $360,000 contract.

 Pedro Astacio never really had a chance in Tuesday's exhibition against the 
Atlanta Braves at West Palm Beach. Raul Mondesi dropped a fly ball and Dave 
Hansen booted another play in the first inning before Astacio gave up a triple 
and three singles, falling behind, 5-0. The game was stopped in the top of the 
eighth inning because of rain, with the Braves winning 9-1. . . . Chan Ho Park 
and Darren Dreifort are both expected to make the trip to Los Angeles when camp 
breaks next week. MARYANN HUDSON

NHL ROUNDUP; SHARKS' TIE HELPS PAD LEAD OVER DUCKS, KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Elik scored at 12:36 of the third period to give the San Jose Sharks a 
2-2 tie at Pittsburgh Tuesday night, ending the Penguins' three-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 It also moved the Sharks (65) another point ahead of Anaheim and the Kings, 
both with 59. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Lemieux returned from a five-game absence to score one goal and set up 
the other in the third period. The point allowed the Penguins to move into 
first place ahead of the Montreal Canadiens in the Northeast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 6, St. Louis 3 -- Rod Brind'Amour had two goals and an assist, 
and Mark Recchi continued his torrent scoring pace with two assists to lift the 
Flyers at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Recchi, who is four points away from his third 100-point season, has scored 16 
points in his last nine games on four goals and 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The win moved Philadelphia ahead of Florida in the Atlantic Division, but the 
Flyers still trail Washington by five points for the final playoff spot in the 
Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 3, Chicago 1 -- Nicklas Lidstrom and Vyacheslav Kozlov scored 
first-period goals and Chris Osgood made 19 saves to lead the Red Wings to a 
victory over the Blackhawks at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The win moved Detroit back into a first-place tie in the Central Division and 
Western Conference with Toronto. Meanwhile, Blackhawk left wing Michel Goulet, 
who suffered a severe concussion last Wednesday night, was released from the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec 5, Boston 3 -- Craig Wolanin, Garth Butcher and Mike Ricci scored 
consecutive goals in the second period as the Nordiques rallied for a victory 
at Quebec, sending the Bruins to their fifth straight defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 5, Tampa Bay 4 -- Vladimir Malakhov's goal 3:59 into 
overtime capped a five-goal rally as the Islanders came back from a 4-0 deficit 
to beat the Lightning in Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 4, Hartford 1 -- Joe Juneau had a goal and two assists in his first 
game with Washington, and the Capitals dominated Hartford in a victory in 
Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 4, Calgary 4 -- A goal by newly acquired Stephane Matteau 
with 13.6 seconds left in the third period earned the Rangers a 4-4 tie with 
the Flames in Calgary, Alberta.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SNOW SAYS HE SEES THE BIG PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe Angel first baseman J.T. Snow should have seen it coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Those early days of spring training, when Eduardo Perez and Bo Jackson stayed 
after practice to field ground balls at first base, should have been a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The writing was on the wall then," Snow said Tuesday. "I knew something was 
up. I just couldn't quite figure out what." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, heralded as the second coming of Wally Joyner last season, might be 
spending his final days in an Angel uniform this week. He could be traded as 
early as Friday for New York Met pitcher Anthony Young. If not, Montreal and 
Pittsburgh, have expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really bothered me when I first heard about it because I really want to 
stay," Snow said. "But I talked to a few of the veteran players and they told 
me this is something I can't control, so why worry about it until it happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow was summoned to the offices of Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi and 
assistant Tim Mead, where he was told the Angels do not want to trade him, but 
that something has to give. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize now, more than ever, that this is a business," Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief pitcher Craig Lefferts, after reading in the newspaper that he is on 
the verge of being released, met privately with Manager Buck Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts apparently had no idea that his job was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just been working on my sinker," said Lefferts, who has a 22.50 ERA. "I 
haven't even been concerned about my fastball, but you better believe I am now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've got to go out and show them I'm still capable of pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 It made little difference in the Angels' 11-7 exhibition defeat by the Chicago 
Cubs at Mesa,Ariz. Lefferts gave up four hits and three earned runs in his only 
inning.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that he better start using that fastball because we haven't seen a 
major league fastball yet," Rodgers said. "It hasn't even been close. He better 
start getting guys out now." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Lefferts starts to show improvement, the Angels probably will trade 
him and keep Lee Guetterman, who is 1-1 with a 6.75 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It may be only spring training, but the Angels are starting to become 
embarrassed by their 3-15 record, losing six consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three wins," Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina said, "that's pitiful. I haven't 
been on a team that's gone 3-15 in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 John Dopson has unofficially become the fourth starter. He yielded nine hits 
and five runs -- four earned -- in five innings against the Cubs. He joins Mark 
Langston, Chuck Finley and Phil Leftwich in the rotation. . . . Young, who was 
scratched from his last Met start because of a strained groin muscle, pitched 
on the side for the second consecutive day with no discomfort. He is expected 
to make his next start Thursday or Friday, after which the Angels will decide 
whether to trade Snow for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Leiter, the leading candidate to become the fifth starter, will make his 
Angel debut tonight against the Colorado Rockies. Leiter, who underwent 
arthroscopic shoulder surgery last September, was examined Monday by Dr. Lewis 
Yocum and pronounced fit. He will make at least two appearances before the 
Angels make a decision by March 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels reduced their roster to 32 players Tuesday by sending infielder 
P.J. Forbes and catcher Mark Delasandro to their triple-A Vancouver team. . . . 
American League President Bobby Brown visited Rodgers before Tuesday's night 
game against Arizona State. . . . The Angels, who had gone seven games without 
a homer, got homers by right fielder Tim Salmon and catcher Greg Myers. BOB

ANAHEIM ARENA TO BE SITE OF WOODEN CLASSIC DEC. 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Orange County businessmen were having dinner last year when the 
conversation turned to John Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
 That was no surprise. One, Randy Ryan, is a former vice chairman of the John 
R. Wooden Awards, and the other, J.T. Visbal, is a longtime admirer of the 
legendary UCLA coach. What could be done, they wondered, to help further 
perpetuate the Wooden legacy? 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that sprang to life was a college basketball event called the John R. 
Wooden Classic. And a little more than seven months later, the two announced 
Tuesday that the first Classic has been scheduled Dec. 3 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The doubleheader will feature Kansas against Massachusetts and UCLA against 
Kentucky. The Bruins and Wildcats have not met since the 1975 NCAA final, which 
marked Wooden's final game as a coach and his 10th national title. NBC will 
televise both games, the first starting at 10:30 a.m. (PST). 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden was on the dais along with three of his most famous former players -- 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton and Michael Warren -- for Tuesday's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm flattered and proud," he said in his typical low-key style. "You have to 
keep your ego in the proper perspective, but I'm glad they saw fit to name this 
event in my honor. I think it can become something very worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 The last seven months have been busy for Ryan, who will be the event's 
president, and Visbal, who will be executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a couple of days of our conversation, Randy had talked to Coach Wooden 
about it," Visbal said. "The ball was really rolling down hill after that. I 
resigned from my (advertising) company and went to work full time on it." Ryan 
became involved with Wooden though his friendship with Richard (Duke) 
Llewellyn, senior vice president of the Los Angeles Athletic Club and national 
chairman of the Wooden awards program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited that we're able to bring an event of this type to Anaheim 
and Orange County," said Ryan, who grew up in Anaheim. "We had many other 
arenas contacting us, but we felt it was very important to have the event in 
Southern California, where Coach Wooden's family can attend. . . . And we 
consider the Anaheim Arena the premier arena in the country."

WEST PROVIDES ORDER IN WILD PIERCE VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To appreciate this devilish baseball game Tuesday, simply look at the Valley 
College line score: Six runs, six hits, six errors. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the kind of game Stephen King could appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley and Pierce combined for 15 errors and when the final popup was gingerly 
caught, Pierce stumbled away with a 14-6 victory in a Western State Conference 
South Division game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wasn't that the ugliest game you've ever seen?" Valley Coach Chris Johnson 
asked. "They made more errors but we managed to make ours at key times." 
</P>
<P>
 The sloppy fielding overshadowed an excellent performance by Pierce 
left-hander Adam West (3-3), who gave up five singles and struck out 11 in 
eight innings. Right-hander Chris Frith-Smith pitched a scoreless ninth for the 
Brahmas (10-8, 6-3 in division play). 
</P>
<P>
 West also struck out 11 in a 15-6 win over the Monarchs on March 10 at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 3-3, Tuesday, the Brahmas blew the game open with three 
runs in the fourth, three in the sixth and four in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Third baseman Lou Tapia provided the crushing blows with two-run doubles in 
the sixth and seventh. He also had an RBI double in the fourth against starter 
Shaik Nabi (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Tapia is eight for 10 against Valley this season, including six doubles. He 
was five for five with three RBIs on March 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce second baseman Cesar Martinez and first baseman Kevin Milligan also had 
big days. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was two for four with a two-run triple and scored four times. 
Milligan was three for three with a double, two RBIs and three walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley (6-12-1, 4-5) could not take enough advantage of the Pierce mistakes 
with the glove and stranded 10 runners. David Stevenson and Amani Smith each 
had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs scored their final three runs in the seventh without a hit but 
with the help of four errors and two walks. Tapia had two errors in the inning 
and four in the game.

MATADORS GIVE 49ERS HANDOUT; COLLEGE BASEBALL: CSUN MISCUES KEEP IT CLOSE UNTIL 
LONG BEACH WINS IN 10TH, 5-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Kernen, the Cal State Northridge baseball coach, says his team has the 
free-market system all messed up. The Matadors don't understand that credits 
are far better than debits in simple economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm opening up a gift shop," Kernen grumbled. "But there's one difference. We 
give everybody the merchandise for free." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors went bust again Tuesday, allowing runs in each of the last four 
innings as ninth-ranked Long Beach State rallied to win in 10 innings, 5-4, in 
a nonconference game at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing cheap about the last two 49er runs. Former Westlake High 
standout Tim Falsken homered to lead off the ninth to tie the score, 4-4, and 
Nate Vopata did likewise for what proved to be the game-winner in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kernen maintained it should never have come to that. He certainly had a 
point -- Long Beach (18-5) managed all of three singles off right-hander Rick 
Orr over the first seven innings, yet trailed only 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr gave up three runs over 7 1/3 innings, one earned. Even the earned run was 
tainted: One of Orr's knuckle-curves skidded to the backstop for a wild pitch 
with two out in the seventh as the 49ers closed to within 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough pitch to control," said Orr, who walked eight, struck out six 
and tied a school record with four wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge still held a 3-2 lead in the eighth when third baseman Tyler Nelson 
threw away a grounder by Kirk Pierce for a two-base error. Pinch-runner Steve 
Rivera took third on a wild pitch, and after a walk, Orr was replaced by Jason 
Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas (1-1) retired Ramon Smith on a grounder, but Rivera scored from third 
to tie the score, 3-3. Northridge (15-13) moved back ahead, 4-3, in the bottom 
of the eighth on Joey Arnold's run-scoring single with two out. 
</P>
<P>
 Falsken's homer leading off the ninth ended a long power drought by the 49er 
third baseman. Falsken missed the first 10 games with a hamstring pull, then 
homered on the first pitch of his first game. He didn't go deep again until he 
unloaded on Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposite-field shot hit by Vopata to open the 10th, his first, didn't seem 
all too dangerous when it left the bat. But left fielder Brian Vasey kept 
drifting in reverse until he ran out of room at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a popup," Vargas said. "It just kept on going back. . . . I 
just couldn't put (the game) away." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither could the offense. While holding a 3-1 lead, the Matadors botched 
sacrifice-bunt attempts in the sixth and seventh to short-circuit potential 
rallies. Northridge stranded 10 and had a runner picked off second with none 
out in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Long Beach) did nothing offensively," Kernen said. "It was Christmas again."

 Nothing seemed to go as planned for the El Camino Real High baseball team, 
even before its game against Granada Hills on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As both teams' players stood at attention awaiting the national anthem, El 
Camino Real Coach Mike Maio discovered the field's sound system was broken. 
Maio improvised and led the players in the pledge of allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
 Then El Camino Real had to face the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills pitcher Josh Goldberg tossed a three-hitter to outduel ace Randy 
Wolf, 1-0, in the Northwest Valley Conference opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat was El Camino Real's first in 13 games and Wolf's first defeat in 
eight starts dating to May 4, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reality check," said Wolf, a senior left-hander. "I pitched all right, 
but there were a lot of things I wish I did better." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf (3-1), last season's City Section 4-A player of the year, struck out 
eight, worked his way out of several tight spots and allowed only five hits. 
Unfortunately for El Camino Real (5-1), one of those hits was a run-scoring 
double by center fielder Jimmy Landress in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Landress drove a fastball from Wolf into the left-center field gap, driving 
home Bryan Weinstein from second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills (5-1) hung on thanks to Goldberg (3-1), a senior left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice El Camino Real baserunners advanced to third base with two out, but both 
times Goldberg retired the next batter. In the fourth, he got Matt Tays on a 
called third strike, and in the sixth knocked down Tays' comebacker with his 
bare hand and threw him out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking forward to this for a while," Goldberg said. "I came out 
and I was, boom -- strike! Everything was working. I kept throwing strikes and 
I stayed on throughout the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 He was aided in the sixth by third baseman Eddie Kinsler, who made a diving 
catch of Steve Riback's leadoff pop fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the play of the game," Granada Hills Coach Darryl Stroh said. "If he 
doesn't make that play, El Camino Real probably scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Goldberg) pitched a great game. They don't get any bigger than this."

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: GALLARDO'S GEM MAKES DECISION EASY FOR AGOURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agoura High baseball Coach Bryan Maloney wasn't sure who his starting pitchers 
would be once the Marmonte League season began. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, Cary Gallardo made half of that decision easy. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting the season as the closer, Gallardo pitched a no-hitter against 
Van Nuys in his first start. Not surprisingly, Maloney named him the starter 
for today's league opener at Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was setting him up during the preseason to be the closer," said Maloney, 
whose team lost four of its first five games. "But since we weren't in the 
situation to use him as a closer, I thought I'd have him start and see how he 
handled it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ended up going in there and throwing a doozy." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallardo, a senior right-hander, struck out eight and walked four, two of 
which were erased by double plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of the team was happier for him than he was for himself," Maloney 
said. "He shows no expression, never gets excited about anything. He's a very 
low-key type of kid." EAST VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Left-Handed Compliment 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt surprised Sylmar in more ways than one last week. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella figured he'd save ace Carlos Velazco 
for the championship game and throw junior varsity pitchers against host 
Roosevelt on Thursday in a semifinal game of the Sylmar tournament. Roosevelt 
responded with 19 hits in a 16-9 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the ground rules at Roosevelt seem to change depending on the number 
of left-handed batters in the lineup. The umpire told Donatella that Roosevelt 
had only one left-hander last year and any hit that cleared a 270-foot fence in 
right field was ruled a double. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Roosevelt is featuring five lefties. Guess what a ball hit over 
the right-field fence is now? A home run, of course. And Roosevelt batters hit 
three -- including a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of them were routine fly balls on our field," said Donatella, whose team 
has no left-handed hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Poly (5-1) has made great strides in a year and is proving to be one of the 
better teams in the region. Last year the Parrots were outscored, 55-8, in 
their first five games, all losses. In the same span a year later, the Parrots 
have outscored their opponents, 24-10. Coach Chuck Schwal attributes the 
turnaround to a more experienced, close-knit team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a totally different team," said Schwal, who is in his second year. 
"Everybody gets along this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Unity has its merits, but pitching is even more important. Last week, Hugo De 
La Torre (4-0) and Jerry Delgado (1-0) threw three-hit shutouts against Agoura 
and Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Valley Pac-8 Conference opener against Van Nuys on Monday, De La Torre 
tossed a two-hitter and extended his scoreless inning streak to 22. ALPHA 
LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 A Pitch for Success 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to believe L.A. Baptist is 5-2 considering only two players are batting 
over .300. The keys? Pitching and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' earned-run average is 1.14. Matt Hernandez (3-0) and Nate Laufer 
(2-1) are keeping the team in games. Hernandez, 10-0 last season and an 
All-Southern Section selection, has 24 strikeouts in 21 innings and has given 
up only 10 hits and one earned run. Laufer has been scouted by the New York 
Mets and San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights have turned six double plays. Except in an 8-7 loss to La Canada, 
the defense has been exceptional. L.A. Baptist committed eight errors against 
La Canada but only four in the five victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Infielders Matt Barker, Jeff Baumsteiger and Zack Hernandez are playing well. 
FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Bulldog Effort 
</P>
<P>
 Call Ramiro Alvarez's performance inspired. The Burbank pitcher did it all in 
a 2-1 victory over Fairfax last week. He threw a two-hitter, went three for 
three, stole home for the Bulldogs' first run and drove in the winning run with 
a single. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez, normally a relief pitcher, entered the game with an ERA of 11.00. 
CAMINO REAL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Bouncing Back 
</P>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff hit rock-bottom before finally recording a victory. The Guards lost 
their first four games, including a 20-2 bashing at the hands of Valley 
Christian before defeating St. Genevieve, 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we didn't throw the towel in after that horrible loss," said Coach 
Craig Sherwood, who was hired in early February. He is still getting to know 
the players. It hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a learning experience on both sides," he said. Around the Leagues .

</P>
<P>
 * Camarillo's Jake Spahr enters today's game with hits in his last six 
at-bats. Through seven games, Spahr is batting .480 with eight RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canyon is off to a 2-4-1 start, but Mike Bland is off to the races. The 
sophomore second baseman is batting .550 and has a .667 on-base percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Village Christian is 7-1 behind Dave Gustafson and Mike Spielman, both of 
whom are batting .556. Mike Gallegos is hitting .500.

 * Granada Hills center fielder Jimmy Landress is batting .529 with seven RBIs 
through the Highlanders' first five games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moorpark soccer player Jared Kira suffered a broken leg in a Southern 
Section all-star game Sunday. Kira, a senior defender, was an All-Southern 
Section Division V selection last season.

 The attorney for Jeff Gillooly, Tonya Harding's former husband, has told the 
Oregon State Bar that his critical remarks about her last month are protected 
by his right to free speech.

 Ron Hoevet's comments accusing Harding of complicity in the assault on rival 
Nancy Kerrigan had drawn 30 official complaints, many from other lawyers. The 
bar is considering whether to discipline Hoevet, one of Portland's most 
prominent criminal attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Harding's lawyer dismissed a report that the figure 
skater wants to skate in a competition in France in May. Bob Weaver said 
Harding might want to return to skating, but not as soon as May because of her 
probation for pleading guilty to having knowledge about the attack on Kerrigan.

DIGEST: SECTION TO MULL ELIGIBILITY PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern Section will decide Monday whether it will back a California 
Interscholastic Federation proposal that would grant students immediate 
athletic eligibility when they transfer under new open-enrollment laws. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 6, the Southern Section and representatives of each of the CIF's other 
nine sections will determine the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CIF has been meeting with legislative analysts and the feeling is that 
students who transfer under these laws ought to be immediately eligible," said 
Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley predicted, however, the new CIF policy probably will stipulate that 
students who transfer by means other than open enrollment will continue to lose 
a year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current CIF rules, a student who transfers without changing residence 
loses one year of varsity eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Open-enrollment laws, which will take effect in June, allow students to attend 
any school in their district that is not full. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Section is formulating its own proposal, Commissioner Barbara Fiege 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, there are discussions about the rules and we intend to come 
out with a proposal in May," she said. Water Polo 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Corso, the Harvard-Westlake High water polo coach who also coaches the 
U.S. national team, is taking the U.S. squad to France today to compete in a 
major international tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-nation French Open will feature the top teams in the world: Italy, 
Russia, Spain, Hungary and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime we can get a game like this, with this kind of competition, it's 
fantastic," Corso said. "These are the same teams that will play in the world 
championships in September and also in Atlanta (in the 1996 Olympics)." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States will train in Marseilles for a week and then play Russia on 
March 30, Italy on March 31 and France on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Harvard-Westlake star Jim Toring, who currently plays for UCLA and the 
national team, will not accompany the 13-man team, Corso said, because of final 
exams at UCLA. Baseball 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Hagge, Crescenta Valley High shortstop, has committed to play at Cal 
State Fullerton next season now that he has scored the NCAA-required 700 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother Erick really helped me prepare for the SAT," Hagge said. "I 
studied every night for about a month and a half for two hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagge leads the Falcons with a .615 batting average. Cycling

U.S. TEAM LEARNING THE HARD WAY; WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL: CHINESE TEAM ADMINISTERS A 
15-6, 15-13, 15-8 BEATING AT THE BREN CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Check out the latest status report on the U.S. women's national volleyball 
team and try not to wince. 
</P>
<P>
 A young, inexperienced U.S. team, missing most of its top stars, lost its 
fifth consecutive match to China, 15-6, 15-13, 15-8, Tuesday night in front of 
2,045 at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-city California "Stars and Spikes" tour against the Chinese was 
supposed to be a coming out party, a learning experience, for some of the top 
young American players. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned into target practice for the Chinese, who feature four former 
Olympians. Tuesday night's sweep was the second by the Chinese, who won two 
other matches in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 China needed only one hour 25 minutes Tuesday night to drop the United States 
to 5-5 on the year, a mark the Americans hope to improve on as they leave today 
for the Canada Cup in Winnipeg.  
</P>
<P>
 The Americans, who went 15-27 last season after winning the bronze medal at 
the 1992 Olympics, played without former Olympians Caren Kemner, Teee Williams, 
Tara Cross-Battle and Elaina Oden, who are playing overseas, and Kim Oden, who 
has retired. All but Kim Oden are expected to return by June. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Coach Terry Liskevych, entering his 10th year with the team, 
is left with a starting lineup that features two Olympians -- outside hitter 
Tammy Liley and setter Lori Endicott -- and several former college stars with 
little international experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a young team," Liskevych said. "We usually have a young group after 
each Olympics, and I think this group is way ahead of where we were in 1985 and 
'89. Once we get our veteran players back from overseas, we'll have a good 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans could have used those veterans Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 After China built a 10-3 lead and cruised to an easy victory in the first 
game, the Americans blew a 13-8 lead in the second as China scored seven 
consecutive points. The Americans fell behind, 5-2 and 10-4, in the final game 
and were never in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Liley, a former Arizona State and Ocean View High standout, led the Americans 
with 14 kills, and Elaine Youngs finished with 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngs, a former All-American at UCLA and El Toro High, also finished with a 
team-high four aces. But her four errors in the second game were costly, and 
the United States struggled to get the ball set to her all night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other night, Elaine was unstoppable," Liley said, "but tonight she 
wasn't. We have to work at being more consistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it hurts that our veteran players aren't here. Elaine is a great 
player, but she needs Tara, Elaina, and Teee here to help."

NAVY TO BEGIN 'SHIP SHOCK' TESTS NEXT MONTH; CHANNEL ISLANDS: THREE WEEKS AGO, 
THE MILITARY HAD ANNOUNCED DELAYING THE UNDERWATER EXPLOSIVES PROGRAM 
INDEFINITELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that sparked criticism from environmentalists, the Navy said Tuesday 
that it will begin next month detonating underwater explosives to test ship 
hull strength -- apparently one ship at a time -- in an area west of the 
Channel Islands that is teeming with marine life. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the "ship shock" testing program, published Tuesday in the 
legal notice sections of several Southern California newspapers, comes just 
three weeks after Navy officials said they planned to put the tests on hold 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Navy officials, the service is seeking to initially test only the 
Aegis-class destroyer John Paul Jones next month in an area about 120 miles 
west of Point Mugu. The testing site is rich with marine mammals including 
migrating gray whales, and a variety of sea lions, seals, dolphins, some of 
which are federally endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would appear that we want to test one vessel at a time," said Lt. Cmdr. 
Frank Thorp, a Navy surface fleet spokesman in San Diego. "I haven't read the 
documents yet, I don't really know what's going on with this (public notice). I 
do know that we plan to proceed with the tests sometime in April." 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy on Tuesday also released a new environmental assessment of the 
proposed testing of the John Paul Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service, which granted the Navy a 
"letter of authorization" early last month for a five-year-long "ship shock" 
testing program involving several of the Aegis-class warships, said the 
announcement took them by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Smullen, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, the parent organization of the fisheries service, said Tuesday 
that he was unaware of the change in the testing schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first thing I've heard about this," Smullen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Navy spokesman at the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station declined to 
comment Tuesday, saying they had not been briefed on the details of Tuesday's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials have acknowledged that a small number of mammals may be killed 
during the testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Reynolds, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a 
nonprofit environmental organization, said the Navy's move may be an attempt to 
"segment" the shock trials -- some of which involve the detonation of 
explosives as large as 10,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the plan may be a ploy by the Navy to minimize the heated criticism 
from environmentalists of the $38-million testing program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't free them of their responsibilities," Reynolds said. "This plan 
-- if that's what it is -- gives us no comfort just because they are saying 
they wish to do the tests one at a time. All that it means is that we will now 
have to fight both test proposals." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, fisheries officials -- reportedly at the Navy's request -- 
said they would place their letter of authorization for the testing plan on 
"indefinite hold" until a testing schedule was determined and the Navy 
officially requested the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Navy officials said Tuesday they now are in possession of the permit. 
Officials declined to name a date for the test. They explained the discrepancy 
over whether or not they held the actual permit as a matter of "semantics." 
</P>
<P>
 On March 7, the Ventura City Council added its voice to the growing debate 
over the testing by unanimously passing a resolution -- believed the first in 
the county by a City Council -- that implored the Navy to use caution while 
conducting the tests because of the ecologically sensitive nature of the 
proposed test area. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Godley, a Ventura-based environmental activist and a spokesman for the 
Earth Island Institute, said Tuesday's announcement was both frustrating and 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're trying to marginalize these tests," Godley said. "They're 
trying to reduce them so they might appear to be insignificant. That's not the 
case. What they're doing is significant and shouldn't be allowed." 
</P>
<P>
 The federally mandated testing procedure involves the detonation of underwater 
explosives at various distances from the ships to determine the strength of 
hulls, electronics packages in the ships and crew survivability. But before 
each test, extensive aerial surveys of the area will be done to check for 
marine mammals. If any are sighted, the tests would be moved or delayed, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said that the resources defense council, along with legal 
representatives of other prominent environmental groups who are opposed to the 
tests, will continue to meet with Navy officials over the controversial 
proposal and have scheduled another meeting Friday in Los Angeles. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. Navy invites public comment on its plan to conduct "ship shock" 
testing of the destroyer John Paul Jones. Comments must be received by April 1 
and should be addressed to Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Department of 
the Navy, Attn: Cmdr. E. Valdes, DDG-53 Shore Support Site, P.O. Box 82207, San 
Diego 92138-2207. Faxes can be sent to (619) 556-0238.

CHURCH HELPING FILLMORE REBUILD; QUAKE: VOLUNTEERS FROM MICHIGAN-BASED GROUP 
TRY TO FILL GAPS LEFT BY FEDERAL AID, ASSISTING IN CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIRS. 
</P>

 Wearing kelly green polo shirts and clutching clipboards, more than a dozen 
retired, out-of-town volunteers are trudging the streets of Fillmore this week, 
tallying earthquake damage and helping local residents rebuild their 
quake-ravaged lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of about 14 volunteers from the Christian Reform Church based in 
Grand Rapids, Mich., has descended on Fillmore from across the West and 
Midwest. Working with local church groups and other volunteer organizations, 
they hope to assess the needs of local residents and then fill in the gaps that 
federal disaster aid won't cover.  
</P>
<P>
 "When there is a disaster, at first people are jumping in and helping everyone 
else, but soon, they have to attend to their own business," said Henry Smit, a 
retired physician who volunteers at the Grand Rapids headquarters of the 
Christian Reform Church. "We try to send people down to organize interfaith 
groups and help them take ownership of a particular disaster, because they're 
going to be faced with it for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 During the next few months, Christian Reform workers and other volunteers plan 
to rebuild damaged homes around the city. Christian Reform volunteers will help 
primarily with construction and other repair work while local volunteers will 
assist with the renovations and help raise money to supplement grants from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide, church-based group has been responding to disasters since 
1962. Volunteers receive training from the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, members of the Christian Reform group began visiting every house in 
Fillmore and Piru, going door-to-door and asking homeowners whose property was 
damaged in the quake what still needs to be done and what kind of help they 
need to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Fillmore resident Guadalupe Pina, 41, and her mother, Juana, 76, 
aren't sure just how much repair work their $2,000 FEMA grant will cover.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Pinas outlined the extent of the damage to their Saratoga 
Street home for Christian Reform volunteers Clancy Lappinga, 73, of Redlands, 
and Donald Kraker, 70, of Phoenix, Ariz. Floors, doorways, windows, plumbing, 
the water heater and the air conditioner were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with all the destruction, their house was green-tagged. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother still hasn't spent the (FEMA) money because she still has to look 
for someone to come and fix the damage," Guadalupe Pina said on behalf of her 
mother, who speaks only Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake, Guadalupe Pina and five of her six children rented a 
small home in the back yard of the main house, but the quake left that home so 
damaged it is uninhabitable. Technically, Kraker said, the volunteers could not 
help rebuild the house in back because it is not owner-occupied, and they are 
only able to work on houses that are inhabited by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Kraker helped Guadalupe Pina fill out a four-page disaster assessment form 
describing the damage to her mother's house. Her mother, she said, subsists on 
Social Security and Guadalupe's sister, Dolores, 36, and Guadalupe's daughter 
Lorena, 18, hold down jobs that contribute to a household income under $6,500 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kraker said afterward that the disaster volunteers may be able to help the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's probably things she's not showing us right now that could be fixed," 
he said. "There's also the possibility that she would buy the materials with 
the FEMA money and we would do the work." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Kraker and Lappinga turned in the Pinas' survey form, along 
with the many others they accumulated during hours of walking Fillmore's 
tree-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Reform volunteers are due to finish their tallying by April 2 at 
the latest. Next, local volunteers will wade through the many surveys, sorting 
residents' forms according to type and severity of need. Then, as many 
communities eventually do, they may ask the Christian Reform volunteers to come 
back and help with the actual home rebuilding. Until this latest disaster in 
Fillmore, John and Bertha Vis of Grand Rapids have usually arrived for the 
construction phase of the volunteer effort. They drywalled in Des Moines, Iowa, 
last September following the epic Midwestern floods. A year ago January, in 
Homestead, Fla., John Vis, 63, repaired roofs of homes damaged by Hurricane 
Andrew, and Bertha Vis, 63, painted the homes' interiors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, they went door-to-door in Fillmore, filling out survey forms so later 
volunteers would know whom to help and what to bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents, however, insisted they really didn't need any aid at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "FEMA money is more or less for poor people who want to cry on somebody else's 
shoulder," said Robert Eckert, 75, a retired janitor whose home, yellow-tagged 
by structural engineers, needs a new foundation, a new chimney and a new 
fireplace. "I'll make it on my own. It takes guts, but you've got to have that 
in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Vises' persistent offers to connect him with a FEMA office, Eckert 
insisted federal help would be more trouble than it was worth. "I went up there 
and I got three estimates and they wanted 10 and I said, 'Forget it!' " he 
said. "It's just all a pain in the butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert said he will pay the contractor -- who has already begun work on the 
foundation -- out of income from his Social Security checks and some rental 
properties he owns, and from his savings. If necessary, he said, he'll apply 
for a loan from Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you might want to look at this," John Vis finally said, handing Eckert 
a sheet of paper with a telephone number for the California Natural Disaster 
Assistance Program, which awards low-interest, deferred loans to property 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmm, I never heard of this," Eckert said, his face brightening as he studied 
the sheet of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he said with a smile, "I may give them a call."

OXNARD FACES DILEMMA ON DEVELOPMENT; TRANSPORTATION: SLOWDOWN IN PROJECTS MEANS 
LACK OF FUNDS FOR ROADS. COUNCIL DEBATES WHAT COURSE TO TAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The slowdown of development in recent years has left Oxnard without the cash 
to build new roads and fund other transportation projects needed to keep 
traffic moving easily through some areas of the city, the City Council learned 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scared off by a sluggish economy, few developers have broken ground in Oxnard 
as of late. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, development-generated traffic revenues have declined from a 
projected $2.7 million to an actual $553,000 during the first eight months of 
fiscal year 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 And next year promises to be no better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen over the past few years a decline in development in the city," 
Development Services Director Tim Nanson told the council Tuesday. "Many of the 
dollars we saw coming in to support our vision are not materializing." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's vision included major projects such as new interchanges for the 
Ventura Freeway at Rice and Rose avenues and a new freeway bridge over the 
Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 Nanson said the idea was that developers would form assessment districts and 
collectively pay for needed road work. But while some big developments -- such 
as the Shopping at the Rose complex anchored by Wal-Mart -- have been built in 
the city recently, not enough new projects have been built to fund roadway 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Nanson said, the city is in a tough spot: Does it stay the course and 
wait for development to fund the road improvements? Or should the city scrape 
up the money to pay for the work, with the hope that development will follow 
and reimburse the city's cost? 
</P>
<P>
 "First we were waiting for development," Nanson said. "Now we're thinking 
maybe we need the new roadway systems to attract the new development." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, council members had approved a fee reduction for new 
development from $348 per added trip to about $174. The council reasoned that 
the one-time fees, which had more than tripled since 1988, were inhibiting 
development within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, council members were expected to help Nanson sort it all out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council stopped short of providing formal direction, instead ordering 
city staff members to do more homework on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "I welcome the opportunity to have this discussion," said Councilman Mike 
Plisky, who blasted staff members for providing a sketchy report on the matter. 
"I think it is long overdue. But I think to sit here and deal with broad 
generalizations, without seeing the entire picture, is the wrong thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, council members talked generally about the need to re-examine the 
city's road development standards. By way of example, council members said 
perhaps narrower roads should be allowed for some projects as a way of lowering 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And council members stressed the need for city staff to more aggressively 
pursue grants and other sources of revenue to fund transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, council members said the city needs to guard against ever again 
developing a plan for transportation projects without having a guaranteed 
source of money to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current plan is not adequate," Councilman Tom Holden said. "We kind of 
danced around this a little bit, but we don't have the money to do the projects 
we promised to put in." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Mayor Manuel Lopez: "The philosophy was that people who caused the need 
for the improvements would have to pay for them. Now we just need a way to make 
sure that happens."

TRIAL BEGINS FOR MAN ACCUSED IN BEACH GUNFIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly eight months after a gunfight erupted on a crowded Ventura beach and 
shocked many in the community, a teen-ager with Santa Paula gang affiliations 
went on trial Tuesday to face four criminal charges in connection with the 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 A prosecutor told a Superior Court jury that 19-year-old Alejandro Garcia put 
hundreds of lives in danger -- including those of young, frolicking children -- 
when he blasted five shots toward members of the Bad Boyz gang near the south 
jetty at the San Buenaventura State Beach on Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Todd R. Howeth acknowledged that his client fired the 
first shots, but said he was only responding to previous threats when he pulled 
out his .44 Magnum pistol in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities initially investigated more than half a dozen suspects in 
the beach incident, they were only able to get charges in direct connection 
with the shooting to stick against Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's 19-year-old cousin, John Sosa, was charged with accessory after the 
fact for trying to hide the gun Garcia used in the shooting after the suspects 
were stopped by police, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim G. Gibbons. Sosa's trial is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of three men Garcia allegedly opened fired on were charged shortly after 
the shootout, but those charges were eventually dropped by a judge and a grand 
jury for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The same grand jury charged Garcia with two felonies -- assault with a firearm 
and grossly negligent shooting -- and two misdemeanors -- carrying a concealed 
firearm and carrying a loaded firearm in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who authorities say is not a gang member, faces nearly 12 years in 
prison if convicted of all the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons told jurors that more than 200 people had flocked to the beach the 
morning of the shooting, drawn there by warm weather and a bright sun, and not 
expecting to be trapped in the middle of a potentially deadly gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Garcia drove his Chevrolet Blazer to the beach with Sosa, another 
cousin and a fourth person -- all affiliated with the Santa Paula-based Crazy 
Boyz gang, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Crazy Boyz spotted the Bad Boyz on the beach, Gibbons said, "and 
without hesitation (Garcia) pulled out a gun and blasted five shots." 
</P>
<P>
 He said one bullet hit the sand three inches in front of an innocent 
12-year-old boy, who was playing with his 9-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons told the jury that the Bad Boyz started to flee, but that at least one 
of them turned around and returned three shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "After those three shots, the defendant and his friends got back into the 
Blazer," Gibbons said. "The defendant reloaded his gun before driving off." 
</P>
<P>
 As Garcia drove down Spinnaker Drive, he took his gun out again and fired once 
more before being pulled over by a Ventura police officer, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons also told the jury that no member of the Bad Boyz was charged because 
witnesses could not agree on which one fired the returned shots. Police found 
the gun that was used to return fire, he said, but it had been hidden in the 
sand, which effectively wiped off any fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Garcia, Gibbons said self-defense is no excuse for his actions because, 
among other things, he provoked the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence will show that . . . the defendant pulled his gun out first and 
started shooting," Gibbons said, dismissing the defense notion that Garcia only 
fired into the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Howeth said Garcia and his friends had gone to the beach merely to fish. 
</P>
<P>
 After spotting the Bad Boyz, he said, Garcia shot into the sand because he had 
been victimized by those gang members previously. 
</P>
<P>
 Howeth said Garcia moved to Fresno to live with his grandparents in 1992 
because of continual verbal and physical threats from the Bad Boyz. 
</P>
<P>
 He came back to Santa Paula the day before the beach shooting because his 
sister had given birth to a baby. He decided to go fishing Aug. 5, not 
expecting to face off with the Bad Boyz, Howeth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was shoot or be shot," Howeth told the jury. "He was frightened." 
</P>
<P>
 He called the trial "a case of a young teen-ager from Santa Paula who has 
lived under death threats from street thugs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex Garcia has waited for this day," Howeth said of the trial. "We are going 
to ask you for justice because the time has come for justice."

SETTLEMENT NEAR ON DREDGING IN VENTURA KEYS; LITIGATION: CITY SAYS MANY 
HOMEOWNERS SUPPORT AGREEMENT OVER PAYING FOR REMOVAL OF SILT FROM BACK-YARD 
CANALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura city leaders announced Tuesday that they are one step closer to 
reaching a settlement with homeowners over a lawsuit about who should pay for 
dredging the silt in the Ventura Keys. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of lobbying and negotiating with Keys residents, city officials 
have decided that there is enough support among property owners for a 
settlement to merit drafting a formal agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Keys homeowners say they are tired of fighting and spending thousands of 
dollars in legal fees to contest who should dredge their back-yard canals. 
About one-third of Keys property owners have filed lawsuits against the city 
and county since 1991, when the council levied assessments on homeowners to 
cover dredging costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to settle," said David Harris, a vocal opponent of the city. "There 
are very few people who are enthusiastic about the settlement, but we don't 
have unlimited time, and we don't have unlimited funds. We've been worn down." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said 229 Keys property owners support a settlement proposal 
that has been circulating since September. A formal settlement agreement is 
expected to be distributed in May for Keys residents to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal could still fall apart because there are at least 11 holdouts who 
are not in support of the settlement, and 68 homeowners who have not responded 
to the proposal. City leaders said they want all Keys property owners to sign 
the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope they'll come to their senses," Councilman Gregory L. Carson said, 
referring to the holdouts. "This is a settlement with everybody, and there may 
not be an offer any more." 
</P>
<P>
 If all homeowners do not agree to the settlement, the council will have to 
decide whether to withdraw the offer and go to court, renegotiate the offer, or 
settle with some homeowners and continue fighting others in court, City Atty. 
Peter D. Bulens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keys residents have maintained for years that they should not have to pay for 
dredging because runoff from the county's Arundell Barranca and 28 city storm 
drains is responsible for dumping mud and other pollutants into the waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 Although about 100 property owners have sued the city and county, the 
settlement is being offered to all 300 homeowners because city officials are 
hoping to ward off future lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Massa, a Keys resident who did not respond to the settlement proposal, is 
not in favor of it because homeowners would be responsible for maintaining the 
rock walls in their back-yard canals, which could be very expensive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement also calls for reducing the average annual assessment from 
$1,733 per property to $685, with a guarantee that the fee will increase by no 
more than $64 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would pay the $2.5-million dredging costs for 1992 -- which would 
otherwise be covered by the assessed fees on property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, property owners would agree to drop their lawsuits against the city 
and pledge not to file future lawsuits relating to the Keys pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and Keys homeowners have already gone one round in court. Residents 
lost a lawsuit last year over whether the city has the authority to assess 
homeowners extra taxes to pay for dredging their canals. 
</P>
<P>
 Massa said he thinks that most homeowners will eventually sign the settlement, 
including himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably knuckle under," he said. "The city could tie us up for 20 years 
in court. It's blackmail, really. If you sign the settlement, your assessment 
will be around $600. If you don't, it will be about $1,800. Who's not going to 
take that?"

WEST VENTURA FOCUS: MAN ARRESTED AFTER SHOTS FIRED AT TRUCK

<P>
 Oxnard police have arrested a 21-year-old man on suspicion of shooting at a 
pickup truck with a man and his two young daughters inside, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Lara, of Oxnard, was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon and carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Rodriguez told police that he was driving in the 5500 block of Cypress 
Road about 7:50 p.m. Monday when someone fired several bullets at his pickup 
truck. No one was hurt, but a witness reported seeing two men running from the 
scene through a field on Saviers Road north of Hueneme Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Several minutes later, Officer Christopher Orsini spotted Lara running in the 
200 block of West Clara Street. Lara refused to stop, and was tackled by Orsini 
in the intersection of West Clara and Courtland streets. Police found a loaded 
.22-caliber handgun in his right front pants pocket, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses later identified Lara as the person who fired the shots at 
Rodriguez's pickup truck, police said. Investigators do not know whether 
Rodriguez was the intended target, police spokesman David Keith said. JULIE

 A 21-year-old man who died Monday while rock climbing in Los Padres National 
Forest has been identified as Robert Patrick Billingsley of Maricopa, a Ventura 
County coroner's official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Billingsley died from a head injury after falling about 250 feet while trying 
to scale a cliff known as the Sespe Wall along California 33 north of Ojai, 
sheriff's deputies said. He died instantly, said Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate. 
</P>
<P>
 Billingsley's 28-year-old brother, David, was climbing the same wall and had 
to be rescued after his brother fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Wingate said both men were free-climbing without ropes or safety equipment 
when the accident occurred. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA FOCUS: COUPLE SENTENCED IN PAYROLL-TAX CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood couple has been sentenced to three years' probation for 
failing to pay $12,000 in payroll taxes for employees working at the 
now-defunct Scandia restaurant at Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard, authorities 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robair and Anette Altounian were sentenced March 11 by Ventura County Superior 
Court Judge Lawrence Storch to probation and ordered to pay back $12,000 in 
back taxes in lieu of serving jail time, said Rosemary Shorr, a spokeswoman for 
the Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorr said the Altounians failed to pay taxes on up to 50 employees who worked 
at their restaurant between July 1, 1992, and April 30, 1993, when the business 
was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorr said the couple avoided paying taxes by not reporting that the people 
were working at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the flagrancy of it," she said. "That's why the district attorney's 
office wanted to prosecute these people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Altounians were arrested in June, 1993, and pleaded guilty in December.

WEST VENTURA FOCUS: OXNARD; SPIT-AND-POLISH REGIMEN FOR STUDENT CADETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wearing newly shined shoes and crisply pressed uniforms, more than 100 Naval 
Junior Reserve cadets who underwent a military inspection at Hueneme High 
School on Tuesday appeared much better groomed than typical high school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 But some weren't quite tidy enough for Naval Junior Reserve Cmdr. Daniel 
Jorvig. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorvig walked slowly up and down the rows of the student cadets, stopping to 
inspect each person from head to toe. 
</P>
<P>
 And he seemed to notice everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your hat is off to the left," Jorvig said to freshman Harold Hill. "You want 
to have the middle of the brim right over the bridge of your nose." 
</P>
<P>
 Such minutiae may seem irrelevant to the many students in the Naval Junior 
Reserve who said they have no intention of joining the military as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jorvig, who is based at the Naval Training Center in San Diego, said a 
major goal of the Reserve Officer Training Corps is to instill discipline and 
teach students to pay attention to detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It teaches them that small things are as important as the large things," 
Jorvig said. "You find out in life that the small things will get you in 
trouble. The large things take care of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to learning the proper way to wear their uniforms, students in the 
Naval Junior Reserve program practice military drills with dummy rifles and do 
course work on subjects ranging from naval history to developing better study 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have to adhere to strict classroom rules. And students who break the 
rules during ROTC class undergo a common form of military punishment: pushups. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you chew gum in our class, you do pushups," said ROTC class instructor 
George Thompson, a retired Navy captain. 
</P>
<P>
 The strict regimen has won respect from other Hueneme High students who 
initially poked fun at their uniformed classmates, said junior Chris Lynch, one 
of a handful of students who watched the military inspection Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of it everybody was making fun of them, but not anymore," 
Chris said. "Everybody knows how much they have to do: a lot of work, a lot of 
pushups." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, some students in the ROTC class said they signed up for the 
course mainly to learn self-discipline. But many others said they had a less 
lofty motive for taking the course: ROTC satisfies Hueneme High's physical 
education requirement.

EAST VENTURA FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; D.A. WILL APPEAL IN MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney's office has decided to appeal a judge's 
decision to reduce a first-degree murder conviction that a jury had imposed on 
a Newbury Park man, a prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch on Friday lowered 27-year-old Todd Love's 
conviction to second-degree murder, saying prosecutors had not proved that the 
defendant planned to kill Frank Kish, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Without premeditation, Storch ruled, Love was guilty only of the lesser count. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury found Love guilty in December of fatally shooting Kish, his sister's 
boyfriend, as 911 operators heard the shooting on the phone and taped it. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty Michael K. Frawley, who prosecuted Love, said Tuesday that 
the district attorney's office will appeal to the 2nd District Court of Appeal 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said they found Kish guilty of first-degree murder because he called 
911 operators before shooting his victim and announced his murderous 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley said prosecutors believe that it was unlawful for the judge to reduce 
the verdict and "act as a 13th juror." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Storch said the judge has a policy against commenting on 
pending cases. Storch is scheduled to sentence Love to a maximum 18 years to 
life for Kish's death on April 15. Under the original jury verdict, Love would 
have faced 28 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley said California law does not allow judges to reduce jury verdicts that 
are based on "sufficient, credible evidence" from the trial record. He said 
prosecutors, in deciding to appeal, determined that Storch had decided to 
re-weigh the evidence in the case without proper basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to respect what the jury decides," Frawley said. He said prosecutors 
may wait until after the Love sentencing to file the appeal. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA FOCUS: MOORPARK; HEARING TONIGHT ON SLOW-GROWTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark residents will have their first opportunity at a City Council meeting 
tonight to speak out on a proposed new ordinance to limit growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to adopt an ordinance after a series of public 
hearings over the next several months.The ordinance will take the place of 
Measure F, a growth-limiting initiative that expires at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents adopted Measure F in 1986, during a decade when Moorpark's 
population more than tripled, increasing from 8,000 people in 1980 to 25,000 in 
1990.  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, growth has come to a near standstill in the city, but local 
officials say the reasons have more to do with economic reasons than the 
restrictive growth measure.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is building in a down economy," said Jim Aguilera, Moorpark's director 
of community development. "There's really no pressure for development." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the city wants to be ready when the economy rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinance is meant to kick in when the economy rolls around and we again 
see pressure for growth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As with Measure F, the new slow-growth ordinance is expected to limit the 
number of houses built to no more than 500 in any given year until 2010, when 
the city will reach its planned maximum population of 41,000. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expect that it will take at least two months of public debate 
to develop a final draft of the ordinance.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the ordinance, the City Council will discuss a measure to 
protect the area's ridgelines from development. The meeting begins at 7 p.m. in 
the council chambers of the Moorpark Community Center, 799 Moorpark Ave. SCOTT

EAST VENTURA FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PLANNER POSTPONES AHMANSON HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A hearing scheduled Tuesday on a proposal to extend Thousand Oaks Boulevard 
from Los Angeles County 1,000 feet to the Ventura County line as part of the 
giant Ahmanson Ranch housing development has been continued until April 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Ristic, a Los Angeles County regional planning hearing officer, continued 
the proceedings because he wanted more time to study the proposed roadway 
extension before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go out and look at the site, and I also want to talk with county 
counsel regarding the development," Ristic said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 90-minute hearing, representatives of the city of Los Angeles and 
Calabasas as well as several homeowner groups discussed potential traffic 
problems that the development would create for surrounding communities. 
Ahmanson Land Co. officials also spoke about steps the developer plans to take 
to mitigate traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson wants to extend Thousand Oaks Boulevard from Mountain Gate Drive in 
Los Angeles County across the Ventura County line, which would also require a 
permit to remove nine oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension would be one of two main entrances to the development, which 
calls for 3,050 dwellings, two golf courses and 400,000 square feet of 
commercial space to be built in the rolling hills southeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson project, approved by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors in 
December, 1992, has been stalled because of lawsuits filed by Los Angeles 
County and others who would be affected by the project. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County judge, however, earlier this month upheld the Board of 
Supervisors' decision to approve the project and ruled that the development's 
environmental impact report met all state guidelines. Los Angeles County and 
the other eight plaintiffs in the suit are considering filing an appeal. CARLOS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DOCTORS FIRED FROM CLINIC PROTEST PUBLICLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two doctors fired from a clinic that serves the county's poor said Tuesday 
that they were unfairly targeted because they challenged the clinic's 
management over patient care issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Gonzalez and Victor Pulido stood outside Clinicas del Camino Real in 
Oxnard near a florescent green sign that read, "We were forced to abandon our 
patients." 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors also handed out balloons with sad faces drawn on them to children 
entering the clinic with their families. It was their second day of public 
protest over the job action, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This clinic purports to champion the cause of the Hispanic community and here 
are two excellent Hispanic doctors who are fired," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido said Clinicas' patients will face longer waits for appointments and 
lose continuity in their care because he and Gonzalez were terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors clashed with management when they protested a policy stating that 
Clinicas' physicians would not be paid if they left the clinic during a shift 
to care for indigent patients in the hospital, Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get docked for our time lost serving in the clinic," Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinicas' Executive Director Robert Juarez said that is not true. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a total falsehood," he said. "They have been paid for all amounts due 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez said he cannot comment on why Pulido and Gonzalez were dismissed 
earlier this month because it is a personnel issue. But he said there was no 
unfair treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 He also contested the doctors' assertion that patient care will suffer as a 
result of their termination. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our patients have access to other physicians that we have on staff," 
he said. KAY SAILLANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; RACIST LEAFLETS ARE DISCUSSED AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Administrators and student leaders at Buena High School have met to discuss 
concerns over racist flyers found stuffed in student lockers, Ventura Unified 
School District Supt. Joseph Spirito said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principal has assured the student leadership that we don't tolerate 
this," Spirito said. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaflets were stuffed into about 1,800 lockers at the school over the 
weekend, he said. Students discovered them Monday morning and immediately 
notified faculty members, Spirito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar flyers have been found in lockers at several east county schools in 
recent months. The propaganda ridicules Latinos and carries a message of white 
supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the sickest piece of literature I've ever seen," Spirito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Associated Student Body member Beth Denger said students were disgusted with 
the leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of friends who are minorities and they were very upset by it," 
she said. "A lot of people just crumpled it up and threw it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the flyers came from a white supremacist group based in West 
Covina. But officials don't know who put them in the students' lockers, Spirito 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that we weren't able to catch them," Spirito said. "It's an 
open campus and anyone could have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar flyers have appeared in soft drink packs, backpacks and pantyhose 
containers in stores in Ventura and Los Angeles counties since October, police 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaflets have been found stuffed into lockers at Royal and Simi Valley 
high schools in Simi Valley, and Westlake High in Thousand Oaks. KAY SAILLANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: U.S. FUNDS SOUGHT FOR PIPELINE STUDY

 Concerned with recent oil spills, Ventura County officials are seeking federal 
funds to conduct an inventory of local oil pipelines to find danger zones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oil has always been a major issue in this county," Supervisor Maggie Kildee 
said during board comments at the supervisors' meeting Tuesday. "We need to get 
a handle on the pipelines. How old are they? How long have they been in place?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee directed Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg to secure 
federal funds for the inventory and return to the board with his findings. 
</P>
<P>
 She also requested that Wittenberg form a panel with county officials and oil 
company representatives to find ways to prevent future spills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be an interesting study," Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three months, three oil spills in Ventura County have raised 
questions about the reporting system that state officials and environmentalists 
rely on to safeguard sensitive habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest spill, a 30,000-gallon mixture of light crude oil and water, wound 
its way down a Santa Paula canyon and into the Santa Clara River on Saturday 
after overflowing from a Unocal storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 84,000 gallons of thick crude leaked into McGrath Lake near 
Oxnard after a state park ranger and six other law enforcement agencies ignored 
early reports of the spill. Bush Oil Co. executives admitted that a pipeline 
leaked for three days before it was noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, local prosecutors served a search warrant at a Texaco facility 
in Ventura, suspecting that the oil company failed to report the true extent of 
a 370,000-gallon release of a petroleum byproduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the state Department of Fish and Game said they believe that 
the contaminant leaked from a ruptured Texaco pipeline near School Canyon Road 
north of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of old pipelines people have forgotten about," said 
Supervisor Susan K. Lacey. "Those are the ones we need to look at." TINA DAUNT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MORE CANDIDATES FINANCING OWN RACES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A growing number of Ventura County political candidates are digging into their 
own pockets to finance their campaigns for some of the county's top elected 
positions, including two supervisorial posts. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, attorney Trudi K. Loh, who is running for the supervisor's seat being 
vacated by Maria VanderKolk, has poured $10,000 of her own money into the 
campaign, according to finance reports filed Tuesday.Loh reported total cash 
contributions of $14,475 received since Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo reported total cash contributions of 
$1,650, which included $1,281 of his own money. Malibu rancher Carter J. Ward 
loaned his campaign $1,445, while reporting no other campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance reports from former Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer and 
taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings, two other candidates, had not been received 
by the county elections office. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Simi Valley Councilwoman Barbara Williamson, who is competing for 
the supervisor's seat being vacated by Vicky Howard, reported raising $11,224, 
far outpacing two rivals who also filed finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson received $1,800 from the Public Employees Assn. of Ventura County 
and $750 each from Bromley Foods of Calabasas, Westwood Financial Corp., AKAI 
Construction Co. and several developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels raised $3,362, while parks official James 
Meredith reported a personal loan of $1,430. A finance report for Moorpark City 
Councilman Scott Montgomery was not available. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of six candidates for county auditor-controller also filed reports that 
were available Tuesday. Incumbent controller Thomas O. Mahon led the way with 
$7,094 in contributions; accountant Scott Weiss was second with $4,684, 
including a $2,300 personal loan; and accountant William Baker was last with 
$4,401, all of which he loaned himself. Reports for Simi Valley Mayor Greg 
Stratton and accountants Clifford Wigen and Richard Morrisset were not 
immediately available. CARLOS V. LOZANO

PLANS FOR FESTIVAL SITE TO BE DISCUSSED; DEVELOPMENT: PROJECT ON THE 67-ACRE 
LOT WOULD FORCE SIMI VALLEY DAYS ORGANIZERS TO FIND A NEW HOME FOR THE EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials tonight will discuss plans to move ahead with 
development on the 67-acre lot where Simi Valley Days, the city's annual 
carnival, is held. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Planning Commission approves a series of suggested changes to the 
city's General Plan, the land at Los Angeles Avenue and Madera Road could 
become the site of a project that could include both residential and commercial 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Development of the site would force Simi Valley Days organizers to find a new 
home for the event, which usually takes place in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Simi Valley Days said they have long expected the land would be 
developed, but hope for the chance to use the property until a permanent home 
for the festival can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been looking, so far without success, for a place to locate the event 
for good," said David Yasman, last year's Simi Valley Days chairman. "It has 
become very difficult because of the buildup of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, who have been working with festival organizers to find another 
location for the event, said it is unclear how soon a development at the site 
would displace the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many of the city's large parcels of vacant land have been developed, 
officials said it has been difficult to find a site as suitable for the 
festival as the present location. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be tough for them to find something," said Laura Kuhn, deputy 
director of advanced planning. "There are other vacant parcels in the city, but 
not ones that are as large and as flat as the one they've got now." 
</P>
<P>
 But Yasman said he does not expect Simi Valley Days officials to oppose a 
development because the festival has been able to use the expansive lot for 
free for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think it will be a few years before anything gets going there, but 
they were very generous to let us use the land in the first place," he said. "I 
don't see us getting in the way of their plans now." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's debate will focus on dividing the land into four parcels, one for 
each of the three landowners and the fourth for a proposed post office. 
</P>
<P>
 Several attempts to build on the property before 1988 fell through, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, the parcels have been bound together by a long-range planning 
guideline for use of the entire 67 acres, but the owners have been unable to 
agree on a plan to develop the land together, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Planning Commissioner Michael Piper said that despite the failures, 
the city is not opposed to a project going up on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure why there hasn't been successful development of that piece of 
land," Piper said. "I can think of several occasions in which the city has 
granted the developers just about everything they wanted and still it didn't 
work out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Great Western Bank, one of the three property owners, said he 
did not know why development has failed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure, but I know we have not had any real opposition," said John 
Tomakin, the Great Western spokesman. "Right now we're slating the land for a 
residential development, but it's still in its earliest stages." 
</P>
<P>
 The other landowners, Simi Valley Partners and Plaza International, could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's public hearing on plans for the property is scheduled for 7 p.m. in 
City Hall, 2929 Tapo Canyon Road.

FEE LEVIED ON HOMEOWNERS TO PAY FOR STORM WATER PROGRAM; SIMI VALLEY: THE $7.15 
ASSESSMENT IS EXPECTED TO RAISE $265,000. REST OF MONEY FOR FEDERALLY MANDATED 
PROJECT WOULD COME FROM SANITATION DISTRICT TAX REVENUES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council has reluctantly agreed to levy a $7.15 fee on 
every homeowner in the city for a federally mandated program to keep storm 
water from carrying pollutants through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff had recommended that the council charge nearly $20 per household to 
cover the $733,000 annual cost of the city's Storm Water Management Program. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council voted instead to lower the charge from $8 to $7.15 a year, 
which would raise about $265,000. The rest of the cost of the program will be 
paid out of the city Sanitation District's share of property tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, required by the federal Environmental Protection Agency to 
control the spreading of pollution during storms, is administered by Ventura 
County officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual cities are responsible for collecting fees and handing them over to 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 A large part of the fee pays for maintenance and operation of five 
water-monitoring stations in the west county. Two additional stations are 
planned for Simi Valley along the Arroyo Simi later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In agreeing to impose the tax, council members said they were concerned about 
charging residents for a program required by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to sit here and look at a mandated program and figure out 
how you're going to fleece the people to pay for it," Councilman Bill Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sandi Webb suggested that a notice be enclosed with residents' 
annual property tax bills informing them that the $7.15 fee is paying for a 
federal program. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to let people know," Webb said. "Here's this tax; go yell at your 
congressman." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, Mayor Greg Stratton asked the council to consider 
dropping a $25 fee that the city would charge residents who need to prove that 
they have been removed from the city's flood zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a federal agency reduced the city's flood zone in size, allowing 
more than 1,200 homeowners to drop federally mandated flood insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insurance companies and bankers require a notarized letter before they 
will agree to drop the insurance, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city usually charges for such letters, to cover the cost of looking up a 
property and confirming its status. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the requests will be concentrated in a small area in the middle of 
the city, the workload for city staff should be minimal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all going to be on one map," Stratton said. "And while we have the map 
out, it's very cheap to go over and look at it and figure out if you're in or 
out."

DRIVEN TO TROUBLE; IDLING FIRETRUCK IS MOVED BY MAN, WHO THEN IS ARRESTED 
</P>

 Garry Campbell says he was NOT trying to steal that bright yellow Ventura 
County fire engine in front of his house just after midnight Tuesday in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 He just wanted to move it because its idling motor was keeping his four 
children awake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Campbell threatened Tuesday to sue the Sheriff's Department for falsely 
accusing him of vehicle theft, authorities argued that his drive of less than 
100 yards in the county's fire engine endangered the life of a heart-attack 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 And it could cost Campbell up to a year in jail if he is convicted of 
interfering with an emergency crew, said Ventura County Sheriff's Detective 
Dave Ehrlich. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two versions of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Both begin with the same scenario: 50-year-old real estate consultant meets 
late-model, chrome-yellow fire engine. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the crew from Ventura County Fire Co. 31 pulled up in the 
4200 block of Palomino Circle and parked in front of Campbell's house just 
after midnight, leaving the truck in neutral with the motor on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone left a firetruck in front of my house with the engine running and no 
one around," Campbell said angrily. "It felt like an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 or 15 minutes of rumbling, Campbell said, he called 911, thinking the 
truck might have been stolen and abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he went outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing no one, he climbed into the engine, put it in gear and drove it down 
the block. He hopped out and walked back up the street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way home, he saw someone climb into the truck and back it up toward his 
house again, Campbell said, "And I tried to wave at them to say something to 
please don't park it in front of my house, but they ignored me." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, sheriff's deputies arrived and arrested him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a stupid thing to do," Campbell admitted. "But I just wanted to get 
the noise away from the house so my kids (ages 12 to 23) could go back to 
sleep. They had to get up early and go back to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Company 31 Engineer Doug Beving tells a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had examined Campbell's neighbor for heart trouble and was ready 
to load the man into a waiting ambulance when Beving walked outside to fetch 
the gurney, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the engine revving up, I went inside and I wasn't counting noses so I 
didn't know we were all in there. And then someone said, 'Somebody else is 
driving the engine off!' " recalled Beving, a 20-year veteran firefighter. "I 
went out, and he'd already driven it around the cul-de-sac and was heading down 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Its air brakes still engaged, the truck was moving slowly, Beving said. So he 
ran after it and caught up just as it stopped at the intersection of Valley 
Springs Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know who was in it at the time, I just made up my mind that whoever 
was in it has gotta come out," Beving said. "I grabbed the door and pulled him 
out and said, 'Hey, what are you doing?' and he comes back with 'Well, what are 
you doing here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Beving climbed back into the truck and prepared to back it up to the heart 
attack victim's house, he said, but Campbell ran around to the passenger side 
and tried to climb in. 
</P>
<P>
 Beving said he stomped on the brakes twice, hoping the truck's momentum would 
slam the passenger door shut before Campbell could get in. Finally, he said, he 
pushed a panic button that automatically radioed sheriff's deputies to signal 
that a firefighter was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was strange behavior, I didn't know what to think," Beving said. "We've 
got one of the newest engines in the county, and I didn't want to see it 
disappear on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Told this version of the incident, Campbell replied, "Interesting story. . . . 
It's just absolutely untrue." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what happened, said Detective Ehrlich, Campbell had no business 
moving the county fire engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrlich said he plans to ask the district attorney to charge Campbell with 
interfering with an emergency crew, which carries a maximum penalty of a year 
in jail. And maybe joy-riding, too, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a hell of a lot more social impact than the loss of an engine or the 
embarrassment of (the firefighter)," said Ehrlich. "There was a man's life up 
at the end of the cul-de-sac on the line, too, and Mr. Campbell doesn't care 
because his kids have to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrlich added, "Have him explain that his behavior was OK to the heart attack 
victim . . . next door." 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't happen like they said it did," Campbell said. "I'm going to have my 
lawyer call the sheriffs. I'm going to sue them all for defamation of 
character." 
</P>
<P>
 The heart-attack victim, Beving said, was driven to Westlake Medical Center by 
ambulance. The fire engine was returned, safe and sound, to Company 31's 
station.

Newbury Park hit yet another setback as city planners reversed a ruling that 
would have allowed a commercial project to be built there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission's vote, taken late Monday, could limit construction on 
the environmentally sensitive land, wiping away zoning for a shopping center 
and sharply reducing the number of homes permitted on the property. The 
decision still needs to be approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Nedjatollah Cohan and his son Albert Cohen, who have fought and lost countless 
battles with the city over the property at Reino Road and Kimber Drive, were 
furious at a decision they called a "shot from the hip." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is ridiculous," an angry Cohen said after the meeting. "They had nothing 
to support this decision. It's politics, plain and simple." 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission, on a 3-2 vote, decided that another shopping center in 
Newbury Park was unnecessary and the wetlands on Cohan's property needed 
greater protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty tough to cram a shopping center down people's throats when it's 
clear they don't want it," Commissioner Marilyn Carpenter said. "It's also 
clear that there is a strong expression of community will in terms of 
preserving these wetlands." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said she agreed with a 1993 recommendation by then-Mayor Judy Lazar, 
which said a shopping center would require "a sea of asphalt" that could 
threaten the property's sensitive natural habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Chairman Irving Wasserman, who voted with Carpenter and 
Commissioner Linda Parks, said hundreds of Newbury Park residents have 
expressed a desire to see the wetlands preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the items before the commission required a change in the city's 
General Plan, Wasserman said the normally nonpolitical commission was correct 
in taking some degree of public expression into account. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere, the needs and desires of the community have to be a factor," 
Wasserman said. "Community opinion is what has shaped the General Plan and 
shaped the way this city looks." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cohan argued that the public did not know the facts about his property and 
brought in a battery of financial experts to testify to the benefits of 
developing the land.  
</P>
<P>
 After the speakers had finished, Commissioner Forrest Frields said he was 
convinced there was a need for commercial development at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the commercial viability of such a project has been amply 
demonstrated," Frields said. "I think it is appropriate for us to consider the 
need for commercial development here, and I'm sorry that we're going to see 
this voted down on a 3-2 vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally frustrated was Commissioner Mervyn Kopp, who, after sitting quietly 
through most of the meeting, became extremely vocal in opposition of the zone 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am totally, 100%, unalterably opposed to the motion (to change the 
zoning)," Kopp said. "I say, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp said he believed the commission would appear inconsistent because it 
approved Cohan's development plans in 1992. Those plans were later overturned 
by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 After the council's decision, Cohan sued the city -- he lost and the case is 
now on appeal -- and Cohan's son said this decision may lead down the same 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to have to sue the city again," Cohen said. "All this is an 
effort to get us to sit down and negotiate and we won't do it. It's our land." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said what upset him the most about the decision was that in the 12 years 
he has been fighting the city, the wetlands on his property have multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
 The wetlands, which now stretch in two large branches through the center of 
the land, are the result of drainage from developments around the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have waited and waited, and now, all of a sudden, we have willows on our 
property and that's it," Cohen said. "Now they say, 'Sorry Mr. Cohen, but now 
we have to preserve the willows.' "

 * Investors responded with a buying frenzy to the news that Manuel Camacho 
Solis has decided not to run for the presidency in August. The Bolsa index 
rocketed 128.91 points, or 5.4%, to 2,511.92, the biggest one-day rise since 
January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * The market had been sinking for weeks on expectations that Camacho, the 
peace commissioner negotiating with Mexico's southern rebels, would challenge 
the ruling PRI party's candidate. His decision not to do so ends fears of a 
messy campaign that could derail the PRI's long-term economic plan. Analysts 
warn that the government still faces the challenge of reviving the economy in 
the short run.

 The economy has improved drastically in the past three years as a result of 
reduced tariffs, a devalued currency and new export-oriented and foreign 
investment policies. Finance Minister Manmohan Singh recently proposed further 
reforms, including cutting customs duties, widening rupee convertibility and 
easing taxes.

 House Approves Bank Branching Bill: The House approved a bill to revamp 
decades-old regulations that limit the ability of banks to run branches across 
state lines, a move that would pave the way for coast-to-coast banking. Similar 
interstate branching legislation easily cleared the Senate Banking Committee 
last month and is awaiting a final vote by the full Senate.The Clinton 
Administration supports the plan. The House bill would permit healthy banks to 
acquire any bank in any state one year after enactment. After 18 months, banks 
with subsidiaries around the country could merge them into a unified branch 
system. State legislatures would have three years to adopt laws that would 
exempt their state from the plan. And banks could establish branches in any 
state that allows such a move.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; SPOTLIGHT ON MALAYSIA; MALAYSIA IS 
MODERN, USER-FRIENDLY; ASIA: BUSINESS CUSTOMS IN THE PACIFIC RIM NATION ARE 
SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With its modern highway system, burgeoning industry and British-based system 
of laws, Malaysia is one Southeast Asian country that offers few impediments to 
the business traveler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing business there is very much similar to the United States," said Wan 
Hashim, vice consul of investments for the Malaysian Consulate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Business is conducted from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Business lunches are as common as 
they are in the United States. And there are no special customs to observe, 
such as bowing or gift giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping religious customs in mind, however, is vital. Islam is the state 
religion, and you shouldn't plan a business trip that coincides with Islamic 
holidays, because most business people will not be in their offices. Also, many 
Malaysians fast during daylight hours throughout March in observance of 
Ramadan, making midday business meals inappropriate for that period. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel is also relatively safe in Malaysia. According to the U.S. State 
Department, major crimes against tourists are uncommon. However, petty crimes, 
including pickpocketing and purse snatching, are common in tourist areas, and 
credit card fraud rates are among the highest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners traveling in Malaysia are subject to the country's strict laws. For 
example, Malaysia has a mandatory death penalty for convicted drug traffickers. 
For more information on laws and traveling in Malaysia, you can contact the 
U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur at (011-603) 248-9011. Getting Around 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia is bordered by Thailand to the north and Singapore to the south. A 
modern highway runs the length of its western coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's major airline, Malaysian Airlines, offers international and 
domestic flights. Departures from Los Angeles to Kuala Lumpur, the capital, are 
scheduled every day except Wednesday and Friday. There are two flights on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are traveling in other parts of Southeast Asia, the country is also 
accessible by train, bus or car from Thailand and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 The road system is modern, and all major international car rental firms have 
offices in Malaysia. (Although U.S. driver's licenses are acceptable, having an 
international license is advisable.) 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking the wheel, you should familiarize yourself with the road 
customs. For maps and information, visit the Tourist Development Corp. offices 
in major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to get around in large cities is by taxi. "It's busy, congested 
and very hard to drive," said Hashim, the vice consul. Taxis are cheap and 
readily available. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the major business destinations are along the well-developed west 
coast. Major industrial destinations north of Kuala Lumpur include Ipoh, Alor 
Setar and Penang, each of which is about 45 minutes by air from Kuala Lumpur. 
Penang is the Malaysian equivalent of Silicon Valley, and many electronics 
firms based in the San Jose area have plants or offices in Penang. 
</P>
<P>
 Flights for Penang, Ipoh and Alor Setar leave Kuala Lumpur every hour or so. 
Major business destinations south of Kuala Lumpur include Malacca and Johor 
Baru. There are no flights to Malacca, but Johor Baru is about 45 minutes by 
air. The latter, across the border from Singapore and one of the country's most 
Westernized cities, is a frequent meeting place for Singaporean business people 
because food and lodging are less expensive. Money 
</P>
<P>
 You can exchange the Malaysian currency, the ringgit, at taxi and bus stands, 
airports, banks and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange rate is set by the central bank, and the best rate is usually 
available at banks. There is no currency black market. Most large department 
stores accept traveler's checks. Lodging 
</P>
<P>
 Luxury business hotels in Kuala Lumpur include the Shangri La and the Regent 
Hilton. In Johor Baru, there is a Holiday Inn, and in Malacca, the Ramada 
Renaissance caters to business travelers. For more information on hotels and 
facilities, contact the Malaysian Division of Tourism in Los Angeles at (213) 
689-9702. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on investing in Malaysia, the Malaysian government is 
sponsoring a one-day seminar on investment opportunities June 7 at the Fairmont 
Hotel in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minister of International Trade and Industry will be the keynote speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, contact the Malaysian Consulate Division of Investments 
at (213) 621-2661.

EXTORTION, LOOTING OF JEWS DESCRIBED AT WAR CRIMES TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Touvier routinely extorted money from Jews and looted Jewish homes as a 
militia officer in Vichy France during World War II, according to court 
documents read at his trial Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier, 78, the first Frenchman to be tried for crimes against humanity 
committed during the war, denied requisitioning the homes and property of Jews 
in Lyons.He also denied extortion charges, made in depositions filed by four 
Jews soon after the Allies liberated France in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier said he was a "victim of people looking for financial retribution 
after the war." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all maniacs," he said in a raspy, high-pitched voice. "I don't agree 
with anything you've read. It's all fiction. (Those people) filed suits just to 
get money." 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier's memory was uncertain during the proceedings, and he fumbled for 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier, former intelligence chief for the Vichy militia, denied knowing that 
people were tortured with electricity one floor above his office or having 
worked with Klaus Barbie, the Lyons Gestapo chief. 
</P>
<P>

BILL HARP; EMMY-WINNING TV SET DECORATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Harp, Emmy-winning set decorator for such long-running television series 
as "The Carol Burnett Show" and "L.A. Law," has died. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Harp also owned Prop Services West, which supplied furniture and accessories 
for television and films. He died March 16 at his Hollywood home of a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 During his nearly four-decade career, Harp earned four Emmys and 24 Emmy 
nominations for sets on specials such as "My Name Is Barbra," with Barbra 
Streisand, and for series such as "Moonlighting," with Bruce Willis and Cybill 
Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a long association with Burnett, whom he met when they both worked for 
"The Gary Moore Show." Harp decorated Burnett's homes as well as the sets for 
her series and its spinoff, "Mama's Family." Burnett, who likened Harp to Santa 
Claus in appearance and to a child in behavior, said he also supervised the 
decoration of her Christmas tree each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill was always there, a consummate professional and a brother," she said 
after his death. "I'll miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Harp also worked on the respected "Omnibus" television series and "The Perry 
Como Show." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Bastrop, La., he was recently honored with a "Bill Harp Day" in 
his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from Louisiana State University 
and taught at the University of Georgia. During World War II, he was a flight 
navigator with the rank of lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Harp is survived by his companion, Marshal Alan Philips; a brother, E.L. (Red) 
Harp; two sisters, Mary Nell Rogers and Katherine Talley, and seven nieces and 
nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled at 11 a.m. Saturday at the Academy of 
Television Arts & Sciences in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to the American 
Actors Fund or to Project Angel Food Los Angeles.

DACK RAMBO; PLAYED JACK EWING IN 'DALLAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dack Rambo, television actor best known for his role as Jack Ewing, cousin of 
the notorious J.R. on the popular series "Dallas," has died. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
 Rambo died Monday at Delano Regional Medical Center near the San Joaquin town 
of Earlimart, where he grew up, and where he had a ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 He had resigned from his last role, as congressman Grant Harrison on NBC's 
daytime soap opera "Another World" in 1991, saying that he had tested positive 
for HIV and wanted to become a spokesman for AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so much better today having gone public with being HIV-positive. It's 
like freedom to me," he told The Times in an interview shortly after that 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 He described himself in the interview as being bisexual and said he had felt 
the onus of suspicion about being gay and vulnerable to AIDS when he appeared 
on "Dallas." That was from 1985 to 1987, at a time when the entertainment 
industry was awakening to the dangers of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there were whispers going on behind my back. Either 'he's gay' or 
'he's this or. . . .' And I thought: 'What the hell did I do?' " the handsome 
actor said in 1991. "People were just assuming. And people didn't really know 
anything about my private life." 
</P>
<P>
 Although leaving "Another World" was his decision, Rambo said he did so 
because he saw few employment opportunities in acting for people who were 
HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Norman Rambeau, Rambo and his identical twin brother, Dirk, grew up on a 
San Joaquin Valley farm. They were discovered by Loretta Young, who saw them 
sitting in church. She cast them in her prime-time television series "The New 
Loretta Young Show," and the twins were an instant hit with teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 They later sang as the Rambo Twins, styling themselves after the Everly 
Brothers. But the act ended when Dirk was killed in an automobile accident in 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Dack Rambo went on to act, taking the role of Walter Brennan's grandson in the 
television series "The Guns of Will Sonnett," and the role of Steve Jacobi in 
"All My Children."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite his success in Hollywood, Rambo remained true to his roots. "I guess 
if I did anything else other than act," he once said, "I'd be a rancher."

THEATER REVIEWS; ROSE-COLORED MEMORIES BLEND IN A SWEET 'DANDELION WINE'; A 
12-YEAR-OLD BOY DOES SOME GROWING UP DURING A MAGICAL TIME IN CHARMING 
SMALL-TOWN AMERICA IN THIS ALTERNATIVE REPERTORY THEATRE EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Most people are content to reminisce now and then about their childhood. Most 
writers have an uncontrollable urge to write about theirs. Science-fiction 
maven Ray Bradbury is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like the one bygone day Emily in "Our Town" chooses to revisit, Bradbury 
picks a summer day in 1928, a magical time when his alter ego, 12-year-old 
Douglas Spaulding, was suddenly goosed into growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other similarities with Thornton Wilder's "Our Town." Bradbury's 
Greentown, Ill., is that long-ago, all-but-forgotten thing: innocent, naive and 
utterly charming small-town America. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bradbury's "Dandelion Wine," at Alternative Repertory Theatre, the town is 
the center of Douglas' universe. He is, as he is perfectly frank in admitting, 
"a wizard of wizards." He can make the sun come up and the birds begin to 
warble. He can make the town folk stop dead in their tracks when he hollers 
"Red light, freeze, don't move!" 
</P>
<P>
 It's a world that director Joel T. Cotter and most of his cast understand, 
seen through a rose-colored glass, tinted in antique tones, and bubbling with 
the charm memory often gives to the past. 
</P>
<P>
 That understanding is also evident in David C. Palmer's evocative lighting 
design and Gary Christensen's sound design. And Cotter's staging on ART's small 
playing area is full of the spirit of Bradbury's memory, and full of enough 
dramatic tricks to entrance even the impatient Douglas Spaulding. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug (Glenn Meek), his kid brother Tom (David Neilsen) and his best friend 
John Huff (Lindsay Irvine) are brightest in Bradbury's memory, and the action 
flows like a kaleidoscopic dream around them. 
</P>
<P>
 The images move into and out of their simple perception, like the machines at 
Lena Aufman's (Carole Hennessy) penny arcade, like the spinster Misses Fern and 
Roberta (Stefanie Williamson, Laurie Messerly) honking through town in their 
roadster, like the ill-fated trolley driven by Mr. Triddens (Tom Orr). 
</P>
<P>
 The play is almost like a piece of music being conducted by a mysterious 
stranger named Forrester (Jonathan M. Motil). He knows what's going to happen 
and smiles sweetly when the Greentown folks seem to recognize him but can't 
quite place where from. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forrester knows about Doug's wizardry and his puppy love for the librarian Ann 
Barclay (Kathryn Byrd). And he knows about Doug's Grandpa's cellar, where the 
dated bottles of dandelion wine are aging. 
</P>
<P>
 Motil is a warm and nicely distracted, well-detailed Forrester, often in awe 
of his memories of his boyhood, and kind enough not to give his identity away 
to Doug too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance, though, that carries the production is Meek's as Doug, fresh, 
full of bursting enthusiasm and wonder at the world's doing his bidding. Meek 
makes you believe in Doug every moment, with all your heart. It is a virtuoso 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Neilsen is expert at appearing 9 years old as Doug's brother. As John, who 
deserts Doug and causes the first crack in Doug's childhood armor, Irvine gives 
a fine portrayal of what every man remembers as the best friend of his boyhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole cast is adept at re-creating and peopling Bradbury's microcosm of 
the past, particularly Byrd's librarian, as warm and ingratiating as to make 
Doug's adoration believable. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception is Steve Willis, who plays Doug's Grandpa and doubles as the 
ancient Col. Freeleigh, who fascinates Doug with tales of his Civil War days 
and his adventures with Pawnee Bill. Willis obviously likes his roles, because 
he acts a great deal doing them, declaiming his lines with stentorian 
assurance, but never taking the time to build a characterization for either. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; 'PRIVATE LIVES' THRIVES ON EXPERT CONTROL, RHYTHM; IN THIS LA 
HABRA DEPOT THEATRE PRODUCTION, LOUISE MARTIN AND RICK WATSON SUPERBLY HANDLE 
THEIR VERBAL (AND PHYSICAL) SPARRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 There are some plays that would be impossible to update. And a good thing, 
too. They belong in their period, they speak only of that period, and for 
today's audiences they make an emotional historical connection that history 
books can't come close to. 
</P>
<P>
 Noel Coward's "Private Lives" is one of those, a catalogue of dressing gowns, 
stem glasses, potent cheap music, a long-ago world whose feel, rhythms and aura 
have been re-created at the La Habra Depot Theatre with welcome attention to 
style by director Phyllis Gitlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Coward was accused early in his career of being "thin" and "brittle" -- which 
he was, and never more so than in this classic art deco comedy. Those are 
qualities on which Louise Martin (who plays Amanda) and Rick Watson (as Elyot) 
both have a firm grip. They handle the verbal (and physical) sparring of the 
reunited divorcees with expert control and a fine sense of the timing and 
rhythm so important to playwrights of high comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the small but very plum role of the French-speaking maid is turned, 
as it should be, into an amusing cameo by Tiffany Sauceda, who speaks the lines 
with enough authority to leave the impression that she might be Provencal , 
trying to be classy. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Watts' settings for both the Riviera balcony where Amanda and Elyot 
unexpectedly meet and for Amanda's Parisian flat are just right: the balcony in 
pale marble with cupids on pedestals, the flat in the strong contrasts of art 
deco. With Tom Phillips, Watts also has designed a fine set of costumes. The 
women's period gowns are particularly notable. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brad Steward's lighting design is sometimes a bit garish -- as are the 
performances of Dani Ballew as Elyot's bride Sibyl and Mitchell Nunn as 
Amanda's groom Victor. Each is acceptable -- particularly Ballew for her fine 
comic sense -- but neither wears the period comfortably. Ballew has a tendency 
to screech when playing angry, and Sibyl is just too refined for that. Nunn 
plays Victor's pomposity with too much emphasis. As Coward himself said, both 
Sibyl and Victor must have qualities that would make it logical for Elyot and 
Amanda to have fallen for them (Coward cast the young Olivier as Victor). 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn and Ballew do manage a very good, very funny slow build to their final 
argument. And even their near-misses don't take the shine off this Amanda and 
Elyot, who glow with fondness for a time when theater still could allow itself 
to be thin and brittle, and totally entertaining. 
</P>

 FEVERISH EFFORT: A few opponents of the Ahmanson development believe they have 
discovered the Achilles heel of the mini-city proposed for the Simi Hills: the 
deadly valley fever virus. The respiratory illness transmitted by spores kicked 
up from the soil has gained notoriety with a surge of cases and its first death 
in the county. And some Ahmanson foes smell a new vulnerability. . . . "We 
think that grading 53 million yards of earth could expose a lot of people to 
the illness," said Bill Bell, a member of an opposing homeowner group. 
</P>
<P>
 LAID AN EGG: The California Condor Recovery Program has reached another 
milestone, with the 100th condor egg laid in captivity. Meanwhile, wildlife 
biologists are trying to figure out how to keep a group of free-flying condors 
out of Ventura County's backcountry, their favorite haunt. . . . But even the 
newest condor, once it hatches and grows up, "could end up in Ventura County 
too," sighs program director Robert Mesta. "Regardless of where we release 
them, they will be in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 AWARENESS: One by one, Simi Valley schoolchildren get their chance in a 
wheelchair. But what looks like a fun ride quickly becomes a frustrating 
challenge as they strain to get a drink from a faucet or open a bathroom door 
without getting up. . . . Every student at Garden Grove Elementary School will 
get a firsthand experience of living with disabilities this week (B4). . . . 
"This kind of training is terrific," said Hollace Wood of the Tri-Counties 
Regional Center. "Once you experience it, you won't forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 IT'S A RENTAL: "Schindler's List" has done remarkably well at the box office 
and promises to do well in home video rentals too. . . . (D1) Video sales and 
rentals generally outpace theater receipts, and "Schindler's" is the kind of 
searing, three-hour drama that many viewers prefer to watch at home. "It is a 
very powerful movie and it might be a little much for some people," said Jim 
Salzer of Salzer's Video in Ventura. By watching at home, he said, "they can 
take a pause."

LAKERS' MAGIC MOVE SURPRISES PFUND; PRO BASKETBALL: OUSTED COACH THANKS THE 
TEAM AND INDICATES HE MIGHT BE WILLING TO STAY IN ANOTHER CAPACITY.

 The story was true, though it was premature. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 22, 1993, word came out that Randy Pfund was on his way out as Laker 
coach, and that owner Jerry Buss had asked Magic Johnson to coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened Tuesday, 11 months later, but Pfund still said he was surprised to 
be fired as coach of the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you would expect, it is difficult news," Pfund said Tuesday night. "I 
still lean on the side of thanking Dr. Buss and Jerry West for the opportunity 
they gave me. Down theline with the whole Laker staff, they are nothing but 
good people. I owe a special thanks to Bill (Bertka) and Chet (Kammerer), my 
two closest coaching buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew when I took the job that there was a great challenge ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief challenge was inheriting a team without a Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has a similar challenge, because the Lakers said that the No. 32 
jersey will stay retired to the Forum wall. He would not be a player/coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach on the floor under Pat Riley, Johnson is the coach on the bench, 
with Nick Van Exel and Sedale Threatt as his coaches on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Johnson is a new title. He has not been an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic is a very unique person," Pfund said. "He certainly has the credentials 
as a player to do a good job. As tough as it is for me, I wish him the best of 
luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund had little luck in his time as head coach, having replaced Mike Dunleavy 
on the job after being assistant to Dunleavy and Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been some exciting moments the last two seasons or so, and some tough 
moments," he said. "But I think the players and the staff all understood the 
tough challenge ahead of us. I appreciated the way the players had shown a 
willingness to face the uphill battle. This wasn't as much fun as slipping 
rings on your fingers like in the '80s, but I think they still played hard all 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund says he has no immediate plans. But he did not discount the possibility 
of remaining with the organization that has employed him since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would always welcome the opportunity and would be more than grateful to sit 
down with Jerry (Buss) if there is an opportunity he sees for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for now, it is probably good not to have to figure out how to outrebound 
a team for a night." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund was fired after the Lakers' 84-81 victory over the Miami Heat on Monday 
at the Forum, but he left Tuesday morning with the team on a charter flight to 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the company man, he said that some issues had not been resolved -- 
specifically who would coach the next two games: at Dallas tonight and at 
Houston on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 That job fell to Bertka, his top assistant, and Pfund will return home today. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson will take over Sunday, when the Lakers play Milwaukee at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be an instant drawing card to a team that has had only two sellouts 
all season and that has averaged what Forum ushers say is a heavily padded 
11,000 a game. 
</P>
<P>
 He will bring excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 He will bring Michael Cooper, his backcourt partner on occasions through the 
Lakers' glory years, as an assistant coach. It's a job Cooper wanted when Pfund 
was named coach, but Pfund opted instead to hire his old Westmont College boss, 
Kammerer, and Cooper became an assistant to Jerry West, the Laker general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Johnson will bring enough victories to get the team into the playoffs 
is another issue. The Lakers (27-37) are 5 1/2 games behind the Denver Nuggets 
for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference, and there is talk around 
town about a lottery draft choice for the first time in franchise history. That 
talk is not coming from Jerry West, Laker general manager, who went into the 
team locker room at a game earlier this season and blasted the players for 
their lack of effort. 
</P>
<P>
 That last playoff spot saved Pfund's job last season. 
</P>
<P>
 His original contract was for three years, through 1994-95, and he was offered 
an extension last fall after the Lakers took the Phoenix Suns to five games in 
the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never signed the extension until two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That one-year extension indicated that the extra year would not necessarily be 
as coach. Asked if that meant he could be cleaning the Forum men's rooms in 
that extra year, he laughed and said, "That's what took me so long to sign it, 
making sure they took that clause out." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Jim Hodges, Steve Springer and Helene Elliott contributed 
to this story.

GRETZKY SAYS HIS TARGET IS 1,000 GOALS, NOT 802 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

 Questions, questions and more questions. Wayne Gretzky's mother, Phyllis, says 
that her son will pass Gordie Howe and become the NHL's all-time leading goal 
scorer with his 802nd tonight against Vancouver at the Forum, but even 
Gretzky's abilities don't extend to prognostication. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky, in his 15th NHL season, has set 60 league records, so he has some 
ideas about the whys, the whats, the wherefores and, well, the Howes of this 
latest quest. The immense pressure seemed to lift from his shoulders on Sunday 
at San Jose when he scored twice to join Howe at 801. Now, one does not seem to 
be the loneliest number for Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want it to happen tomorrow night, believe me," Gretzky said on Tuesday at a 
Forum news conference to announce a three-year endorsement deal.  
</P>
<P>
 "I broke the one, the points record, in Edmonton. This one, I want to do here. 
It would be nice to have it happen here at home." 
</P>
<P>
 It all started for Gretzky against the Canucks. He scored his first NHL goal 
against Vancouver goaltender Glen Hanlon on Oct. 14, 1979, at 18:51 of the 
third period. Hanlon now is the Canucks' goaltending coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a backhander," Gretzky said. "I came out of the corner and threw it 
over the top of Glen Hanlon. There's something special about any first goal you 
score in the NHL. You spend your whole life dreaming about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was visualizing Sunday in San Jose about how he might score the 
record goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some strange reason, it was a backhand," Gretzky said. "Now, it'll 
probably be a tip-in or knock off my leg and go in. That's all right. In 20 
years, they're all end-to-end rushes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just visualized 801 being a big goal, and it was. I want 802 to be a big 
goal. The last thing you want to see is a 5-1 game and you score to make it 5-2 
with a minute left. I don't see that in the cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Provided Gretzky doesn't score into an empty net, there will be a goaltender 
going into the record book with him. The Canucks have not announced a starting 
goalie but it is expected to be Kirk McLean. Gretzky has scored 12 goals 
against McLean and two against the Canucks' backup, Kay Whitmore. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose's Arturs Irbe declined to speak to reporters after giving up 800 and 
801, but King Coach Barry Melrose said Irbe will be long forgotten after 
Gretzky scores his next goal. "Arturs is safe," Melrose said, smiling. "That's 
our society. You don't want to be the guy who gives up 802. You're 
immortalized. Everyone knows who was pitching to Hank Aaron. You become part of 
the trivia." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' Kelly Hrudey was in goal when the St. Louis Blues' Brett Hull 
scored his 50th goal in 50 games on Jan. 28, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually it's a good thing," Hrudey said. "You're usually pretty motivated not 
to let the goal in."  
</P>
<P>
 All of the Kings, of course, want to be part of hockey history. On Sunday, 
Warren Rychel suffered a broken nose in a first-period fight and sat out the 
rest of the game. "Yeah, my kids will say, 'What did you do when Wayne Gretzky 
tied the record?' " Rychel said. "Well, I had my nose and face in a bucket of 
ice for an hour and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 It could all have been over if King defenseman Marty McSorley had passed to 
Gretzky instead of scoring into an empty net at Hartford on March 2. Naturally, 
that has come up a few times. McSorley was practicing shooting into an empty 
net on Tuesday when he spotted Gretzky and said: 
</P>
<P>
 "You would have been pushed over the edge if I had given it to you." 
</P>
<P>
 But any anxious edge has passed for Gretzky, who says he is happy to be at 
801. He has been telling his teammates to shoot if they get a two-on-one with 
him late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was something going around that after 802, I was going to quit," 
Gretzky said. "I see 900 goals. I see 1,000. I tell you, I'll try my best."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; THE TOP TERRAPIN; WILLIAMS 
GUIDES MARYLAND OUT OF THE BAD TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After five seasons, 146 games, maybe 700 practices, 1,000 recruiting phone 
calls and who knows how many miles traveled, Maryland basketball Coach Gary 
Williams did the strangest thing a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a smirk. Not a grin. A smile. An actual, see-I-do-have-teeth smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland assistant Art Perry was there at the Sunday staff meeting and saw the 
whole thing with his own two eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was as relaxed as I've ever seen him in the last four years," said Perry, 
who came to Maryland a year after Williams was hired to rescue the Terrapin 
program. "People who don't know Gary won't appreciate that comment. But people 
who do will understand." 
</P>
<P>
 The people who do -- his assistants, his players, his family, his friends -- 
have watched as Williams painstakingly rebuilt not only a basketball program, 
but also an image gutted by the drug-overdose death of Len Bias and later, NCAA 
sanctions. And few times, if ever, did Williams look as if he enjoyed one 
moment of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as an afternoon rain taps away at the Cole Field House roof, Williams 
stands near courtside and tries to put the long journey into perspective. From 
suicide mission to Sweet 16, that's what Williams has done here. His team, 
nothing more than afterthought, seeded No. 10 when the NCAA tournament began, 
now prepares to face third-seeded Michigan in Friday's Midwest Regional 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asks if the events of the last two weeks -- Maryland's first 
tournament appearance since 1988, a first-round victory over St. Louis, a 
second-round triumph over Final Four candidate Massachusetts, Terp hysteria on 
campus and off -- diminishes the memory of the dark days, when Williams 
wondered on more than one occasion if he had made a career mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," says Williams, almost in a monotone. "This is this year. Those other 
years, that's something that will never be made up. That was four years out of 
the five of my (Maryland) coaching career that will never be made up. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm happy now." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, Williams played in this building. He came to Maryland in 
1964 as a 6-foot, 170-pound guard from Collingswood, N.J. He left as the team 
co- captain, described as such in the 1966-67 Terrapin media guide: " . . . a 
fierce competitor with a heart as big as his chest." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing has changed. Williams still considers himself the point man for a 
basketball program that desperately needed one. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bias died in the spring of 1986, and Coach Lefty Driesell was forced out 
shortly thereafter, and clumsy Bob Wade came in and completed the damage by 
violating NCAA rules during his three-year reign, there was no worse place to 
be than Maryland. It had been touched by tragedy and later crippled by NCAA 
probation that, among other things, kept the Terrapins from postseason play 
until this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was there for some of the worst of it, when the NCAA delivered its 
harsher-than-expected sentence and left the Maryland program in little pieces. 
Williams, who had left a sweetheart situation at Ohio State, was supposed to 
glue it all together again. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had doubts," Williams says. "But you gradually get it resolved, that you 
just got to make this happen. That's what it eventually came to, that we were 
just going to make it happen. I didn't know how it was going to happen. I 
didn't know it would be probably this quick, but I felt that we could be good 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy. During the first few years, Williams and his assistants 
couldn't get a top-rated recruit anywhere near the place. After all, who wanted 
to go where the summer Olympics were on television more often than Maryland. 
And don't think opposing Atlantic Coast Conference recruiters didn't mention 
it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams didn't have a freshman starter in 1990. Or 1991. Or 1992. Donyell 
Marshall, now merely the second- or third-best player in the country, thought 
about signing with the Terrapins a few years ago. But with no chance of playing 
in the tournament until 1994, why bother? 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland's victory totals began to slide, from the pre-probation 19 to 16, to 
14 and then 12. But despite the losses, Williams and Perry began to get 
players. Guard Johnny Rhodes, who was on every recruiter's list, and forward 
Exree Hipp, who wasn't, decided to take a chance on the Terps and were rewarded 
with starting positions as freshmen last year. The same thing happened this 
season, when forward Keith Booth and center Joe Smith signed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Now look at them: Hipp, Rhodes, Booth and Smith all average in double figures. 
Another sophomore, starting guard Duane Simpkins is also in double digits. And 
among the first three substitutes, two are freshmen -- swingman Nick Bosnic and 
guard Matt Kovarik -- and one is a sophomore, forward Mario Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, the star of the team is the guy with the plain name -- Joe 
Smith. Rhodes, who needs a little help with his cliches, has called him, "our 
bread and water guy." Perry, who said Smith is the best player he has ever 
recruited, swears every ACC school was after the 6-10 newcomer from Norfolk, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't exactly true. According to Smith, who would know, North Carolina, 
Duke, Clemson and Georgia Tech weren't the least bit interested. And although 
Maryland was crazy about Smith, nobody could quite understand why Smith would 
be crazy about Maryland.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my friends, when they found out I was coming here, they were like, 
'Why you wanna go there? They just got off probation and they're not gonna be 
back for a couple of years,' " said Smith, who averages 19.7 points, 10.6 
rebounds (25.5 points, 10.0 rebounds in the two tournament games) and was 
recently named the national freshman of the year by the U.S. Basketball Writers 
Assn. "But now that we're in the Sweet 16, they have had a change of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, Smith wasn't so sure himself about this Maryland team. He thought 
they'd win enough games to make the tournament, but almost nobody -- Perry, 
Williams, Rhodes, etc. -- figured the Terrapins would still be playing March 
25. 
</P>
<P>
 Except one player . . . Hipp. Back in November, before anyone knew how good 
Maryland would be, Hipp offered Baltimore Sun reporter Don Markus a prediction. 
Hipp said the Terrapins would win 16 or 17 games, finish in the middle of the 
ACC standings, earn an NCAA tournament invitation and advance to the Sweet 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean the NIT," said Markus. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," said Hipp, "the NCAAs." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're crazy," said Markus. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland' record: 18-11. Maryland's ACC finish: tied for fourth. Maryland's 
tournament record: 2-0 . . . and counting. 
</P>
<P>
 With 20 seconds to go in last Saturday's game against second-seeded 
Massachusetts, Hipp scanned press row in search of Markus. When he found him, 
Hipp smiled and mouthed three short words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Told you so."

MOVING BEYOND; INDIANS REMEMBER A TRAGEDY AND TRY TO FORGET A SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a few quiet moments Tuesday, a young, carefully built team bursting with 
promise stopped on a cool, cloudy Florida day to recall its somber past. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Indians lowered the flags to half staff at Chain O'Lakes Park, 
closed their clubhouse to outsiders, and observed a moment of silence in 
tribute to Steve Olin and Tim Crews, who died in a boating accident on Little 
Lake Nellie near here one year ago Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But, once their spring training game against the Texas Rangers began, the 
Indians were determined not to dwell on sad memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to give the guys our best regards and go on with the day," said 
reliever Derek Lilliquist, who was a close friend of Olin's. 
</P>
<P>
 But the team couldn't escape troubling news -- Tuesday, relief pitcher Jerry 
DiPoto had a cancerous thyroid gland removed. "They're going to give me an 
iodine pill to burn out the rest of the cancer," DiPoto said. "In a couple of 
weeks, they'll go back in to see if the cancer has spread anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with a farm system that is beginning to produce prospects, a front 
office that has plucked talent from other teams and fit it under tight salary 
restraints, and, most dramatic of all, with a new, state-of-the-art ballpark 
already triggering a ticket-selling boom, the Indians' are ready to forget 
their history of failure. 
</P>
<P>
 And a year after losing Olin and Crews, they tried to move beyond the tragedy, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grief is still there, the sorrow is still there, and I don't think it 
will ever leave," Manager Mike Hargrove said at a news conference held in the 
same room where he and General Manager John Hart spoke to reporters a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old saying, 'Time heals all wounds,' is not correct. But you get to the 
point where enough is enough. And we need to get on with our business." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hart: "We've talked about it, and we will continue to talk about it. But 
we don't want to make this the issue of what we're doing this spring. We've had 
to move forward, and we have. We think we're doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Wickander, Olin's closest friend, was traded last May. Bobby Ojeda, the 
only survivor of the boating accident, was released in the off-season. Hart 
said it was best for both the players and the team not to be reunited at Winter 
Haven, and the accompanying memories, again. 
</P>
<P>
 Said catcher Sandy Alomar: "It was something we all had to deal with . . . and 
everybody got over it. I know the anniversary is here. Those guys, in one way 
or the other, if they could talk to us, they would want us to let them go. 
Their families we really care about, and we're not going to forget that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's time to let those guys go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As much as 1993 was a lost season because of the trauma of Olin and Crews' 
deaths and the Indians' 14-30 start, they believe their strong backstretch run, 
bringing them to a final record of 76-86, is only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, who have transformed hope into failure so many times before, are 
overflowing with talent and expectation once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Indians had assembled a batting order full of young stars -- 
Carlos Baerga, Albert Belle, Sandy Alomar and Kenny Lofton, all of whom are 28 
or younger and are potential most-valuable-player candidates -- that provided 
one of the league's best offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 But with perhaps the worst pitching staff in baseball, an exciting offense was 
not nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I went into (opening day) with a sense of loss," Hart said last 
week from his seat behind home plate. "I lost two good friends. I also went 
into it, I guess, with a sense of foreboding for the club itself because of the 
pitching problems that we were facing." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with ace Charles Nagy healthy again and the acquisitions of Dennis 
Martinez, Chris Nabholz, Steve Farr and Jack Morris, the Indians believe their 
pitching staff is vastly upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart also settled an error-prone infield by acquiring Gold Glove shortstop 
Omar Vizquel from the Seattle Mariners and moved to protect Belle in the lineup 
by signing Eddie Murray to bat fifth as a designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people in Cleveland, they've been waiting for a long time," Baerga 
said, "and I think they have a chance to have it this year." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a team that has finished no higher than fourth place in 26 years, that 
hasn't finished first since 1954 and hasn't been above .500 since 1986. This is 
a team that has lost 100 games three times in the past nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, who was hired to run the team in the middle of the 100-loss 1991 season, 
began the rebuilding process by locking up his young stars to contracts that 
eliminated arbitration years and ensured that the team would have a stable 
salary scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium -- built in downtown Cleveland's new Gateway complex -- only makes 
the potential for Indian success grander. Temporarily being called Indians 
Park, the Indians clearly believe the ballpark will energize the ticket-selling 
audience like Baltimore's Camden Yards and Toronto's SkyDome did in their first 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, who have drawn more than 2 million fans only twice in their 
history, already have sold 1.89 million tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of this season is going to be about our new ballpark," Hart said. "As 
good as our team's optimism and hope is, it's going to be so special for the 
city and the north coast of Ohio to have a facility like this coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken us from the smallest-market club in all of a baseball to a club 
that's more of a mid-sized market, we have some additional revenue streams. . . 
. I think it puts Cleveland where it should be. It's an original American 
League city -- the love affair has been re-established." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the name, the 42,400-seat baseball-only park should be far superior 
for players and fans to the drafty, cavernous 62-year-old Cleveland Stadium, 
their old 80,000-seat home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just that the old atmosphere was very tough. It was cold, it was right 
next to the lake, and it's so old," said Alomar, who jokingly suggests that the 
right-field stands at the new park look as if they were tailor-made for 
switch-hitter Baerga's left-handed home run swing. 
</P>
<P>
 It also could be ideal for rookie third baseman Jim Thome, a left-handed 
batter who hit 25 home runs in triple-A last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in the five years I've been here that people are 
showing respect for this ballclub," said Alomar, who has watched his brother, 
Roberto, earn back-to-back World Series rings with the Toronto Blue Jays. "I 
just need to get one ring," Sandy Alomar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hart: "You look at the Indians, whether accurately or not, probably more 
accurate than not, it has been perceived as probably one of the poorer-run 
franchises in all of professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the one thing that's happened in the last four, five years, is that 
people have to look at this franchise now as one that is a factor. We're 
stable. We've been very creative with our contracts, we've made good trades, 
we've got very good young players who are going to be here for a while, we're 
moving to a new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, in the eyes of the baseball world, we're a competitive franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 Does the signing of Martinez, Murray, and Morris mean that Hart and Jacobs 
think 1994 is the year it all comes together? 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's all about this year," Hart said. "This isn't the be-all, 
end-all. Obviously, with the new ballpark and everything, this is an important 
year for us. But I don't think anybody's picking us to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think we certainly have a chance to have a breakthrough year." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris says he fully expects Cleveland to win the World Series in his first 
year with the team -- as Toronto and Minnesota did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think they're building the right kind of club," Morris said last 
week. "Similar to the team that they put together in Minnesota in '91, a team 
that a lot of people are overlooking, somewhat of an underdog. But people who 
have played against them the last few years realize what they've been doing 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians expect the day-to-day steadiness of Morris, Martinez and Murray to 
add a dose of stability to the younger players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have young players and young guys are very excitable," Alomar said. "And 
sometimes young guys get off track together. And I believe we had too many 
young guys, we needed some older guys to settle us down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians' transformation from confusion to contender seems to have happened 
so suddenly, but not if you have been there through the years of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Back when Hart was hired, the team was bad, short of money and unexciting. 
They had some good players, but no future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We treated it almost like an expansion team," Hart said. "We recognized very 
early that we were not going to win with some of our established stars. We 
couldn't afford them, either. And we traded them off, starting with Joe Carter 
-- got Alomar and Baerga. Traded off (Tom) Candiotti, (Greg) Swindell, we went 
right on down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "And after that, it's very exciting to be in this position. We'd much rather 
be here than be with a club like we had in '91 when we had no chance of winning 
and no dollars and we were trading people off. It was a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrove says he is comfortable with his team's new role as a contender in the 
three-division American League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather have it that way than people cussing you because you're bad," 
Hargrove said. "I think the expectations, I think that's warranted. This is an 
exciting club. When we take the field every night, we have every reason to 
believe we should win the game we're playing that night. And I couldn't say 
that last year at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Hargrove says, his team limped into the season "emotionally 
drained." 
</P>
<P>
 "We, as an organization, have moved beyond that," Hargrove said. "That doesn't 
mean we'll ever forget Tim and Steve, but we just have a job to do."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; TOUGH ENOUGH; USC'S LESLIE 
ASSERTS HERSELF IN THE MIDDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the second round of the NCAA tournament last Saturday night at the Sports 
Arena, USC's women's basketball team needed help in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the Trojans went to their best player. 
</P>
<P>
 With 32 seconds left and USC holding a 71-70 lead over George Washington, 
USC's players did the expected. 
</P>
<P>
 They gave Lisa Leslie the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, at the high post, was guarded by 6-foot-5 center Martha Williams. 
Leslie drove down the right side of the key, stopped abruptly and made a 
six-foot jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans added free throws in the final seconds for a 76-72 victory, but 
Leslie's basket in her last L.A. appearance was the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (25-3)advances to the Mideast regional at Fayetteville, Ark., against 
Virginia (27-4) on Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
 If the Trojans move on, it will be with the help of the 6-5 Leslie, a strong 
candidate to win the Naismith Award as the player of the year for women's 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisa's the best player in the country," said Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer, 
shortly after Leslie and the Trojans defeated the Cardinal earlier this season. 
 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe the toughest, too, she might have added. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is something new. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, after Texas Tech's Sheryl Swoopes scored 33 points against USC in 
the West Regional at Bozeman, Mont., Leslie and USC had to watch as Swoopes' 
team won the national championship.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was really discouraged that night (after the Texas Tech loss)," Leslie 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I hadn't done enough, that I hadn't improved as much as I should 
have in my college career. I had the feeling I could be doing so much more." 
</P>
<P>
 She decided she could play tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 From the team's Dec. 1 opening victory at Northern Illinois in November, 
through winning the Richmond Tournament that same week and through a 16-2 
Pacific 10 championship season, opponents have witnessed a tougher, more 
intense Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
 When pushed around underneath, she answered with an elbow. Foul trouble? So 
what? She'd always been in foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Jan. 6 at Oregon State, Leslie was guarded by Kristina Lelas, a 6-5, 
240-pound player from Croatia. On rebound plays, Lelas grabbed Leslie's 
forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, enough was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rebound bounced away from both players, Lelas continued to hold Leslie's 
forearm. Leslie jerked her arm out of Lelas' grasp, then came back with a 
backhanded punch that caught Lelas on the mouth, knocking her down. 
</P>
<P>
 Aki Hill, Oregon State's coach, saying Lelas lost a tooth in the incident, 
demanded that the Pac-10 suspend Leslie. But because the referee was in proper 
position and made no call, conference officials took no action. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, word went around the league: 
</P>
<P>
 Don't mess with Leslie.  
</P>
<P>
 But then, you might expect a tough game from a player who was reared by a 
truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie's father died when she was 12. When she was a young teen, her mother, 
Christine, hocked her house and bought an 18-wheeler. Today, she hauls coconut 
oil from Carson to City of Industry.  
</P>
<P>
 Leslie's game has also been helped by her 6-5 freshman backup, Michelle 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my first three years, I didn't have any help," Leslie said.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Former coach Marianne Stanley) would tell me if I was tired to just coast a 
bit, because there was no one on the bench. Now, I can play harder because of 
Michelle.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I have to come out for a rest, Michelle goes in there, blocks a shot and 
grabs a couple of rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm also stronger. I've been in a year-round weight-training program for 
two years now, and it's paying off. I just feel like I'm able to play hard for 
a longer period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 She also is helped by another freshman, 6-3 power forward Tina Thompson, the 
Pac-10's freshman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson is a player with no flair or dash, but offers hard-nose play.  
</P>
<P>
 Leslie averages 12.3 rebounds, Thompson 10.5. No other Trojan averages more 
than 3.8. Combined, they are averaging 26 points -- but that figures to 
decrease in the tournament. USC is not a good long-range shooting team, making 
only 31% from beyond the three-point line. In tournament victories over 
Portland and George Washington, the Trojans were eight for 31. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of Leslie and Thompson, with almost four blocks combined per game, 
opponents are shooting only 36.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leslie said this week she would like to see the team improve its 
three-point shooting against Virginia on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams are going to look at that (USC's low three-point shot percentage), and 
just decide to pack it in tight on Tina and I," Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another component to Leslie's game comes from the man in her life, 6-7 Lorenzo 
Orr of the USC men's team. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, a date is simply playing one-on-one in Lyon Center at noon.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lorenzo and I help each other," Leslie said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's helped me stay out of foul trouble by telling me never to try and block 
the shot of someone I'm not guarding. And I've helped him by getting him to cut 
down on dribbling when he doesn't have to. We break down each other's tapes all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
 When Leslie came out of Inglewood's Morningside High four years ago, few could 
resist calling her another Cheryl Miller. Now, Miller is her coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Both once scored more than 100 points in high school games. Both were USC 
All-Americans. Both were known for tough, intense playing styles. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller played on two NCAA title teams, 1983 and '84, by the time she was a 
senior. Leslie's teams are 4-3 in the tournament and haven't made it to the 
Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time, she figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The George Washington game did a lot for us," Leslie said.  
</P>
<P>
 "None of us want the season to end now. Our team morale is high, we all have 
confidence in each other and the seniors have stepped up. Our experience is 
coming into play, and we have confidence in ourselves and each other."

MIKE DOWNEY: HERE'S HOPING HE KEEPS HIS SMILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saturday will be the 15th anniversary of the last game of basketball Earvin 
(Magic) Johnson played before becoming a Laker. He played it for Michigan State 
in the NCAA tournament championship game March 26, 1979, against Larry Bird and 
Indiana State. He was 20, so much of his life was ahead of him, Los Angeles was 
another planet and the last thing on Earth he ever expected was that one day he 
would be the Laker coach.  
</P>
<P>
 He will make a fine coach. A splendid coach. A devoted coach. Who loves the 
Lakers more? Who loves basketball more? Who knows more about winning? Who knows 
more about the NBA? Who better to restore Showtime than the star of the show 
himself? Mr. Pfund is out and Mr. Fun is in. Earvin Johnson, arguably healthy, 
definitely wealthy and hopefully wise, is the new coach of the Lakers, 
effective this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic. Excuse me. Coach Magic. Now you see him, now you don't, now you do . . 
. don't . . . do. 
</P>
<P>
 Why now? I have no idea why now. Randy Pfund reportedly will move on to 
another assignment with the organization. Magic moves in, coat and tie. Hope he 
kneels on the sideline so the ticket-holders can see. 
</P>
<P>
 I have known Earvin Johnson for more than these 15 years. I have heard him 
called Earvin, E, EJ, Junior, Buck, Big Fella, you name it. Everything but 
Coach. I never thought I would call him Coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He never thought anybody would. He intended to play for the Lakers until his 
legs wore out, not his immune system. Then he thought he might own the Lakers 
sometime, or else own the team they were playing. He never minded being Magic 
Johnson and he wouldn't have minded being Mr. Johnson. He simply never expected 
to be Coach Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 His first time inside the Forum, 1979, he got there ahead of everybody but 
Jack Curran, the trainer. He asked Jack if he could sit in the stands by 
himself. He sat there thinking of games he played at Everett High, back in 
Lansing, Mich., and about hey, look at me now. Curran called out to him several 
times before Earvin came out of his fog. He took the big fella downstairs into 
the dressing room. Magic saw golden shirts on hangers, with names on the back: 
ABDUL-JABBAR, NIXON, WILKES. He started crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people thought I'd never get this far," he said later. "Not because 
they didn't support me, but because almost nobody back in Lansing had big 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Stu Nahan and Jim Hill took him aside after his first news conference. A 
couple of TV vets, giving tips to the new kid in town. Told him to think about 
what he said before he said it. Told him what L.A. was like. Later on, Earvin 
said, Hill said to him: "Magic, there will eventually come a time when you 
won't play anymore. What do you see yourself doing when your playing career is 
over?" 
</P>
<P>
 Magic said: "Actually, Jim, I'd like your job." 
</P>
<P>
 Lo, these many years later, he has had other jobs. Been a Magic of many 
trades. Sat behind a mike. Peddled Pepsi. Endorsed all sorts of stuff. Ran 
camps for kids. Made a bid to buy an NBA franchise for Toronto. Barnstormed 
through Europe. Produced AIDS-education tapes and literature. Began his own 
one-on-one TV chat show, out to become the 6-foot-9 Barbara Walters. Guess 
maybe that one goes on the backburner for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know everything about Magic, but I know how much he misses basketball. 
How he needs to be around it. How whatever energy he has, whatever knowledge he 
has, compel him to bring it back to basketball. His world is as round as that 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But the timing. Oh, the timing. Magicians are supposed to have timing. So why 
now? Why 64 games into the season? If someone has to strip the fun from Randy 
Pfund, must it be today? It couldn't wait? Are the Lakers going somewhere we 
don't know about? Do they think they can still make the playoffs? Do they think 
Magic will bring them luck when the lottery Ping-Pong balls come popping out? 
No, the question isn't: "Why Magic?" The question is: "Why now?" 
</P>
<P>
 My enduring memory of Randy Pfund will be of him walking off that court after 
Monday night's Miami game, a winner. What a prince of a guy this is. What a way 
this is for him to go out. To find out after a victory that he was history. 
When I called his home phone number Tuesday night, the answer-machine recording 
ended with: "Leave me a good message." Wish I could have. 
</P>
<P>
 Earvin Johnson has not one whit more experience coaching than Randy Pfund had 
when the Lakers put him in charge. Randy struggled. Some of it was his fault, 
some of it was that he had a club full of rookies as raw as the coach, Doug 
Christie, George Lynch, Anthony Peeler, Nick Van Exel, a veritable no-star 
team. They traded Sam Perkins, discarded Byron Scott, were abandoned by A.C. 
Green. Every move was understandable. But the poor coach was stuck with what 
was left. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaching is a tough racket. That championship season at Michigan State, the 
team lost -- and I mean lost big -- to last-place Northwestern one night. The 
coaches were on the players' cases. The players were uptight. They held a team 
meeting, after which Magic said, "We told the coaches to stay off our backs and 
we would play harder. We said we'd start diving for loose balls and 
everything." They did. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this means Magic Johnson will be a John Lucas type of coach, turning the 
talent loose. Of course he is older now, has ideas. And he has no David 
Robinson, no Dennis Rodman out there. Of course, Magic wouldn't want one of his 
younger players to do what he did that one night, which was to protest Paul 
Westhead's strategy sufficiently to get the coach canned. "Shut up and pay 
attention!" Westhead once yelled in the huddle. "I am paying attention!" 
Johnson yelled back. "Either you start listening or you don't have to play!" 
Westhead said. Let us hope Coach Johnson never has this discussion with a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Did I really say Coach Johnson? 
</P>
<P>
 Guess I did. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson's a coach, Michael Jordan's a baseball player and Charles 
Barkley wants to be governor of Alabama. It isn't 1979 anymore, is it?

KICKERS GIVEN BOOT BY NFL; PRO FOOTBALL: CHANGES, INCLUDING TWO-POINT 
CONVERSION AND NEW FIELD POSITION AFTER MISSED FIELD GOALS, ENCOURAGE 
TOUCHDOWNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NFL delivered a good swift kick to kickers Tuesday in one of the most 
dramatic days of rule changes in the league's 75-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did owners approve the use of the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did they move the kickoff back five yards to the 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also approved returning missed field goals to the point of the kick 
instead of the line of scrimmage. The seven- or eight-yard difference figures 
to keep many kickers on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like our legs are being tied together," said Gary Anderson, veteran 
Pittsburgh Steeler kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly the point, according to coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have all those great field goal kickers, now they are going to 
have to start checking things out a little closer," said Buddy Ryan of the 
Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two-point conversion is the first scoring rule change in league 
history, its impact probably will be overshadowed by the rule that essentially 
penalizes a team for missing field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The change there will be profound," Anderson said. "This is a rule about 
field position. Coaches preach field position. They will stop trying long field 
goals if it means lost field position." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, officials were upset that kickers were successful on three field 
goals for every four touchdowns scored. Besides that, only 68.5% of kickoffs 
were returned, nearly 20% fewer than in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what they are doing is trying to punish the kickers for being too good," 
said Tony Zendejas of the Rams. "It's not right." 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules, and what coaches expect they will mean: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two-point conversion from the two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 No more settling for field goals in the middle of the fourth quarter when 
trailing by eight points. More fourth-down conversion attempts, more gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 No more sitting on the ball while leading by eight points in the middle of the 
fourth quarter. More daring offense, less prevent defense. 
</P>
<P>
 What will not happen is teams using the two-point conversion to win in the 
final seconds after pulling within one point on a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what they have overtime for, ain't it?" Ryan said. "Depending on the 
situation, most people are going to kick the extra point and take a chance on 
the coin toss." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Moving the kickoff back five yards while lowering the tee from a maximum of 
three inches to one. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer touchbacks, more long returns of more line-drive kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 More intentionally short kickoffs when teams realize that they can't stop 
these returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm playing Dallas and looking at Kevin Williams down there, I'm not 
kicking the ball to him," said Dan Reeves, New York Giant coach who was upset 
with the changes. "All this rule means is, more squib kicks." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Returning the ball to the spot of the kick on missed field goals, normally 
seven or eight yards behind the line of scrimmage.  
</P>
<P>
 Teams that automatically attempted field goals on fourth down and short from 
the 30-yard line will be going for first downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams that gave strong-legged kickers a shot from 50 yards or more will be 
deciding instead to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quarterbacks everywhere today are jumping for joy," said Leigh Steinberg, 
agent for Troy Aikman and Steve Young, among others. "Last year, quarterbacks 
were complaining that the game should be taken off the kicker's foot and put 
back into their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 They will not be joined in their celebration by Reeves, who was openly angry 
at a rule that reduces the effectiveness of his specialty kicker, Brad Daluiso. 
</P>
<P>
 George Young, Giants' general manager, was a Competition Committee member who 
pushed for the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the public could care less about points," Reeves said. "They want 
competition. And can you tell me a better game than our game against Phoenix 
last year when Daluiso won it with a 54-yard field goal in the final seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Other coaches openly dread the darker side of the new rules. In exchange for 
more offense, they have left themselves open to considerably more 
second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This leads to some very, very exciting plays . . . but when they are over, 
one of the coaches is going to get ripped," said Mike Holmgren, Green Bay's 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Shula, a Competition Committee member whose approval was vital to the 
passage of the rules, scoffed at the suggestion of coaches feeling more heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how in the hell there can be more pressure on you than there is 
now," he said. "So why not? . . . The league needed more offense. We hope this 
will provide that." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-point conversion, which passed 23-4, with the San Diego Chargers not 
voting, could also mean a slight change in personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The best conversion plays are run by option offenses, which currently do not 
exist in the league. Heroes could come from the unlikeliest places.  
</P>
<P>
 "I may just decide to put Sterling Sharpe at quarterback on a two-point play 
and let him run around a little bit," Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
 For kickers, there was some slight comfort after the turbulent day. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're down by two points, there's only one way to end a game," Gary Anderson 
said. "And that isn't changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pro Football Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are one of six teams that have contacted Leigh Steinberg about 
obtaining quarterback Jim Harbaugh, recently released by the Chicago Bears. . . 
. The Raiders will play the Denver Broncos in an exhibition game in Barcelona, 
Spain, July 31. . . . Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys' owner, told several writers 
in a hotel bar early Tuesday that "I'm sick and tired of hearing this 
Jacksonville stuff . . . I should have fired Jimmy (Johnson) and hired Barry 
Switzer," according to eyewitnesses. Johnson confronted Jones later Tuesday and 
received an apology.  
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Ram vice president, maintained that he still plans to notify the 
city of Anaheim on May 3 that he is terminating the Rams' lease effective Aug. 
3, 1995. After that notification, Upon the announcement, expect Baltimore, St. 
Louis and Memphis to make their pitches for the franchise. Baltimore is still 
the clear favorite because of stadium lease problems in St. Louis and money 
problems in Memphis.

BLACK COACHES, THE NCAA WORK OUT A SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Justice Department will announce today in Washington that a 
settlement has been reached in a dispute between the Black Coaches Assn. and 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Details were not immediately known, and all sides have agreed to wait until 
today's announcement before discussing it, said USC basketball Coach George 
Raveling, among the most active and outspoken BCA members. 
</P>
<P>
 An NCAA spokesman, Kathryn Reith, warned not to "expect an 'X, Y and Z 
statement.' There are some things the leadership can't guarantee until they are 
passed by a convention. The NCAA's governance process is such that any major 
issue has to be decided by the convention." 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department offered to mediate when the BCA threatened to boycott 
some college basketball games in January to protest the lot of black athletes 
and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came to a head at last January's NCAA convention, when delegates 
rejected a proposal that would have restored the scholarship limit in Division 
I men's basketball from 13 to 14 with a 191-119 vote. The BCA said the failure 
to approve the scholarship proposal served to further limit blacks' access to 
higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship issue was simply one of several grievances the BCA had against 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes far beyond that," said Washington State Coach Kelvin Sampson on 
Tuesday, adding that he did not know the details of the settlement. "The 
biggest thing we were after was academic reform to make a more level playing 
field for athletes. And we want more minorities in decision-making jobs in the 
NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
 The mediators -- officials from the Community Relations and Civil Rights 
divisions of the Justice Department -- have organized two sessions with the 
disputing parties, one by teleconference and one in person. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter was held last week in Chicago when Drake Coach Rudy Washington, 
president of the BCA, Georgetown Coach John Thompson and Temple Coach John 
Chaney met with NCAA and Justice Department officials.

THIS MOVE RAISES EYEBROWS -- AND SOME KEY QUESTIONS

<P>
 Once again, there will be a frenzied news conference at the Forum, and once 
again, the main man will be Earvin (Magic) Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 When the cameras start whirring and the notepads start filling up today at 11 
a.m., there will be much excitement. One of the greatest stars of the game of 
professional basketball will be back under the bright lights, although they 
will be shining on him along the sidelines this time. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as always with Johnson -- whose last few years in the limelight have 
included announcements that he contracted the AIDS virus, announcements that he 
would retire, then unretire, then retire again -- there will be lots of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why is he taking over now? Was it a matter of owner Jerry Buss telling 
Johnson long ago that when he was ready, simply speak up? Did Magic speak up? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is this timed so that (1) he can take over with the Lakers on a little bit 
of a winning roll but (2) also at a time when the playoffs are almost certainly 
no issue and Magic can learn for a couple of months without any pressure to 
win? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why would the Lakers sign Randy Pfund to a contract extension through the 
1995-96 season as recently as two weeks ago and then bring Johnson aboard? Is 
that simply Buss, being loyal to an employee -- Pfund -- whom he has said he 
wants to keep around in some capacity? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is this the Lakers' answer to the need for some star quality to fill the 
frequently empty seats at the Forum this year? Does this mean that, because 
there is no way to get a real star player in the near future for Jack Nicholson 
to watch, the Lakers sent for a star coach? Or should that read: went for a 
star player as their coach? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What about Magic's health? And what about the things he said after his last 
retirement about getting worn down by questions about his health at every stop 
on the NBA schedule? 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, perhaps the biggest question of all: Can he merely sit there and 
watch, as his youngsters bumble and stumble and do all the things wrong that he 
wants done right, and not be compelled to put on a uniform again and fix things 
right out on the court, rather than from the sidelines?

 "It may be politically incorrect to encourage competitive sports and emphasize 
winning because it is insensitive to the feelings of the loser. Wrong! To 
compete and try to win is to risk losing. That's healthy. We must teach our 
young people that it is necessary and worthwhile to risk failure to make an 
attempt at success. An excellent lesson of competitive sports is that if you 
lose today, you go back, strengthen your weaknesses, and try to win tomorrow."

 "The obsession with winning is at the core of what's wrong with the world 
today. People don't see the relationship between competitiveness and the 
violence which pervades this society from top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the world of sports, we're not interested in playing or even watching a 
game just because we love the game, except for a few great (athletes). How many 
times have you seen someone switch the channel or leave the stadium because the 
score was 87-57 with three minutes to play. We don't care about the game 
anymore, just who wins. 
</P>
<P>
 "In life we have Watergates and Whitewaters and gang-bangers and jealous 
husbands and wives killing each other for the same reasons: They want to win at 
all costs, or because they're humiliated by losing. We see life as a struggle 
to be won or lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning is not the only thing, just the final result. What we need to do is 
begin to look at life and sports like music. You don't listen to a symphony or 
a single song just to hear the last note. In fact, the last note is no more 
important than any of the others."

 "What's wrong with winning? Winning at all costs is not right (i.e. illegal 
recruiting, ineligible players). Winning because you have a good program, good 
athletes, fine coaching and a winning tradition is right. No one likes to lose, 
period. Losing is not good.

 "There are certain conditions as to how much emphasis should be put on 
winning. Coaches who have teams that are young and inexperienced should use 
practice and game time to teach fundamentals that are necessary to win games. 
It should not be a time for scolding and pushing kids into something that may 
not be tangible at the time. Constructive criticism is the key. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, coaches who have teams with talent, experience and the 
desire to win should be able to push their kids to the next level of play."

 "Yes, winning is everything. But only if winning is defined in a much larger 
sense, both on and off the court or the field. The definition of winner must 
include the development of balance and perspective as well as humility, 
camaraderie, loyalty, respect for self and others and grace under pressure. 
Yes, it's lots of fun to take first place. But the real winner does his or her 
best at all times. More narrowly defining the term winner -- to refer only to 
the guy with the most points -- makes us all losers. The obsession with getting 
ahead, no matter what the cost, weakens that sense of cohesion that is the 
essence of community."

 "Winning at the high school level should be secondary to learning the 
fundamentals of a sport and having fun. Winning is a byproduct of executing 
those learned skills. High school should be an arena for preparing 
student-athletes for college or professional careers. The ultimate goal of 
winning as a primary emphasis should be reserved for the professional level."

 "With school choice now a reality, parents will be more likely to elect a 
school based on what they perceive to be the more successful sports program. 
Sadly, and often, the only measure of success is a school's win-loss record. 
Great athletes rarely transfer into losing programs. The successful sports 
program realizes that winning is not always synonymous with success, for the 
successful program continually meets the goals of the individual athletes, and 
for each the goals may be different."

 "Being a member of a sports team in high school is a realistic learning 
experience which educates students athletes on life itself. It offers 
opportunities to discover truths, such as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- You will receive only what you invest. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The need and respect for authority. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cooperation among teammates is essential for success.

<P>
 -- Life isn't always fair. 
</P>

 -- Everyone respects a winner.

 "The most important argument against focusing on winning is that it takes the 
fun out of the game. Athletes should concentrate on developing teamwork and 
sportsmanship. High school players should be taught how to accept defeat 
gracefully. It's knowing that you've tried your best and given it your all is 
what sports should be all about. There is nothing wrong with wanting to win, 
but not at the expense of having fun."

 "Winning teaches kids to work hard to get what they want, but at the same 
time, they should be reminded that winning isn't everything. Losing teaches 
them to work harder the next time to win. A competitive attitude should be

you do in life."

concentrating and improving skills should be the emphasis. When we play to our

 Emphasis should not be placed on winning, but rather on playing the game to 
the best of a person's ability, learning skills such as playing as a team, and 
enjoying the game. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman at Esperanza High School in Anaheim, I can think of a number of 
games that I have played in where the other team thought winning was so 
important they would use any and every means possible to achieve a victory, 
including dishonest tactics as well as excessively fouling their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the regular physical education classes at school, when there is not an 
adult supervising or keeping score, students will tack on extra points to their 
own totals. When confronted, they argue they are correct and that you just were 
not keeping score properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Using dishonest tactics and cheating are not confined to only those players 
with less athletic skill. I have known excellent players who have resorted to 
cheating. Perhaps the poorer players need to win to make themselves feel 
better, while the good players need to win in order to retain their reputations 
as winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Although everyone likes to win, winning should not be the only reason a coach 
gives to his team for playing or the only reason that motivates a participant 
to play. Many are taught that winning is all-important, but if everyone 
concentrates on winning, athletes are often less likely to enjoy the actual 
playing of the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone has been to a game where there was a parent in attendance who 
was obviously obsessed with winning. These rude spectators, who usually spend 
their time yelling at the referees, players, coaches or anyone else who might 
be in a position to prevent their child from winning, influence their children 
more than they might realize. If they are so obsessed with winning, why 
shouldn't their children be likewise? 
</P>
<P>
 At the high school level, students should concentrate on improving their 
playing techniques, especially if they are considering taking up the sport as a 
way to get into college or as a possible career. They should not be obsessed 
with obtaining more points or faster times than their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 By playing on a team, a student can learn many things that will help him later 
in life: teamwork, setting and reaching goals, commitment and persistence. 
Future employers are not going to ask you on your job application if you or 
your team won a CIF Southern Section championship in high school. However, the 
skills and qualities you did develop during your playing days will prove very 
valuable.

 High schools in Orange County with winning traditions in sports are schools 
with heavy parental involvement, schools that promote and support academics, 
athletics and parental ties. Winning is a natural result of this cooperation. 
It isn't that winning is emphasized; winning occurs because parents, kids, 
teachers and coaches are working together to mold future Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda, Mater Dei, Los Alamitos, Santa Margarita, Edison, El Toro, 
Estancia and Marina and many others are high schools with winning traditions in 
multiples of sports. They are also high schools with active booster groups, 
knowledgeable athletic administrators, student-centered coaches and involved 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding reductions, increased academic requirements, intra-district transfer 
policies, etc., do not become impediments at these schools; they become 
challenges that parents, athletes, teachers and coaches focus on together for 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning at a family-centered school occurs because all four forces have made 
sacrifices and worked together. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's remember that until their junior year, most high school students don't 
drive. They're dependent on adults or the system to transport them to and from 
practice. The system, in the past 10 years or so, has collapsed; schools no 
longer provide bus transportation to and from athletic practices. The kids have 
to get there and get home on their own.  
</P>
<P>
 Schools that have parents who take their kids to swim practice year-round at 6 
a.m., who pick up their kids from football practice at 7:30 p.m., who spend 
their weekends at cheerleading performances, band competitions, volleyball 
clinics or wrestling events are the winners. 
</P>
<P>
 The "have" schools of our county are in the majority, and they are successful 
winners because parents at those schools make major sacrifices in time, money 
or priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 A winning tradition becomes contagious when cheered on by all those involved. 
Coaches are a crucial ingredient in the mix, but so are committed parents, 
supportive teachers and dedicated athletes. Ask what makes Brea-Olinda's girls' 
basketball team click, Mater Dei's boys' program excel, Los Alamitos' football 
squad dominate annually or Marina's softball team win consistently: an 
interactive winning tradition supported by adults who respect students. 
</P>
<P>
 How much emphasis should be placed on winning at the high school level? As 
much emphasis as the partners involved wish to spend. After all, this is 
America: land of the free to choose, to sacrifice, to win!

PREP VOICES; REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; LEARNING TO LOSE GRACIOUSLY IS AS IMPORTANT

 Do we place too much emphasis on winning?

<P>
 No. Understanding how to win is important. Knowing what it takes to set a goal 
and then reach it is invaluable in society. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we place too much emphasis on winning? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. When a team reaches four consecutive Super Bowls and is branded a loser, 
our collective perception of winning is skewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Society is better served by a high school athlete who learns how to lose 
graciously than one willing to win at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
 That seems to be the problem with many of today's social ills, regardless of 
how small they might seem. The pursuit of victory develops the me-first 
attitude that permeates our society. I have grown up in the "Me Generation." 
Selfishness is the No. 1 problem in America today, and not just because we have 
stooped to allowing NBA players to compete in the Olympics.

 OK, you can't blame the Middle East on high school sports, but hear me out. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important function of our educational system is to advance a 
literate, clear-thinking society. But another function, whether education wants 
it or not, is to build character and help forge young citizens who appreciate 
winning, but are not consumed by it. The importance of practice and teamwork, 
of hard work and sacrifice, of preparation and strategy, of establishing viable 
working relationships despite interpersonal differences, are applicable to life 
beyond high school. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the high school athlete -- as well as the coach or teacher -- who is 
often the role model for the younger students in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Me? I looked up to Leonard Kadel, a senior at Olivehurst (Calif.) Lindhurst 
High while I was a freshman. Someone at Mater Dei is looking up to Miles Simon. 
Someone at Brea-Olinda is looking up to Nicole Erickson. And athletes aren't 
the only ones looking; there are others who it is hoped will appreciate the 
hard-work ethic that both those players exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important for everyone in society to know how to win. It's also important 
for everyone to know how to lose. When stories are made public of an entire 
junior varsity team threatened to be replaced because it lost one game it was 
expected to win, is that sending the right message or the wrong one? 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Lombardi is supposed to have said it: "Winning isn't everything; it's 
the only thing." He was speaking of professional sports. I would hope that if 
Coach Lombardi were alive today, addressing your student body, he would amend 
that statement to: "Winning isn't everything." 
</P>
<P>
 It just isn't. There is failure in everyone's life. Learning to deal with it, 
learning how to move on, is terribly important. The best time to learn is while 
you're still young enough -- and willing -- to learn. Junior high and high 
school is a time when you're still young enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Might Angel reliever Donnie Moore still be alive had he been able to 
effectively deal with the home run he surrendered in the AL playoffs? Or, might 
he still be alive had fans been able to effectively deal with it? 
</P>
<P>
 I am surprised there haven't been more Donnie Moores, more people who crack 
under the pressure of losing. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not throwing away the importance of victory. I am not criticizing 
programs that yearly increase the standards of excellence in football, 
basketball, baseball or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 But I refuse to indict those programs that are weak. For every team that wins, 
there is a team that loses. And the all-consuming desire to win creates asses 
in society. From my position as a sportswriter, I hear the comments of plenty 
of fans -- parents, particularly -- who are blinded by the pursuit of victory. 
I am embarrassed that somewhere on the playing field or court they have a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 I sat next to a 15-year-old boy one game who cheered and jeered with every 
call for and against his team. At one point, the boy yelled at the referee, 
"You blew it, you . . . !" 
</P>
<P>
 Am I wrong to be worried? This was a high school girls' basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some people aren't concerned about what others think. And that's 
fine. But I have worked with those types of people and they are my least 
favorite. They are, typically, the most selfish. They are, typically, the ones 
who can't stand the thought of losing.

BASS HEAVEN; 10-POUND LARGEMOUTH FISH APPEAR PLENTIFUL IN PERHAPS LAKE CASITAS' 
BEST YEAR EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new day's sun is lighting the sky, revealing a lush green countryside and a 
sprawling lake reflecting the billowing clouds above. Birds begin to sing. 
</P>
<P>
 The serenity of the morning is short-lived, however. Abruptly, in a collective 
roar of high-powered engines, bass boats by the dozens speed off. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily ritual has begun anew. 
</P>
<P>
 It's peak season at Lake Casitas, and the reservoir, rejuvenated after the 
drought by two years of steady rains, has been the hottest lake around for 
trophy-sized largemouth bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good every year at this time, but this year has to be one of the best 
ever," marina manager Randy King says. "At other lakes a 10-pounder is a 
once-in-a-lifetime fish. We've been getting more than a dozen every week." 
</P>
<P>
 But lake regulars catch most of those fish, and they are a secretive yet 
fiercely competitive lot. A very large bass does not go unnoticed. Neither does 
failure to produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin Spencer, a 53-year-old semi-retired cabinetmaker from Santa Barbara, is 
one such fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've fished here 20 years and I catch at least 10 bass (of) 10 pounds or more 
every year," Spencer says as he pulls his boat up to a point off an area known 
as Indian Mesa. The submerged trees and bushes beneath were home to an 11-pound 
8-ounce lunker that charged the surface and inhaled one of Spencer's homemade 
lures the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 The lures are large jointed contraptions, painted to look like a trout and 
built to mimic one. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing these bass like more than a trout swimming on the surface," 
Spencer says. "And when they come up, the water just opens up and there's 
nothing like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer casts and begins the slow retrieve. The lure looks like a trout, but 
there is no sudden opening of water, only a gentle V-shaped wake following the 
lure as it swims back to the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer casts again, and again . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on the lake, Dave Townsend is battling a 10-pound largemouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer isn't concerned, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have patience," he says. "It's just a matter of when they decide 
to feed. I can throw these (lures) all day if I have to." 
</P>
<P>
 It appears he won't have to wait long. A commotion erupts behind the boat, 
where several bass are chasing a small trout, which disappears suddenly as a 
bass opens its large mouth, taking the trout and a huge amount of water in one 
gulp. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer puts his hand over his heart, breathes deeply, then casts several 
times in the vicinity of what he calls the "wolf pack" of bass. But the fish 
are not fooled by his artificial trout.  
</P>
<P>
 The commotion is over quickly, tranquillity restored. A breeze ripples the 
lake. Small ducks dive for small prey. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Spencer, nothing is biting. 
</P>
<P>
 Not too far away, John Shull, a lake regular from Ojai, is battling an 
11-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer decides to move. 
</P>
<P>
 He pulls up to an area at the south end, where a submerged ridge between what 
are now two small islands has produced in the past. Spencer casts. Nothing. He 
casts again. nothing. It is asked how he got the name Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother picked it out of an old true-confession magazine," he answers, 
reluctantly. So much for small talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer remains upbeat, though, outwardly anyway, and moves again to an area 
he calls "Fish Highway," near the dam. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in from the dam and round this small point," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, two large bass are cruising around the point a few feet beneath 
the surface. Spencer's heart races again, and he casts. Again, no takers.  
</P>
<P>
 He works the shoreline toward the east shore. Several deer are grazing on the 
hillside. But Spencer can't get a bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never cast so many times and not caught anything," he says, his 
frustration beginning to show. He fires up his engine and hits the throttle. 
"Maybe they'll be biting after lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having filled up on humble pie, Spencer orders a burger and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 King hand-feeds wild birds meal worms behind the counter at the tackle store, 
where snapshots logging the day's top catches are displayed. He explains how 
Casitas has regained its prominence as one of the world's top largemouth bass 
fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lake dropped 55 feet during the drought," he says. "We lost nutrients and 
lots of habitat. The lake came back up 28 feet two years ago, covering all the 
new growth, and 25 feet last year. It gave us a terrace -- there's great 
habitat 25 feet down and then there's the next level, where there are a lot of 
big bass." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest Casitas bass was a 21-pound 3-ounce fish caught by Ray Easley in 
March of 1980. The biggest since, an 18-pound 8-ounce fish caught last March by 
Steve Gray of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe that Casitas will produce the next all-tackle world record, 
finally striking from the books the name of George Perry, whose 22-pound 
4-ounce largemouth caught in a Georgia pond has stood as the record since 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, however, has something else on his mind: producing a respectable fish 
by day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it happens to be a world record, so be it," he says, back in his boat for 
the afternoon bite, should there be one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never take no for an answer," he says, back at Indian Mesa. But after several 
casts, he does just that. Back to the Fish Highway, nothing. Back to the ridge, 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer is asked if he has ever caught a marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nope," he says, his mind on much smaller but equally elusive quarry. "Don't 
know too much about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on the lake, Paul Beppu, a lake regular from Ventura, is catching a 
12-pounder. He follows that up with a 13-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer pulls up to Dead Horse Canyon, where Shull is fishing. Shull had 
already caught four bass. "And one rolled on my lure that had to weigh 15 
pounds," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer doesn't want to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 He moves to Deer Slope and works the entire bank. Nothing. He motors into 
Chismahoo Creek and casts in and about the weedy banks and off the several 
small points. Nothing.  
</P>
<P>
 A red-tailed hawk swoops down on a large rodent and carries it to a treetop. 
But as far as Spencer is concerned, nothing is biting. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that his friend, Jim Mason, who knows the lake as well as or better 
than anyone, had been having similar troubles for the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been really upset lately because he hasn't been able to catch a big 
fish," Spencer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on the lake, Mason, an Oak View resident, is having no trouble at 
all, he and a companion having landed five bass totaling 51 pounds, the largest 
a 13-pounder.  
</P>
<P>
 But for Spencer, time is running out. He ends up at Orchard Point, where he 
once caught a 15-pounder. He has been on the lake for 10 hours and has only a 
three-pounder to his credit, a fish he took on a plastic worm in hopes of 
breaking the ice. Now, a few hundred casts later, his spirit is drooping.  
</P>
<P>
 Defeated, he fires up his engine and heads for the marina.  
</P>
<P>
 Wondering, possibly hoping, if others had struggled as he has, Spencer wanders 
up to the tackle shop. No such luck. On the counter are snapshots of at least 
10 bass, all weighing 10 pounds or more, including Mason's five, which were 
photographed and released.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've had more than a dozen fish over 10 pounds," King says. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer tries to hide his humiliation. He downs a cup of coffee and mingles 
for a bit before going back to load his boat and head home. "I'm surprise at 
old Marlin," King says. "He usually comes up with a big one." 
</P>
<P>
 At least for Spencer, there is always tomorrow. Lake Casitas 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to drought-busting rains the past few years, Lake Casitas in Ventura 
County has regained its prominence as a world-class trophy bass fishery.

<P>
 In a tribute to the late Dinah Shore, the Ladies Professional Golf Assn. 
announced Tuesday that she has been elected an honorary member of the LPGA Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame, considered one of the most difficult to get into in sports, 
has only 13 members from the playing ranks.Shore, who helped build interest in 
the LPGA tour through the Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament, is the only honorary 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was made by Commissioner Charles S. Mechem at the banquet 
that precedes the tournament. The 72-hole event begins Thursday at the Mission 
Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechem also announced that the LPGA scholarship program will be named after 
the entertainer, who died of cancer Feb. 24. The first Dinah Shore LPGA 
Scholarship is expected to be awarded for the 1994-95 school year. DAN HAFNER

COACHES PROPOSE CHANGES IN CITY FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The L.A. Football Coaches Assn., representing football coaches at 49 City 
Section high schools, has proposed a modification of the playoff structure that 
could be implemented by the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The association proposed to the Interscholastic Athletics Committee this week 
that teams not be predesignated as members of the 3-A or 4-A divisions.Instead, 
once the regular season is complete, teams will be placed in the appropriate 
divisional playoff bracket based on record and strength of schedule, City 
Commissioner Barbara Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has been sent to a City subcommittee. Formal ratification is 
expected at IAC's next meeting on May 16, Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed to get tacit approval from IAC," Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, each of the six conference champions automatically would be 
placed in the 16-team 4-A playoff bracket. The remaining 10 teams would be 
chosen subjectively. After the 4-A bracket is complete, the 16-team 3-A bracket 
would be filled from the remaining schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said the proposal "got a number of positive responses" from IAC, whose 
members seemed interested in applying the format to other sports. Adoption in 
other sports would first need to be approved by coaches, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the existing format in football, basketball and baseball, most 
conferences are split into a 3-A and 4-A leagues before the season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The leagues are juggled annually based on conference record, which means teams 
are often placed in 4-A leagues after strong seasons. However, one good season 
doesn't ensure a similar performance at the higher level the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Fiege said IAC has authorized a plan in which City openers will be 
played Friday, Sept. 9, the start date for most Southern Section games. The 
first day of school in the Los Angeles Unified School District is Sept. 12.

HUFFMAN GETS ANOTHER VICTORY IN COURT; JURISPRUDENCE: JUDGE ORDERS STATE SCHOOL 
SYSTEM TO PAY HIS ATTORNEYS FEES. FULLERTON'S SHUMARD AND BEDELL TOLD TO PAY 
PUNITIVE DAMAGES TOTALING $4,500. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The California State University system Tuesday was ordered to pay $300,000 in 
attorneys fees to representatives of former Cal State Fullerton volleyball 
Coach Jim Huffman, who in February won a $1.35 million judgment in his wrongful 
termination suit against the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Ronald L. Bauer also denied a CSU attorney's motions for 
a new trial and to have the $1.35 million award reduced. In addition, Bauer 
ordered two defendants, Fullerton Athletic Director Bill Shumard and university 
administrator Jack Bedell, to pay Huffman punitive damages totaling $4,500, 
$3,000 for Shumard and $1,500 for Bedell. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kevin Gerry said the CSU system will appeal the ruling, 
perhaps as early as today. The appeal process could take up to two years, 
during which time Huffman's $1.35 million judgment will earn 10% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as one of the best investments we can make in this economy," said 
Jared Huffman, Jim's brother and attorney. "We've analyzed the verdict and 
researched the law and have no question whatsoever that we will prevail on 
most, if not all, causes of action on appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman estimated that his San Francisco-based firm of Boyd, Huffman & 
Williams could incur another $200,000 in attorneys fees during the appeal 
process. In 18 months, the $1.35 million would earn about $200,000 in interest. 
</P>
<P>
 If a state appellate court upholds the verdict of the Superior Court jury, 
that could push the CSU system's financial liability over $2 million. Judgments 
against the system come directly out of the CSU's operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the taxpayers of the state and students of the CSU system should be 
aware that their representatives are wasting money in this matter," Huffman 
said. "It's the same type of horrible decision-making that has characterized 
the defendants from the very beginning of this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the same people who rejected our $300,000 settlement offer when the 
complaint was filed (in December, 1992) and our $350,000 settlement offer two 
months before trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Huffman, who now works at an Anaheim sports apparel company, said he was 
unfairly fired in March, 1992, after he fought and blocked the school's effort 
to kill the women's volleyball program in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The university contended it acted properly when it fired Huffman, whose teams 
went 25-80 in his three years (1989-91) as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffman's attorneys successfully argued during the three-week trial that 
the coach was fired in retaliation for his sex-discrimination lawsuit that 
saved women's volleyball, forced changes in the school's athletic policies and 
embarrassed the school. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury determined that Shumard and Bedell, then the school's acting vice 
president for academic affairs, had "acted with reckless disregard of, or 
callous indifference to" Huffman's First Amendment rights. Shumard also was 
found to have acted with "fraud, malice or oppression" in terminating Huffman.

TACO BELL TRIMS SEARCH TO O.C., TEXAS; FAST FOOD: THE RESTAURANT CHAIN WON'T 
SAY OUTRIGHT IF ITS IRVINE HEADQUARTERS IS SCRATCHED FROM ITS LIST OF POSSIBLE 
SITES. BUT IT DOES DECIDE AGAINST MOVING TO ATLANTA OR CHARLOTTE, N.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Taco Bell Corp. hinted Tuesday that it has decided to move out of its 12-story 
headquarters and said that it has narrowed its search for bigger offices to 
Orange County and the Dallas-Fort Worth area. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Janis Smith said the company, a week away from its self-imposed 
deadline for deciding where to move its headquarters, has ruled out Atlanta and 
Charlotte, N.C. That decision was made earlier this month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still looking at a variety of options," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Taco Bell said at the end of September that it might relocate, the 
company also said it was possible that it would remain in its 
285,000-square-foot mirrored Irvine office tower. "To say that would be 
inaccurate today," Smith said, though she would not say outright that the 
Irvine building was scratched from the company's list of possible sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-growing, Mexican-style fast-food chain already has nearly 1,000 
employees working in its headquarters and in several floors of a smaller 
building next door, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunt for new offices will depend on "economics, transportation and, for 
Texas, a central location" in the nation, Smith said. The company still expects 
to reveal its plans by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith would not elaborate on what Taco Bell is looking for in a headquarters 
or what incentives are being offered, but it is believed that Dallas' central 
location and larger airport facilities would be weighed against the huge cost 
of moving such a large operation halfway across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's announcement last fall jolted Orange County and California 
officials who already were beset with companies fleeing -- or considering 
leaving -- the state for cheaper land, cheaper labor and fewer state and local 
restrictions on business. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt stopped by Taco Bell's headquarters on Nov. 
4 as part of a Southland swing to round up a new crop of companies for the 
Tarheel State. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said corporate executives have since talked with the governors of all 
four states. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson sent in a so-called red team, a task force of corporate 
leaders, to try to persuade Taco Bell to remain in California. Red teams have 
been used in other cases where large employers have threatened to relocate out 
of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Taco Bell is still discussing possible plans both with Wilson's red 
team and with Texas officials.

SANTA ANA SURGEON ACQUITTED OF FRAUD IN WORKERS' COMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Ana orthopedic surgeon charged two years ago in a much-publicized 
crackdown on workers' compensation insurance fraud was acquitted Tuesday on all 
14 counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The not-guilty verdict, which was delivered by a Los Angeles Superior Court 
jury, came nearly two years after the defendant, Dr. Marappa V. Gopinath, 46, 
was arrested for allegedly filing bogus insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi held a press 
conference and proclaimed Gopinath's arrest and those of eight others as "a 
clear warning to con artists that we aim to put them out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Gopinath could not be reached for comment Tuesday, but his attorney, Marshall 
Schulman, said, "justice has not been served because he never should have been 
charged."  
</P>
<P>
 Initially, prosecutors alleged that Gopinath had double-billed insurance 
companies and provided false information for a workers' compensation patient. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the trial started Feb. 4 in Los Angeles Superior Court, Gopinath 
was accused of 14 counts of conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and fraudulent 
billing practices involving five patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely untrue," Schulman said. "It showed a complete lack of 
understanding of the workers' compensation laws." 
</P>
<P>
 While under indictment, Gopinath has continued to practice medicine in Santa 
Ana, Schulman said, but his practice has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're under indictment, it's hard to get people to come in to see you," 
Schulman said. "He was receiving referrals from other doctors. He's a fine 
orthopedic surgeon. But no doctor or lawyer is going to refer" cases to a 
person awaiting prosecution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gopinath's arrest in April, 1992, came in the wake of a then-new state law 
providing for stepped-up investigations of suspected workers' compensation 
fraud and stiffer penalties for those convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi called a midday news conference in Los Angeles on April 22, 1992, to 
tout what was described as the start of a major attack on workers' compensation 
insurance fraud and to announce the arrests. The status of the cases against 
the eight others arrested that day was not immediately available.

AUTO EXEC'S ARREST STUNNED ACQUAINTANCES; PROBE: BUT INDUSTRY INSIDERS SAY THEY 
SAW SIGNS OF TROUBLE FOR FORMER AMERICAN HONDA EXECUTIVE JIM CARDIGES AS EARLY 
AS 1992.

 Children in the exclusive Nellie Gail subdivision dubbed Jim and Effie 
Cardiges' home "The Castle" for its domed, octagonal turret. 
</P>
<P>
 Business associates who socialized with the couple agreed that the $760,000 
house, with its extra-wide hallways and carpeted, air-conditioned garage, was 
indeed palatial. 
</P>
<P>
 The home and the couple's refined tastes -- he wore gold Rolex watches and 
$1,000 suits, she appreciated fine jewelry, both drove expensive cars -- seemed 
to be in keeping with Jim Cardiges' position as a high-ranking executive at 
Torrance-based American Honda Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors described the family as warm, gentle people. Cardiges' business 
associates described him as a regular churchgoer at St. Paul's Greek Orthodox 
Church in Irvine, where he'd recently served as chairman of an important 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 So friends and neighbors were stunned when federal agents arrested Cardiges at 
his home March 11 and charged him with taking an estimated $5 million in 
kickbacks and bribes in return for awarding Honda franchises to dealers across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges and his family have declined to comment. But his attorney, Philip 
Israels, said Cardiges fully expects to "prevail in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators allege that the scheming was fueled by the law of supply 
and demand. As customers clamored for Honda and Acura automobiles in the 1980s, 
the economic value of those car dealerships skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1992, there were signs that Cardiges' situation might be more 
complicated than it appeared. He surprised acquaintances and business 
associates by abruptly resigning from American Honda, where he had been the top 
executive in the U.S. sales division. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges, now 48, told associates then that he wanted more time to look after 
his personal businesses, including J. Car Consultants & Development, which he 
ran from an office in his home. Cardiges also spent considerable time -- and as 
much as $1 million of his own money, according to court documents -- on 
Worldwide Dyve Inc., a small company in Corona that made sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
 "His premise was that he'd resigned, which we all found very surprising," said 
an Orange County businessman who socialized with Cardiges in the early 1990s. 
"It was unusual because someone of his age resigned so suddenly." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation among auto industry insiders about Cardiges was fueled in late 
1992 when disgruntled Honda dealers in New Hampshire testified in federal court 
that company executives tilted the dealer selection process and car allocations 
to favor franchisees who paid bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1993, Cardiges' successor in the Honda sales division acknowledged in 
an interview that "a small number of people have tarnished us." And in June, a 
Detroit automobile-industry trade magazine reported that the FBI intended to 
question Cardiges. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Honda executives who pleaded guilty in recent months to related fraud 
charges told investigators that Cardiges logged various illegal payments in a 
black, leather-bound notebook, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors 
in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana. The document says one former executive 
asserted that Cardiges kept $150,000 hidden in a brown paper bag in an 
unoccupied condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 The former executives also told investigators that Cardiges -- whose annual 
salary at Honda was never more than $143,892 -- accepted automobiles for his 
children and niece from Honda dealers in Virginia and New York. Investigators 
allege that Cardiges accepted bribes and kickbacks, including a new Mercedes 
Benz and a $20,000 baby grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
 He allegedly ordered one car dealer to buy $24,000 worth of furniture for him 
at high-end retailers, such as Glabman's Furniture in Costa Mesa. According to 
court filings, investigators were told that another dealer footed the bill for 
a Hong Kong shopping spree where Jim and Effie Cardiges purchased expensive 
vases for their home. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents confiscated some of the furnishings after searching the house for 
evidence on the night they arrested Cardiges, who is free on $200,000 bail and 
scheduled to appear in federal court in Concord, N.H., by March 31 to enter a 
plea. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Cardiges associates say they were shocked by the arrest and the 
allegations that subsequently came to light. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Al Hornsby, vice president of the Professional Assn. of Diving 
Instructors, a Santa Ana-based group that licensed Worldwide Dyve to 
manufacture sportswear in 1991. PADI contracted with Worldwide Dyve in large 
part because of Cardiges' reputation as "an important executive at Honda," 
Hornsby said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was profitable for PADI and Worldwide, Hornsby said, but 
Cardiges opted not to renew the licensing agreement late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Cardiges called real estate broker Larry Null, who had helped 
Worldwide Dyve find office space in Corona, for advice about "shutting the 
business down," Null said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide's demise, Null said, followed a bitter disagreement between Cardiges 
and Harry Youngman, an accountant who also served as Worldwide Dyve's manager. 
"It was real obvious that they had a falling out," Null said. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngman, who handled Cardiges' accounting and tax work for eight years, 
subsequently provided federal investigators with an inside look at Cardiges' 
finances, according to an arrest warrant and criminal indictment filed in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges reported more than $1 million in "consulting income" from Honda 
dealers during 1991 alone, Youngman told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngman, who could not be reached for comment, also told federal 
investigators that Cardiges set up J. Car Consultants & Development to help 
shelter his non-Honda income. And, the court records say, he told investigators 
that Cardiges used his consulting income to buy investment properties and to 
pump more than $1 million into Worldwide Dyve. 
</P>
<P>
 The small clothing company's ample budget made an impression on industry 
executives accustomed to dealing with less well financed start-ups. Cardiges' 
willingness to spend money also was apparent to associates who visited the 
executive's home. 
</P>
<P>
 During a party, one Orange County businessman said, Cardiges took guests on "a 
mandatory tour" that included the carpeted garage. Cardiges boasted of having 
bought a Mitsubishi 3000 GT sports car for his youngest son's 16th birthday, 
the associate recalled. And he told of a garage in the Trabuco Canyon area 
where he stored more than a dozen other cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very status- and image-conscious," another former business associate 
said. "For him, what he drove and what he wore were very important. You knew 
that just from listening to his conversations about what to do with his money."

THE TELEDESIC DEAL; NETWORK IDEA MAN; WEST COVINA VENTURE CAPITALIST IS BRAIN 
BEHIND SATELLITE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the bold proposal for a $9-billion global communications network is 
being launched by high-technology giants Craig McCaw and Bill Gates, the 
network itself is the brainchild of an obscure West Covina venture capitalist 
and engineer named Edward F. Tuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuck, 62, a respected financial backer of several start-up telecommunications 
firms but little known to the general public, said in an interview Tuesday that 
he has been pondering this kind of a network since 1988, and persuaded McCaw 
four years ago to get behind the 840-satellite project. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuck said that after their first meeting, McCaw "said, 'Let's keep in touch,' 
so I took him at his word." 
</P>
<P>
 McCaw, the cellular telephone titan, joined with Tuck in 1990 to form 
Teledesic Corp., a Kirkland, Wash.-based company that plans to build the 
network. Gates, chairman of Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft, came on board 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 In unveiling its project Monday, Teledesic said the network would provide 
virtually any spot in the world with a broad menu of interactive and portable 
services for voice, data and video communications, at prices mirroring 
conventional telephone services. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is almost certain to face major obstacles before the services are 
scheduled to start in 2001, but Tuck's job is now largely complete. He said his 
role from here on out is a minor one. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has hired a president to run its day-to-day affairs, and although 
one of Tuck's venture capital funds, Kinship Partners II, owns 11% of the 
project, Teledesic is mostly owned by Gates and McCaw. (McCaw controls McCaw 
Cellular Communications, which he is selling to AT&T.) 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Teledesic plans to enlist the help of dozens of other communications 
firms and other partners to help develop and finance the project, which will 
rapidly dilute Kinship's stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly a venture capital deal that got out of hand," Tuck said only 
half facetiously. "Good grief, that's going to be an immense company. I'll be 
on their board for a while, and to the extent I'm useful to them, I'm theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 It suits Tuck's profile to duck quickly out of the limelight while keeping a 
piece of the financial action, associates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd never know Tuck has done well" in his field, said Douglas Lockie, 
executive vice president of Endgate Technology, an antenna equipment maker in 
Sunnyvale, Calif., that Tuck helped start. "He lives an unostentatious 
lifestyle. No Armani suits. When we go to lunch, it's usually sushi or the deli 
down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Tuck does business from a modestly furnished office -- not in the 
venture capital hotbed of Palo Alto or Newport Beach, but in West Covina, where 
his office shakes from trucks that hurtle by 100 yards away on the San 
Bernardino Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 He does fly his own plane -- a small, swift Mooney TLS single-engine propeller 
craft. An "aerial hot rod," he calls it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With a shock of white hair, a broad nose and brown eyes, Tuck has lived in the 
same three-bedroom house for 17 years, seldom wears ties to work and avoids 
publicity, fearing that it would make his clients ill at ease. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ego doesn't seem to get in the way of anything," said Randy Hoffman, 
president of another Tuck start-up, Magellan Corp. in San Dimas. "He's not in 
it for the publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, if Tuck gets the credit for Teledesic's brash concept, he's also 
in line for the flak. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture has already been criticized by some analysts as being too 
expensive, too complex and too ambitious, if only on political grounds, because 
approvals will be needed from countries worldwide to make the system work. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they said, there are several other satellite-based communications 
networks already on the drawing board, backed by such companies as Motorola, 
Loral Corp. and TRW. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuck is unmoved. "It's something that I think should happen," he said. His 
network would provide all countries with similar, affordable service, thereby 
lifting the economic status of poor nations that currently have inferior 
ground-based communications systems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Global wireless communications had not yet occurred to Tuck when he was 
attending college in the early 1950s, for which he paid tuition by working as a 
country-western disc jockey in Rolla, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuck graduated from the University of Missouri with an electrical engineering 
degree. He then held various engineering and technical posts at such companies 
as General Motors Corp. and ITT Corp. before moving into the venture capital 
business in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 As a venture capitalist, Tuck uses cash raised from investors to help 
fledgling firms get started, while retaining major ownership stakes that he 
hopes will grow in value as the firms prosper. (He said Kinship Partners II has 
about $20 million invested in a handful of companies, but he declined to 
release financial details about himself or his projects.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tuck also helps manage the firms at first, but he eventually hires a president 
to take over operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no good at running hierarchies," he said. "I've fired myself successfully 
several times." 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest success to date is Magellan Corp., which expects annual sales this 
year of $35 million. The firm makes hand-held receivers that, using technology 
from the Pentagon's Global Positioning System satellite network, enables 
boaters, hikers, pilots and others to know their exact location. 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan got Tuck thinking about the Teledesic network. Tuck said he realized 
that while a Magellan receiver could guide someone directly to, say, the North 
Pole, there was now another need: "To be able to call your mom and say, 'Mom, 
I'm at the North Pole.' "

JAMES FLANIGAN: HOW MOVIES GREW UP TO BECOME VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar winner "Schindler's List" tells you that a good story will always have 
value, no matter what develops on the overwrought subjects of information 
highways and multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which won the best film and best director awards for Steven 
Spielberg, can also be a guide to understanding many other things in the 
entertainment business today. For example, "Schindler's List," which has taken 
in $60 million at the box office to date, may do even better in home video 
rentals -- for the very human reason that it is a searing, three-hour movie 
that many people might find easier to watch in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, more films are seen on home video than on movie screens these days 
-- by a margin that may surprise you. In 1993, video rentals totaled $8.8 
billion and home video sales added another $5.9 billion, according to a major 
study by analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler Cos., a Los Angeles investment 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 That's almost $15 billion from the U.S. video market, compared to $5.2 billion 
at the theatrical box office. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, video can be more profitable than theatrical distribution for the 
studios, because they get a higher share of every deal, says analyst David 
Davis of Paul Kagan & Associates, a Carmel, Calif., research firm. Thanks to 
the growth of video, movie studio revenues have more than doubled in the last 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that the studios didn't see the bonanza coming. In the late 1970s 
and early 1980s, the video rental business got started in stores owned by 
record distributors, who first had the idea of selling movies on tape to new 
owners of videocassette recorders. Later they moved to renting the films. 
</P>
<P>
 But the whole idea made studios uneasy. Warner Bros. and others threatened to 
withhold films from the storefront merchants. Then the studios sought to have 
Congress pass a law limiting the merchants' business. Fortunately for all 
involved, Congress listened to local small-business people more than it did big 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 No action was taken on the matter, and videos became a great and stable source 
of film industry revenue, contributing importantly to making studios more 
valuable -- witness the recent bidding in which Viacom paid more than $10 
billion for Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 How could studio heads a decade ago have missed the promise of such a 
business? Simple: They yielded to what is called the displacement fallacy -- 
the idea that a new technology displaces a previous one. It doesn't. Radio 
continues alongside television, the movie business has adapted and grown with 
each new wrinkle in distribution -- from theaters to television to growing 
international markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The surging business of videocassette sales grew 28% last year, spurred by the 
runaway success of family films, especially by Walt Disney Co. Disney's 
"Aladdin" took in $286 million in video sales, compared to $217 million at the 
box office; "Pinocchio" had $174 million in video sales, compared to $19 
million (worth more than $100 million in today's dollars) in box office 
receipts more than 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A successful film doesn't have to be a Disney classic. "Free Willy," a 20th 
Century Fox story about a boy and a whale, took in $94 million in video sales 
after earning $78 million at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 And a film doesn't have to be for children, nor even a box office hit, to 
score in video rentals. "Sliver," a steamy thriller panned by critics that took 
in only $37 million in theaters, added another $29 million in rentals, possibly 
turning a loss into a profit for Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson should be clear for all in Hollywood and investors around the world 
who are now trying to predict developments in new media: The more advances and 
varieties there are in film distribution, the more valuable the movie business 
becomes. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest news is that Pacific Bell is going to test a system for beaming 
movies digitally over telephone lines directly to theaters, eliminating the 
costs of duplicating films and delivering canisters. 
</P>
<P>
 PacBell will be testing machinery that one day could be used to send movies 
directly into homes in response to signals from interactive television sets -- 
the much-touted movies on demand. Such wonders will come to pass, no doubt, but 
not soon and not cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
 Technological breakthroughs and major investments will be needed to bring 
interactive television over fiber-optic cables to homes and neighborhoods. 
Analyst Logsdon believes that important thresholds, such as 1 million homes 
capable of conducting interactive experiments, may be crossed by 1998 or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, movies, one of the identifying technologies of the 20th Century, 
will continue to attract growing audiences in the 21st Century simply because 
they reflect an ancient art. They tell stories, as in "Schindler's List," a 
true story of decency and good surviving and ultimately prevailing against 
incredible evil. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a very powerful business. Fast Forward 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of movies on home video has been surprisingly rapid--video rentals 
have quadrupled in a decade--and video sales surged past box office revenue 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rentals: $8.8 billion 
</P>
<P>
 Sales: $5.9 billion 
</P>
<P>
 Box office: $5.2 billion

TRADE DEFICIT UP 50% ON RECORD DROP IN EXPORTS; COMMERCE: EVEN WITH SERVICES 
ADDED IN, IMPORTS OUTPACED EXPORTS BY $6.3 BILLION IN JANUARY, GOVERNMENT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. trade deficit soared 50% in January, driven by a record decline in 
exports, the government said Tuesday. The jump from the previous month occurred 
even though the scale for measuring the nation's trade posture was expanded to 
include its surplus in exported services and deficit in imported merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate of increase, the largest in nearly a year, raised a red flag that 
trade tensions could mount in coming months. However, the $6.3-billion January 
trade deficit was far from the highest in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department, adjusting figures from earlier months to include 
services as well as merchandise, said the January deficit fell short of the 
$7.2-billion monthly average for all of 1993. The monthly deficit in 1993 
ranged from a high of $8.5 billion in October to a low of $4 billion in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The services trade surplus grew slightly in January, but the small improvement 
was overwhelmed by a $2.3-billion increase in the merchandise trade deficit. 
Merchandise exports plunged $2.7 billion, surpassing the previous record of 
$1.8 billion in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The $6.3-billion trade deficit "is a big number," said Jeffrey Schott of the 
Institute for International Economics in Washington. "The significant story is 
that you had a sharp increase in 1993 over 1992, and that trend is not abating. 
We could see a higher trade deficit this year than last." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the United States imported $132 billion more in goods than it 
exported. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Stoga, an economist at Kissinger & Associates in New York, found a silver 
lining. The decline in exports reflects the weak economies of many of America's 
trading partners, he said, while persistently high U.S. imports are "a clear 
sign of the strength of the U.S. economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The measurement of the trade balance was changed to include services to better 
reflect the overall trade picture and the significant role that non-traditional 
business activities play in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Services include a wide variety of economic activities such as transportation, 
insurance, education, advertising, research and engineering. They represent 29% 
of U.S. exports, up from 18% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise includes the more traditional products of an economy: agricultural 
and manufactured goods, as well as commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we learned today was that our trade position in the world reflects a 
wider variety of forces in addition to those involving the flows of 
merchandise," Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said in a statement.

 House Approves Bank Branching Bill: The House approved a bill to revamp 
decades-old regulations that limit the ability of banks to run branches across 
state lines, a move that would pave the way for coast-to-coast banking. Similar 
interstate branching legislation easily cleared the Senate Banking Committee 
last month and is awaiting a final vote by the full Senate. The Clinton

 Spectrum-Linked Firm Raided; Five Arrested: Postal inspectors in New York 
raided an investment company founded by the president of Spectrum Information 
Technologies Inc., and five men were arrested on wire and mail fraud charges. 
The federal complaint, filed in Brooklyn, says Paradigm Investments ran a 
"boiler room operation," calling small and medium-sized businesses and offering 
to find them financing for a fee.It says Paradigm defrauded dozens of companies 
of as much as $30,000 each, beginning in 1989. John Bohrman, 27, son-in-law of 
Spectrum President Peter Caserta, was among those arrested, and the complaint 
notes that Caserta recently sold Paradigm to Bohrman. Spectrum, which was not 
the target of the probe, said it is cooperating with authorities. Spectrum's 
stock fell 50 cents to close at $2.56 a share on Nasdaq.

 SEC Backs Shareholders in Big O Tire Dispute: The agency agreed that 
shareholders of Big O Tires Inc. may decide whether to hire an investment 
banker in hopes of enhancing shareholder value, according to a Newport Beach 
investment group. The ruling comes on a proposal by the Balboa Investment Group 
L.P. The investment banker would have the option of recommending a sale, merger 
or taking the company private, according to Kenneth W. Pavia Sr., Balboa's 
general partner."Now the company cannot have the comfort of omitting this 
proposal," he said. Big O Tires, a chain of tire stores based in Englewood, 
Colo., with more than 15 locations in Orange County, could not be reached for 
comment. Big O stock closed Tuesday on the Nasdaq at $15.75, up 37.5 cents. 
Pavia said his group is the largest independent shareholder of Big O, with 9.6% 
of the shares. The group made the investment banker proposal in December. 
Initially found acceptable by the company, Big O lawyers later declared the 
proposed supporting statement to be false and misleading.

 L.A. County Establishes Micro-Loan Program: The County Micro Business Loan 
Program will guarantee loans of between $5,000 and $50,000 made by private 
lenders to small companies.The program, established with $700,000 in Department 
of Housing and Urban Development funds sent to Los Angeles after the 1992 
riots, is designed to encourage banks to make riskier or non-traditional loans 
to spur economic development. If a borrower defaults, the bank is reimbursed 
for the balance of the loan. The first lender to sign up is Bank of America 
Community Development Bank, which reached an agreement after negotiating with 
the County Community Development Commission and county Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke.

lower on fears of a price war.East Hanover, N.J.-based Sandoz Pharmaceuticals 
Corp. will sell a month's supply of the newly approved drug, called Lescol, to 
wholesalers for $30.60. Stock prices of Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb

PARAMOUNT LEAPS INTO THE INTERACTIVE FRAY; ENTERTAINMENT: THE VENTURE INTO THE 
GROWING CD-ROM MARKET IS THE FIRST BY A HOLLYWOOD STUDIO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a deal that reflects technology's growing influence in the home 
entertainment market, Paramount Pictures' home video division said Tuesday that 
it will begin distributing interactive CD-ROM products to computer software 
stores, video rental stores and other retail outlets this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Paramount title -- produced by Los Angeles-based software firm 
Xiphias -- is based on the popular "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture, which pits Paramount against interactive software distributors 
such as Electronic Arts and Compton's New Media, marks the first foray into the 
rapidly expanding arena by a Hollywood studio's home video arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Home video is the area of the entertainment business most threatened by new 
technologies that will allow movies to be delivered to the home through phone 
and cable lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Doctorow, president of domestic home video for Paramount, said he expects 
interactive CD-ROM distribution to become a "very, very big business" -- but 
not necessarily at the expense of video. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctorow said videocassettes will eventually give way to compact discs for 
movies as well as music, interactive games, reference and educational products. 
Paramount also distributes some of its movies on CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the major movie studios have started divisions that publish and 
distribute CD-ROMs, but Paramount said the retail relationships already 
established by the home video division will help usher the shiny discs out of 
the Eggheads and CompUSAs where they have traditionally been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts said the company may face an uphill battle getting shelf space 
in the computer-oriented retailers, which are key to successful marketing in 
the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because their name is Paramount doesn't mean their products are a 
shoo-in," said Bishop Cheen, multimedia analyst with Paul Kagan & Associates. 
"It will depend on the quality of the content they get."

 State-Run Health Plan Lowers Rates: California's health alliance for small 
businesses dropped rates an average of 6.3%, prompting supporters to claim that 
the innovative new system is a success. Health plans unaffiliated with the 
alliance and competing for the same small-business customers have also been 
cutting rates in recent months.The result: a welcome reversal in California of 
the national trend toward ever-higher health care costs. The state-run 
alliance, called the Health Insurance Plan of California, operates as a 
purchasing pool for businesses with five to 50 employees, offering one-stop 
shopping for cut-rate coverage from 23 private health plans. Rates are lower 
than those typically available to small businesses because the alliance gives 
small firms the same kind of bargaining clout as giant corporations.

SURGEON ACQUITTED OF INSURANCE FRAUD

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Ana orthopedic surgeon charged two years ago in a much-publicized 
crackdown on workers' compensation insurance fraud was acquitted Tuesday on all 
14 counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The not-guilty verdict, delivered by a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury, 
exonerated Dr. Marappa V. Gopinath, 46, who had been accused of filing bogus 
insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi proclaimed Gopinath's 
arrest and that of eight others as "a clear warning to con artists that we aim 
to put them out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Gopinath could not be reached for comment, but his attorney, Marshall 
Schulman, said, "Justice has not been served, because he never should have been 
charged."  
</P>
<P>
 While under indictment, Gopinath has continued to practice medicine in Santa 
Ana, Schulman said, but his practice has suffered. JEFF BRAZIL

GM WANTS 2,500 TRUCKS IDLED PENDING PROBE; SAFETY: THE AUTO MAKER'S ADVISORY ON 
THE GAS-POWERED VEHICLES COMES IN THE WAKE OF TWO TANK EXPLOSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. has advised the owners of 2,500 natural-gas-powered 
trucks, most of them sold to utility and municipal fleets in California and 
Texas, to take them off the road until the cause of two recent tank explosions 
can be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The affected trucks are 1992 and 1993 GMC Sierra and Chevrolet 
three-quarter-ton pickups. The vehicles were fitted at the factory to run on 
compressed natural gas stored in three underbody aluminum tanks wrapped in 
fiberglass. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Gas Co., which uses 160 of the trucks, inspected its fleet 
for tank cracks after the first explosion Jan. 18, then took the trucks out of 
use shortly after the second incident Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 GM mailed notices to other users in West Hollywood, Irvine, Long Beach and 
Thousand Oaks and in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. It also notified 
customers at UCLA, Northrop Corp. and Rand Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Though GM is not expected to announce the results of its investigation into 
the incident until next week, early indications are that some sort of acid -- 
possibly from batteries being carried in the trucks -- caused the fiberglass 
wrapping to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have requested these owners take them out of service so there isn't any 
potential for any other accidents," a GM spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first rupture occurred as a tank was being filled at a Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. fueling site in San Francisco. One worker was hospitalized with 
lacerations. The other, similar incident occurred in Minneapolis. In neither 
case did the gas ignite. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The accidents come as cleaner-burning natural gas vehicles are entering the 
marketplace to help communities around the country reduce air pollution. 
Skeptics had predicted there would be difficulties handling the fuel in 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you're dealing with . . . fuels, you're talking about something 
that's not totally benign," said Mark B. Glick, chief executive of Global 
Environmental Industries Inc., an Austin, Tex.-based natural gas technology 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the relative factor of safety with natural gas vehicles is exponentially 
greater than with gasoline vehicles -- there's no doubt about that," said 
Glick, who is working with a task force to increase use of alternative fuels in 
government and private fleets. 
</P>
<P>
 Glick noted that more than 30,000 natural gas vehicles are in operation and 
that finding a solution to the tank problem would probably be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co., which is building natural gas demonstration vehicles, uses a 
different tank supplier and has reported no comparable incidents.

FIRST INTERSTATE TO OFFER EARLY RETIREMENT TO 2,650 WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 First Interstate Bancorp said Tuesday that it will offer early retirement to 
as many as 2,650 employees, or 10% of its work force, as part of a program to 
cut costs and improve its financial performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Management of the Los Angeles-based bank company, the nation's 13th-largest, 
also told analysts in New York that they will ask the firm's board next month 
to significantly increase the quarterly dividend from the current 50 cents per 
share and to expand a previously announced stock buyback program from 1.5 
million to up to 8 million shares, or 9.7% of outstanding common shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional share purchases would begin in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate shares rose $1.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday 
to close at $74.50. The shares had been down from the previous close most of 
the trading day, evidently on news that Paine Webber banking analyst Lawrence 
Cohn had cut his rating of the stock from "attractive" to "neutral." 
</P>
<P>
 Trading was halted late in the day pending the restructuring announcement, and 
the share price soared when trading resumed just before the close. 
</P>
<P>
 In its announcement, the bank also said it will seek to acquire other 
financial institutions that would afford it a return on equity of 18% to 20% 
and possible expense savings of up to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The early-retirement program is one of several steps the bank said it will 
take to cut its costs in 1995 to 58 cents for every dollar in revenue, from 
65.75 cents last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Company spokesman James Simon said details of the program will be released 
within the next two to three weeks but that approximately 10% of First 
Interstate's 26,589 employees will be eligible for the buyout. He declined to 
say whether such a cut would meet company goals or whether layoffs would be 
necessary.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: RELAX, HOT FOREIGN STOCKS WERE BOUND TO CORRECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Dow Jones industrial average were to fall 27% in three months, Wall 
Street would know what to call it: a bear market. 
</P>
<P>
 But in many naturally volatile foreign stock markets, a 27% decline -- which 
is what Hong Kong shares have experienced this year -- might just be called par 
for the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some American investors, probably new to the international investing game, 
have been stunned as foreign markets that were red-hot last year have plunged 
this year. Investors' shock is showing up in a sudden rash of redemptions from 
international stock mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: T. Rowe Price Associates' New Asia Fund, a $2-billion stock fund 
that invests in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and other young Asian markets 
outside Japan, has dropped 20.5% in value this year, as shares in those markets 
have slumped. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopeful investors continued to pump new money into the fund in January and 
February, even as its share price fell. But early this month, fear began to get 
the best of some New Asia shareholders. The fund says that since March 1, it 
has seen 4% of its assets yanked away as shareholders have demanded their money 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The tide also has turned at giant Fidelity Investments in Boston. The 
company's emerging markets stock funds, which drew record sums from new 
investors last year and early this year, now are seeing money flow out, says 
spokesman Neal Litvack. So far the redemptions are modest, he says -- $2 
million to $5 million a day on Fidelity's $4-billion base of foreign stock 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Litvack admits, "it's a significant reversal of the trend of the 
prior eight weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some foreign-fund owners may have a legitimate reason for getting out, of 
course, if they bought in well before last year's international stock frenzy 
and want to realize some of their substantial profits. But if today's sellers 
include investors who just bought these funds late last year or early this 
year, they're probably making a classic mistake bailing out. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? First, wild price swings are nothing new in emerging markets, because 
these are markets of relatively few stocks and relatively little trading. 
Before an investor dumps the New Asia fund because it's down 20.5%, he or she 
ought to remember that the fund was up 78.8% in value last year. Rarely can you 
make that much money in a year without giving some back in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, foreign stock markets' great year in 1993 followed five years of 
generally weak performance. Market cycles tend to run longer than a year, so 
1993's surge looked more like a beginning than an ending. Indeed, that's what 
the economic outlook for most emerging markets suggests, many pros say. 
"Fundamentally, nothing has changed in most emerging markets," argues Josephine 
Jimenez, co-manager of the $635-million Montgomery Emerging Markets fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's economy is weak, but that market's biggest problem has been political 
uncertainty, much of which was dissipated Tuesday when a potential spoiler in 
the presidential race opted against running. (The news sent beaten-down Mexican 
shares soaring Tuesday.) Argentina, meanwhile, "is still in the most 
spectacular recovery that we've seen anywhere in Latin America," says Lawrence 
Krohn, emerging markets analyst at Lehman Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the Pacific, most local economies are likewise in fine 
shape, says Dan Duane, whose Prudential Pacific Growth fund invests in 
Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and other Asian markets. While much of this 
year's Asian selloff is tied to fears of rising U.S. interest rates -- which 
can automatically push rates up in smaller Asian nations -- Duane says the 
sellers miss the point: U.S. rates are creeping up because the economy is so 
strong, which should translate into rising export orders for Asian companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "World trade should be very strong this year," Duane says, "and that means we 
should see very good profit growth out of these Asian economies." 
</P>
<P>
 With the 16% and 24% market declines in Singapore and Malaysia, respectively, 
so far this year, Duane says the price-to-earnings ratios on many of those 
stocks have dropped to the 15 to 20 range, putting them on par with U.S. 
stocks' P-Es. Yet profit growth in Pacific Rim countries this year should far 
exceed what many mature U.S. companies are capable of, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the last few days, Duane says, his $500-million fund was still taking in 
new money. Now, he says, the fund is seeing mild net redemptions. While that 
may temporarily restrict his ability to buy stock, Duane sees a silver lining 
in worried investors' decision to bail. "Normally," he notes, "people redeem at 
market bottoms." Easy Come, Easy Go 
</P>
<P>
 Though many foreign stock markets have plunged this year, experts say 
investors should keep in mind that they are merely taking back some of the 
tremendous gains scored last year. How some foreign stock mutual funds fared in

3 MAJOR AIRLINES DISCOUNT FARES ON SOME SPRING TRIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three of the nation's major airlines lowered fares as much as 50% on Tuesday 
for trips between April 19 and June 15 on routes where they compete. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir initiated the move, with United Airlines and American Airlines quickly 
following suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales cover the period between Easter and summer vacations, when travel is 
fairly light. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir said in a statement from its Arlington, Va., headquarters: "Based on the 
strong response seen in recent sales, we're extending the opportunity for our 
customers to travel during the pre-summer period at discounted levels." 
</P>
<P>
 For this sale, USAir said, it selected markets where it has a sizable presence 
and where additional capacity is usually available during the post-Easter 
period. Not all routes are included in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 In markets where lower promotional or regular fares already apply, USAir said 
it will continue to offer those fares. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir gave as examples fares of $198 round-trip between Eastern Seaboard 
cities and Florida; $298 round-trip between Eastern cities and New Mexico, 
Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin, and $398 for a 
coast-to-coast round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based American will match USAir's discounts in competing markets, 
spokesman Marty Heires said. 
</P>
<P>
 United, based in Chicago, said it will match discounted fares by USAir in 
competing markets by offering 40% to 50% off the price of trips taken between 
April 19 and June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 All three airlines said tickets must be purchased by March 31 and carry 
significant restrictions, such as a Saturday night stay.

BRIEFCASE: AUTO INDUSTRY; KIA REVIEW, HYUNDAI OFFICIAL'S QUOTE MAKE CAR AND 
DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Korean car makers Hyundai and Kia -- both with U.S. headquarters in Orange 
County -- made the pages of April's Car and Driver magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sephia sedan, debuting in the United States this year as the inaugural 
product of Kia Motors of America Inc. in Irvine, got a full-page review in the 
respected monthly magazine for car buffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict? The reviewer said a brief drive in the top-of-the line GS model, 
which retails for less than $12,000 with power windows and door locks, tilt 
steering, intermittent wipers and an AM / FM stereo cassette audio system, 
"gives us the impression that the Sephia will be a respectable transportation 
module." 
</P>
<P>
 But Car and Driver is noted for as much for acidity as acuity, and the Sephia 
review was no exception. Citing potential competitors, like Dodge's Neon, that 
come with dual air bags, optional ABS braking, sexier lines and a bigger 
engine, the magazine wrote that "notoriety for Kia will likely take a bit 
longer than it did for Heidi Fleiss."

NEW GM PLANT IN BREA TO REHIRE 200 LAID-OFF EMPLOYEES; AUTOMOTIVE: 2,500 
FURLOUGHED WORKERS FROM VAN NUYS FACTORY CLOSED 2 YEARS AGO WILL HAVE PRIORITY 
ON JOBS TO SEW TRUCK SEATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A General Motors division plans to open a factory for making pickup seats here 
that would employ about 200 former workers from its shuttered San Fernando 
Valley auto plant, a spokeswoman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sewing factory will produce seats for GM's line of full-size pickups when 
it opens later this spring, said Karen Longridge, spokeswoman for the Inland 
Fisher Guide division of GM in Warren, Mich., which makes automobile and truck 
components. 
</P>
<P>
 Most, if not all, of the new plant's work force will be drawn from the 2,500 
employees idled when GM shut its Van Nuys auto factory two years ago, she said. 
From its opening in 1947 until its closure in August, 1992, in a cost-cutting 
move, that plant had churned out 6.3 million cars, including Chevrolet Camaros 
and Pontiac Firebirds. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure left production workers who had earned $17.50 an hour with little 
hope of finding similar high-paying manufacturing jobs in the Southland after 
their benefits ran out a year later. Though there was no immediate word on what 
the new jobs will pay, the Brea plant will put a relatively small portion of 
the furloughed workers back on the GM payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we have a work force available, we would like to find opportunities," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers are represented by United Auto Workers Local 645 in Van Nuys, 
which declined comment on the rehiring effort. 
</P>
<P>
 A truck-seat plant had been planned for the San Fernando Valley, but undamaged 
industrial buildings became harder to find after the Northridge earthquake in 
January. That led GM to the site in Brea -- a former Weber Aircraft facility at 
3200 Enterprise St. Weber moved to Fullerton, according to the brokers for the 
Brea building's landlord, Carl Ross of Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 GM has leased a 132,000-square-foot building for four years at a cost of $2 
million, according to the brokers, Lee & Associates Commercial Real Estate 
Brokers in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "The San Fernando Valley was GM's first choice. But in the aftermath of the 
earthquake, there was a run on all available industrial sites, which forced 
them to widen their search to a 50-mile radius," broker Bill Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's Longridge said the company was attracted to Brea by the pressing need to 
get the operation up and running. 
</P>
<P>
 "The site in Brea just met our needs," she said. "There was little work we 
would have to do to get up to speed. We want to get this site operating as soon 
as we can."

FDA'S DELAY IN APPROVING LASER SPURS SELLOFF OF TRIMEDYNE STOCK; TECHNOLOGY: 
THE INNOVATION WOULD TREAT ENLARGED PROSTATE GLANDS. SHARES FALL 10%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shares in Trimedyne Inc. fell nearly 10% in heavy trading Tuesday after the 
maker of surgical lasers announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
is delaying approval of a new laser for treating enlarged prostate glands. 
</P>
<P>
 The selloff of Trimedyne stock came after the company announced that the FDA 
was postponing a decision on its Urolase device until researchers rework some 
data included in the company's voluminous application. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we don't have to start from square one," said Trimedyne spokeswoman 
Kathy Price. "They just want us to clarify the information that is already in 
the documents." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some shareholders lost confidence in the company, sending the 
stock down $1.25 on the Nasdaq market, to close at $12.875 a share on volume of 
721,400 shares -- more than four times the normal trading volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Market jitters forced company officials to fend off a barrage of phone calls 
from investors concerned about the future of Urolase, which could increase the 
company's annual revenue by several million dollars. It is estimated that 
nearly half of American men over 55 suffer from enlarged prostate glands. 
</P>
<P>
 The application, originally submitted in July, 1993, still needs to undergo 
scrutiny by a panel of urologists before receiving final approval. That 
process, even without the delay, could take until the end of the year to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're actually encouraged that the FDA is paying so much attention to 
detail," Price said. "When we're done, the technology will be airtight." 
</P>
<P>
 David Anast, publisher of the Biomedical Market Newsletter in Costa Mesa, 
suggested that shareholders acted hastily on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said an FDA request for additional information during the review process is 
routine and does not mean that the prostate laser's application will probably 
be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that the investment community has regressed to the point 
that if instant approval is not received, then the product or company is 
branded as a disappointment," Anast said. "That can't be further from the 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA, Anast said, routinely asks for information not found in applications 
or demands that information already included in an application be restated. 
</P>
<P>
 In Trimedyne's case, further delay appears to be minimal if the company can 
quickly provide the additional data. 
</P>
<P>
 The Urolase device is being jointly developed by Trimedyne and C.R. Bard Inc., 
a medical supplies distributor in Georgia. The partnership suffered a setback 
in December when FDA officials held off the company's presentation to the panel 
of experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said the repeated delays have not dampened enthusiasm for a device 
designed to help men who suffer from enlarged prostates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has and will be a great deal of expectation for this approval," Price 
said. "Wall Street expectations are high. . . . Any blip will get an 
extraordinary amount of attention."

 Quotable Mazza: A few pages before the Sephia review, Car and Driver gave 
Hyundai Motor America Inc.'s chief executive, Doug Mazza, a block of ink in its 
quote-of-the-month box. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mazza-ism that caught the editors' ears? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's about a million and a half cars that won't be sold (in the United 
States in 1994). The issue is, who is it who won't sell them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hyundai Motor America, based in Fountain Valley, certainly hopes that it won't 
be one of those that isn't selling. The company has aggressively upgraded its 
model line and at the end of this year will unveil a replacement for its 
inaugural -- and most troublesome -- offering, the Excel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the bargain basement-priced Excel that made Hyundai the fastest-growing 
new car importer in the mid-1980s. But mechanical problems that accompanied the 
Korean manufacturing plant's rush to make as many Excels as the U.S. market 
would absorb contributed to lingering image problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The new car will be curvier, peppier and slightly smaller outside while -- 
through the wonders of ergonomic engineering -- providing slightly more 
passenger room inside. It is likely to start at or just under $8,000.

PACIFICARE TO SERVE MEDI-CAL PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., a health-maintenance organization, said it has 
received state approval to provide managed health-care benefits to Medi-Cal 
recipients in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare President Jeff Folick on Tuesday said approvals by the state 
Department of Health Services and the state Department of Corporations should 
boost the Cypress-based company's annual revenue by $25 million by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the contract, which became effective Monday, the state will pay 
PacifiCare about $85 a month for each Medi-Cal recipient who enrolls in the new 
HMO program, Folick said. The state's Medi-Cal program provides state-funded 
health benefits to low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Medi-Cal recipients have the option of allowing the state to pay for their 
medical care each time they go to a doctor or enroll in an HMO that provides 
them, in most cases, 100% coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare is the latest HMO to provide benefits to Medi-Cal recipients. 
Competitors Cigna Health Plans, Kaiser Permanente and United Health Plan also 
provide full coverage to low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is similar to a federal program that allows companies to provide 
full health benefits to the elderly in exchange for their Medicare benefits. 
Under that program, HMOs receive about $400 a month for each Medicare recipient 
who signs up for a company medical plan. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare Class A shares closed at $56.50 a share on the Nasdaq market on 
Tuesday, up 25 cents a share.

ALR WINS PATENT ON PROCESS FOR UPGRADING OLD COMPUTERS; TECHNOLOGY: THE IDEA IS 
TO ASSURE BUYERS THAT THEIR NEW MACHINES WILL NOT QUICKLY BECOME OBSOLETE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a development that could send ripples through the computer industry, 
Advanced Logic Research Inc. said Tuesday that it has won a patent on its 
method of upgrading older personal computers to new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The ALR technology allows a computer user to easily snap out an obsolete 
microprocessor -- the main computing unit of a PC -- and replace it with a 
faster microprocessor and other updated components, which generally allows the 
PC to work faster and use the latest software programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the invention, which has been included in computers made by 
the Irvine-based company since 1989, was that PC buyers would not delay 
computer purchases if they could be assured that their machine would not soon 
become obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 The upgraded component could be purchased for a smaller price than buying an 
entirely new computer, assuring customers that their machine would last longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Such modular design, which also lets manufacturers keep up with the constant 
change in computer chip speed, spread throughout the industry and is now 
regularly used by other companies such as Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston and 
cross-town rival AST Research Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 And since modular PCs use many of the same parts, ALR was able to simplify its 
inventory, devote less of its resources to technical engineering and lower its 
overall production costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy helped ALR set itself apart from the so-called "clone makers" 
that merely mimicked brand-name computer makers such as IBM. Some experts 
viewed ALR's technology simply as a marketing ploy aimed at eliminating buyer's 
remorse. But on some early models, ALR said as many as 30% of its customers 
upgraded their PCs to faster microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
 ALR lost $10.6 million, or 86 cents a share, in fiscal 1993 on revenue of 
$169.3 million, compared with net income of $500,000, or 5 cents a share, on 
revenue of $206.8 million the previous year. The company, which is now 
marginally profitable, has been hurt by fierce price wars in the PC industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patent seems fairly broad, but we have to conduct a competitive analysis 
before we know its value," said Vic Sial, ALR treasurer. "We know that it is 
important and that PowerFlex technology made our company famous." 
</P>
<P>
 In past interviews, ALR President Gene Lu, 39, has said that ALR invented the 
CPU upgrade technology. It is not yet clear whether ALR could force other 
companies to pay it royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to analyze the patent's claims to see the boundaries of the patent," 
said Susan Nycum, a patent attorney for Baker & Mackenzie in Palo Alto. "There 
isn't enough information to go on yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Under patent law, ALR cannot collect royalties on machines sold before it 
received the patent, Nycum said. But if the patent is upheld against legal 
challenges, companies deemed to infringe on that patent could be forced either 
to withdraw their machines from the market or pay a royalty on any future 
computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In one such case, Gilbert Hyatt, an inventor who formerly lived in La Palma, 
began collecting millions of dollars in royalties for a patent he received for 
invention of the microprocessor. He had said he invented it before industry 
giants Texas Instruments Inc. and Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu, David Kelly, vice president of engineering, and engineers Norman Hack and 
Scott Rushford were credited by the patent office as the inventors of the 
upgrade technology. The patent is the first won by ALR since its founding in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at AST Research Inc. have applied for their own patent on what AST 
called its Cupid-32 architecture, another method for upgrading microprocessors. 
Emory Epperson, spokesman for AST, said no executives were available Tuesday 
evening for comment.

POLICE LABOR DISPUTE MOVES TO BILLBOARDS; LAPD: ADS PORTRAY A CARJACKING IN 
PROGRESS AND URGE RESIDENTS TO SUPPORT THE OFFICERS' BID FOR A NEW CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stepping up its campaign for a raise by attempting to frighten the public, the 
Los Angeles police union began posting billboards across the city Tuesday that 
show a carjacking in progress and encourage residents to support officers in 
their fight for a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered from the San Fernando Valley to South Los Angeles, the 
union-sponsored billboards show a woman being robbed at gunpoint outside her 
car by a shadowy figure. They say: "Warning: This Can Be You Without the Police 
Dept." 
</P>
<P>
 The shock ads, 22 in all, are designed to dramatically illustrate the 
indispensable nature of the police and swing public opinion toward the Police 
Protective League. But they also represent a risk because they may alienate a 
crime-weary public and antagonize city officials who hold the Police 
Department's purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that the Police Protective League continues to try public 
relations stunts that I believe will erode public support for their position, 
rather than strengthen it," Mayor Richard Riordan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The mastermind of the campaign is one of Riordan's former aides, Geoffrey 
Garfield. A former assistant deputy mayor for public safety, Garfield became 
the union's communications director last month after he was asked to leave by 
Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going into this, we knew there would be criticism," Garfield said. "But we 
know we're right, and we've put on our armor and we're going to play tough. Now 
that the billboards are in the city's face, we all have to deal with this." 
</P>
<P>
 The union's next escalation -- a videotape that will highlight the city's 
crime problem -- is scheduled to go out to tourism officials across the world 
early next month if the contract dispute is not settled, union leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local tourism officials, barraged by calls from the media, were grimacing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world out there tends to forget this is a labor dispute," said Michael 
Collins, senior vice president of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors 
Bureau. "They think police, Los Angeles, trouble. That can do serious damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said there has been no overwhelming reaction to a brochure that the 
union sent out to tourism officials earlier in the month that used crime 
statistics to press the officers' case for a new contract. But as the dispute 
heats up, he said, the city's image may be on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The union had considered holding off on the billboards, which union officials 
said cost $19,000. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break in the negotiations, Riordan announced last week that he 
intended to give officers with a raise, which sources said was in the 6% range 
over two years. But Riordan also called for changes in work rules that the 
union vehemently opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan is proposing, among other things, that the LAPD eliminate distinctions 
among detectives, who are divided into three classifications. That would allow 
some detectives to be sent back to patrol duties, a move that would help 
Riordan put more officers on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy with Riordan's proposals, union leaders have said they will settle for 
nothing less than the 9% raise over three years offered to city utility workers 
last fall. Negotiations are scheduled to resume on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference across the street from one of the billboards near Echo 
Park, Danny Staggs, president of the union, said the mayor's proposed changes 
in LAPD job classifications would set back the negotiating process at least 
another six months. The changes, he argued, would unfairly affect women and 
minorities by reducing their opportunities for advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 The police union says it does not enjoy the campaign but believes it has no 
other choice. Police officers are forbidden to strike, and a sickout that the 
officers held last fall was declared illegal by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "These billboards again demonstrate that the police officers of this city have 
been left with few options to resolve their dispute regarding the lengthy 
negotiations, now approaching two years," Staggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among City Council members, a majority of whom must approve whatever agreement 
is reached at the negotiating table, sentiment over the union's tactics has 
ranged from outrage to sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Joel Wachs and Rudy Svorinich Jr. have said they understand the 
officers' frustrations and want them to get a solid contract soon. But 
Councilman Marvin Braude said the union is hurting itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is irresponsible," said Braude, chairman of the Public Safety Committee. 
"I think we have to work together. Just dumping on the city of Los Angeles in 
this way harms everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The method the union is employing struck many as ironic, because police 
officers are typically defensive about the job they do fighting crime. In this 
case, the police are advertising the unsafe nature of the city's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe most of the officers do not support this tactic," Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky said. "This is a self-destructive, self-defeating strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 As the contract dispute rages on, Riordan is exploring the idea of 
incorporating into the LAPD the hundreds of peace officers who patrol the 
airport, harbor and other city facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under study for months, the idea faces a host of logistics problems, ranging 
from pay disparities among the various departments to differences in training, 
and has not reached the stage of a formal proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor's office is looking at a number of options, but there is nothing 
solid on the table," said David Novak, Riordan's director of communications. 
"This is one of the ideas that is being looked at." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the LAPD has teamed up with the county Sheriff's Department in an 
attempt to take over policing of the region's transit agency. The joint 
city-county plan has touched off an intense struggle with Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority police, who are seeking to maintain their patrols on 
area buses and subways. 
</P>
<P>
 The police union has not taken a position on Riordan's effort to incorporate 
officers from other city departments into the LAPD, but various city officials 
said the plan faces several obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary and benefit packages of the city officers who work outside the 
Police Department generally are much lower than those of LAPD officers. In 
addition, there is concern about the qualifications of some of the outside 
officers.  
</P>
<P>
 Some critics complained that the plan appeared to be a backhanded way of 
expanding the police force, which Riordan promised to do during his mayoral 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure there would be more officers," one official said. "But there would also 
be more work."

MOTHER'S DAY; LEAH ADLER BASKS IN THE GLOW OF HER SON STEVEN SPIELBERG'S OSCAR 
SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after the Oscars, and mom's little restaurant was buzzing -- mom being 
Steven Spielberg's mother, Leah Adler. 
</P>
<P>
 In between hugs and lunch patrons and congratulatory flowers, the 74-year-old 
proprietor was chattering Tuesday about that Academy Award-winning son of hers: 
how as a kid he used to slap on wet green toilet paper and lurch around the 
house like "the Mummy"; how he schlepped through school earning Cs; how, for 
one of his wacky home movies, Adler simulated a kitchen explosion by flinging 
cherry-pie filling all over her new cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 " Rubbed-ash cabinets," she added, noting that the stain lasted years -- and 
may still be there. "But it was a glorious scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Adler laughed, a giddy, all-out laugh by a woman who lives all-out, like 
a character out of some -- need it be said? -- Steven Spielberg movie. Only 
hours after "Schindler's List" had racked up seven Oscars, including honors for 
best picture and best director, Adler was back at work as usual, cracking 
one-liners, greeting customers, doing what she has done for 17 years at her 
Milky Way kosher restaurant in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was suddenly in the limelight. TV crews came through. Star-maker 
Michael Mann, a regular who put a client in one of the Indiana Jones movies, 
stepped in for the veggie-stuffed cabbage roll and potato pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a movie deal for you -- three pictures," Mann joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler flashed a stern look: "No nudity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this the happiest Jewish mother in the world?" someone asked her. 
</P>
<P>
 No question. "I told Steve, if I'd known how famous he was going to be, I'd 
have had my uterus bronzed," the spry woman with short-cropped blond hair 
recalled, her blue eyes sparkling. She made that crack even before the Oscars. 
Spielberg was about to be honored last month at a black-tie tribute in New 
York, where he related his mother's remark. "He said that to 1,000 people at 
the Waldorf-Astoria," Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
 She just can't keep her own mouth shut, Adler confessed. "I just spew," she 
said. "Sometimes I'll say something and just be stunned." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a night, not long ago, when a surly diner demanded to know where she 
had gotten the rainbow trout. What waters? 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'I don't know,' " Adler recalled. " 'It was dead on arrival.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in a poor household in Cincinnati, Adler had nothing short of a 
fairy-tale childhood. Her father adored her. Her mother adored her. "She'd look 
at me and just grin," Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler, in turn, raised her own four children that way. Steven was the oldest. 
There was also Anne, who now lives in the San Fernando Valley; Susie, who lives 
in Silver Spring, Md., ("What a mouth," mother says); and Nancy, who is raising 
two young children in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie and Nancy flew out for the Oscars. They got to watch their older brother 
give mom a kiss on worldwide television, moving her to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 A grinning Nancy also popped in at the restaurant Tuesday -- along with her 
husband, Shimon Katz, and two young daughters -- and remembered some of the 
stunts that her brother pulled to get out of going to school. That scene in 
"E.T." in which the boy holds a thermometer to the light bulb to fake a fever? 
</P>
<P>
 "That was Steven," Nancy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom aided and abetted such high jinks, Adler admitted. All through her 
children's younger years -- through a divorce, a remarriage, moves from 
Scottsdale, Ariz., to Northern California, back to Phoenix, out to L.A. -- 
Adler was a stable, loving, creative force. A onetime classical pianist who 
later created three of the paintings that hang in her restaurant, Adler still 
loves plenty of jalapeno in her salsa and lots of those other elements that add 
spice to life, such as the ominous drama of approaching thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like storms," she said. "I love that feeling, 'How bad is it going to be?' 
" Not only that, but she and daughter Anne have a sixth sense about the 
weather; they can tell if, say, there is snow in the mountains down to 3,000 
feet. "There's a certain feeling in the nostrils." 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime family friend, Shirley Lamm, brought by yellow roses to commemorate 
the Oscars and talked about Adler's role in shaping Spielberg's career. Long 
before there was an extraterrestrial, or an Indiana Jones, there was this 
freewheeling woman who passed on a spark of fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the Peter Pan that he couldn't put in his films," Lamm said. "She's the 
E.T. that he couldn't put in his films. She's the pixie, she's quixotic; she 
doesn't have an artificial bone in her body." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, the star-maker, called her one of a kind. "She's got this tremendous 
zest for life," he said. "She loves her restaurant. She's a very unusual 
woman."

FINAL CHAPTER AT OLDEST L.A. BOOKSTORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It began in 1888 as a "Church and Sunday School Supply House" in the small and 
distinctly unbookish pueblo of Los Angeles. It went on to be linked to a 1920s 
Hollywood scandal as the last known whereabouts of a murdered film director. It 
survived six Downtown locations to become the city's oldest bookstore, 
cherished by politicians, movie stars and lesser mortals for fine novels, good 
pens and expert advice. 
</P>
<P>
 But that colorful history ended Tuesday as Fowler Brothers bookstore and 
stationery shop closed its doors forever. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7th Street store had lost customers, as many independent bookshops and 
office supply businesses have, to discount chains. Retailing's decline along 
7th Street -- with recent departures of Robinson's department store and Brooks 
Brothers clothiers -- also hurt. And the store never recovered from disruptive 
subway construction just outside the window, its proprietors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept hoping times would get better again," said owner Siegfried Lindstrom, 
66, whose grandfather was one of the store's founders. "But all you have to do 
is look outside and see all the empty stores around here and see that is not 
happening now." 
</P>
<P>
 His son Bill, 29, who also worked at the shop, said it has been losing money 
since 1990. "With the Crown and Super Crown stores on one end and Staples and 
Office Depot on the other end, business has been on a gradual slide," Bill 
Lindstrom said, referring to the giant discounters in books and stationery. 
</P>
<P>
 Those chain stores may have some lower prices, but not the antique oak 
bookshelves and glass cases that Fowler Brothers moved from previous sites to 
its last location in 1975. Chains may have huge stacks of bestsellers, but not 
the many obscurities found at Fowler Brothers such as a guide for "Woodland 
Walks in South-East England," textbooks for independent paralegals or road maps 
of Austria and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do most chain stores display copies of customer registries dating back to 
the turn of the century. At Fowler Brothers, guest books from the 1920s show 
signatures from composer John Philip Sousa, author Zane Grey, aviator Charles 
Lindbergh and actors Tom Mix and Douglas Fairbanks. Customers in later years 
included then-governor and later Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren and 
presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 A particularly intriguing 1921 signature was from silent film star Mabel 
Normand. A year later, Normand was a suspect in the unsolved murder of her 
friend, director William Desmond Taylor. On the night before Taylor was found 
shot to death at his home, both he and Normand had visited the bookstore. 
Taylor reportedly had bought two copies of "Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety" 
by Sigmund Freud.  
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who had anything to do with Downtown has gone to Fowler's," said Doug 
Dutton, owner of Dutton's bookstore in Brentwood. Despite the toughening 
competition from national chains to independent shops like his and Fowler 
Brothers, Dutton said he was shocked by the closing. "I'm just sick about it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also saddened was science fiction author Ray Bradbury, who credits the store 
for his marriage. He met his wife, Maggie, at the store in 1946 when she was a 
fiction salesclerk there. "Every single person there was top quality. They all 
had high IQs and knew their own subject," Bradbury recalled. "There are not 
that many bookstores left where you are going to get that kind of service or 
that kind of intellect." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lindstroms kept their decision to close fairly quiet because of an 
agreement with the liquidation company that is to auction the stock or hold a 
discount sale at a later date. Even the gold-leaf motto sign, hung high above 
the sales floor, may be sold. It quotes the 18th-Century British historian 
Edward Gibbon in proclaiming: "The early and invincible love of reading which I 
would not exchange for the treasures of India." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no closing notice posted Tuesday, no farewell bargains and no crowds 
of souvenir seekers. Only a private farewell party for the 15 employees and 
friends was planned. Customers flinched when they heard the 
going-out-of-business news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a shame," said Terry Lewis, a loan officer at a nearby bank. She 
said she used to order specialized business books that she could not find 
anywhere else.  
</P>
<P>
 That apparently was the case in 1888, shortly after the bookstore opened on 
2nd Street. According to family lore, one early customer was a grizzled 
prospector headed for the hills and looking for some books to take along. On 
the recommendation of John W. Fowler, the miner left with "Ramona" and "Ben 
Hur." 
</P>
<P>
 The store's fifth location, on 6th Street near Pershing Square, was a local 
landmark for 41 years and part of a celebrated Bookseller's Row. But as the row 
dried up and Pershing Square declined, Fowler Brothers moved to 7th Street, 
which was supposed to become Downtown's shopping mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was excellent through the 1980s, until subway construction turned 7th 
Street into an obstacle course that discouraged shoppers, Siegfried Lindstrom 
said. Last year's opening of the Red Line subway and Blue Line trolley station 
a block away was a hopeful moment, but new transit commuters were not enough to 
make up for the many customers who lost their jobs in the recession, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Downtown used to be at the center of things," he lamented. "Those days are 
gone."

MENENDEZ LEGAL PAPERS SAY ESTATE IS WORTHLESS; COURTS: JUDGE UNSEALS DOCUMENTS 
THAT SEEK PUBLIC FUNDING FOR YOUNGER BROTHER'S RETRIAL EXPENSES. THE 
INHERITANCE, ONCE VALUED AT $14 MILLION, HAS BEEN DEPLETED BY DEBTS, TAXES AND 
LEGAL FEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Erik Menendez is so broke that he does not even have any bank accounts, 
according to legal papers filed on behalf of the younger of the Beverly Hills 
brothers facing a retrial in the 1989 shotgun slayings of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the papers, which urge a judge to appoint defense lawyer Leslie Abramson at 
public expense for the retrial, Menendez asserted that his parents' $14-million 
estate has been "rendered worthless" by debts, taxes, legal fees and court 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said his financial situation is so grim that he wants to raise money 
by selling his Jeep Wrangler but can't -- because a buddy racked up about 
$1,500 in unpaid parking tickets. Until the tickets are paid, the car, which is 
in storage, cannot be registered or sold, Menendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal papers, which also detail the payment of $740,000 that Abramson has 
earned from the estate, were unsealed by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Cecil 
Mills, who ruled there was no reason to keep them secret because Menendez is 
seeking taxpayer cash for his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Menendez, 23, and Lyle Menendez, 26, are charged with murder in the Aug. 
20, 1989, slayings of their parents, Jose Menendez, 45, the millionaire boss of 
a Van Nuys video distribution firm, and Kitty Menendez, 47.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that the brothers were motivated by hatred and greed in 
killing their parents. At the first trial, the brothers admitted the slayings 
but said they acted in fear after years of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 That trial ended in January when separate juries deadlocked between murder and 
lesser manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Two public defenders have since taken over the case of Lyle Menendez, who also 
claims he is broke. Abramson has made it plain that she wants to stay on -- but 
only if she gets paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Mills, the supervising judge of the county's criminal courts, 
turned down Abramson's request to be paid at public expense, saying she has a 
valid contract to defend Erik Menendez at the retrial. Last Friday, she filed 
legal briefs urging Mills to reconsider or let her leave the case. He said 
Tuesday he would hear her arguments again at an April 5 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg, who presided over the first 
trial, has scheduled an April 15 hearing to set a date for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In TV interviews the past several weeks, Abramson has urged supporters of the 
Menendez brothers to contribute to a retrial defense fund. In the legal papers 
unsealed Tuesday, Abramson said the fund had taken in $15,000 in a few weeks, 
averaging $30 per check. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said that the parents' estate paid her $50,000 of a $100,000 deal 
struck in 1990 for her legal fees; the other $50,000 came from an investment 
account the brothers' aunt maintained for Erik Menendez. In 1991, the estate 
paid Abramson $550,000 more in fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The estate also paid Abramson $140,000 in court costs, according to court 
files. It paid attorney Robert Shapiro, who served briefly as Erik Menendez's 
attorney, $15,000 in fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In total, the estate has paid $755,000 for the younger brother's defense. It 
paid $740,000 for Lyle Menendez's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In the unsealed papers, Erik Menendez said state and federal tax officials 
have assessed more than $400,000 in liens stemming from the payout of legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "I have no bank accounts," and no longer own "any thing of 
value."

SCREAMING HOME INTRUDER TO DEATH

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Venice resident early Tuesday shot and killed a man who had barged into his 
home screaming obscenities, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they received a complaint about a man shouting and banging on cars 
on Brooks Avenue near Ocean Front Walk. After the man broke through the front 
door of 44-year-old Tak Cho's home yelling obscenities, Cho shot him in the 
chest with a large-caliber handgun, said Detective Cedric Wilder of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified man was pronounced dead by paramedics. Police said they 
confiscated Cho's gun. A decision on whether charges will be filed against Cho 
will not be made until an investigation by the district attorney's office is 
completed.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY; 
VOTE ON NEW SCHOOL DISTRICT TENTATIVELY RULED INVALID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Tuesday tentatively ruled invalid a 1992 
vote approving the creation of the San Gabriel Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Diane L. Wayne tentatively ruled Tuesday that voters in the Alhambra 
High School District who live in the city of Alhambra should have been allowed 
to vote along with residents in the city of San Gabriel in the April, 1992, 
election that pulled San Gabriel out of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "If San Gabriel wants another unification vote, it must include the people in 
the Alhambra district," said Mia E. Montpas, an Alhambra schools attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel Unified officials dismissed the ruling, saying it was issued 
before oral arguments and that the judge had promised to re-examine it. The 
1,300 San Gabriel high school students still attend school in Alhambra but are 
scheduled to attend a new school in their hometown in September. The San 
Gabriel district has 3,500 pupils in kindergarten through the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne tentatively ruled that it was unconstitutional to deny Alhambra voters a 
say when the secession would have a significant impact on their district's 
state revenue.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TOUGHER 
PENALTIES SOUGHT FOR FALSE SECURITY ALARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick and Police Commissioner Art Mattox on Tuesday 
proposed toughening penalties on owners of business and home security systems 
responsible for hundreds of thousands of false alarm calls that keep police 
from responding to real crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 95% of the security alarms responded to by the Los Angeles Police 
Department last year turned out to be false, triggered either by human error, 
faulty equipment or bad weather, according to police and city officials.Police 
responded to 153,000 false alarm calls last year, at a cost of about $6 million 
to $8 million in wasted work hours, Mattox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal introduced Tuesday to the City Council, owners of alarm 
systems must pay an $80 fine for each false alarm after the third false alarm 
within a 12-month period. Now, the $80 fine starts after the fourth false 
alarm. The proposal instructs the city attorney to draft an ordinance within 30 
days and return it to the City Council for approval.

 By the narrowest of margins, the City Council voted Tuesday to commission a 
study on the economic impact of the 7-month-old ban on smoking in restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 A private research firm released a report Monday saying that more than half of 
300 restaurateurs who were surveyed reported losing customers to competitors in 
neighboring cities that allow diners to light up. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all entities in the county of Los Angeles were held to the same standard, 
then there would be no need to even look at this issue," Councilman Richard 
Alatorre said.  
</P>
<P>
 The losing side in Tuesday's 8-7 vote accused the study's proponents of 
placing business interests above the health of restaurant workers and 
customers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel this measure is a smoke screen," Councilwoman Laura Chick said. "It's 
designed to lead the council to reconsider lifting the ban on smoking in 
restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 The council passed the restaurant smoking ban on an 8-6 vote in June. It 
became effective two months later, making Los Angeles the biggest city in the 
country to adopt such a law. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's vote, Alatorre was joined by Council President John Ferraro and 
Councilmen Richard Alarcon, Hal Bernson, Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden, Rudy 
Svorinich Jr. and Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting no were Councilwomen Chick, Ruth Galanter, Jackie Goldberg and Rita 
Walters, and Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Marvin Braude, the latter of whom 
wrote most of the city's anti-smoking laws.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COMPLAINT 
ACCUSES MOVING COMPANIES OF OVERCHARGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A criminal complaint filed Tuesday against the operators of three companies 
accuses them of overcharging customers to move their belongings out of their 
quake-damaged homes.  
</P>
<P>
 An April 12 arraignment date is set for Thomas J. Smith, 42, of Van Nuys, and 
Jeronimo Maldonado, 32, of Pacoima.Smith, president of LA Moving, Storage and 
Distribution, and Maldonado, who operates Maldonado Trucking, a sub-carrier of 
LA Moving, were charged in the criminal complaint.  
</P>
<P>
 Charged in a separate complaint was Paul Helbert, 27, of Burbank, president of 
Miles Transfer & Storage Co. He also is scheduled to be arraigned April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were charged after disgruntled customers called a toll-free line set 
up by the Earthquake Fraud Prevention Task Force to complain about their moving 
costs, said Deputy City Atty. P. Greg Parham.  
</P>
<P>
 In each case, the defendants are accused of overcharging quake victims for 
transportation, packing and labor in the days after the Jan. 17 temblor, of 
operating without a housing goods carrier permit issued by the Public Utilities 
Commission and of violating other PUC regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both moving companies had permitsat one time but lost them.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BRAUDE 
CALLS FOR PERMANENT CAR-POOL LANE ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite public outcry at the idea 18 years ago, Los Angeles City Councilman 
Marvin Braude proposed Tuesday that the city call for a permanent car-pool lane 
on the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, a barrage of lawsuits and public complaints ended a car-pool project 
on the freeway after 21 weeks.A temporary version of that project has been 
installed to speed motorists past sections of the freeway damaged in the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Braude said Tuesday that the temporary car-pool lane has worked so well 
that city officials should ask Caltrans to permanently convert the fast lanes 
on both sides of the freeway between the San Diego and Harbor freeways into 
car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's working wonderfully," he said. "Let's try it again." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena, Mayor Richard Riordan and 
other city officials have in recent weeks proposed the idea behind closed 
doors. Braude is the first to suggest that the city take a public stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The failed car-pool lane project 18 years ago required at least three 
passengers per car. But Braude said the program will be more successful if the 
minimum is reduced to two passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to vote Friday on the proposal.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: KING'S LAWYERS, CITY IN 
LAST-DITCH BID TO SETTLE LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for Rodney G. King and the city of Los Angeles are engaged in a 
last-ditch effort to reach an out-of-court settlement in a lawsuit to determine 
how much King should be compensated for the injuries he received from his 1991 
beating by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations for a settlement took place Tuesday while both sides were in the 
midst of selecting a 10-member jury for the trial against the city and officers 
involved in the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has admitted liability, so the jury will be called upon to decide how 
much money King should receive for injuries. Thus far, the two sides have been 
far apart. King was reported to be asking for $9.5 million; the city has 
offered $1.2 million. On Tuesday, Milton Grimes, King's attorney, said he had 
lowered his demands in an effort to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are negotiating, we have moved," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that negotiations have been ongoing, but they were 
reluctant to release details. If the trial goes forward, it will be conducted 
in two stages. The first phase will determine the amount King should be 
compensated for his injuries. In a second phase, the panel will have to decide 
if the individual officers should pay him punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 15 defendants are named in the suit, including former Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates, nine officers who watched the beating, four officers who took 
part in it and the city of Los Angeles.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: RUSSIAN IMMIGRANT GETS 
LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE IN KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Russian immigrant was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of 
parole Tuesday in the executions of two of his countrymen, whose fingers and 
thumbs were chopped off in a failed attempt to prevent identification of their 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Serguei Ivanov, 31, listened intently to an interpreter as Superior Court 
Judge Nancy Brown told him he will spend the "rest of his natural life in 
prison, unless there is a change in the law and I don't envision that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also ordered Ivanov to use his prison job earnings to pay a $10,000 fine 
into a fund for victims of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 An accomplice, Alexander Nikolaev, 33, has served two years in prison as an 
accessory after the fact for helping Ivanov dismember and try to dispose of the 
bodies. He is in the process of being deported back to St. Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanov, Nikolaev, and the victims -- Andrey Kuznetsov and Vladimir Litvinenko, 
both 28 -- shared the home in West Hollywood where the slayings occurred on Jan 
26, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Ingalls said all four men were part of a crime ring 
that dealt in high-priced check kiting and credit card fraud and used other 
Russians as operatives. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Ivanov's and Nikolaev's arrests on the day of the slayings, 
police found in their home a trove of still-boxed computers and other valuables 
believed to have been stolen or illegally bought. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims, Kuznetsov, is believed to have been the mastermind of the 
fraud ring. He was described as a charming, suave, Hollywood-handsome immigrant 
who arrived in the United States two years before his death after serving four 
years in a Soviet prison camp for criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 He is believed to have become a millionaire from his illegal activities in Los 
Angeles and New York, and moved in chic circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingalls said Tuesday that the motive for Kuznetsov's and Litvinenko's 
executions may never be known. 
</P>
<P>
 She said, however, that reports that the men were linked to a Russian Mafia 
were creations of the "the media and the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution did not seek the death penalty against Ivanov, Ingalls said, 
because it did not believe a jury would "send someone to death when the victims 
are less than saintly." ANDREA FORD

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SUSPECT IN 
HOME COMPUTER HEISTS HELD IN PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philadelphia authorities have arrested a man linked to a ring of Los 
Angeles-area thieves who robbed people trying to sell expensive computers 
through classified ads, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Worline was arrested Monday night as he stepped off a plane at 
Philadelphia International Airport, said Detective Bill Speer of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division, which is investigating 
the series of at least nine robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Worline, 23, of Inglewood, is one of several men suspected of going to 
victims' homes under the pretense of looking at the top-of-the-line Macintosh 
computer systems they had advertised for sale, and then stealing the machines 
and other valuables, Speer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Worline was the bandit who shot two Reseda men Saturday night 
while attempting to rob them of a computer, and that he suffered gunshot wounds 
after being shot by one of his victims in a gun battle.

$345,000 AWARD EXPECTED IN POLICE BEATING AT PARTY; COURTS: JUDGE'S RULING 
CULMINATES FIVE YEARS OF LEGAL WRANGLING AND A TWO-MONTH TRIAL. POLICE DEFEND 
THE OFFICERS' ACTIONS AT A BAPTISMAL CELEBRATION IN ARLETA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has awarded $345,000 to 26 party-goers who alleged that 
they were beaten up without cause by Los Angeles police officers as they 
attended a baptismal celebration in Arleta, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of legal wrangling and a two-month trial with more than 50 
witnesses, Judge Richard Montes has ruled for the plaintiffs. Police officials 
Tuesday defended the officers involved, saying they acted properly and that 
some officers were injured by party-goers.  
</P>
<P>
 Men, women and children were clubbed or otherwise assaulted by officers who 
ordered them to leave the house after responding to neighbors' complaints of a 
noisy party in April, 1989, said Leon P. Gilbert, a Woodland Hills lawyer who 
represented the plaintiffs. He called it the worst example of police brutality 
he had seen in years of representing people in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 11 party-goers were treated for injuries at San Fernando Valley 
hospitals after the incident. Six, including two brothers who owned the house, 
were arrested on charges that were later dropped, according to Gilbert and 
court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographs taken by a family member after the party showed people with 
missing teeth and bruised shoulders, arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Division police officers also were injured, police spokesmen said, as 
they tried to clear out a house packed with belligerent people. Police said 
relatives of those being arrested jumped them as they tried to haul suspects 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes' issued his decision in an order from the bench March 10. Although he 
has yet to sign the final judgment, attorneys for both sides said Tuesday that 
they have accepted this ruling as the judge's final decision and the signing as 
a formality. The Los Angeles city attorney's office -- which defended the 
officers, the Los Angeles Police Department and city officials named in the 
complaint -- and the judge refused to comment until the city decides whether to 
appeal.  
</P>
<P>
 "This shows that the system works, that people who really have been taken 
advantage of by police authority still have the ability to obtain some type of 
justice by suing the city," Gilbert said. Police Capt. Val Paniccia, commanding 
officer of Foothill patrol officers at the time of the incident, said the 
verdict shows it is fashionable for people to sue the police with false 
allegations of brutality, and for juries and judges to award them damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry the judge made the decision he did, but that's because he didn't 
believe the facts," Paniccia said. "In my opinion the officers were totally 
doing their jobs and nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
 Paniccia, now commanding officer at the LAPD's West Valley Division, said one 
officer lost a tooth in the incident and that other officers were punched and 
hit by people who refused to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that about 30 officers came to the house in the 9800 block of 
Mercedes Street in Arleta about 10:45 p.m. April 1, ordered that the music be 
turned down and told the crowd to disperse. More than a dozen people attending 
the party lived at the house, and several dozen more were guests. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, the music was turned down after police arrived. But 
the police ordered everyone to disperse and began forcing them out, Gilbert 
said. Officers formed lines outside the front door of the house, beating people 
as they tried to leave, said Gilbert and some of the witnesses and party-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are having a baptismal party to celebrate and the police come in like 
storm troopers and force them all out of their house," Gilbert said. The city 
attorney's office accepted the judgment. "Based on the number of plaintiffs and 
the number of allegations, I found the award was reasonable," said Deputy City 
Atty. Ellen Fawls, the chief defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the judge did not find that any of the officers acted with malice, 
and thus did not award punitive damages. "As far as who hit who, I don't think 
it was clearly established as to whether it was intentional," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge determined that the police violated the party-goers' civil 
rights by acting too aggressively to shut down the party, and so the officers 
were responsible for the injuries that followed, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Rosario Guillen was awarded $50,000 for injuries suffered as he bent over to 
help a young cousin who fell, the lawyer said. "Some cop whacked him with a 
baton, and knocked his two front teeth out."  
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the money, if the city pays or loses on appeal, will be divided 
among the other plaintiffs.

RIORDAN, FERRARO CALL FOR CHANGES AT L.A. ZOO; REMODELING: PROPOSED MANAGEMENT 
TEAM WOULD OVERSEE IMPROVEMENT OF EXHIBITS. THE ACTION MAY DEFUSE A FEUD 
BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan and City Council President John Ferraro have called for 
management and planning changes at the Los Angeles Zoo to refocus attention on 
the animal collection and defuse a bitter feud between employees and the zoo's 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter Monday, they proposed the redrawing of a remodeling plan that 
critics say focuses too much on a few grandiose projects rather than overall 
improvements in animal exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Likely to be put on hold by the recommendations are a large off-site 
veterinary hospital, a remodeled front entrance/educational center, and a 
multilevel polar bear and penguin exhibit, all of which had been proposed by 
zoo management. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor and council president also proposed that an outside zoo expert be 
brought in to help manage the zoo and improve the relationship between Director 
Mark Goldstein and dissident employees. The volunteer consultant would help run 
the zoo in a management team with Goldstein and Chief Curator Les Schobert. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations were based on a consultant's report and were directed to 
the city's Recreation and Parks Commission, which oversees zoo operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan asked for the changes because of flaws in the zoo management's plan 
for spending $25 million in bond money approved by voters in 1992, said his 
adviser on the issue, Karen Rotschafer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a set of grandiose changes, and it wasn't fair to the animals to make 
those changes that didn't address the immediate safety and comfort of the 
animals," said Rotschafer, Riordan's legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotschafer said that delayed maintenance at the 28-year-old zoo has made 
mundane repairs -- such as new drainage systems and filtration for animal pools 
-- a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's office would also like to see some of the bond money go to expand 
and improve the chimpanzee exhibit, now an austere and cramped rock holding 
area, Rotschafer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Ferraro called on the Recreation and Parks Commission to establish 
a task force to draw a new list of priorities for improvements at the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading the task force, and directing other zoo operations, would be the team 
of Goldstein, Schobert and a volunteer chair. 
</P>
<P>
 The elected officials said they believe that improvements at the zoo have been 
bogged down in disagreements between Goldstein and some of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In recommending the hiring of an outside consultant, Riordan and Ferraro 
wrote: "We cannot tolerate the current attention on individual successes and 
failures. . . . Unfortunately there has been a critical breakdown in 
communication and trust." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor and council president are expected within a month to recommend a 
retired zoo official to work with Goldstein and zoo employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the call for outside intervention, Goldstein said he is pleased with 
the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it clears the air and gives us some definitive direction to go in," 
said Goldstein, who was hired two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoo employees who had asked for a reordering of spending priorities said they 
supported the recommendations. "It seems like they are trying to right some 
wrongs," said animal keeper Marci Hawkins, "and trying to give the money to 
(help) the animals in the zoo, instead of to some project that we don't need."

FIXATIONS: QUEST FOR HONOR; VICTOR SEPULVEDA CONTENDS THAT HIS ANCESTORS WERE 
SWINDLED OUT OF AN ENORMOUS LAND GRANT ENCOMPASSING MUCH OF THE COUNTY, OR EVEN 
THE STATE. BUT HE DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE BACK THE PROPERTY; HE JUST WANTS 
RESPECT, RECOGNITION AND MAYBE SOME MONEY.

<P>
 Victor Sepulveda is a big man with a gentle handshake, a large turquoise ring 
and a small ponytail. In manner he seems soft-spoken, sincere and thoroughly 
exasperating.  
</P>
<P>
 In 15 years of researching his family history, he has amassed so much 
information and speculation about the Sepulvedas that when we spoke last 
Tuesday and in a follow-up call Sunday, his views came out in ungoverned 
torrents, often unrelated to the question at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the 42-year-old, part-time security guard expects government, both state 
and federal, to pay attention to him in court one day. It is Sepulveda's 
contention that more than a century ago his ancestors were swindled out of a 
land grant that includes at least the 48,800 acres of the historic Rancho San 
Joaquin, encompassing Newport Beach and much of the other land that became the 
Irvine Ranch. According to another interpretation Sepulveda applies to ancient 
documents he says he's unearthed, his family should actually have custody of 
all of Alta California -- this entire state, not to mention Colorado, Utah, 
Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. and the state of California, they have to answer to a lot of 
things," he insists. "But I'm not looking to oust anybody off the land. I joke 
about this with a woman who works with me and lives on Balboa. She says, 'You 
know, Victor, I just got a loan, and if you want to take over this loan, you 
can have this property.'  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking forward to taking back our land. We cannot take people off 
the Balboa Peninsula." Rather, he says he wants respect, recognition and maybe 
some money. He also wouldn't mind getting the El Toro Marine base, since it's 
up for grabs, though he also suggests that land should be ceded to the Juaneno 
Band of mission Indians, to which he is remotely related. 
</P>
<P>
 He first remembers hearing about his family history when he was 4, on drives 
the family would take through the county to visit grandparents living off 
Ortega Canyon. Passing the fields where the Sepulveda's rancho had been, "I 
remember asking my father quite a lot of questions. He would talk about the 
cattle, the agriculture. He said a lot of things in regard to land that was 
ours and to land that was taken from us. I remember that -- and the fig jam my 
grandma would make." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't seriously take up tracing his family history until he was 28, 
following a difficult divorce. "I started looking inward, through meditation, 
in sorrow and pain. I think that spiritually, if you will, an inner voice 
started talking to me, saying, 'Well, do you want to know who you are and where 
you come from?' And I said, 'Most definitely. Surely.' From that time on my 
life has been what I refer to as a spiritual uplifting." 
</P>
<P>
 He began looking up Sepulveda history in local libraries and continued his 
paper chase when he moved for a time to Sacramento in the mid-'80s, checking 
the archives of the Bureau of Land Management. On visits back to Orange County, 
he would often catch buses to Los Angeles to scour libraries there. Further 
searches led him to query the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 We met in the Santa Ana offices of the advertising agency he has hired to help 
spread his story. In the seven-page press release they assembled, there is a 
somewhat ordered tale centering on Don Jose Andres Sepulveda, Victor's 
great-great-grandfather, who was granted Rancho San Joaquin by the Mexican 
government in two parcels in 1837 and 1842.  
</P>
<P>
 The release goes on to reiterate a fate shared by many other California 
ranchers: High living on the ranchos buoyed by the Gold Rush's boost to the 
beef market went crashing into a five-year drought in the 1860s. Ranchers 
borrowed money at usurious rates -- often 5% a month -- and had to either sell 
their property or face foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1852 Don Jose won a $25,000 purse in a famed horse race with other 
ranch-holders. A mere 12 years later he had to sell his entire rancho for 
$18,000. The press release alludes to the land being illegally transferred, and 
to a charter from Spanish monarchy to the Sepulvedas that should have 
superseded other laws in preserving their claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Fascinating stuff, but in trying to get Sepulveda to elucidate any of these 
assertions, his arguments came rolling out like something from a fever dream or 
a labyrinthine Borges tale. Asked numerous times what evidence he would take to 
the court trials he anticipates, he responded with a flurry of long but often 
incomplete sentences touching on conspiracy theories, Roman law, destiny, 
ecclesiastical jurisdiction, "the perfect number seven," the sepulcher of 
Christ and the Spanish-American War.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the more cogent points to partially emerge are his beliefs: that Don 
Jose's signature on the title transfer doesn't match his other known 
signatures; that, rather, he had a gun placed to his head and was forced to 
flee to Mexico; that -- contradicting the account repeated in Sepulveda's own 
press release -- California history has perhaps been fudged to fabricate the 
story of a drought; and that the Sepulvedas were a royal and holy people with a 
charter granted by King Alfonso VI of Spain in 1046 that somehow extended their 
dominion over these parts of the as-yet-undiscovered New World. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This might be a good point at which to remind the reader that the title of 
this column is Fixations, and that it has dealt at times with people who 
worship the late Vic Morrow or who think demons stole their teeth. One can 
appreciate the unique road these people tread without necessarily buying into 
the veracity of their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda describes his quest as "obsessed." It concerns a part of Orange 
County history that was undoubtedly full of injustice, propelled by the 
Manifest Destiny by which the expanding United States obtained its new lands 
through a variety of unsavory means. But Sepulveda's story flies in the face of 
numerous state and local histories, and even one local expert Sepulveda claims 
as a supporter disputes his claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Villa Park real estate attorney Charles Parker is a descendant of C.E. 
Parker, who founded the Orange County Title Co. (later the First American Title 
Insurance Co.) a century ago, and he's made a study of local title claims. 
Sepulveda describes him as a "staunch ally." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker says he likes Sepulveda and is "inclined to humor him," but says, "He 
has this dream world, I guess, based on the Sepulveda claim. I certainly 
wouldn't want to tell him he'd go into court with it and have much hope of 
prevailing. He could talk himself silly, but a judge would throw it out in a 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Sepulvedas did have an ancient charter, he said, that would have been 
nullified by the Mexican Independence in 1821. 
</P>
<P>
 According to local histories, the Sepulvedas didn't have a Spanish land grant, 
but were one of 11 families to receive grants in what is now Orange County 
under the years of Mexican government. Don Jose prospered and grew wealthy with 
the demand for beef brought on by the 1848 Gold Rush that soon overran the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 When the United States helped itself to California that same year, at the 
conclusion of the Mexican-American War, the government was bound by treaty to 
respect the Mexican land grants, which it did in 604 or 794 claims, including 
Don Jose's.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a long, expensive process, however, and it was still draining the dons 
when drought hit the state in the 1860s. Despite Sepulveda's assertions of 
fraud, there are numerous historical accounts of many ranchers, Hispanic and 
white, who were brought to ruin by the drought. As Woody Guthrie was later to 
remark of bankers during the Dust Bowl days, it can be easier to rob with a 
fountain pen than a gun, and it's likely Don Jose lost Rancho San Joaquin 
through legal means, just or no. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda says he'll press on, looking for recognition of the wrongs done his 
family. He does admit that it might be hard to root his beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look on me as a kook," he said. "I'm glad to have that title. I think 
personally I dream and I fantasize way too much. I know at times I'm too 
unreal. I get confused sometimes myself. But as long as I live on this earth, 
I'm going to be gathering all the information I can. I'm not just going to put 
my sombrero on and take a siesta under a tree. I know that David did slay 
Goliath, and the (current landowners) may have millions and billions, but I 
have faith to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the money Sepulveda spends researching and promoting his 
views comes from his $6-an-hour job as a security guard at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. One can see where it might be galling to 
see those who do have millions passing by on land where a Sepulveda was once 
master of all he surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor has seen the painting of Don Jose in the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, 
showing him on horseback with the finery and proud visage or a feudal lord. He 
has seen the blue cape embroidered with gold and silver. He's read of Don 
Jose's generosity and the lavish parties at his Newport Bay home that helped 
create the legend of California's "pastoral" period (which wasn't so pastoral, 
perhaps, for the captive grizzly bears and bulls Don Jose would pit in vicious 
fights for the entertainment of his guests).  
</P>
<P>
 To be disenfranchised from such a legacy has to hurt. But the depth of his 
obsession with it can make it exasperating talking to Sepulveda. It was hard 
not to think of Bosnia, the Middle East and other areas where people have 
sustained bloody grudges for decades over issues that boil down to a 
playground-like squabble over who hit who first. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice has been lacking in many things this nation has done and may well have 
been in short supply when the ranchos were absorbed 130 years ago. But it was 
no less lacking when the Spanish seized the land from the Native Americans and 
enslaved them in the 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Sepulveda claims his struggle uplifts him, that it doesn't keep him 
from living in the here and now.  
</P>
<P>
 He said, "I go up to the third tier of the Performing Arts Center, and I can 
see the rolling San Joaquin Hills my family once rode over. I reflect 
spiritually and thank God for the grace to know where I come from."  
</P>
<P>
 As to where that knowledge may lead, he seems unperturbed that history and his 
own sources dispute him. "It's like Doris Day sang, 'Que sera sera, whatever 
will be will be.' "

TREAT KIDS' FEARS BEFORE DOCTOR VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A visit to the doctor is often stressful for children and their parents -- but 
it doesn't have to be. Careful preparation can ease a child's fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Children adjust better if they are familiar with what will happen. Parents can 
help by asking their children what they expect to happen at the doctor's office 
and correcting any misinformation or fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful parents lead to fearful children. It is important to answer questions 
calmly and in simple language. Be truthful about the possibility of needing a 
shot or other possibly painful procedures. But stress that the discomfort will 
be over quickly and that you will stay with your child during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents must also stress that medical attention is not a punishment. 
Threatening children with a visit to the doctor only increases their anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing out events a few days before may help take the mystery out of a 
doctor's visit. Use a toy doctor's kit to "examine" parents or dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers' concerns may be very different from those of younger children. 
Teen-agers generally do not fear doctors, but their changing bodies may make 
them uncomfortable about undressing in front of a doctor or nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing physical changes and sexuality before the appointment may make the 
visit more comfortable. It is also helpful to prepare a teen-ager for any 
unfamiliar procedures, such as a girl's first pelvic exam. Knowing what to 
expect can increase the feeling of being in control when a teen-ager is in the 
doctor's office.

 Talking about the future: Unless you're dating Jeanne Dixon, this is the 
ultimate turn off. Having testosterone means living fully in the moment, in the 
Now. Guys are Zen-like creatures, dammit. Macho bodhisattvas who understand the 
transitory nature of beingness in a causally connected cold and indifferent 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that, nothing irks us more than when Little Miss 
Let's-Be-Clairvoyant-Together has the bad taste to jolt us out of the present, 
especially while we're trying to fully appreciate a particularly seminal 
episode of "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dwelling on the way you were: No, thank you, I don't want to hear about the 
Prince of Monaco or Fabio or John Jr. or whatever you said your ex-boyfriend's 
name was. Maybe it's just me, but unless Mr. (former) Wonderful has done 
something really creative lately, like blown up a Zeppelin or colonized Mars, 
then why go yanking the scab off the past? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Listening versus hanging on my every word: Here's my beef. I'm a thinker. 
Theories and deep ideas ooze out of me like oily matter from a Slim Jim. Women, 
of course, appreciate this.  
</P>
<P>
 But I have this unsettling hunch that, although they appear to be listening, I 
often don't believe that they're truly grasping the nuance of my musings. I 
mean, when I voice a revelation, is it too much to ask for an occasional 
"Hallelujah, uh huh, say it, daddy," to punctuate my witticisms? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bras: Why? That's all I want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cursed wait: Breakthroughs in forensic science have proven that the longer 
you have to wait for Ms. Oh-I'll-Just-Be-a-Minute to get ready, the more radon 
you're going to inhale while sitting around in her apartment leafing through 
Vogue.  
</P>
<P>
 Avoid this unnecessary health risk. Only date women who live in 
well-ventilated yurts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Apres date etiquette: This being the '90s, actual down and dirty gorilla sex 
with your date is, of course, out of the question.  
</P>
<P>
 But after dropping a thick wad of jack on dinner, drinks and tickets to 
Dwarf-Toss Mania '94, I don't think it's out of the question to expect a phone 
call or maybe some cash redeemable token of appreciation. Real estate? Treasury 
Bonds? Hallucinogenic toads? I'm certainly not picky. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of compassion when it comes to playing the field: It seems as if women 
nowadays just don't possess the wherewithal they did a few years back . . . in 
the Paleolithic Age. Neither do their boyfriends or husbands. At least not any 
of the boyfriends or husbands of the ones I've gone out with lately.

 PMS: One day some guy is finally gonna invent a time travel machine -- and 
he'll be able to set the thing for fast forward by about, oh, let's say, eight 
days. Then he's going to collect the $100 trillion prize that every nation on 
Earth has set aside for just such a humanitarian contribution to life on this 
planet.

 Familiarity breeds contempt: Most men move into that inevitable part of the 
relationship way too early. You know, that "Hygiene Takes a Holiday" part when 
really cheap cologne replaces bathing, and they feel free to burp and scratch 
at random. Not to mention cut their toenails in your bed, impaling you with 
those little flying missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dating faux pas: OK, ready guys? Listen carefully. The Sports Illustrated 
blooper tape and a Hungry Man dinner that you make us cook . . . is not a good 
date. Anything that somehow includes us doing your laundry . . . is not a good 
date. Taking us to see any movie where more than 10 guys get kicked in the head 
or the "F-word" is said more than 150 times . . . is not a good date. 
Basically, any movie that has a man in it who has arms bigger than my waist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Memory lapses: Some men forget plans entirely or forget to call (or wait two 
weeks to call -- do you know how long this is in Girl Time? Roughly 40 years). 
Or sometimes they just forget little things, such as birthdays, anniversaries, 
Valentine's Day, other wives, children in other states, their prison records. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of commitment: When a guy mentions before the appetizers are served on 
your first date that he's not interested in marriage or kids, that's a tiny 
warning sign. When a guy considers leaving a pair of socks at your house a 
major commitment, that's another little ringy-dingy. When he drops that 
ever-so-special, "I need my space," run for the hills. That's Guy Language for 
"I'm going to start trawling for other women now, OK, honey?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trawling for other women: Oh, sure, it starts with that cute little 
swivel-neck motion -- the one that resembles the Garfield in your car window -- 
when there's any attractive woman within 100 yards. But it's only a matter of 
time before you find another woman's Barbie-sized lingerie in your bed. I call 
it the Billy Joel Complex. He wrote, "I Love You Just the Way You Are" for his 
first wife, then dumped her for Christie Brinkley. Thank you, Piano Man. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cheapness: You know the drill. You get him a leather jacket for his birthday, 
he gets you a Ronco nose hair trimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bad opening lines: "I'm hung like a yak" is, contrary to popular belief, not a 
good one. Neither is: "Hey, baby, I'm going to find your G-spot!" Whenever a 
guy says that to me, I'm always tempted to respond: "What are you, Lewis and 
Clark? I don't think so, Skippy." I mean, you know how men will never stop to 
ask for directions anywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Criticizing a woman's clothes or body: OK, guys, this will be the most 
important advice you ever get. Ready? There is no other answer but 'No' to the 
time-honored Girl Question: "Honey, do I look fat in this dress?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Things to avoid talking about for more than two hours straight on the first 
date: Yourself (fascinating as it may be to you), your mother, your car, any 
sport, any old girlfriend, your date's resemblance to your dead wife.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I feel like a relationship flight attendant: "Will you be checking 
that baggage or is that a carry-on? Should there be a sudden change of 
affection during the flight, your record albums and furniture will drop from 
the overhead compartment. . . . Please grasp them and get out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Size does matter: When it comes to egos, we like them smaller. Why is it that 
you're never happy until we sound like a cross between Lassie, the Exorcist and 
Curly of the Three Stooges, when what we normally feel like yelling is simply: 
"Ow, you're on my hair!"

PARTYING WITH OSCAR; VANITY FAIR-TISCH; THE LITERATI CAME EARLY, THE 
CELEBRITIES STAYED LATE

<P>
 Air kisses, caviar, champagne, table-hopping, low-cut gowns and the fire 
marshal: Yep, this must be an Oscar party. 
</P>
<P>
 Not just an Oscar party, the event thrown by Vanity Fair and producer Steve 
Tisch drew a crowd of very beautiful people, including actors, directors, 
producers, singers, studio chiefs, models, artists and writers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the biggest Monday night Morton's had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanity Fair Editor-in-Chief Graydon Carter knew he had an A-list on his hands. 
"But," he added, "I think it puts on a lot less pressure than if we had the 
B-list." 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks before the event, Tisch found out just what a popular guy he was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been getting calls from a lot of people claiming they went to Hebrew 
school with me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, by midnight none of the big winners had shown up. Later on, several 
nominees and presenters arrived, and some people did come in clutching gold 
statues. But few guests seemed to know who they were. 
</P>
<P>
 The party's first act started at 5:30, when guests invited to the seated 
dinner began to arrive: Gore Vidal, Lee Radziwill, Wendy and Leonard Goldberg, 
Barbara and Marvin Davis, Jackie Collins, Nancy Reagan, Michael Stipe, Anjelica 
Huston and Robert Graham, Candice Bergen, Barry Diller and Oliver Stone, plus 
Conde Nast Chairman S.I. Newhouse and Vanity Fair's Bob Colacello, Dominick 
Dunne, Reinaldo Herrera (with wife Carolina) and Annie Liebovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographer Liebovitz circled the room with a small auto-focus Nikon taking 
copious snapshots. "They're just for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no way to stop this crowd's instinctive urge to schmooze. Guests 
changed seating arrangements around and flitted from table to table while the 
awards played on several big-screen televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, waiters whisked away most of the tables, preparing for the 
second act: the onslaught of celebs from the awards. 
</P>
<P>
 In this wave was Liam Neeson with Natasha Richardson, Geena Davis and Renny 
Harlin, Prince, Debra Winger, Marisa Tomei, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, Emma 
Thompson and Kenneth Branagh, Anthony Hopkins, Nancy Kerrigan, Whitney Houston, 
John Singleton, Ralph Fiennes, Claudia Schiffer and David Copperfield, Joel 
Silver, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, Christian Slater and Rosie O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we're groupies waiting for the band to play," said a Big Agent 
standing with friends and surveying the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominee Liam Neeson admitted to having "a couple of butterflies" during the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's only natural," he said. "Fellini called it a great circus, and he was 
right. But it was great fun. Whoopi was great, what an artist. Was anyone 
thinking of Billy Crystal tonight? But now it's back to reality. These clothes 
turn into rags in 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 This was Rosie Perez's second party of the evening, and about 11:30, the best 
supporting actress nominee was starting to look weary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a ball," she said. "But after this, no, no more parties. I think 
I'm going to go home and go to bed."

PARTYING WITH OSCAR; ELTON JOHN; GRACIOUS HOST UPSTAGED BY ET -- AND WE DON'T

 Ralph Fiennes came to Elton John's Oscar party with a get-me-out-of-here look 
on his face. "I haven't experienced anything quite like it in my life," the 
"Schindler's List" star said of his evening at the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Stone made an entrance in her 
now-that-I'm-done-presenting-I'll-change-into-some-thing-doubly-fancy dress. 
And, judging by the way the stars made beelines to "Entertainment Tonight" host 
Leeza Gibbons, you would have thought it was her party. It wasn't. (Word of 
advice, Elt: Next time, keep the TV crews outside.) 
</P>
<P>
 John played host -- a charming, table-hopping one at that -- for the second 
year at an Academy Awards viewing party that reaped more than $150,000 for his 
Elton John AIDS Foundation. Will he do it again next year? "Oh yeah, every 
year. It'll probably be an annual event for us," the rock star said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner at Maple Drive restaurant in Beverly Hills, underwritten by 
Cartier, also surely offered the best reward of the night for amateur Oscar 
ballot markers: The winner took home a gold Cartier watch. 
</P>
<P>
 During dinner, the restaurant was skewed toward a music-industry crowd, 
including Bonnie Raitt, George Michael and Rod Stewart, plus executives from 
MCA Records, Polygram, MTV, King World and Planet Hollywood. Not surprisingly, 
Bruce Springsteen's win was one of the room's favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Some felt the void created by the death of uber Oscar party-giver Swifty 
Lazar. "We miss it," producer Allan Carr said of Lazar's legendary bash. John's 
mix was "subdued, quiet and chic," he offered before saying he was heading off 
to fetes at Chasen's and Tatou. But two hours later, Carr was still there -- 
the party wasn't so subdued once the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion started emptying 
out.  
</P>
<P>
 Whoopi Goldberg, in jeans, made a cameo appearance. "I did as well as I could, 
and I did my best, but it'll take me a few weeks to figure out what that was," 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Newlyweds Geena Davis and Renny Harlin agreed that the show went really well. 
"It was my first time there and, it sounds naive, but I felt a great feeling of 
unity and goodwill," director Harlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 11:30, best actor winner Tom Hanks made it into the party. 
Unfortunately, Leeza Gibbons had already gone home.

PARTYING WITH OSCAR; ROXBURY; PASSING UP GLITZ FOR A STYLE BEFITTING LEGENDS OF 
THE SCREEN

 Serious glamour and no glitz prevailed at the American Red Cross benefit party 
at Roxbury. The few sequins in attendance were all respectfully black. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was the Zeitgeist -- the Holocaust; AIDS; domestic violence; 
Sunday's 5.3 aftershock -- that caused Hollywood to adopt the profound, 
emotionally resonant style befitting screen legends. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Tia Carrere remarked: "We're partying tonight, but everyone has to 
remember that there was an earthquake yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 A respectably starry turnout included Sharon Stone, Mimi Rogers, Justine 
Bateman, Christian Slater and Juliet Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 The China Club Pro Jam kicked off with singer Gavin Christopher rousingly 
quoting Rodney King when he shouted, "We all have to learn to get along!" 
</P>
<P>
 The estimate of the evening's take was between $10,000 and $15,000 for the Red 
Cross, which could use some replenishment of its coffers after two years of 
disasters in Southern California.

PARTYING WITH OSCAR; EL RESCATE; ANNUAL BENEFIT REMEMBERS A GOOD FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Long before the first mention of "Schindler's List" at the awards ceremony, 
throngs were coursing through the amply laden food tables on the patio at the 
Mondrian Hotel for El Rescate's seventh annual Academy Awards benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Central American immigrant advocacy organization held its fete 
in conjunction with Rock the Vote to honor the late activist Patrick Lippert. 
</P>
<P>
 An El Rescate supporter and founder of Rock the Vote, Lippert died of 
AIDS-related complications in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents came to the party to accept a posthumous award from California 
Secretary of State March Fong Eu in honor of Lippert's humanitarian work. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening raised $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick was a very good friend and activist around the AIDS and the Central 
American issue," said Oscar Andrade, El Rescate executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as emcee for the evening's musical lineup, which swung to a decidedly 
Latin beat, was comedian/actor Cheech Marin. 
</P>
<P>
 He introduced entertainers Sangre Machehual, Culture Clash, members of Soul 
Vibrations and Darryl Pupose.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the oldest Oscar party now in existence," Marin pointed out. "It has 
that cachet and it also draws the politically aware and it draws the future of 
the country and the future of the entertainment community. And the fact that 
it's spearheaded by a Latino organization is momentous."  
</P>
<P>
 Mixed in with the hundreds of Hollywood's politically aware and generally 
youthful party-goers was a smattering of familiar faces from movies, TV and pop 
music, most notably actors Michael Madsen and Ian Ziering from "Beverly Hills, 
90210."  
</P>
<P>
 The much-whispered-about arrival of an Oscar-toting Bruce Springsteen never, 
sadly, materialized.

PARTYING WITH OSCAR; WOMEN IN FILM; A NIGHT OF INTERNATIONAL CUISINE, BUSINESS 
CARDS

 The Oscar show's effort to pay more attention to the workers behind the 
cameras didn't have much impact on the crowd attending the third annual Women 
in Film's Academy Awards viewing party. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the telecast, guests focused more on the choice of international 
cuisine -- Chinese, Mexican, Italian or American -- at the various buffet 
tables in the Regency Beverly Hills Hotel ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hasn't anyone eaten yet today?" was one remark heard as folks in the food 
queues used the time to exchange business cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you don't mind if I talk constantly, but I'm used to watching this at 
home on the sofa in my pajamas, eating popcorn," said Women in Film President 
Joan Hyler. 
</P>
<P>
 For those determined to be serious viewers, the organizers made it easy to see 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Minimal table decorations, featuring an array of international flags and a 
strip of film, kept sight lines clear to the big screens. The goody bags 
contained a handicapping sheet.  
</P>
<P>
 The party's star power wasn't evident until long after the television show had 
finished. Then a few on-camera faces did drift in. 
</P>
<P>
 Party co-chairs Ann-Margret and Roger Smith weren't present. 
</P>
<P>
 WIF supporters who were included Janine Turner, Joan Chen, Bruce Davison and 
Lisa Pelikan, this year's best actress nominee Stockard Channing, Diane Ladd, 
Michael Lerner and Diane Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Most joined film veterans Shelley Winters, Kathleen Nolan and Leta Grey 
Chaplin in etching their names in tiles that will decorate a wall of fame at a 
Women in Film international center.

THE PLOTS THICKEN; WERE THE BRADYS TRULY A HAPPY BUNCH? WHAT WAS TINA LOUISE OF 
'GILLIGAN'S ISLAND' REALLY LIKE? IN A WAVE OF NEW BOOKS, TV STARS OF THE PAST 
SHARE SECRETS ABOUT SOME OF OUR FAVORITE SHOWS.

 "The Brady Bunch's" Greg Brady went on a date with his mother, Carol, and made 
out with his sister Marcia. "Star Trek's" Capt. Kirk did kiss Uhura. 
</P>
<P>
 Warped plots from lost episodes? Nope. These are cast members' real-life 
accounts of what happened behind the scenes of TV's most popular reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, a steady stream of books has made its way to store shelves, 
quenching couch potatoes' thirst not only for nostalgia, but to know just what 
the likes of Thurston Howell III and Alice the maid were like in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers used to buy tell-all autobiographies only of the super-famous. But 
they have found that baby boomers and twentysomethings are just as or even more 
interested in tomes from Nick at Night icons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Star Trek Memories," by William Shatner and Chris Kreski, made it to the 
Publisher's Weekly bestseller list. Also on bookshelves are "I'm a Believer," 
Micky Dolenz's tales of his years on "The Monkees"; and not one, not two, but 
three books by "Gilligan's Island" castaways: Russell Johnson (the Professor), 
Dawn Wells (Mary Ann) and Bob Denver (Gilligan). 
</P>
<P>
 In the works are books from Batman (Adam West) and Robin (Burt Ward), David 
Cassidy, Mary Tyler Moore, Buddy Ebsen, Dwayne Hickman ("Dobie Gillis") and 
George (Goober) Lindsey of "The Andy Griffith Show" and "Hee Haw." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few people in America 'Andy Griffith' and 'Hee Haw' haven't 
touched," Lindsey says. "People kept telling me they always wanted to know all 
about Goober." 
</P>
<P>
 "Goober in a Nutshell: The AUTObiography of George Lindsey" won't be tell all, 
Lindsey says, but the book will include a "very honest" account of his rise 
from his hometown in Jasper, Ala., to his struggle to cope with instant fame as 
Mayberry's mechanic, his drinking problem and an "ego that runs rampant." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rush to snap up rights escalated last year with the unexpected success of 
"Growing Up Brady," written by Barry Williams (Greg) and Chris Kreski, MTV's 
editorial director. The book was on the New York Times bestseller list for 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, (publishers) really didn't understand the value of a Brady book," 
Kreski says. "They were more comfortable with a biography of Merle Oberon. But 
there's a whole demographic that is not being served."  
</P>
<P>
 "Growing Up Brady" readers found out that off-screen sparks flew between 
Williams and Maureen McCormick (Marcia) during the filming of the show's 
Hawaiian episodes and that Williams once went on a date with Florence 
Henderson, who played his mom, Carol Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great deal of fascination with this stuff," says Williams, who is 
writing a sequel based on the show's reunion series and TV movies. "I guess 
when you are used to seeing Greg dealing with Carol in a son-to-mother 
relationship, the idea that the two would go out kind of shakes the senses. But 
it's harmless." 
</P>
<P>
 Many books had been written about "The Brady Bunch" and other TV shows, but 
"Growing Up Brady" was different, Kreski says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other books were sort of 'Everything's nice. Everything's great,' " 
Kreski says. "This was the first one that went underneath it all, but still in 
a fun way." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Brady book, Kreski found even greater success teaming with Shatner 
in writing "Star Trek Memories," published last fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Shatner tells of his unhappiness with the show's creator, 
Gene Roddenberry, and with the network's decision not to allow Uhura and Kirk 
have an on-screen, interracial kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 (They did kiss, but the network cut most of it out. "We'd give the illusion of 
kissing without ever touching lips," Shatner writes.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Sufficient time had gone by, and people who had lived parts of their life 
working on the show were dying," Shatner says. "The story had to be told, and 
now was the time to do it. I attempted to tell the truth about making 'Star 
Trek.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But "you don't have to give every detail," Kreski says. "It doesn't have to be 
a 'Spock-ie Dearest' or the National Enquirer." 
</P>
<P>
 The same holds true for the latest series of "Gilligan" books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left out a lot of stuff," says Denver, whose book "Gilligan, Maynard & Me" 
hit bookstores in December. "I didn't want it to be all trash. I didn't want to 
get nasty. It's a lighthearted book." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, whose "Here on Gilligan's Isle" was published last summer, included 
details on the making of the show (Carroll O'Connor tried out for the role of 
the Skipper). 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not out to take an ax to anyone's neck," Johnson's co-writer, Stephen 
Cox, says. "There were a few stories that some cast members enjoyed a toke now 
and then. After all, it was the '60s. But we just decided to drop it. After 
all, there would be children reading it." 
</P>
<P>
 So why three books in the same year? 
</P>
<P>
 "This has become more than just a TV show," says Sherwood Schwartz, the show's 
creator, who is preparing big-screen versions of both "Gilligan" and "The Brady 
Bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a part of the American idiom. You go to any movie and there's a 
reference to it. Or any TV show, there's a reference to it." 
</P>
<P>
 "People have such fond memories of the show," says Wells, whose "Mary Ann's 
Gilligan's Island Cookbook" (with 13 coconut cream pie recipes) includes 
behind-the-scenes anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the show has been on so long, and there's a new generation of fans. But 
we each have our own point of view, and that's important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, whose book has sold almost 100,000 copies since it was published in 
July, has drawn large crowds to book signings in West Hollywood and in 
Manhattan's Greenwich Village. 
</P>
<P>
 The castaways share a few tales about Tina Louise, who was unhappy with her 
role as Ginger in a show lambasted by critics. In his book, Denver tells of 
hearing strange sounds from Louise's dressing room. She was having sex with her 
boyfriend, he says, an allegation Louise denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Others associated with the show have their stories, too. Schwartz's book, 
"Inside Gilligan's Island," is due in April. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are even more "Star Trek" and "Brady Bunch" stories to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Shatner has a sequel, "Star Trek Movie Memories," due next year. Nichelle 
Nichols, who played Uhura, also has a book on the way. Williams is working on 
his follow-up to "Growing Up Brady." Even Ann B. Davis, who played Brady maid 
Alice, has a cookbook in the works that includes her own memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's strange," Kreski says, "because when we talked to her, she said she 
doesn't like to cook."

STREISAND SHOWS ON SALE SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand's only Southern California appearances on her 
much-anticipated U.S. concert tour will be at the Anaheim Arena, May 25, 27 and 
29. Tickets for the shows will go on sale Sunday through Ticketmaster outlets 
and phone lines.Seats are believed to range from $50 to $350, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional U.S. stops will be May 10 and 12 at the U.S. Air Arena in 
Washington; May 15 and 17 at the Palace of Auburn Hills near Detroit; June 7 
and 9 at the San Jose Arena, and June 20, 23 and 26 at Madison Square Garden in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour, which starts in London on April 20, will use the same format as 
Streisand's acclaimed performances Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 at MGM Grand Hotel's 
Grand Garden arena in Las Vegas. Instead of a greatest-hits survey, the 
scripted show followed an autobiographical theme that employed music and 
stories to comment on themes ranging from Streisand's childhood dreams to 
relationships to social responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The material ranged from such Streisand standards as "The Way We Were" and 
"You Don't Bring Me Flowers" to such surprise choices as "What Is This Thing 
Called Love." As in the Vegas shows, Marvin Hamlisch will conduct a 64-piece 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The shows at the 13,000-seat Grand Garden marked Streisand's return to live 
concerts after a 22-year break, and were instant sell-outs. The gross -- about 
$7 million per show -- more than doubled that of any previous pop event. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the Las Vegas and London shows, which raised a total of $6.5 
million for various charities, a portion of the proceeds from each of the U.S. 
stops will be earmarked for charity, said Martin Erlichman, the singer's 
representative.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE EBERTS: THE NEW AWARDS FOR FAWNING; TELEVISION: THE FILM 
CRITIC THUMBS HIS NOSE AT OBJECTIVITY BY HOSTING KABC'S PRE-OSCAR SCHMOOZEFEST 
-- A JOB HE SEEMS BORN FOR.

 Roger and me. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Enjoy yourself."  
</P>
<P>
 You rubbed your eyes, blinked repeatedly and tried to focus. It was a Regis 
Philbin. It was a Tawny Little. It was a Chuck Henry. No, none of those. 
Incredibly, amazingly, supersonically, it was a Roger Ebert, planted like a 
palm beside a microphone by the red carpet at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
with his partner for the evening, Pam Thomson, fawning over preening 
celebrities as if joined at the brain with "Eyewitness News." 
</P>
<P>
 As if his entire career as a movie critic had been building toward this 
wondrous moment when he could shed all pretenses of professionalism and be 
affable and avuncular with everybody who was anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 As if he'd been born for it. 
</P>
<P>
 And just beyond, in the throng of onlookers, you could see the Hollywood 
wanna-bes side-by-side with the has-beens, those ghostly apparitions who might 
have earned a live shot in front of the camera in past years, but now were 
reduced to watching from the wings and hoping somehow to be noticed and 
summoned to appear before Ebert and the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoopi, shmoopi. Monday night's Academy Awards telecast on ABC was three 
sleepy hours of anti-climactic yawn compared with the dueling team coverages 
that preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
 Local news -- that's where the action was. That's where the short, roundish, 
gray-topped, bespectacled half of Siskel & Ebert was. In his emerging role as 
emcee for the stars, Ebert was more entertaining even than Monday night's 
Revlon commercials in which Nancy Kerrigan performed like a cursor controlled 
by a joystick.  
</P>
<P>
 Once the exclusive stage of KABC-TV Channel 7, the grandly vacant, annual 
Oscar pre-show has evolved into an electrifying free-for-all among network 
stations in Los Angeles, with KNBC-TV Channel 4 and KCBS-TV Channel 2 pushing 
their way into the circle to make this an electrifying threesome. 
</P>
<P>
 And what team coverage it was. Channel 2 had David Sheehan (who used to do 
this for Channel 4) and hyper-kinetic Pat Lalama, who must have set a record 
for close-ups while trying to meld her face to the camera lens. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 4 put its own unique stamp on the event, including having a chopper 
hover over milling celebrities at the Pavilion. It was a smart move, because 
you never know when a police chase can break out. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the anchor desk were Colleen Williams and Chuck Henry (an alumnus of 
Channel 7's pre-Oscar show). While his colleagues were fawning in general, 
specialist Henry at one point expertly fawned (from afar) over female breasts. 
</P>
<P>
 On the scene for Channel 4 was Garrett Glaser, who broke the rumor that 
Macaulay Culkin was absent from the Oscars. As Channel 4 viewers gasped, Glaser 
reported that the excuse offered by little Macaulay's camp was that "another 
commitment" had prevailed, but Glaser skeptically noted the scuttlebutt that 
Macaulay was held out by his father, who was "displeased because of some copy 
written for him." 
</P>
<P>
 But it would take more than this shocking disclosure by Glaser to upstage his 
more seasoned colleague in the field, Kelly Lange. As adept at self-promotion 
as at fawning, it was Lange who commanded Janet Jackson: "You are live on the 5 
o'clock news. Say hello to our viewers out there. There are millions of them."  
</P>
<P>
 And it was Channel 4 newcomer Kathy Vara who managed to corner "Entertainment 
Tonight" co-host Mary Hart and press her to reveal exclusively to Channel 4 
(the station on which Hart's program airs) just how "Entertainment Tonight" 
would be covering the Oscars. After pausing a millisecond, Hart quickly 
capitulated.  
</P>
<P>
 But quickly, back to the studio for this self-fawning update from Henry: "We 
have cameras all over the place," he told viewers, "so you will not miss a 
thing by keeping it here." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. They would have missed Ebert. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Gene Siskel are such an institution, are in such demand, that they've 
become their own hot-ticket cottage industry, doing everything short of opening 
shopping centers. The gigs just pour in. But it's Ebert who has demonstrated 
that he's the new, unsurpassed meister of criticshtick . His work for Channel 7 
Monday night, as a self-proclaimed arbiter for all seasons and reasons, 
affirmed that he has acquired a kind of celestial omniscience in the universe 
of moviedom, someone to be followed like a Bethlehem star. 
</P>
<P>
 Or to put it more crassly, the words self-parody come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Proving he knew how to play the game, Ebert was a natural, taking to vapid 
pre-Oscar schmooze like a critic to the plaudits "magical" or "fully realized" 
or "triumph of the human spirit" or "one of the year's 10 best." 
</P>
<P>
 When he interviewed Christian Slater while treating the woman at the actor's 
side as if she were invisible or a leper, you knew his future was in the stars. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Ebert to a star: "Enjoy yourself tonight, yeah, goodby." To another star: 
"You're more relaxed this year than last year." To another star: "A billion 
people will be listening to you tonight. Is that OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 And all of this without cue cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some of the interviews had greater depth. Ebert to supporting actor 
nominee Pete Postlethwaite: "It must seem strange that the whole world knows 
your name." 
</P>
<P>
 Postlethwaite: "Well, it's a good name." 
</P>
<P>
 Ebert: "Have fun tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of fun, when the conveyor belt of celebrities delivered Kerrigan -- 
who managed to mention her cosmetics employer in each of her TV interviews -- 
Ebert grilled her but good. Ebert (with a stone face): "Do you think you might 
want to move into the direction of acting instead of skating?" Apparently, he 
hadn't seen her on "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time you yearned for those pre-Oscar shows with Tawny Little, now 
a sedate KCAL-TV Channel 9 anchor, who would get so worked up in the presence 
of stars that she would almost leap out of her dress. In his own way, though, 
Ebert has eclipsed even Little. Here he was shouting at supporting actress 
nominee Rosie Perez: "ROSIE! ROSIE! Hi, how are ya? . . . I'm predicting you're 
going to win." As if Ebert's command would be the movie academy's wish, Perez 
replied, "Thank you, thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 It was when Ebert began quoting his own reviews to stars that you wanted to 
stand up and applaud. After quoting himself to soon-to-be best actress winner 
Holly Hunter: "Were you mad at me?" Hunter: "I didn't hear you say that." 
Ebert: "Oh. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the evening, Ebert co-hosted Channel 7's post-Academy Awards show 
with Thomson, spinning on his tall swivel stool as reporters checked in from 
various Oscar parties. If Channel 7 doesn't bring him back in 1995, it will be 
a crime equal to the Academy Awards ignoring an Oscar-deserving performance. 
</P>
<P>
 As an evening, it was one of the year's 10 best. All thumbs.

A NEW LOCALE FOR CARMEN; COMPUTER GAME/PBS SHOW FINDS SUCCESS AS A FOX CARTOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It wouldn't have happened without congressional demands for more educational 
children's programming, but Fox, the network known for such Saturday morning 
"action" hits as "X-Men" and the karate-kicking "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," 
is finding gold in a new cartoon about world geography. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong competitor since it began airing after "X-Men" in February is "Where 
on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?," based on Broderbund Software Inc.'s educational 
computer game phenomenon, in which players must locate super-thief Carmen 
Sandiego, her henchman and stolen loot through geographical and historical 
clues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cartoon show, from Burbank-based DIC Entertainment, is a creative 
combination of computer and traditional cel animation, photo stills, 
educational factoids and action. Compared with Fox's usual cartoon fare, its 
violence quotient is low. That may testify to Broderbund's creative approval 
over the content, so that it is "appropriate to the game and the character of 
Carmen," according to Ken Goldstein, Broderbund's consultant on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Peggy Charren, the outspoken founder of Action for Children's Television, 
is impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found out that DIC animated it . . . I fully expected it to look like 
'X-Men,' " she said in an interview. "I have seen a lot of shows get devastated 
by bad animation and some of it looks like it leaps to the screen without a 
writer. Given that Fox puts on some of my least favorite cartoons, I was 
prepared not to like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "it's nicely animated," Charren said, "and they put a lot of 
education into a cartoon . . . and they have a lot of words on the screen, so 
it helps promote reading. I think they did a terrific job." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Heyward, president of DIC, who optioned "Carmen" two years ago as a toon 
property but found network interest lukewarm, is candid about why the show 
finally sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to say that people felt it was a competitive property in its own 
right," Heyward said, "but I think that (Congress) pushed it over the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Loesch, president of the Fox Children's Television Network, readily 
concurs: "Because of the Children's Television Act, we were actively looking 
for something that would be more curriculum-oriented than our pure 
entertainment programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Loesch, who has made no secret of her reservations about federally mandated 
children's programming, stressed, "I never said you couldn't be educational. 
The point I was trying to make was that if you do not attend to the 
entertainment content of a show, you will not be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of "Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?," Fox postponed the 
premiere for six months "in order to get it right," Loesch said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the cartoon version, Carmen (voiced by Rita Moreno) each week "steals the 
unstealable," such as Stonehenge or the Taj Mahal's roof. Hot on her trail are 
Carmen's chief protagonist, teen sleuth Ivy, who's powerful and smart, and her 
younger brother, Zak. The female leads, in a genre dominated by male heroes and 
villains, are another Saturday morning rarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Through dialogue and on-screen text, viewers are given historical, cultural 
and geographical tidbits pertinent to the objects stolen and the locales 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's greatest challenge is ensuring accuracy -- from the factual 
descriptions to the visuals to the foreign languages that are heard when the 
action shifts to other countries. Accordingly, DIC employs several consultants. 
Besides Broderbund's Goldstein, they include Peter Kovaric of UCLA's Graduate 
School of Education; Barbara Wong, principal of Martha Baldwin Middle School in 
Alhambra; a travel writer; language experts; and three full-time researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The men at DIC most responsible for taking the consultants' input and turning 
it into an entertaining package are Robby London, vice president of creative 
affairs; producer Mike Maliani; director Joe Barruso and story editor Sean 
Roche. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the game, you can just say Carmen stole the Taj Mahal or the Eiffel Tower 
or whatever," Maliani said. "We have to figure out how ." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Taj Mahal episode, for example, researchers first estimated the weight 
of the roof, then found some Soviet-made heavy-lifting helicopters that 
conceivably could do the job. The artists took it from there. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure visual accuracy, artists work from photographs of all interior and 
exterior locations. Barruso, accustomed to telling his artists to "go out and 
draw whatever your heart desires," said that now "you're looking at two days of 
research before anything can be handed over to the artists." 
</P>
<P>
 "The trick is to keep it interesting," said Roche, "to keep finding ways to 
fold the facts into it in a kind of stealth learning approach to education and 
entertainment. We try to kick off every episode with an action-packed theft to 
hook our audience, as imaginative a heist as we can come up with." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how much real education can children pick up from a half-hour cartoon? 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent meeting, London said, "That was the key question. How many facts 
are too many, how fast should they go and what are kids absorbing? 
</P>
<P>
 "Our thought was to pack the shows extra full and maybe they won't catch 
everything the first time, but hopefully, by the time they've seen the show 
four times (in reruns), they will." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox cartoon is just the latest incarnation of Broderbund's hugely 
successful "Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?" computer game series. Over 
eight years, more than 3.5 million units of the eight titles in the software 
series have been sold. The series has also spawned a popular PBS game show and 
a lengthy list of licenses for music, clothing, accessories, toys and games. 
</P>
<P>
 That a geography game could grab such attention "came as a tremendous 
surprise," Goldstein said. "It was not planned in the board room as a major 
marketing assault. It was discovered by the public" -- first by teachers, then, 
when students demanded their own copies of the game, by parents. 
</P>
<P>
 So where is Carmen Sandiego? "Basically," Goldstein said, "Carmen is 
everywhere."

HOOP THERE HE IS, AGAIN; MOVIES: LEON, THE STAR OF 'COOL RUNNINGS' AND 
'CLIFFHANGER,' TAKES ANOTHER TWIST AS A TROUBLED BASKETBALL STAR IN 'ABOVE THE 
RIM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By QUENDRITH JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's only one Hollywood trapping hidden among the pieces of significant 
furniture in actor Leon's Beverly Hills bachelor flat: a green Jamaican Bobsled 
Team deck chair from last fall's hit movie "Cool Runnings." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon carried that film as the affable Derice Bannock, the real-life thwarted 
Jamaican sprinter who became captain of the Caribbean island's first bobsled 
team in 1988; the late John Candy also starred as a burned-out athlete turned 
team coach. 
</P>
<P>
 A magnetic presence, Leon, 31, who has long since dropped his surname of 
Robinson, describes himself as a "low-light kind of guy," as he adjusts the 
living room wattage to make note-taking possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't take a spotlight to figure out why Leon's star is -- in the 
words of Robert Townsend, who directed him in "The Five Heartbeats" in 1991 -- 
"on the climb." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Leon appeared in not only "Cool Runnings," but also in 
"Cliffhanger," as the ruthless bad guy Kinette. And now, he moves from the snow 
to the basketball court in the fast-and-loose drama "Above the Rim," about a 
high school basketball star torn between pursuing his sport in college and the 
easy money of a street gang. The film, directed by Jeff Pollack, co-starring 
Duane Martin ("White Men Can't Jump") and rapper-actor Tupac Shakur ("Poetic 
Justice"), opens today. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack, who co-produced the movie with partner Benny Medina, admits Leon's 
role as the shellshocked Shep, a fallen basketball star with a tragic secret, 
had been originally pitched with Denzel Washington in mind, but changed his 
mind after seeing "Cool Runnings." "I was so pleased to see his work," Pollack 
says. "He was pretty much of a slam dunk (for the role)." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is Leon's own basketball background. He grew up pounding 
the blacktop in the Bronx and played for Loyola Marymount on a basketball 
scholarship before he decided to focus on acting. (Co-star Martin was a star 
player for New York University in the late '80s). 
</P>
<P>
 "A basketball movie was definitely in the cards for me," Leon says. "There's 
always something you can add when you're in the know. Jeff Pollack wrote the 
script (with Barry Michael Cooper), but he'd ask me about things because I was 
in the know." 
</P>
<P>
 Test audiences helped shape his part too. "There was a much longer scene near 
the end, where I died," he reports. "The test audience said, 'No way. You got 
to live .' And then they did a test marketing with me living, and the audience 
cheered. I'm flattered by it, as long as it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, who cast Leon as heartthrob singer J. T. in "The Five Heartbeats" 
because of his affable sex appeal, views "Above the Rim" as another way to keep 
up momentum in the actor's career. "He's getting to show his range, and I think 
that is what actors live for," Townsend says. "To be a tough gunning force 
(against) Stallone in 'Cliffhanger,' kicking butt, that's one thing. Then in 
'Cool Runnings,' he's an island hero. Now in 'Above the Rim,' he's the mystery 
character in the puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
 The ball playing in the film is set to a hip score, with music from artists 
like Snoop Doggy Dogg and Shakur and peopled with gritty street personalities. 
Leon's controversial co-star Tupac Shakur has had well-publicized run-ins with 
the law recently, but his co-star tries to deflect any negative publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Tupac was getting press about his acting in this movie or about his 
success as a rapper, I would love it," Leon says. "But it's not. What's 
happened is a lot of stuff about his lawsuits . . . some of which happened 
while on the shoot, some of which did not. For this film to be overshadowed 
with the negative stuff would be a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Leon, son of a schoolteacher and a transit authority executive, 
seems to have always been aware of his star potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were always signs. It was weird," he says with a slight Bronx accent. 
"Contrary to what I was being told, that it was going to be very hard for me, 
'an actor of color,' I flew to New York and auditioned for a movie. I got it 
immediately, before even leaving the room. That was for 'All the Right Moves' 
(1983), with Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I said, 'Excuse me,' went to the bathroom, and yelled out the 
window. Then I went back in and was like, 'Yeah, so what are you guys thinking 
about?' Playing it cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he met Garry Marshall for "The Flamingo Kid" (1984) and played small 
roles in "Streetwalkin' " and "Colors," directed by Dennis Hopper. He even 
starred opposite Madonna, in her "Like a Prayer" video. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a perfect world, I would love for my roles to be bigger than me," he says. 
"I would love to be identified by the roles I've played as opposed to me, the 
personality. I've seen people who start out as very good actors and now are no 
more than celebrities -- their image has become more important than the roles 
they play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I walk down the street for the rest of my life and people are yelling out 
'Derice' or 'Shep,' " he continues, "that's fine with me, because those are the 
characters that I want to make an impression on people." 
</P>

FEW STRINGS TO THE PAST; MUSIC: GUITARIST JOHN WILLIAMS DOESN'T FRET ABOUT 
BREAKING WITH SEGOVIA'S CLASSICAL TEACHINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SWED, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Classical guitarists are different from other musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is the most familiar instrument in all music, the one instrument with 
which nearly every kid these days, whatever his or her background, comes into 
physical contact, and will actually hold and pluck. Given the saturation of 
Western popular music, which is now inescapable even in the most remote corners 
of the planet, the guitar's sound has, moreover, become the dominant character 
of the global soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet classical musicians form the smallest imaginable subset of guitarists. 
Their solo repertoire is limited and apart from the standard classical 
tradition. Their own recent tradition, instead, is wrapped up in Segovia, who 
single-handedly made the guitar respectable as a classical instrument, but 
around whom a pretentious and worshipful aura of exclusivity developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least it had until John Williams came along. Williams will play two 
recitals at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena, today and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has had one of the more remarkable modern careers in music. Segovia's 
most-gifted protege, he came into international prominence in the early 1960s 
while still a teen-ager, with what seemed like the most flawless technique ever 
heard on the instrument and an exquisite tone. He played Bach with an 
unprecedented clarity; he played Spanish music with dazzling panache. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams, who was born in Australia in 1941 and moved to London at age 10, 
also rejected the Segovia model and embraced the larger guitar world along with 
the larger musical one. Not only did he expand the classical repertoire, 
transcribing pieces and playing new music, he played jazz and pop, 
experimenting with the electric guitar. He made an album in the early '70s with 
singer Cleo Laine; he formed a pop group called Sky; he jammed with the likes 
of Paul McCartney. He stopped wearing formal clothes in his classical recitals. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this made Segovia furious, Williams recalls. The guitarist, in New York 
for three recitals at the 92nd Street Y before coming to Los Angeles, says he 
has very complex feelings about Segovia, both as a historical figure and a 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very great musician and true to what he believed, but looking back, 
I think a lot of the artificiality in his personality, and the artificiality in 
his musical personality as well, were limiting factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, he held the development of the guitar back, which is ironic 
because he also created that development. He just went on too long, propagating 
his way of playing when times were changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Williams, by going about his career in his own way, has proven Segovia's 
true successor. Like Segovia, he has broadened the range of the instrument 
greatly, as can be seen in his two Ambassador programs, one devoted to Baroque 
and Spanish music (much of it in Williams' own transcriptions) and the other to 
readily accessible contemporary music (much of it written for Williams). 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Segovia, however, Williams, who is proud of his life-long involvement 
in liberal causes (he rails against the hotel laundry for putting cardboard in 
shirt collars, wasting trees like that), found that it was through social 
causes that he has often expanded his own musical horizons. It was, for 
instance, performing at benefit concerts for the African National Congress in 
the early 1970s that he met Cleo Laine. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Williams has, like Segovia, also enlarged the popular appeal of the 
instrument, again he has done so in a manner both like and most unlike his 
mentor. Following in Segovia's footsteps, Williams is a musician faithful to 
his age. But he adamantly rejects Segovia's approach, which created a 
generation of copy-cat players obsessed with fingerings and positions and other 
people's editions. As a result, he says, "guitarists are rotten sight readers 
and rotten at playing in ensembles. They can't read and they don't listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Williams will not teach solo playing. "I won't sit in front of them and 
say you should play this piece this way. Jazz players don't teach jazz like 
that." Instead, Williams feels that the only way to rectify this imbalance is 
by having students play in guitar ensembles, so that the students learn by 
interacting with other musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 He notes, moreover, just how "wonderfully well" something like a Brahms string 
sextet can sound on six guitars, an example of which is included in a film 
profile of Williams that accompanies an alluring new Sony video of Williams 
performing at the Royal Alcazar Palace in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for all his varied participation in the contemporary music scene, it is 
in the traditional solo guitar recital where Williams best captures the essence 
of the guitar. That essence, Williams says, picking up from an idea he got from 
Julian Bream, is the exploration of the guitar's most special quality, its 
ability to shape the dying away of a sound into silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a totally magical thing, as you're drawn into the sound as it 
disappears," he explains, his voice becoming almost transfixed. No other 
instrument produces the effect as thoroughly as the guitar, and it can help an 
audience feel especially intimate to the music. It is something that Williams 
says is particularly well-exploited in the newer pieces and what makes the 
contemporary program so appealing to him, and, often to their surprise, to 
audiences as well. 
</P>
<P>
 This quality of the guitar may be one of the principal reasons why guitarists 
are different. "I think it is because they have a response to that sound," 
Williams postulates. "And I think it is perhaps why I like guitarists as 
ordinary people as well."

HE TALKS THE TALK -- GAELIC, THAT IS; MOVIES: IRISH WRITER RODDY DOYLE ESCHEWS 
HOLLYWOOD AS CORRUPT, YET FINDS SUCCESS IN ADAPTING TWO OF HIS NOVELS FOR THE 
BIG SCREEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roddy Doyle stood by the window of his 12th-floor hotel room and peered 
through the hard gray afternoon light at what he assumed to be the general 
direction of Los Angeles, conjuring his mythic picture of what the city 379 
miles south looked like. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as close to L.A. as I want to get," he said. An odd sentiment, coming 
from someone who had successfully adapted his first two novels -- "The 
Commitments" and "The Snapper" -- to the screen and was at work on the 
screenplay for his third work in the Barrytown trilogy, "The Van." As is true 
with a lot of people, Los Angeles was synonymous with Hollywood, which Doyle 
considers intolerably corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an aversion to L.A.," he continued. "Maybe it's because I disagree 
with the way movies are made, the star system and all." He added cryptically: 
"I bet there are streets there with no pavements." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle was at the end of an arduous national tour to promote his Booker 
Prize-winning novel "Paddy Clark, Ha Ha Ha," and the strain showed. For two 
weeks, he had been up at 5 for crack-of-dawn radio and TV interviews, and then 
evenings of staged public readings. Now his conversation skipped like a needle 
over a cracked disc. He was tired, and homesick for his wife and two young sons 
-- mention of whom drew his gaze toward another imagined destination: Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But a sly, sotto-voce humor was irrepressibly evident as well. Doyle shares 
with his working-class Barrytown characters a chronic, low-frequency 
indignation, expressed in continuing "fancy tha' " quips and a certain piquant 
vulgarity. His motor is always running. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I've come at a great time," he said. "I've been listening all about the 
Menendez brothers, Tonya Harding, the Bobbitts." He smiled, as if to say, "What 
a circus!" 
</P>
<P>
 "We get Oprah (Winfrey) over in Ireland," he went on. "Sally Jessy Raphael 
too. Christ, you can't escape 'em. In Portland there were five of those shows 
on, all at once. I looked out the window to see if there was anyone left on the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the hours, he was hanging tough. "If Margaret Thatcher can live on 
three hours of sleep, I can survive on five." 
</P>
<P>
 At 35, Doyle occupies an unusual place in the cultural scheme of things, a 
serious novelist -- some consider him Ireland's best right now -- who doesn't 
look at screenwriting as a whore's trade. An internationalist whose roots are 
thickly entangled with the life of Northern Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 (In selling the idea for a soul band, one of the characters in "The 
Commitments" says, with touching absurdity, "The Irish are the blacks of 
Europe, the Dubliners are the blacks of Ireland, and the North Dubliners are 
the blacks of Dublin. Say it loud, 'I'm black and I'm proud.' ") 
</P>
<P>
 And after "Paddy Clark, Ha Ha Ha," a masterwork of shadowed indirection that 
shows us how being a 10-year-old is a full-time job, Doyle has been compared to 
the James Joyce of "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man." The comparison 
makes Doyle uncomfortable: "Joyce was tuned into that state of being very well. 
But there's a school of writing which, though it may be unfair to summarize 
this way, has a lot to do with writers showing us how big their brains are. 
Like Anthony Burgess, who wants to show us that he has the biggest vocabulary 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The type of writing I prefer is simple, straightforward and serves the 
characters. I like writers like Elmore Leonard, Anne Tyler, Raymond Carver and 
Richard Ford, where you tend to forget you're reading. With 'Paddy Clark,' I 
only hoped people could be conned into believing they were inside a 10- or 
11-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the very idea of setting out "to forge in the smithy of my soul the 
uncreated conscience of the race" is something that would make Doyle bolt for 
the nearest exit. He's probably closer to Anton Chekhov, the good doctor who 
bore his characters' ridiculous affectations and self-dramatized torments with 
grace and bemusement, because he knew that everyone's body eventually breaks 
down in pain and dies, and that the enemy of life isn't death, it's futility. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Chekhov, Doyle's forgiveness of just about everything and everyone 
filters into his characters. Jimmy Rabbitte Jr. can only shake his head at the 
explosive thickheadedness that tore the Commitments apart and go on polishing 
his answers to an imagined press interviewer. No sense in keeping a grudge. 
</P>
<P>
 When his sister, Sharon, gets pregnant and won't divulge the name of the 
father in "The Snapper," the Rabbitte family comically adjusts itself around 
her and the impending arrival. In "The Van," Jimmy Sr. loses his job as a 
builder and warily takes up a second career selling fish and chips from a 
refurbished lunch truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, this is not the spiteful grim-lipped Dublin of "The Lonely Passion 
of Judith Hearne," where the heavy cargo of censure shifts against the troubled 
and the weak, and a 16-year-old housemaid is thrown into the street because 
she's had the bad luck to be raped by a boarder. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Europeans rushed through to Page 80 to see Rabbitte's new adventure 
begin," Doyle said of "The Van." "Americans are more attuned to the beginning. 
A lot of the American middle class has never experienced unemployment before. I 
think the book struck a chord with this new condition they have to live with. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a generational thing too. Jimmy Sr.'s limited education hasn't prepared 
him. Jimmy Jr. is more able to cope with the world as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether anybody's education can prepare for a future in which all roads 
seem to lead through television to an electronic superhighway, Doyle replied: 
"As a writer, I think people will always enjoy the physicality of books. 
Television is aimed at the middle class, people too tired to go out. In 
Ireland, more people per capita are going out than ever before. I don't think 
many people in Lagos will be tuning into the superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle showed a small, shy grin. His mouth tends to be drawn in a certain 
unrequited fastidiousness, but the voice is soft, full of small melodious 
surges and drops. His eyes float suspiciously behind thick spectacle lenses, 
like pale aquarium creatures. He wears a small golden earring in his left 
earlobe, and his black hair is shoe-brush stiff on one side, a tribute to 
Dublin's cold, steady winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many writers who, with great justification, figure they can kiss their 
work goodby once it gets sausaged in movie or TV development, Doyle believes 
his characters can weather the change from page to screen. 
</P>
<P>
 For openers, they have language. To lose one's temper is to "throw a wobbler." 
To make a girl pregnant is to "send her up the pole." If someone insults your 
friends, he's "slaggin' yer shower." And they're delivered with comic 
succinctness, as in this living room scene from "The Snapper": 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What's perception?" Sharon asked.  
</P>
<P>
 "Wha?"  
</P>
<P>
 "What's perception?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Sweat," Jimmy Sr. told her. "Why?"  
</P>
<P>
 Sharon whispered to Jimmy Sr.:  
</P>
<P>
 "It says my perception might be heightened when I'm pregnant."  
</P>
<P>
 "Yeh smell all right from over here, love," said Jimmy Sr. He leaned over.  
</P>
<P>
 "Wha's the buke about?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Pregnancy."  
</P>
<P>
 "Jaysis, d'yuh need a buke to be pregnant these days?"  
</P>

 "In most working-class cultures you'll find a contempt for the Queen's 
English," Doyle said. "In Ireland you get a creative use of language because of 
the class divisions, and also because English was superimposed on Gaelic, which 
has its own symbols and phrases."  
</P>
<P>
 At first Doyle didn't think he'd write a screenplay, but after director Alan 
Parker became interested in "The Commitments" (which Doyle had published at his 
own expense), he realized he was more than halfway there. What was true of "The 
Commitments" was true of the entire Barrytown trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were written mostly through dialogue, the plots were simple, and there 
were no chapter divisions. Just breaks instead." 
</P>
<P>
 And Doyle is of a generation that grew up with the movies: "I went a lot as a 
kid. 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' really scared me. I hid under the seat. 
I was remembering 'The Vikings' when I wrote 'Paddy Clark.' It was a trashy 
film, with Tony Curtis and Kirk Douglas. But brilliant." (Doyle and his 
characters like to use brilliant as an all-purpose term of appreciation.) 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of the stuff we watched was British and American. The British was for 
the head, and the American was for entertainment. We sat around the telly and 
believed everything we saw. We weren't into criticizing everything then. There 
was a certain atmosphere of belief you don't have anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle is Dublin born. His father is a printer-compositor, and after their four 
children (two brothers, two sisters) grew up, Doyle's mother went to work as a 
solicitor's secretary. Doyle majored in English and geography at University 
College in Dublin and then went into teaching, which, after some early 
misgivings, he loved ("The spirit of the children, their humor, their sheer 
differences -- I'd never experienced anything like it"). 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't begin writing for three years, and then only because he had time on 
his hands during a summer break when all his friends were working. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took years to get the self-consciousness out of my system," he recalled. 
"My first book was called 'Your Granny's a Hunger Striker.' It went bloody 
downhill after the title." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle's students inspired "The Commitments"; he wanted to write something that 
would reflect their ebullience. Shortly after finishing the book, he wrote a 
couple of plays for a Dublin theater group. One was called "Brownbread" and 
dealt with three young thugs who kidnap a bishop. The other was called "War" 
and focused on a popular pub game in which large groups of people compete in 
quiz games. Neither play lived long, which only confirmed Doyle's suspicion 
that he wasn't a natural playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 The movies, which Doyle considers "a halfway house between novels and the 
stage," are another matter. Besides, he wanted to protect as much of his work 
for as long as he could, fearing, for example, that "The Commitments" might 
turn up someday as a vehicle for Michael J. Fox. "The Snapper," directed by 
Stephen Frears, aired on the BBC last April before it was released as a feature 
film in the United States. The Beeb's smaller budget for "The Snapper" ($2 
million, as opposed to $20 million for "The Commitments") meant that it 
wouldn't be overrun by industry heavy-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with American movies is that Hollywood always underestimates the 
audience's intelligence," Doyle said. "The studio system is inherently corrupt. 
Say you want to do a good film about a bad man. You need a $6-million actor to 
sell it. But the $6-million actor decides he wants to make the bad man a 
charming bad man. Then he decides he wants to change the ending, because he 
doesn't want to hurt his image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think agents have too much power in Hollywood. They want to package three 
stars, seven co-stars, a writer and a director -- all clients, of course. Some 
people can thrive in that environment, like Steven Spielberg and Alan Parker. 
But too often you get the 'Oscar-winning performance.' It's good for Al Pacino, 
but all the ingredients aren't there. And it's too bloody expensive as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle has formed his own production company, called Deadly Films. For "The 
Van," which he is co-producing with partner Lynda Myles, he favors the approach 
of directors like Bernardo Bertolucci, who draw their funding from sources in 
different countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever we do, I like us to be doing it," Doyle said. "It wouldn't be 'on' 
for two working-class men in Dublin with a fish-and-chips van to wind up being 
played by Mel Gibson and Kevin Costner." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Frears expects that he'll soon be back in the Doyle fold. "I'll 
probably direct 'The Van,' " he said on the telephone from London. "We'll do it 
this time as a feature film. When I was sent the script for 'The Snapper,' I 
jumped on it right away. Roddy's a deceptive writer. On the surface the work 
seems simple, but it's really very sophisticated, and very funny. He creates an 
entire world. He's the only Irish writer I know of who's actually read by the 
kids he writes about in Dublin. You don't see them walking around with 
'Ulysses.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle still feels too close to "Paddy Clark" to think of making a film of it 
just yet. Besides, its meandering density makes it less amenable to a movie 
script than the Barrytown trilogy (though a spokesman reports that virtually 
every major independent production company in England and the United States is 
interested). 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle is at work, however, on a new script for the BBC called "The Family," 
which deals with a familial breakup as seen through the eyes of its four 
members. The four-episode series, filmed in Ireland and using an Elvis Costello 
soundtrack, airs May 8.  
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be the Rabbittes," said Doyle. "There are no more Rabbittes. I've 
eaten them."

 BIG LOSS: Walter Lantz, the animator who gave us "Woody Woodpecker," died 
Tuesday (A1), and one place he'll surely be missed is CalArts in Valencia. Last 
year, Lantz established an annual scholarship and $10,000 prize for students in 
the character animation program. . . . "CalArts and animation, as a whole, has 
lost a very dear friend," said a school official. 
</P>
<P>
 HOME LOONS: Warner Bros., you operate 56 stores in the United States and six 
in Great Britain. What will you do next? Go to home shopping, of course. That's 
right. . . . The folks in Burbank who sell Daffy Duck hats and Tweety Pie 
T-shirts will be doing their hawking on cable for two hours on the last 
Saturday of each month, starting this week. 
</P>
<P>
 PLAY THE BEST: Like Notre Dame in football, the CSUN baseball team doesn't 
just play softies on its schedule. . . . Already this season, the Matadors 
(15-13), who lost 5-4 to powerful Cal State Long Beach Tuesday afternoon 
(above), have faced highly ranked opponents such as Ohio State, Oklahoma State, 
Cal State Fullerton and USC. (C8) 
</P>
<P>
 TOPANGA'S MESSENGER: His first job was digging ditches. In recent months, he 
was back in the trenches again, this time fighting against the controversial 
Canyon Oaks development plan. He's Colin Penno, editor of the bi-weekly in 
town, the Messenger. . . . Penno, a native of England, came to Topanga in the 
early 1970s, and knew right away this is where he belonged. "Topanga's a place 
where you can still smell the earth." (B2)

 NO CODE SEVEN: OK, so we're getting another area code -- 562 -- in two years 
(A1). That's still no reason for us to panic. In fact, Pacific Bell tells us 
the Valley is going to have 818 to kick around "well into the next century.". . 
. Since area codes started in 1947, there's been only one major switch in the 
Valley, when we went from 213 to 818 in 1984. Michael Arkush

SUPERVISORS OKS RECORDER EMPLOYEE'S TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved the transfer of Orange County 
Recorder Office employee Nancy L. Smith, whose workplace relationship with the 
agency's elected head was among the disruptive situations that led to an 
intense investigation of the office's management. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who had been a manager in Recorder Lee A. Branch's office, will be 
reassigned to the Community Services Agency.The move is meant to separate Smith 
from Branch, who had come under fire for their relationship, along with 
allegations of other office improprieties, including sexual harassment and 
gross mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing, declined to comment 
Tuesday on the board's action. Smith could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
Smith's new job will include similar duties, working with records management, 
said Bill Baker, director of the Community Services Agency. She will receive 
the same pay. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the county Personnel Department said the relationship between 
Branch and Smith, and the alleged favored treatment she received from him, 
created such a hostile environment that at least nine employees sought medical 
care or counseling for stress and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 The board in January took the unprecedented step of censuring Branch, whose 
job overseeing real estate and loan transactions had been among the most 
obscure of the county's elected posts. The board has no direct control over 
Branch, who has held his post since 1979 and has said he will seek reelection 
in June. The district attorney's office and the Orange County Grand Jury are 
conducting an investigation to decide if the misconduct charges warrant 
Branch's removal from office.

MAYOR DALY SCRAMBLING TO KEEP TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly, in his efforts to keep the Rams from leaving the city, has 
talked to several sports management companies to learn how stadiums nationwide 
are being operated. 
</P>
<P>
 At his own expense, Daly also will attend a U.S. Conference of Mayors workshop 
this week in Florida on how cities are dealing with the demands of their 
professional sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to gather information on what is going on in the world of 
professional sports," Daly said. The Rams are threatening to leave Anaheim 
Stadium after the 1994 football season and move out of the state, saying their 
deal at the city-owned stadium costs them more than most other NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
 One company Daly has spoken to is Spectacor, which manages several sports 
facilities nationwide, including the Los Angeles Coliseum and Sports Arena. 
City Hall sources had said Daly was talking to the company about managing a 
stadium built specifically for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those conversations (with Spectacor) are not directly related to the Rams," 
Daly said. "They have been general discussions about trends in facility 
financing and sports facility design." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said he is also trying to learn whether Anaheim Stadium will remain 
economically viable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard experts say our stadium is financially obsolete," Daly said. 
"I'm talking to other experts to see if this is true." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said that at the mayors' convention he will be asked to discuss the 
financing of the $108-million Anaheim Arena, which was built primarily with 
private funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's considered the model for sports financing," Daly said.

PAIR ARRESTED IN ASSAULT, CAR THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A man resisting a car thief was pistol-whipped Tuesday, which left him bruised 
but still able to identify two suspects 20 minutes later when police arrested 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Salcedo of Huntington Beach told police he saw a man and woman trying 
to steal his 1979 Chevrolet Caprice in the 7500 block of Slater Avenue at about 
1:50 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When he confronted them, the man struck Salcedo in the head with a pistol and 
fled in Salcedo's car with the woman, Sgt. Dennis Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police chased the car north on the San Diego Freeway, stopping it at the 
junction with the Garden Grove Freeway in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the suspects as Marcus Barnhardt, 24, of Long Beach, and 
Mirian Daugherty, 34, of Bellflower. They were arrested on suspicion of 
robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and grand theft auto, and were being held 
at Huntington Beach Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 Salcedo was not seriously injured, Martin said, and identified the two 
suspects.

PAROLEE IS O.C.'S FIRST '3 STRIKES' DEFENDANT; CRIME: SANTA ANA RESIDENT, 
ACCUSED IN SHOOTING AT BAR, HAS PRIOR CONVICTIONS ON ROBBERY AND ASSAULT 
CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A parolee with a history of violence earned the dubious distinction Tuesday as 
the first Orange County defendant charged under the new "three strikes" law 
that sends repeat offenders away for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Veliz Rodriguez, 30, of Santa Ana, is scheduled to be arraigned today in 
West Orange County Municipal Court on assault and weapon charges. He is accused 
of shooting a Garden Grove man in the face with a flare gun after a barroom 
dispute Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who has prior convictions on charges of felony assault with intent 
to commit murder and second-degree robbery, faces a sentence of 25 years to 
life in prison if convicted of the new charges. Rodriguez also has prior 
convictions on misdemeanor driving violations including drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "This individual will be out of the game for a number of innings," said Orange 
County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, who said the law is designed for repeat 
offenders such as Rodriguez. "Certainly by having this person off the streets, 
it will be a step toward making it a safer county." 
</P>
<P>
 While facing the prospect of life in prison, Rodriguez unwittingly finds 
himself at the center of a heated debate over the new measure signed into law 
earlier this month by Gov. Pete Wilson. Orange County officials say they are 
gearing up for increased criminal trials for felony defendants who fear 
entering a guilty plea will add another strike to their record. 
</P>
<P>
 And Presiding Orange County Superior Court Judge James L. Smith said he has 
prepared a contingency plan if the system is flooded with criminal trials. The 
casualty will be civil trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "If need be, we will have to shut down civil operations," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 All sides agree that the full brunt of the new law is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 What's certain is this: Before the "three-strikes" measure, Rodriguez would 
have faced a maximum of 14 years in prison if convicted, and would probably 
have served only half that term with credit for work and good behavior. If 
convicted under the new law, Rodriquez must serve at least 20 years in prison 
before becoming eligible for parole, Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Described as the toughest and most sweeping criminal sentencing law in state 
history, the measure mandates a prison sentence of 25 years to life or three 
times the sentence for a third felony conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also increases prison time that must be served for first- and 
second-time felony offenders who in the past have gained release after serving 
only half their sentences for felony convictions. An especially controversial 
aspect of the new law is its application to juveniles as young as 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the law will put repeat offenders behind bars, protecting the 
public from the crimes they would have committed while on the street. The 
measure has widespread support among law enforcement officials and a public 
sickened by tales of repeat offenders released from prison only to kill again. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the law is a foolhardy measure that will cost the taxpayers 
millions and clog the court system with defendants who formerly would have plea 
bargained but will now go to trial when charged with a third felony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a stunning piece of stupidity," said Assistant Public Defender Michael 
Giannini, who said the law is too far-reaching and lumps youthful offenders and 
nonviolent felons in the same category as murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider has given Orange County agencies 
-- including the public defender and district attorney -- 30 days to document 
how the law may impact their departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's clear you will have people who will refuse to plead guilty and 
will demand trials," Schneider said Tuesday, "so that means more courtrooms, 
judges, prosecutors, public defenders, investigators. It has the potential to 
affect us across the board, so we're trying to take a heads-up on this and 
figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Others question whether the measure will be a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think deterrence only works with respect to getting caught, not to the 
possible punishment," said Prof. Jack Luellen, who teaches criminal law and 
procedure at Western State University College of Law in Fullerton. "But the 
mood in the state at the moment, and the country, is certainly anti-crime. 
People are demanding that something be done." 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Rodriguez's first brush with the law took place in 
November, 1979, when he was 16 and faced adult charges. After a defense 
attorney raised questions about his mental capacity, Rodriquez pleaded guilty 
to felony assault with intent to commit murder and use of a knife in June, 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 He escaped a prison term, however, and was instead sentenced to seven years in 
the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 His second strike came in November, 1990, when he and two co-defendants 
attacked a man and stole his wallet. He pleaded guilty to second-degree felony 
robbery and was sentenced to two years in prison, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 According to law enforcement officials, Rodriquez -- who also has prior 
misdemeanor convictions for drunk driving and hit-and-run driving -- walked up 
to the plate Sunday, swung and missed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was at Sugars, a Garden Grove bar, when he got into an argument and 
was asked to leave because of drunkenness and disorderly conduct, officials 
said. He returned carrying a flare pistol, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a scuffle, he shot Donald Moore of Garden Grove in the face -- 
grazing Moore's cheek, according to Investigator Mike Bedard, who said Moore is 
recovering from his wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Rodriquez was subdued by patrons and held until officers arrived. 
He is charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a 
firearm as an ex-felon. He is being held in Orange County Jail and has not yet 
retained counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear what the impact of the Rodriguez case and future "three 
strikes" cases will be. But defense attorneys were predicting appeals and 
challenges to the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people who have committed three violent crimes have probably 
forfeited their right to live in society," Giannini said. "But you have a 
situation here where someone who maybe did some stupid things as a youth, but 
has led a crime-free life for 20 years, could suddenly face life in prison for 
writing a bad check," he said.

NEW AREA CODE COMING TO SOME IN NORTH O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new area code is coming to Southern California, but this one has a twist. 
</P>
<P>
 Local phone companies announced Tuesday that they are going to expand service 
in the 310, 818 and 213 areas by adding an "overlay" area code. The change may 
prove a bit confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in March, 1996, the new area code -- 562 -- will be stacked on top 
of the three existing codes in northernmost Orange County, including all of 
Seal Beach and in Los Angeles County, company officials said. Once that 
happens, knowing where someone is won't guarantee being able to figure out 
their area code. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell and GTE California will start with new and existing cellular 
phones and pagers, which tend to move around a lot anyhow. But after that, 
probably around the turn of the century, 562 will also apply to some regular 
"land-line" phones, the kind that tend to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Murray, a spokesman for GTE, said that to minimize confusion, the 562 
land lines will be restricted mostly to pay phones and data-transmission 
equipment, at least initially. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say New Yorkers weren't confused when an overlay code was introduced 
there in 1992, and we won't be either. The new area code will allow phone 
companies to keep up with the increasing demand for phones without having to 
change the area codes for most existing customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overlay codes could not have come at a better time for number-hungry Southern 
California," said Pac Bell Vice President Gene Sherman. "They make it possible 
to keep up with the demand for new telephone numbers and new technologies." 
</P>
<P>
 The change will make Southern California one of only four places in the 
country to have an area code without a middle digit of 0 or 1. The others -- in 
Alabama, Washington state and Arizona -- will go into service next year. 
</P>
<P>
 As originally set up, the 0 or 1 in the middle of a three-digit area code 
signaled telephone switching equipment that the number was an area code and not 
the first three digits of a local phone number. But such area codes limited the 
total phone numbers in the United States to about 1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction of an 11th digit for long-distance calls -- a "1" preceding 
the three-digit area codes and the seven-digit local numbers -- made possible 
the use of a wider variety of area code combinations. That change eventually 
will permit a total of about 5 billion phone numbers in the United States, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Marcus, a spokesman for NYNEX, the telephone company that serves New 
York state and all of New England except Connecticut, said an overlay code of 
917 was introduced in New York City a couple of years ago in areas previously 
reached only through 212 or 718. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus said that, like here, the service was introduced initially for cellular 
phones and pagers. He said the only land lines now using 917 are telephone 
company phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers have reacted to it very well," he said. "We kind of phased it 
in, and people have understood the need for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus conceded that "it can be confusing if an area code isn't tied to a 
specific geographic area." But he said that since the overlay code applies to 
only two area codes in New York City, and all public use currently is 
restricted to cellular phones and pagers, "there has been no confusion." 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction of the overlay in the Southland will be far less disruptive 
than the creation of a new, geographically exclusive code, Sherman said. The 
creation of the 310 and 909 area codes in the past three years forced more than 
4.2 million business and residential customers in Southern California to change 
codes. By comparison, he said, about 480,000 cellular and paging customers will 
change codes with the introduction of the 562 overlay. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE and Pac Bell say they will ask local cellular and paging companies to 
adopt one or more of the following methods to help reduce the demand for new 
phone numbers in the fast-growing 310 area: 
</P>
<P>
 * Assign cellular and paging customers to other than the 310 area code if they 
initiate service before the 562 code is introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 * Move some existing cellular and paging customers to 562 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 * Move at least half the prefixes assigned to existing 310 cellular and paging 
customers to 562 starting in May, 1996. A prefix is the first three digits of a 
seven-digit local phone number. Each prefix typically accommodates about 10,000 
phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray said the changes are not expected to cause phone book problems because 
cellular phones and pagers are seldom listed. 
</P>
<P>
 As for numerologists, satanists and others who worry about such things, Murray 
said that, yes, he's aware that 5, 6 and 2 add up to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least the new code's not 666," he said.

FED ACTS TO HIKE INTEREST RATES; ECONOMY: CENTRAL BANK'S MOVE IS ITS SECOND 
ATTACK ON INFLATION IN TWO MONTHS. ANALYSTS PRAISE ACTION TO EASE RAPID GROWTH 
BUT CRITICS FEAR A DISRUPTION IN RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In its second preemptive strike against inflation in two months, the Federal 
Reserve moved Tuesday to raise short-term interest rates by another one-quarter 
of a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many analysts hailed the move as prudent at a time of rapid economic 
growth nationally, critics, including some economic policy-makers in the 
Clinton Administration, worry that the independent central bank's preoccupation 
with the possibility of rising prices will disrupt the national economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market, which fell 96 points when the Fed last raised rates on Feb. 
4, took the latest increase in stride, with the Dow Jones industrial average 
falling only 2.3 points. And long-term interest rates, which rise when 
investors fear future inflation, fell by a substantial one-tenth of a 
percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's action, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise 
its benchmark federal funds rate to 3.5% from 3.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan did not mention the size of the 
increase when he announced that the Fed's policy-making committee had decided 
in closed session to nudge rates up. 
</P>
<P>
 But the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, 
immediately moved to 3.5% in financial markets. The Fed has effective power to 
fix this rate by adding or withdrawing cash from the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's rate hike had been widely anticipated by Wall Street, where analysts 
believe that Fed officials are determined to maintain a tight stranglehold on 
inflation before it gets out of hand as the economy revives in 1994. In fact, 
most analysts now predict that the Fed will continue to raise rates throughout 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this was just Step 2 in what I think could be a six-step process of 
quarter-point rate hikes over the next year or so," said David Wyss, an 
economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass.-based economic forecasting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists now expect the Fed to raise the federal funds rate by another 
full percentage point, to 4.5%, by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts believe the rapid pace of economic growth at the end of 1993 and the 
beginning of 1994 has convinced the central bank that it must act now to head 
off rising prices. In the fourth quarter of last year, the nation's economy 
grew by 7.5%, the fastest quarterly pace in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed is trying to stay ahead of the curve on inflation," noted Stanford 
economist Michael J. Boskin, former chief White House economist in the George 
Bush Administration. "I think the Fed is on the right course. If the Fed 
doesn't act now, it will have to catch up later with much bigger and more 
sudden interest rate hikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street seemed especially happy that the Fed moved aggressively even after 
Greenspan met privately with President Clinton and his economic advisers last 
Friday. Speculation had been swirling around Wall Street that the White House 
was trying to pressure Greenspan not to approve another rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 However, while Wyss and other economists believe the Fed's actions so far have 
not endangered the recovery, they warn that continued rate hikes could result 
in a slowdown in 1995. DRI-McGraw Hill, for example, now predicts the economy 
will grow by about 4% this year but only by about 2% in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The slowdown we see in 1995 is because we see higher rates coming," said 
Wyss. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials declined to criticize the Fed's latest decision publicly 
except to say that they saw no signs of a resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, officials were less supportive of the Fed's actions than they 
were following the first rate hike in February. To calm the financial markets, 
the White House at that time explicitly sought to play down its differences 
with the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a very close call," over whether the Fed should have acted 
now, said one senior Administration official. "There was not an overwhelming 
case to be made either way on this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's decision to announce the rate increase publicly, as he did with 
the last rate increase on Feb. 4, was uncharacteristic. Greenspan's new 
willingness to reveal Fed rate changes comes at a time when the central bank is 
under increasing pressure from Congress to disclose its policy actions promptly 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) is determined to 
force the Fed not only to disclose its actions to the public but also to submit 
to his proposal to limit its autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is sponsoring legislation requiring that the presidents of the Fed's 
12 regional banks be appointed by the President. Their role in monetary 
policy-making is significant because five of them serve on a rotating basis on 
the Federal Open Market Committee, which makes key decisions about interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the seven members of the Fed's board of governors, who also sit on the 
Open Market Committee, the regional bank presidents are not presidential 
appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has two vacancies to fill on the Fed's board of governors, giving him 
an opportunity to put his own allies inside the Fed for the first time since 
his election. He has already approved the nomination of White House economist 
Alan Blinder to become Fed vice chairman, but he has not selected a candidate 
to fill the second vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration sources said they hoped to have Blinder in place at the Fed in 
time for the Fed's next Open Market Committee meeting. That could mean that 
Tuesday's session was the last in which the Administration did not have a 
voice.

EX-JUDGE HALE PLEADS GUILTY OVER ARKANSAS LOAN FRAUD; INQUIRY: POLITICAL 
INSIDER AGREES TO COOPERATE WITH WHITEWATER SPECIAL COUNSEL. FISKE CALLS STEP 
'SIGNIFICANT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM C. REMPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Municipal Judge David Hale, an Arkansas political insider who claims 
that then-Gov. Bill Clinton pressed him to make improper government-subsidized 
loans in the mid-1980s, pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges Tuesday and 
agreed to cooperate with Whitewater investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr., who has called Hale's allegations 
"fundamental" to his Whitewater inquiry, told U.S. District Judge Stephen M. 
Reasoner that Hale's cooperation assured that the claims "will be pursued 
thoroughly and vigorously." 
</P>
<P>
 The plea and cooperation agreement, which came the day before selection of a 
new grand jury panel, represents the first major development in Fiske's young 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement outside the courtroom, Fiske said Hale's cooperation 
"will be a significant contribution to our investigation." Rusty Hardin, 
Fiske's assistant, said that Hale, 56, had "extensive knowledge in the areas we 
are investigating." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, reached after more than two weeks of daily private meetings 
between Hale and prosecutors, also seemed to add a measure of credibility to 
Hale's so-far uncorroborated story. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale's accounts certainly represent the most serious allegations raised 
against the President. If proven, they could link Clinton to potentially 
criminal conduct -- at worst, allegedly using his influence to get federal 
funds channeled improperly into loans or investments that benefited Clinton 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has repeatedly denied Hale's charges and this week called them "a 
bunch of bull." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale has told much of his story in lengthy interviews with The Times and other 
news organizations since his indictment in September. On Tuesday, however, his 
attorney said that Hale had already provided prosecutors with "a lot more 
detail" than he had revealed to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are additional transactions that have not come out involving some of 
the same people and others," attorney Randy Coleman said. He declined to say 
whether any of those transactions involved Clinton or First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to Hale's story, as publicly disclosed to date, is the allegation that 
in late 1985 and again around February, 1986, Clinton asked him to make loans 
to James B. McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater resort 
development in the Ozarks. According to Hale, Clinton asked him to "help Jim 
and me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale at the time operated a Small Business Administration-backed fund called 
Capital Management Services Inc. Its purpose was to make venture loans to 
socially and economically disadvantaged borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Clinton's request, Hale has said, he made a series of loans 
totaling $700,000 to members of the Arkansas "political family." The loan 
applications, according to Hale, were prepared and referred to him by McDougal, 
then the owner of the failing Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. None of the 
$700,000 was ever paid back. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of the loans -- $300,000 -- was made to McDougal's then-wife, 
Susan, and records show that the check was cashed at Madison Guaranty. Hale 
concedes that the loan violated SBA rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale also says Clinton specifically objected to having his own name appear on 
any official documents, and so the loan was made in the name of Mrs. McDougal. 
According to the former judge, Clinton nonetheless offered to put up as 
collateral some raw land in the Ozarks, an offer that Hale declined. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal denies that any such meeting or discussion ever took place. The White 
House has said that Clinton cannot recall asking Hale to make any loans. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal does concede that $110,000 of the funds borrowed from Hale were 
transferred into the Whitewater account of the Clinton-McDougal partnership and 
used to purchase land for another land venture outside Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 In a previous interview, McDougal said he made the investment without 
consulting the Clintons. He said his intention was to try to bail out 
Whitewater by starting a successful development elsewhere. However, the new 
development failed and the land was repossessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske, who is trying to determine if funds from Madison Guaranty were 
illegally diverted to prominent Arkansans, including the Clintons, bluntly 
acknowledged Tuesday that "of course we're interested" in the Susan McDougal 
loan and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Hale's allegations, the special counsel is examining the 
dealings of the Whitewater Development Corp., its ties to Madison Guaranty, 
last July's apparent suicide of Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster and a 
series of contacts between the White House and Treasury Department regarding 
the Madison inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the plea agreement disclosed Tuesday, Hale still faces the 
possibility of up to 10 years in prison and fines exceeding $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing was delayed for at least four months to permit Fiske to complete 
the Hale-related portions of his investigation. At that time, government 
attorneys agreed, they will recommend judicial leniency if Hale's cooperation 
merits it. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Coleman, who stood beside Hale as he entered his guilty 
pleas, said: "This is a painful and embarrassing day for David, as I think it 
is for the state of Arkansas." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman has said for weeks that Hale was practicing "business as usual" in 
Arkansas when, by his account, he provided funds to Arkansas' political elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last fall Hale and Coleman have been calling for a special prosecutor 
because the local U.S. attorney was a longtime Clinton campaign supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous efforts to negotiate a plea agreement also had failed until the Fiske 
team moved into Little Rock earlier this year. Coleman said that Hale trusted 
Fiske and his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "David believes that they will fully investigate . . . " he said. "Otherwise, 
we would not have done this today."

HERO ROLE IN RIOTS PUSHES ACTOR ONTO A LARGER STAGE; HUMAN RELATIONS: 'I CAN'T 
BE A BYSTANDER ANYMORE,' SAYS GREGORY ALAN-WILLIAMS. HE WRITES OF LIFE-JOLTING 
CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Los Angeles during the riots two years ago, he saved a Japanese American 
man from being beaten to death. In New York last month, on tour to promote his 
book about those moments, he saved a hotel bellman -- mostly from the bellman's 
own worst impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't be a bystander anymore," said Gregory Alan-Williams, explaining why 
he invited the black bellman, spouting anti-Semitic theories on the cause of 
the Holocaust, into his hotel room for a chat. "He was a very smart man who was 
a bellman -- that was part of his frustration. He was looking for a scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan-Williams is a professional actor who walked into the real world during 
the riots and finds he cannot go back. Everything in his life has changed since 
he waded into the violence of Florence and Normandie -- a black man acting 
"under cover of darkness," he quips -- to rescue the badly beaten Takao Hirata 
from an angry mob. He dragged the dazed and profusely bleeding man on an almost 
Biblical trek from front lawn to front lawn, seeking refuge and being turned 
away by residents gripped with fear or anger. After trusting a concerned 
motorist to take Hirata to a hospital, Alan-Williams emerged from the 
intersection a hero whose life was jolted out of its routine. 
</P>
<P>
 His two-year marriage dissolved. He even parted ways -- amicably -- with his 
talent agency. But his biggest metamorphosis was into book author. He secretly 
toiled at his word processor during the filming of "In the Line of Fire," in 
which he played one of Clint Eastwood's fellow Secret Service agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Gathering of Heroes -- Reflections on Rage and Responsibility" (Academy 
Chicago Publishers) exhaustively covers Alan-Williams' day at Florence and 
Normandie (there's even a map of his movements in the intersection), but more 
important, it chronicles the people -- the "heroes" of the title -- and events 
of his own past that compelled him to be more than a bystander at the 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 In the slender book, Alan-Williams, who still keeps in occasional phone 
contact with Hirata, recalls being victim and victimizer. He talks about being 
a young black boy in a predominantly white Des Moines, Iowa, junior high 
school, the kid who got whacked in the face after band practice while the other 
kids stood around and laughed. He also recalls himself as a young Marine 
recruit who joined others in his platoon in a brutal nighttime assault on a 
fellow Marine they considered inept and disgraceful. 
</P>
<P>
 That image haunted him as he drove toward the riot flash point, drawn by radio 
accounts of violence: 
</P>
<P>
 Those who beat Rodney King, those who battered the people at Florence and 
Normandie, and those like me who participated in the beating of Private Ladieu 
-- we had all abandoned principle and decency in the self-serving name of order 
and justice.  
</P>
<P>
 Even his sense of his vocation has changed since that day. In the wake of the 
book, now trickling into stores, he has found a new calling as a public 
speaker. Whether he is talking at a Catholic high school in Chicago or a 
community forum in Pasadena, where two dozen people showed up at small 
bookstore for an informal Saturday night chat with the author, he is blissfully 
in his element. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk about myself as a victim of intolerance and violence, as perpetrator, 
as bystander, and as rescuer," says Alan-Williams, whose sonorous voice has won 
him lucrative voice-over work and made it easy to write a one-man theatrical 
show for himself, "The Life and Times of Deacon A. L. Wiley." He plays a 
turn-of-the-century former slave sharing his life experiences and talking about 
taking control of his own destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes his living playing a beach cop on "Baywatch," the syndicated 
television show. It offers a pleasant working environment -- the beach -- but 
it's not about him; it's about blond girls and David Hasselhoff. Few of 
Alan-Williams' acting roles so far have fulfilled him. "You do it, you see it, 
and there's nothing left," he says. "It leaves you very empty. That's why all 
this other (book tour) work is very welcome. . . . You can address issues." 
</P>
<P>
 He sits in the den of his rented Hollywood hillside apartment, the drone of 
the freeway coming through the open patio doors. At 37, he is considering 
moving back to his home state of Iowa for the summer and commuting for acting 
jobs or speaking engagements. ("I never liked L.A.," he says. "It's a pit.") 
</P>
<P>
 The accolades have not erased nagging problems: Financial difficulties caused 
him to fall behind in support payments to three children by two different 
women. He struggles to pay the money back and uses the experience of unwed 
fatherhood in his speeches as a cautionary tale. ("I talk to young black men 
about this all the time.") His divorce is bitter. His estranged wife, B. 
Sylestine Williams, a hairdresser, doubts his selflessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He saved Tak Hirata's life. I'm OK with that," she says, but "he went there 
for his own self-aggrandizement." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan-Williams' former talent agency didn't see how his need to travel as a 
speaker dovetailed with its need to have him auditioning in L.A. The speaking 
trips also strained his marriage. "I was away a lot, and I couldn't always 
bring my wife. I think there was a lot of fear. She saw me moving beyond. . . . 
As you can probably tell from the book, we're very different people." 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, he recounts arriving home after the riots, covered in Hirata's 
blood, and his wife's observing his cut finger and his bedraggled condition: 
</P>
<P>
 She took my hand in her lap. "Is that his blood on you?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah."  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you think you oughta get checked?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Checked? For what?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Hepatitis . . . HIV."  
</P>
<P>
 . . . Syleste and I argued back and forth for a while. I told her that her 
concerns were cynical and ridiculous. She was getting on my nerves. "Do you 
think God would let me get away with what I got away with out there and then 
let me get AIDS!" I yelled.  
</P>
<P>
 Legions of publishers turned down his manuscript. And the small company that 
did pick it up found some bookstores uninterested, particularly in riot-weary 
Los Angeles. For one thing, the author's interpretations did not seem 
politically correct to those who viewed the riots as a righteous rebellion, 
years in the making. 
</P>
<P>
 By the second day of the Los Angeles Riots, I was absolutely livid with rage. 
I had witnessed firsthand . . . the consequences of intolerance and unchecked 
anger. Yet folks were running around screaming about uprisings and revolutions 
-- seemingly unable or unwilling to make distinctions between legitimate 
protests against systemic injustice, and terrorism.  
</P>
<P>
 His publisher sent him on a book tour that largely skipped Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the vibe that people think it was a revolution and a good thing," said 
Paul Bennett, the publisher's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan-Williams shrugged it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Paul early on, 'First of all, don't nobody want to hear about them 
riots,' " he said. "And secondly, everybody writes a book. This is a very 
cynical town." 
</P>
<P>
 Esowon, one of the city's most prominent African American bookstores, declined 
to carry the book. "When I read the little synopsis, it just didn't sound very 
interesting," says co-owner James Fugate. He added wearily, "The local authors 
always feel the local bookstore should sell their book." 
</P>
<P>
 Midnight Special, a Santa Monica store specializing in political social 
science, agreed to a book-signing only after Bennett pleaded with them. ("I was 
desperate," he recalls.) In the end, Alan-Williams had to cancel -- he was 
filming an episode of "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of reservations about whether we would get folks to it if we 
did," says Cynthia Cuza of Midnight Special. "I think he misses the point. . . 
. The folks that were at the intersection of Florence and Normandie have had 
years of legitimate complaints and it was a spontaneous uprising." 
</P>
<P>
 But she relented, she says, because "part of what we do is give first-time 
authors an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Other stores had no problem with the book. The Black and Latino Multicultural 
Center in Pasadena held a book-signing. Book Soup ordered 10 copies. So did 
Dutton's in Brentwood. Crown Books bought 250 to spread around its 68 L.A.-area 
stores. "I did read the book, I loved it," said Miriam Bass, Crown's assistant 
vice president for merchandising on the West Coast. "I moved here when I was 7. 
I love reading about the city, problems and all." 
</P>
<P>
 When Alan-Williams speaks, he doesn't mince words preaching self-discipline 
and control of one's own destiny. His listeners can be just as blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why," one disgruntled black man wrote after Alan-Williams gave a talk in 
Brookline, Mass., at the invitation of a human relations group, "do you keep 
bringing in these Uncle Clarence Thom-as niggers?" 
</P>
<P>
 That hurt, Alan-Williams said. "My question to him would be, 'Why didn't you 
say that when I was there? I invited dialogue. Why are you such a punk that you 
won't even write the letter to me? You write it to the white people.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During the Reginald O. Denny beating trial, Alan-Williams was asked on the 
witness stand to identify Damian Williams, later convicted of attacking Denny, 
as one of Takao Hirata's assailants. He couldn't. In the madness, he said, he 
had never had a good look at any of the suspects' faces. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was on the stand, Damian Williams winked at him. 
</P>
<P>
 He winked back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been wanting to make a connection with Mr. Williams," he says. "We were 
kept so separate. In the public eye, in the eye of the prosecution, these were 
monsters and I was a hero. They wanted to cut me off. And this is what black 
folks suspect about my book -- they don't think I understand that this is how 
people are separated from one another: You are good. They are bad. We love you. 
We don't love them. I love them. And I love Hirata. Because I love Hirata 
doesn't mean I have to stop loving them."

 Local phone companies announced Tuesday that they are going to expand service 
by adding an "overlay" area code. The change may prove a bit confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in March, 1996, a new area code -- 562 -- will be stacked on top of 
the existing codes in Los Angeles County and a slice of northern Orange County, 
company officials said. Once that happens, knowing where someone is won't 
guarantee being able to figure out their area code. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell and GTE California will start with new and existing cellular 
phones and pagers, which tend to move around a lot anyhow. But after that, 
probably around the turn of the century, 562 will also apply to some regular 
"land-line" phones, the kind that tend to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Murray, a spokesman for GTE, said that to minimize confusion, the 562 
land lines will be restricted mostly to pay phones and data-transmission 
equipment, at least initially. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say New Yorkers weren't confused when an overlay code was introduced 
there in 1992, and we won't be either. The new area code will allow phone 
companies to keep up with the increasing demand for phones without having to 
change the area codes for most existing customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overlay codes could not have come at a better time for number-hungry Southern 
California," said Pac Bell Vice President Gene Sherman. "They make it possible 
to keep up with the demand for new telephone numbers and new technologies." 
</P>
<P>
 The change will make Los Angeles one of only four places in the country to 
have an area code without a middle digit of 0 or 1. The others -- in Alabama, 
Washington state and Arizona -- will go into service next year. 
</P>
<P>
 As originally set up, the 0 or 1 in the middle of a three-digit area code 
signaled telephone switching equipment that the number was an area code and not 
the first three digits of a local phone number. But such area codes limited the 
total phone numbers in the United States to about 1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction of an 11th digit for long-distance calls -- a "1" preceding 
the three-digit area codes and the seven-digit local numbers -- made possible 
the use of a wider variety of area code combinations. That change eventually 
will permit a total of about 5 billion phone numbers in the United States, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Marcus, a spokesman for NYNEX, the telephone company that serves New 
York state and all of New England except Connecticut, said an overlay code of 
917 was introduced in New York City a couple of years ago in areas previously 
reached only through 212 or 718. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus said that, like here, the service was introduced initially for cellular 
phones and pagers. He said the only land lines now using 917 are telephone 
company phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers have reacted to it very well," he said. "We kind of phased it 
in, and people have understood the need for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus conceded that "it can be confusing if an area code isn't tied to a 
specific geographic area." But he said that since the overlay code applies to 
only two area codes in New York City, and all public use currently is 
restricted to cellular phones and pagers, "there has been no confusion." 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction of the overlay in the Southland will be far less disruptive 
than the creation of a new, geographically exclusive code, Sherman said. The 
creation of the 310 and 909 area codes in the past three years forced more than 
4.2 million business and residential customers in Southern California to change 
codes. By comparison, he said, about 480,000 cellular and paging customers will 
change codes with the introduction of the 562 overlay. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE and Pac Bell say they will ask local cellular and paging companies to 
adopt one or more of the following methods to help reduce the demand for new 
phone numbers in the fast-growing 310 area: 
</P>
<P>
 * Assign cellular and paging customers to other than the 310 area code if they 
initiate service before the 562 code is introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 * Move some existing cellular and paging customers to 562 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 * Move at least half the prefixes assigned to existing 310 cellular and paging 
customers to 562 starting in May, 1996. A prefix is the first three digits of a 
seven-digit local phone number. Each prefix typically accommodates about 10,000 
phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray said the changes are not expected to cause phone book problems because 
cellular phones and pagers are seldom listed. 
</P>
<P>
 As for numerologists, satanists and others who worry about such things, Murray 
said that, yes, he's aware that 5, 6 and 2 add up to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least the new code's not 666," he said. Calling 562 
</P>
<P>
 A new area code -- 562 -- will be instituted in 1996 to cover the same areas 
as existing area codes 213, 310 and 818, telephone company officials said 
Tuesday. The 562 area code will be given primarily to new cellular and paging 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boundaries: The new area code will not affect boundaries for 213, 310 and 
818. A similar overlaying area code was started in 1992 to serve a part of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 * Easing demand: The 562 area code is designed to ease increasing demand for 
numbers in area code 310, the fastest-growing area in California. 
</P>
<P>
 * When it starts: March, 1996.

WALTER LANTZ, CREATOR OF WOODY WOODPECKER, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walter Lantz, who emerged from the ranks of animation's early pioneers to 
build a multimillion-dollar cartoon empire and a respected worldwide reputation 
with the creation of an irascible woodpecker named Woody, died Tuesday morning. 
He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
 Lantz, who had worked in his office only a week ago, died at St. Joseph 
Medical Center in Burbank of heart failure, said his attorney, Ed Landry. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, four years after the last "Woody Woodpecker" cartoon was produced, 
Lantz was given a special Academy Award "for bringing joy and laughter to every 
part of the world." It was during Lantz's honeymoon with actress Grace (Gracie) 
Stafford in 1941 at a lakeside cottage that Lantz found the inspiration for his 
most famous character. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept hearing this knock, knock, knock on the roof," Lantz told The Times 
in 1992. "And I said to Gracie, 'What the hell is that?' So I went out and 
looked, and here's this woodpecker drilling holes in the shingles. And we had 
asbestos shingles, not wood. So, to show you how smart these woodpeckers are, 
they'd peck a hole in the asbestos shingles and put in an acorn. A worm would 
develop in the acorn, and a week later the woodpecker would come back, get the 
acorn and fly away, letting out this noisy scream as he flew away." 
</P>
<P>
 Gracie Lantz suggested adapting the bird as a cartoon character, although her 
husband later admitted he was skeptical of its potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was doing Oswald Rabbit at the time and we were working mostly with 
animals. But I figured I'd give it a try," he once said. "So I made a few 
drawings, took the idea in to the studio and talked it over with some of the 
boys. Alex Lovy, one of my best artists, worked on it, and Bugs Hardaway 
developed a story." 
</P>
<P>
 The character, Woody Woodpecker, debuted soon after as a supporting character 
in an Andy Panda short, "Knock Knock." It would become Lantz's most successful 
creation, spawning a lucrative source of global licensing royalties and making 
a multimillionaire of its creator. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first three Woody cartoons were completed in the early 1940s, Mel 
Blanc, who had supplied the character's voice, signed an exclusive contract at 
Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shopped around, trying to find the right replacement," Lantz recalled in 
1992. "We actually used the writer, Bugs Hardaway, for quite a while -- 
speeding up his voice to a falsetto." 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was Blanc's laugh -- preserved on a segment of film from Woody's 
debut -- that continued to be heard in most of the cartoons that followed and 
in a 1948 novelty tune, "The Woody Woodpecker Song." That year, Blanc sued 
Lantz for more than half a million dollars, claiming that his original laugh 
had been used in subsequent cartoons without his permission. Although a judge 
ruled against Blanc, noting that he had failed to copyright his contribution, 
Lantz paid Blanc in an out of court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, Lantz was preparing another series of Woody Woodpecker cartoons at 
United Artists and needed a new voice. After being turned down by her husband 
because Woody was a boy, Gracie Lantz taped her own audition and secretly added 
it to the other recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we had the listening session, I didn't want to see the actors who were 
doing the voices," the artist said. "So they ran some recordings and I picked 
one -- No. 7, I remember -- and I said, 'Who's that?' And it was Gracie. She 
sneaked it in on me. I thought, 'Oh, God, no! What are people going to think if 
they find out the producer's wife is doing Woody's voice?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gracie Lantz provided Woody's voice and boisterous laugh in hundreds of 
cartoons until her death in March, 1992, at age 88. She initially declined 
screen credit for her contribution, thinking children would be disappointed if 
they found out the voice was supplied by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, Walter Lantz spoke of the character's unique personality. "It's hard 
to think of Woody in terms of paper and pencil," he said. "He's quite real . . 
. a likable, mischievous little character. Youngsters often write to ask where 
he lives and what he eats." 
</P>
<P>
 Lantz once estimated that each cartoon -- consisting of about 5,000 drawings 
-- took nearly four months to complete. Although he was one of the few 
animation producers to provide his own financing, he said he had no interest in 
creating the kind of full-length epics Disney was known for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a desire to make features," he once said. "Very few outside of 
Disney's have ever been successful and his have come to $3 (million) or $4 
million apiece. Even with a one-shot deal, if you miss, you can lose everything 
you've worked for for the last 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Lantz stopped production of new cartoons in 1975, though the short films 
continue to be reissued theatrically and broadcast on television worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason they don't really date is that we use no puns or popular phrases 
of the time," he once said. "Also, they are made up of two-thirds physical and 
sight gags and only one-third dialogue. This is a secret of their success in 
foreign countries too. Often we don't even translate the dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Italian immigrants, Lantz was born in New Rochelle, N.Y. He had an 
early interest in art as a child, completing a mail-order drawing course at age 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 At 15, he traveled to New York City, where he worked for $7 a week as an 
office boy at a William Randolph Hearst newspaper. After work, Lantz attended 
classes at an art school. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1916, Morrell Goddard, who had created the nation's first color newspaper 
comic section, offered the aspiring teen-age artist a job in the animation 
department of Hearst's International Film Service under the supervision of 
director Gregory LaCava. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out on the camera when I was 16," Lantz recalled in 1982. "Within 
three years I was an animator on 'The Katzenjammer Kids,' 'Jerry on the Job,' 
'Bringing Up Father' and all the cartoons based on popular newspaper strips. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know much about animation in those days -- everything was loose and 
rubbery -- but my studies at the Art Students' League had given me a good 
background in drawing the figure in various positions. I also used to project 
Charlie Chaplin's silent films, trace them frame by frame, then flip the 
drawings to study his motions." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the challenges of the new medium, Lantz said he and his colleagues 
were able to meet the growing demand for cartoon entertainment, developing many 
of the techniques still in use today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have any animation cameras in those days, just Hearst-type newsreel 
cameras, and that's what we used," he said. "They were like a big wooden box. 
No motors, just a chain and a crank. We'd put the animation cel down and hold 
it down with a piece of glass and a lever. We'd press the lever to smooth the 
cel out so it didn't have any wrinkles, set the exposure, turn the crank and 
make a picture." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1922, Lantz was working as a producer at the John Randolph Bray studio, 
supervising such characters as Col. Heeza Liar, Pete the Pup and Dinky Doodle 
in cartoon shorts that occasionally blended animation with live actors -- 
including Lantz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a terrible actor," he once said. "I had four expressions." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, Lantz moved to Hollywood, where he was briefly employed with 
Frank Capra as a gag writer for silent-film director Mack Sennett. In 1928, 
after a friend's recommendation, Lantz was hired by Universal Film Co. head 
Carl Laemmle to oversee the studio's animation department. Lantz arrived just 
as a young cartoonist named Walt Disney was leaving, taking with him his idea 
for an animated mouse -- which Universal had rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney had left behind a character named Oswald the Rabbit, which Lantz 
quickly redesigned and copyrighted. Beginning in 1928, he created the first of 
nearly 300 cartoon shorts starring the loose-limbed rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1930, he made animation history by producing the first Technicolor cartoon 
-- the five-minute opening sequence of "The King of Jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Lantz spent more than a decade at Universal producing shorts starring Oswald 
and later, Andy Panda, before he created Woody Woodpecker. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his many awards and tributes, Lantz was honored in 1959 by the Los 
Angeles City Council as "one of America's most outstanding animated film 
cartoonists." In 1973, the international animation society, ASIFA/Hollywood, 
presented him with its Annie award. 
</P>
<P>
 During the late 1970s, the New York Museum of Modern Art and Filmex in Los 
Angeles organized retrospectives of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Lantz donated 17 artifacts to the Smithsonian Institution's National 
Museum of American History, among them a wooden model of Woody Woodpecker and a 
storyboard from the character's 1941 debut. Museum officials credited Lantz 
with "a truly profound accomplishment" in producing 400 six-minute Woody 
shorts. On March 5, 1986, at age 86, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Lantz established an annual $10,000 animation prize and a scholarship 
in his name at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this since I was 16 and I have done very well," he said at the 
time. "I'd like to do something for somebody else."

'3 STRIKES' LAW BEING USED TO CHALLENGE DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Criminal defense lawyers around the state are using the "three strikes" law to 
file long-shot challenges to the death penalty, contending that the new 
sentencing scheme preempts capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 A motion to preclude a death sentence for an accused triple murderer already 
has been filed in San Francisco, and defense lawyers elsewhere in the state say 
they will cite the new law in making similar motions in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you think you may lose doesn't mean you shouldn't be filing it," 
said San Francisco Deputy Public Defender Grace Suarez. 
</P>
<P>
 But some prosecutors believe that such challenges will only tie up the courts 
and run up costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest downside is that it will produce years of litigation and add 
significant issues to each death penalty prosecution," said Ventura County 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, who had warned the Legislature that the bill 
could endanger death penalty prosecutions. "We will win the issue, but at 
tremendous cost of time and money and people power." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of seven counties shows that most of the defendants so far charged 
with third-strike offenses are alleged robbers and burglars. They range from a 
thief charged with breaking into a car in San Francisco to a convicted robber 
believed to have shot and wounded his wife and her boyfriend in Sacramento 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 But some defense lawyers argue that the hastily passed law can be read in a 
way that could benefit defendants charged with the most brutal of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under "three strikes," third-time felons who have been convicted of two 
serious or violent crimes must be sentenced to at least 25 years. A second 
felony doubles the basic sentence. The law says its prescribed sentences must 
prevail, "not withstanding any other law." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys say defendants with prior felonies therefore must be 
sentenced under the provisions of "three strikes," which does not provide for 
the death penalty. A judge has yet to rule on such a motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The state legislators who passed the bill had been warned that it could lead 
to death penalty challenges. Legal analysts believe the challenges will almost 
certainly fail because "three strikes" was intended to stiffen penalties for 
criminals, not diminish them. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate probably will reach the California Supreme Court and the federal 
courts. When the wording of a law is ambiguous, appellate courts interpret it 
by examining the intent of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorneys contend that the law's language is not ambiguous, so the 
intentions of the Legislature need not be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statute is very, very clear in what it says the sentencing scheme should 
be," said San Francisco defense attorney Mark Goldrosen, who filed a motion on 
behalf of a man accused of killing three elderly people in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys are debating when to file such motions. Los Angeles County 
Deputy Public Defender Charles Gessler argues that such an appeal should not be 
made until after a client has been sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Gessler said the new law has not overruled the death penalty initiative, 
although an identical measure on the November ballot may. Rather, in his view, 
the statute "bypasses" the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the effort is to keep people in prison longer and make the terms longer," 
said the coordinator for capital cases, "death is totally counterproductive. It 
shortens the term." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say they will file when their clients are charged with offenses that 
could bring a death sentence or life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our duty to point out anything in the law that helps our client," said 
San Bernardino County Deputy Public Defender David Negus, "and certainly if you 
read the statute as it is written, it helps our client." 
</P>
<P>
 Negus' office intends to file a motion March 30 on behalf of Johnny Miles, who 
is charged with murder in the course of a rape and robbery. He has at least two 
prior felonies. The public defender's office will argue that, if convicted, 
Miles can only be sentenced under the "three strikes" provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court affirms more death sentences than any state high 
court in the country, and few believe the court would rule in favor of such 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 But Suarez, the San Francisco public defender, said the Supreme Court may "get 
sick and tired of coming in and patching up these badly drafted statutes and 
say, 'We are not going to do it this time.' " She is trying to preclude a death 
sentence for one of her clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from its potential impact on capital cases, the "three strikes" law has 
been criticized for imposing hefty prison terms for offenses that may not be 
all that serious. 
</P>
<P>
 But some county prosecutors simply are not charging prior felonies if they 
think a third strike would produce an unjust sentence, said Ventura County's 
Bradbury. He contended that prosecutors have such discretion under the 
California Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is going to tell me I can't do that?" said the former president of the 
California District Attorneys Assn. "Is it the attorney general? We'll kick his 
backside out of the county. . . . The only risk a prosecutor runs is at the 
ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, a Municipal Court judge in Van Nuys reduced a third 
strike felony against a defendant -- possession of a small amount of drugs -- 
to a misdemeanor, allowing him to escape the terms of the law, said Sandi 
Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 She said at least 13 people have been charged with "three strikes" in the 
county. Most of their prior convictions were for burglary or robbery. The third 
strikes ranged from receiving stolen property to sexual assaults and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, a man with two felony convictions for robbery and two for 
possession of a weapon is being charged under "three strikes" with the 
attempted murder of his wife and her boyfriend. The woman had tried to divorce 
the defendant when he was in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes my job easier," said Sacramento County Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert 
Morgester. "For me to get a life sentence under the old law, I needed to prove 
that he intended to kill, and that he premeditated and deliberated. . . . Under 
the new law I just have to prove that he committed a felony. If I get him on 
possession of a weapon, he goes 25-to-life." 
</P>
<P>
 In Kern County, one of six defendants charged with a "third strike" is a 
48-year-old man with two prior robbery convictions. His third strike: allegedly 
stealing five cartons of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an inveterate burglar who is also dangerous," said Kern County Dist. 
Atty. Edward Jagels. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old law, the defendant would have received a maximum four-year 
sentence. Under "three strikes," he faces at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jagels said the six defendants are habitual criminals who have been churned in 
and out of prison over the years. Although prosecutors generally opposed the 
statute passed by the Legislature, Jagels said he sees merits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of prisoners here in Kern County," said Jagels, "and the word I 
am getting from correction officials is that this ('three strikes') is 
virtually all the inmates who are close to release are talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said his office is prosecuting a man 
who is probably not the kind of criminal that lawmakers had in mind when they 
passed the sentencing law. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old allegedly broke into a locked automobile -- his "third 
strike." He was convicted many years ago of two residential burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Auto burglary is not something we approve of," Smith said, "but it is not a 
violent or serious felony."

JUSTICES APPEAR TO BACK STATE'S DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court indicated Tuesday it is likely to reject a claim that 
California's death penalty law is unconstitutional and, in a separate action, 
upheld the state's definition of "reasonable doubt" in jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the court declared those instructions unconstitutional, prosecutors could 
have faced the daunting task of having to retry thousands of criminals who have 
been convicted in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers challenging the death penalty ran into a barrage of skeptical 
questions from the court, with Justices David H. Souter and Anthony M. Kennedy 
-- two potential swing votes -- defending the law because it follows the 
common-sense approach of telling jurors what factors "are relevant to consider" 
before imposing a punishment of death or life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see what's wrong with that," Souter commented. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy also chided a defense lawyer for making "an amazing argument" that it 
is better to give a juror no guidance rather than some. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court called the state's 1978 death penalty law into doubt four 
months ago when it voted to hear a broad challenge to its constitutionality. 
Prosecutors feared an adverse decision could go so far as to sweep aside the 
sentences of all 374 inmates on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 90 minutes of argument on Tuesday, that threat had clearly faded, 
and state prosecutors were visibly cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The argument went very well for us," state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren said on the 
court steps. "The questions went in the right direction, and while you can 
never read too much into an argument, it seemed to point to a favorable 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The argument focused on the instructions given to jurors who must sentence a 
convicted murderer either to death or life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 In most states, jurors are told to "weigh" possible "aggravating factors" -- 
such as whether the killer used torture, acted for financial reasons or had 
committed previous violent crimes. These are to be balanced against possible 
"mitigating circumstances," such as whether the defendant was drunk during the 
crime or had a troubled childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeatedly in recent years, the high court has said that states may not use a 
"vague aggravating factor" to put a "thumb . . . on death's side of the scale." 
</P>
<P>
 But when two defense lawyers recited those statements Tuesday and stressed 
that California jurors are told to "weigh" something as vague as "the 
circumstances of the crime," the members of the high court appeared to back 
away from their earlier opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we accept your argument, the Georgia (capital punishment law) is going to 
be unconstitutional, too," Souter told defense lawyer Howard Gillingham, who 
represented Paul Tuilaepa, a Death Row inmate who shot four men in a Long Beach 
bar in 1986, killing one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, a Sacramento native who recently authored a court opinion striking 
down Mississippi's death sentence statute as flawed, defended California's law 
as being better than those in Texas and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 State Deputy Atty. Gen. William Prahl picked up the theme, calling the state's 
law "unique" and a "hybrid that adopts the best features" of other state 
statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kennedy and Souter vote to affirm the state's law, they almost surely will 
be joined by the court's three solid defenders of capital punishment: Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 A ruling in Tuilaepa vs. California can be expected before July. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, state prosecutors avoided another legal nightmare when the 
high court unanimously upheld California's jury instructions defining 
"reasonable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's definition of a "reasonable doubt" includes archaic and confusing 
terms such as "moral certainty," said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. "But taken 
as a whole, the instructions correctly convey the concept of reasonable doubt" 
and therefore are constitutional, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone agrees that the Constitution requires a jury to find a defendant 
guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt." But defining that term has long proved 
troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
 A juror need not resolve every "possible doubt" about a defendant's guilt 
because "absolute certainty in human affairs" is unattainable, according to one 
common instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1850, the chief justice of the Massachusetts high court said that a 
defendant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt when jurors "feel an abiding 
conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the charge." In 1927, the 
California Legislature copied this definition into state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, before a jury begins its deliberations, a judge tells the jurors that 
they must find the defendant "guilty beyond a reasonable doubt." This means 
that "after consideration of all the evidence (the jurors) feel an abiding 
conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a lawyer representing East Los Angeles murderer Alfred Sandoval 
challenged this instruction as a "jurisprudential dinosaur" that confuses 
jurors and is unfair to the accused. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, the phrase "moral certainty" referred to a factual 
certainty, as opposed to a philosophical conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, jurors would understand the same term to refer to their personal 
values and judgments, rather than the weight of the facts, said Eric Multhaup, 
the San Francisco defense lawyer who filed the appeal. As a result of this 
confusion, a jury might vote to convict a defendant based on a gut feeling 
about his guilt rather than on the factual evidence, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the justices agreed these jury instructions were outmoded and 
possibly confusing, but they upheld them nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not condone the use of the phrase . . . 'moral certainty,' " O'Connor 
said in the case of Sandoval vs. California, 92-8894. She voiced a warning, 
too. Unless California amends its criminal code and removes the references to 
"moral evidence" and "moral certainty," the high court may well throw out 
convictions based on them in the future, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, who personally argued the case in January, hailed Tuesday's decision 
and said it "will help safeguard the criminal convictions of thousands of 
felons, including murderers on California's Death Row. Had this decision gone 
the other way, we would have seen a mad dash to the courts to invalidate 
thousands of properly obtained criminal convictions."

CSUN GARAGE COLLAPSE FUELS TOUGHER POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting on lessons learned from the Jan. 17 earthquake, state university 
officials announced a tougher construction policy Tuesday for parking garages 
like the one that collapsed at Cal State Northridge and ordered a new seismic 
review of buildings at all campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The new garage standards represent the first time the system has adopted a 
seismic policy that exceeds the state building code, according to Jon Regnier, 
Cal State's director of physical planning and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the 20-campus California State University system said the new 
standards were spurred by the failure of the nearly new, $11.3-million garage 
on the Northridge campus. 
</P>
<P>
 During a committee meeting of the Cal State Board of Trustees, officials said 
future garages will be required to have shear walls -- wooden or concrete 
bracing used to stiffen and strengthen buildings against lateral heaving -- and 
more steel reinforcing in vertical columns. 
</P>
<P>
 A $4.1-million, 660-space garage planned for Cal State Chico that lacked shear 
walls is being redesigned to include them. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,500-space Northridge garage that was heavily damaged in the Jan. 17 
quake had neither shear walls nor the extra steel reinforcing in its interior 
vertical columns. Cal State officials said that building codes did not require 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The builder, A. T. Curd Builders of Glendale, did not return calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're quite prepared as a board to go beyond the code at this time," said 
Charles Thiel, chairman of the university system's Seismic Review Board, a 
panel of seven seismic safety experts convened in mid-1992 to review university 
buildings and seismic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the collapse of Parking Structure C at Northridge, review board member 
Ted Zsutty said, "This is a case where we learned something and we want to make 
sure we don't have a recurrence of that problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Structural engineers have long said buildings with shear walls generally are 
more resistant to earthquake damage. But Regnier acknowledged there has been 
resistance to using the walls in garages in the past because they make the 
buildings less open, and can cause security and ventilation problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the experience of the collapse at Northridge, we wouldn't have had 
too much of a leg to stand on" in recommending the change, said Zsutty, a 
former San Jose State civil engineering professor, and the seismic board member 
who reviewed the plans for the Chico garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the Chico garage to be poured-in-place cement construction, 
unlike the assembly of precast segments used to construct the collapsed CSUN 
garage completed in mid-1991, Zsutty said. By comparison, another CSUN garage 
that survived with little damage had shear walls and was poured in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiel said the policy will remain in effect until the state updates its 
building code to reflect lessons learned from the quake. But officials said the 
Chico garage is the only such project pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiel is also heading a group of experts looking into the causes of the 
Northridge garage failure on behalf of the university system. He said that 
panel expects to forward its report in about two months. After Tuesday's 
meeting, he explained in general how the building appears to have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiel said some interior support columns -- which held up giant concrete floor 
slabs -- failed in the quake. The weight of the floor slabs pulled the stronger 
exterior walls inward, causing the outside columns to bend inward. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times disclosed Feb. 11 that engineers hired by the university system had 
warned earlier that the Northridge garage did not meet seismic safety 
standards. But construction went ahead under the original plans after Cal State 
and Curd officials reviewed the warning. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next several months, members of the Seismic Review Board also will 
reinspect other campuses to re-evaluate buildings, paying extra attention to 
steel-frame and recently constructed buildings that suffered more quake damage 
than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 One example is the wings of the Delmar T. Oviatt Library at the Northridge 
campus, which were heavily damaged in the quake despite having been built 
recently. The original library, built more than 20 years ago, suffered less 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiel said the new review, expected to take several months, may result in more 
Cal State buildings being added to a list of 100 seismically suspect buildings 
that officials released in fall of 1992. The university system plans to start 
retrofitting the first group of them this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although CSUN officials are still tallying the damage, unofficial estimates 
have put the campus' earthquake loss at up to $350 million, which would make it 
the costliest disaster ever for a U. S. university. Officials have said the 
recovery process at CSUN could take several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The garage, known as Parking Structure C, was the only facility on campus to 
partially collapse. But most major classroom and office buildings, built in the 
late 1950s and 1960s, were closed initially due to earthquake damage or 
resulting fires, chemical spills and asbestos contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake damage delayed the start of classes by two weeks to mid-February.

MAGIC JOHNSON COMING BACK TO LAKERS AS COACH; BASKETBALL: HE WILL TAKE OVER 
FROM RANDY PFUND. THE TEAM HAS STRUGGLED SINCE THE STAR RETIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In a development whose timing caught all of basketball by surprise, the Los 
Angeles Lakers said Tuesday night that their former star, Earvin (Magic) 
Johnson, this week will become the team's new coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson will replace Coach Randy Pfund, the team said, a stunning development 
that came 11 days after the Lakers announced they had extended Pfund's contract 
by one season. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker assistant Bill Bertka will coach the team's next two games, at Dallas 
tonight and at Houston Thursday night. Johnson, who has never coached, will 
take over Sunday when the Lakers play Milwaukee at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cooper, Johnson's longtime teammate, will become an assistant coach, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers called a news conference for 11 this morning to make a formal 
announcement. Johnson could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, one of basketball's greatest players, originally retired before the 
1991-92 season when he learned he was HIV-positive. He mounted a brief comeback 
during the exhibition season that year but then called it off. He has been 
taking the drug AZT, reporting no adverse effects, and has kept up a hectic 
schedule that includes color commentary on NBA telecasts and a barnstorming 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Commissioner David Stern said, "Anything that would bring Magic Johnson 
back would be good for the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said last spring that Laker owner Jerry Buss offered him Pfund's job, 
but he turned it down. At the time, Johnson said he would be interested in 
coaching only if he also was allowed to buy a percentage of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was then a member of a group applying for an expansion franchise in 
Toronto. Several months later, that franchise was awarded to a rival group. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund kept his job after the Lakers made a surprisingly strong showing in last 
spring's playoffs, taking a 2-0 lead over the heavily favored Phoenix Suns 
before falling, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss said at the team's training camp in Honolulu in October that he planned 
to extend Pfund's contract, which was to run through the end of next season, 
adding that he wanted to keep Johnson in the organization "in some capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 Buss also said of Johnson in October: "I think it would be great for Earvin to 
be coach of the Lakers, but at the same time, he has a lot of very big-time 
businesses. And whether he can devote the unbelievable number of hours weekly 
to one occupation to the exclusion of all others, I don't know. If he tells me 
he can, we're going to sit down and talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations for Pfund's contract extension took more than four months, with 
Buss asking for a clause that would allow him to reassign the coach to the 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund got a one-year extension without the clause but sounded downbeat when 
talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without going overboard on it and trying to pin too much to it because I'm a 
realistic person," Pfund said, "I think it shows there is some confidence in 
our management in what I've tried to do the last year-and-a-half. I think you 
can leave it at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Johnson, a season-ticket holder with a courtside seat a few feet 
from the Laker bench, was growing restless. In January, he blasted the team's 
performance and demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the guys have pride," Johnson said. "I see teams coming in here 
laughing at us. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's so bad about it is the fact that it is something that you have built 
up and you have pride in that. I never thought in my wildest dreams that after 
I retired it would be this bad so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had pride. We lost a game and you'd think we had lost 20 games. Nobody 
said a word. We showered and no words. And we came back and made a point the 
next game we were going to kick somebody's butt because we weren't going to 
lose two games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took losses hard, and I don't think I see the same thing now. I don't see 
it and I'm there all the time. I don't see guys getting better and I don't know 
if they're not working at it or what. It's tough for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund, a protege of former Laker coach Pat Riley, was 66-80 in his brief 
tenure. Ironically, he was burdened in his first season by the loss of Johnson. 
After that, the team began stocking younger players in a rebuilding program.

CRITICS MOBILIZE IN EFFORT TO BLOCK OCEAN NOISE TESTS; ENVIRONMENT: CITING 
FEARS THAT THE EXPERIMENT WOULD HARM WHALES AND OTHER SEA LIFE, SENS. BOXER AND 
FEINSTEIN URGE FEDERAL AGENCY TO GET CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL AND TO FIND ANOTHER 
SITE. 
</P>

<P>
 Environmentalists and other citizens, outraged by a proposal to blast loud 
noises beneath the Pacific Ocean to study global warming, began mobilizing 
Tuesday to block the project because of fears that it could harm whales and 
other marine life. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the planned experiment, which critics say could deafen whales and 
other marine mammals, prompted an outpouring of opposition from Californians 
who began pressuring the state's elected leaders to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, both of California's senators had expressed concerns about the 
study and urged the federal agency with authority over the project to move 
cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nightmare," said Susan Jordan, a marketing director in Los Angeles 
who was among those galvanized into action. "I've been calling everyone I know. 
I've been calling senators and the governor. It would be criminal to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego have 
proposed placing loudspeakers on the ocean bottom 25 miles off Big Sur and the 
Hawaiian island of Kauai to broadcast an extremely loud rumbling noise for 20 
minutes every four hours for 10 years. The sounds, which would be audible to 
people, would be monitored as far as New Zealand and help scientists learn if 
the ocean's temperature is rising. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Marine Fisheries Service, the agency assigned to protect marine 
mammals, is considering whether to let the experiment proceed even though it 
could affect as many as 677,000 whales, dolphins and seals in the Pacific 
Ocean. The experiment is scheduled to start this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), responding to calls from constituents, sent 
a letter to the agency, noting that the experiment is "the first of its kind" 
and asking the agency to consider other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urge the agency to not only examine the proposal presented, but also to 
consider whether this experiment can be done at an alternative site that would 
have less impact on marine mammals," the senator wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer (D.-Calif), who also received numerous calls, went even 
further: "It's our duty to protect marine life," she said. "I call on the 
National Marine Fisheries Service to hold hearings in California. I also 
believe that Congress should approve the plan before it moves forward." 
</P>
<P>
 And in a separate action, officials at the California Coastal Commission said 
they are investigating whether the experiment would affect the state's 
three-mile coastal zone and thereby come under its authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is quite possible that the Coastal Commission should have jurisdiction 
over this," said Jack Liebster, a spokesman for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the study has received little public attention. The National Marine 
Fisheries Service, which held a hearing on the issue Tuesday in Maryland, has 
set a Friday deadline for public comment before it decides whether to let the 
experiment proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural Resources Defense Counsel, concerned about the lack of public 
notice, called for an environmental impact study to analyze the effect of the 
noise on marine mammals and to consider other ways to measure global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 And Save the Whales, a Los Angeles-based group, called on the agency to hold 
hearings on the West Coast before approving the permit. Environmentalists also 
object to the fact that the loudspeakers would be located within the newly 
created Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Sam Farr (D-Monterey), who represents the district closest to the test 
site, said he is concerned about the noise's possible effects on marine mammals 
but noted that global warming poses a serious threat to all ocean life.

WILSON FUND RAISING GAINS STEAM WHILE RIVALS SPEND HEAVILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Demonstrating that he intends to be armed and ready by the time the Democrats 
select a nominee to oppose him, Gov. Pete Wilson disclosed Tuesday that he has 
raised more than $3 million for his reelection campaign since the start of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leading Democratic contenders, meanwhile, are spending twice as much 
as they are raising, making it more certain than ever that the eventual 
survivor will be out of money after the June primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic State Treasurer Kathleen Brown reported raising money at a slightly 
slower pace early this year than she did in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown raised about $865,000 between Jan. 1 and March 17, according to a report 
filed Tuesday with the secretary of state. She spent about $2.2 million and 
ended the reporting period with $3.8 million on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi reported raising $453,000 since Jan. 1. 
He spent about $1.45 million and was left with $58,000 in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden, who is running a "protest campaign" in the Democratic 
primary, said he raised $40,200 during the period, most of it in loans from the 
candidate to the committee. Hayden, who adheres to a self-imposed, $94 limit on 
contributions to his campaign, reported having $3,582 in his campaign account. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson raised about $3 million during the period, according to his campaign, 
and had just over $3.3 million on hand March 17. The governor expected to take 
in an additional $1 million at a Los Angeles fund-raiser Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign press secretary, said the governor's 
fund-raising edge is "one of the advantages" of running without major 
opposition in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after the primary, Kathleen Brown or John Garamendi is going to be 
broke and battered and bloody and we are going to be ready to go," Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign director, said the insurance commissioner, 
as expected, is spending every penny he can raise on television advertising. He 
said Garamendi bought about $800,000 in television time in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have said all along that the minute we went on television we'd be living 
from hand to mouth," Sragow said. "These numbers certainly confirm that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson and Garamendi campaigns said Brown's slowdown was evidence that her 
campaign is having trouble raising money. Sragow said many of Brown's 
contributors were able to give her money early -- in an effort to frighten 
Garamendi out of the race -- but are not financially able to contribute again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a pot of money Kathleen Brown can get, and she got it early," Sragow 
said. "To presume she can continue to raise money at the pace she raised money 
early on is not true. At some point you hit the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown's finance director, Ann Hollister, said the candidate was on track 
and pleased with the pace of her fund-raising effort. She said Brown has raised 
$8.2 million for the campaign since she started raising money about 20 months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollister said Brown's numbers dipped a little in the most recent period 
because she had several major events in December and has more planned for April 
and May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on target," Hollister said. "We want to raise $10 million for the 
primary and we are on target. I think we're in pretty good shape."

SEISMIC RULES ON CAMPUS GARAGES TIGHTENED; SAFETY: COLLAPSE OF CAL STATE 
NORTHRIDGE PARKING STRUCTURE SPURS CHANGES. BUILDINGS THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSITY

 Thiel said the policy will remain in effect until the state updates its 
building code to reflect lessons learned from the quake. But officials said the 
Chico garage is the only such project pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiel is also heading a group of experts looking into the causes of the 
Northridge garage failure on behalf of the university system. He said that 
panel expects to forward its report in about two months. After Tuesday's 
meeting, he explained in general how the building appears to have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiel said some interior support columns -- which held up giant concrete floor 
slabs -- failed in the quake. The weight of the floor slabs pulled the stronger 
exterior walls inward, causing the outside columns to bend inward. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times disclosed Feb. 11 that engineers hired by the university system had 
warned earlier that the Northridge garage did not meet seismic safety 
standards. But construction went ahead under the original plans after Cal State 
and Curd officials reviewed the warning. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next several months, members of the Seismic Review Board also will 
reinspect other campuses to re-evaluate buildings, paying extra attention to 
steel-frame and recently constructed buildings that suffered more quake damage 
than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 One example is the wings of the Delmar T. Oviatt Library at the Northridge 
campus, which were heavily damaged in the quake despite having been built 
recently. The original library, built more than 20 years ago, suffered less 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiel said the new review, expected to take several months, may result in more 
Cal State buildings being added to a list of 100 seismically suspect buildings 
that officials released in fall, 1992.

ON CALIFORNIA: EUREKA! WE HAVE DUMPED IT!

 I want this guy sitting out in the wilderness someplace.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Gov. Pete Wilson on Melvin Carter, a serial rapist who assaulted dozens of 
San Francisco Bay Area women 
</P>
<P>
 Tell Mr. Wilson this from the people of Alturas: Take that rotten creep and 
put him in your own home.  
</P>
<P>
 -- An elderly woman shouting from the crowd Monday at a rally to protest 
Carter's parole into Modoc County 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the wilderness someplace, where last week the rapist Melvin Carter 
was sneaked into a prison work camp seven miles outside town in the trunk of a 
state car. Carter was brought here after the people of Alameda County, where he 
had been convicted 12 years ago in dozens of assaults, threw a fit upon 
discovery he was to be released into Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the 49-year-old Carter was stashed here instead, at a minimum-security 
facility called Devil's Garden. He must wear an electronic monitor and has 
chosen, thus far, to remain within his small bungalow at the camp. He's read a 
novel a day, a camp official said, and received lots of mail, much of it from 
folks known to America by their first names, like Geraldo. Today's piranha, 
tomorrow's paid interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction in this town of 3,000 has been predictable. This is cattle and 
hunting country, and they compare the placement of Carter to the ongoing 
relocation of mountain lions in the surrounding wilderness. They complain that, 
as the cats might prey on livestock and deer, Carter might prey someday on 
townsfolk. So they are afraid. More than that, though, they are mad. They feel 
used, disregarded, the occupants of a state dumping ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we should be angered about," the Modoc County Record explained in an 
editorial, "is a state government that decides we're small enough to scream, 
but not big enough to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, it would seem the state chose its site well. This northeast 
corner of California is as remote as it comes, a land of rough mountains, 
range, hayfields and few towns. Most people look quite capable of 
self-protection, what few people there are. That only 5,500 voters are 
registered in Modoc County explains, in the local view, precisely why Carter 
wound up here. Politics is a game of math, not morality. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a political game Mr. Wilson played," a speaker complained Monday at 
the daily demonstration. "He didn't realize us rednecks in the North State, 
when you tick us off, we can really do some damage." 
</P>
<P>
 What they have done, so far, is stage rallies at the courthouse, where the 
Bear Republic flag hangs at half-staff. The political talk is of banding 
together with other rural counties to dump Wilson, and also of outright 
secession. Legal challenges have been filed, and more reckless remedies 
discussed. Carter's mug shot is plastered all over town, often framed within a 
gun sight. Warned one such sign taped to the back of a pickup truck: "He won't 
be living here. For long." 
</P>
<P>
 The response, while predictable, nonetheless might actually work. Wilson, 
while blaming the Department of Corrections for the mess -- with him, it's 
always someone -- appears to have softened this week to arguments that Carter 
does not belong here, that he belongs someplace else. Someplace else, of 
course, is a concept that goes to the essence of this episode. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What the Carter affair has shown, however it turns out, is not that there are 
big holes in the criminal justice system. We knew that already. Or that 
politicians play politics, even with the safety of people. We knew that too. 
Rather, it has demonstrated, in almost ghoulish extreme, just how divided this 
state has become. California has carved up itself into many, many states. 
Usually, the cutting follows territorial lines -- north, south, coast, 
interior. Sometimes, the divisions involve values, economics, genealogy; the 
result is pretty much the same. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these Californias make for good neighbors. Indeed, the typical 
solution to any problem is not to tackle it head-on, but to chuck it over the 
fence. Got urban trash? Bury it in the desert. Got gangbangers? Don't think 
about a prison in this city; stick them in some little farm town like Corcoran, 
where the locals can be persuaded to swallow new prisons on the soft promise of 
jobs. Earthquake? That's your problem, L.A. Rapists to parole? Not here, Pete. 
Not Alameda. Not Alturas. Someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
 The new state motto should be: Eureka! We have dumped it! Wilson can move 
Carter from here to Death Valley, or Poway, or the Farallon Islands, or even 
the governor's mansion; it won't matter. There will be someone waiting to pitch 
a fit, to suggest a better dumping ground -- in the wilderness, in the city, 
someplace else.

ROBBINS' REBOUND; POLITICS: THE FORMER STATE SENATOR LOOKS TOWARD AN UNCERTAIN 
FUTURE. HE SAYS HIS STINT IN FEDERAL PRISON MADE HIM APPRECIATE THE SMALL 
THINGS IN LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Robbins is sitting in a garden of lush bamboo, palm and fern foliage 
outside his Encino dream home, the one with the koi pond, polished hardwood 
floors, sweeping entrance -- and a "For Sale" sign out front. 
</P>
<P>
 The elegant, half-century-old hillside estate, which has been the former state 
senator's pride during the eight years he has owned it, now stands vacant. It 
is a luxury that as a felon he can no longer afford. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending 20 months in prison for racketeering and tax evasion, Robbins 
still owes the federal government about $4 million in fines and restitution. On 
top of that are substantial legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a self-made multimillionaire with a portfolio of real estate holdings, 
Robbins is now cash-poor, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins contends that the drop in the real estate market left him with nothing 
to turn over to lawyers and federal authorities. But he is vague about his 
actual net worth -- and it is in his best interest to appear penniless. Robbins 
is trying to persuade officials to give him back his real estate license, 
saying that he needs it to pay his restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Robbins, 51, lives in a small Westwood apartment. "People ask me, 
'How can you live in a one-bedroom apartment when you are used to having this 
beautiful, gorgeous home?' " Robbins said in a wide-ranging recent interview. 
"When you are accustomed to living with nothing, you develop an appreciation 
for every little thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Before being snared in Sacramento's biggest corruption scandal, Robbins 
represented the San Fernando Valley for 18 years. Now he stays busy chasing 
down the former business partners that he said denied him profits while he was 
incarcerated and who now find themselves the targets of numerous lawsuits he 
has filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of people trying to take advantage of me, the last being 
my tenant in this house who took the last thing I had left, my furniture," he 
said. But Robbins is philosophical. "There's an old Greek saying: If it doesn't 
kill me, it makes me stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 He spends much of his time at the offices of a local law firm working on his 
own cases. This is vintage Robbins; acquaintances say he was never one to let 
the opportunity for litigation pass him by. 
</P>
<P>
 He has won one of his suits, obtaining a $500,000 judgment handed down before 
he was released from a halfway house in Hollywood earlier this month. He says 
he has three or four other major litigations pending against people "who helped 
themselves to fairly large pieces of my net worth," plus a few minor suits to 
collect smaller debts. 
</P>
<P>
 As for life beyond the lawsuits, Robbins said, his future is an open question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still in the process of trying to figure that out," Robbins said. "I 
thought I had it figured out but, to be honest, I was thrown for a loop." 
</P>
<P>
 What caught him off guard was the recent revocation of his real estate license 
by a state commissioner who determined that Robbins "had lost his moral 
compass" and had not demonstrated that he was rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins plans to appeal that ruling, and may also try to regain his law 
license -- he was disbarred as a felon -- and says he is examining a business 
proposal involving setting up a phone network. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer appearing as gaunt and anxious as he did while in prison, Robbins 
speaks acceptingly of the lessons he learned in Lompoc Federal Prison Camp, 
where he was visited frequently by his son, 23, his daughter, 21, and his 
82-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to take it for granted that someone else would mop the floors and do 
the cleaning. Now I no longer do," he says. In prison, his jobs included 
washing dishes, mopping floors and scrubbing toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins says he also learned to accept punishment for his actions, which 
included extorting nearly $250,000 from a San Diego hotel developer, laundering 
money and using his office to extort cash and campaign contributions from a 
number of sources. 
</P>
<P>
 He blames himself for letting power go to his head. "In Sacramento, everybody 
bows and scrapes and laughs at your jokes. After a short while, you start to 
believe there was some reason other than just luck that you arrived there. You 
start to believe you have a right to expect people to attend your 
fund-raisers." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, toward the end of his legislative career, Robbins had developed a 
reputation as having an inflated view of himself. "There were a number of 
legislators who would have said I could have used a strong dose of humility," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While in prison, Robbins read about 100 books, mostly dogeared paperbacks 
ranging from the out-of-date pop psychology books "I'm OK, You're OK" and 
"Passages" to whatever escapist bestsellers were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, who pleaded guilty to his crimes and cooperated with federal 
authorities in prosecuting other Capitol figures, said he never hit a truly low 
point during his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You prepare yourself as best you can, but it was a stark reality, 
nevertheless," he said. "I think the fact that I had made the decision to 
(plead guilty and serve prison time) made it easier for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins' initial response to his accusers was to fight. It was only after two 
years of investigation by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service that Robbins 
resigned under pressure in late 1991, acknowledging that he had used his office 
for personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
 What is important to him these days, he says, are the good deeds he did for 
the San Fernando Valley's 20th Senate District. Chief among them, he said, was 
obtaining state funding for government projects and the annual San Fernando 
Valley Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state buildings I built are still there. The courthouses I built are 
still there," he said. "Some of the freeway sound walls I built are still 
blocking out the noise." 
</P>
<P>
 But many in Sacramento say he is also likely to be remembered as a 
manipulative legislator who often withheld his votes until the last minute to 
ensure that legislators and special interests were beholden to him for his 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 The public may also recall Robbins as the defendant in a 1981 sexual 
misconduct investigation. In that case, he was acquitted of having sex with two 
underage women he met in the Capitol, but was tarnished by an embarrassing 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 To those in Sacramento who have tried to distance themselves from Robbins 
since his conviction, he sends a message: "I think they would be well advised 
to look at what they could do to clean up their own house. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they looked at what they really did, they would recognize that No. 1, they 
could be prosecuted and No. 2, if the whispered conversations between 
legislators and lobbyists were recorded, they wouldn't feel very good about 
their kids listening to them." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, those hushed hallway exchanges were recorded -- by Robbins. After 
federal authorities convinced the Democratic senator that they could slap him 
with a lengthy prison sentence for his role in extorting bribes, Robbins agreed 
to wear a hidden recording device.

SENATE CONFIRMS TWO NOMINEES FOR JUSTICE DEPT. 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate on Tuesday confirmed President Clinton's nominees for two top 
Justice Department jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 By a unanimous voice vote, senators approved the nominations of Jamie S. 
Gorelick as deputy attorney general and Deval Patrick as assistant attorney 
general heading the civil rights division. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorelick will replace Philip B. Heymann, who resigned in January after a 
dispute with Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. Gorelick has been general counsel for the 
Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick fills the post Clinton originally sought for C. Lani Guinier. He 
withdrew her nomination after conservatives attacked her views on the Voting 
Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick is a partner in a Boston law firm. He has said he would use the civil 
rights job as a "bully pulpit" to speak out against bigotry and hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has not named a successor to Associate Atty. Gen. Webster Hubbell, the 
department's No. 3 official. Hubbell resigned last week amid a dispute over his 
billings at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., where he worked with First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.

 "There has been no change in our position on Jerusalem," State Department

PETE STARK MAY BE A TOUGH PILL FOR CLINTON TO SWALLOW; CHAIRMAN OF KEY HOUSE 
SUBCOMMITTEE IRKS ADMINISTRATION BY PUSHING HIS OWN PLAN TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL 
HEALTH COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the White House, watching Rep. Pete Stark (D-Hayward) maneuver his health 
care reform package through the House Ways and Means health subcommittee is a 
bit like having your eccentric uncle borrow the car. Your palms get sweaty just 
thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The cantankerous 11-term liberal, who has chaired the health panel since 1985, 
thrives on confrontation, takes direction poorly and has a habit of unleashing 
outlandish remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than heed President Clinton's request to wait until the 
Administration's health plan had gelled, Stark weighed in with his own plan to 
provide universal coverage by greatly expanding Medicare, which Stark's 
subcommittee oversees. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark had also declared "managed competition" -- a pillar of the Clinton plan 
-- to be a delusion. "A unicorn, . . . a beautiful animal in fairyland," he 
dubbed it, with characteristic vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House aide, who for obvious reasons didn't wish to be identified, this 
week described the 62-year-old Stark as "erratic and unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to figure out how to work with him," the aide said. "Basically, it was 
keeping him away from (Ira) Magaziner," chief architect of the Administration's 
health care opus and a frequent Stark target. "Now we're making some progress." 
</P>
<P>
 As the first of at least five major House and Senate committees tackled the 
health care issue, Stark managed to dispel some of the White House Angst by 
winning close votes on key elements his bill shares with Clinton's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the subcommittee endorsed the most controversial piece of the 
Administration plan contained in Stark's bill: the requirement that employers 
pay 80% of health insurance premiums for their workers. On Monday, the panel 
fought off a Republican attempt to strip backup price controls on health care 
costs and backed a cap on malpractice awards for "pain and suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Stark bill eventually may be rendered unrecognizable as it is chewed 
upon by the full Ways and Means Committee -- and other committees begin to 
unveil their own versions -- he will have performed a valuable service by 
pushing the first health care legislative vehicle off the starting line. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing about him, he usually gets a bill out and is usually successful in 
getting it through the (full) committee," said a fellow California lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to some members, such legislative prowess is nothing short of astonishing, 
given Stark's legendary flammable personality and fondness for verbal assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete's one of the more erratic members in the House," said the California 
colleague. "There's something about him that makes you wonder if it goes deeper 
than just being hotheaded. When he loses it, it really diminishes his 
effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 In his most recent misstep, Stark last week angered Rep. Nancy L. Johnson 
(R-Conn.), the only woman on his subcommittee, by telling her that she learned 
what she knows about health care "through pillow talk" with her gynecologist 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark later apologized to Johnson, a leading voice on health care who later 
declined to sign a letter of protest circulated by Republicans over the 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he called then-Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, 
who is black, "as close to being a disgrace to his race as anyone I've ever 
seen" for supporting Bush Administration health policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan demanded an apology, saying, "I don't live on Pete Stark's 
plantation." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's right," Stark countered, " . . . he lives on John Sununu's," referring 
to Bush's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 A formal letter of apology was finally delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his congressional career, Stark, who is white, raised eyebrows when 
he sought, without success, membership in the Congressional Black Caucus. And 
in 1991, Stark, a Unitarian, attacked "Jewish colleagues" for voting for the 
Persian Gulf War resolution "as a matter of convenience" to help Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his election to Congress in 1972, Stark has pursued an eclectic liberal 
agenda. He once rummaged through grocery store dumpsters in his tan poplin suit 
to dramatize food waste. As chairman of the District of Columbia Committee, 
Stark doggedly pursues his goal of statehood for the district in the face of 
palpable apathy over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 He remains one of the most flamboyant members in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you must remember," said an Administration health planner who requested 
anonymity, "style is not that important. He's influential in the debate because 
of where he is, not who he is."

CHIEF WALKS THE WALK, TALKS THE TALK ON PORTLAND STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART WASSERMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New to the neighborhood, Police Chief Charles Moose had just parked his car 
outside his house when a prostitute approached. "I simply told her I wanted to 
go home," the chief said. He was tired. He did not bust her for soliciting. 
</P>
<P>
 About a month after that, Moose returned late from work and ran into the 
flashing red lights of five squad cars that lined his block. They had been in 
pursuit of a stolen car. The driver had ditched the vehicle and fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a usual event," Moose said recently, leaning back in his living room 
chair. "But it's not that unusual, either." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's soft-spoken chief -- a strong community policing advocate and 
19-year veteran of the force -- was appointed to his post last year. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time to buy a house in November, Moose and his wife, Sandy, 
picked the troubled King neighborhood on the northeast side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 In the chief's own words, it's an area of "vacant lots and abandoned 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 As captain of the precinct, Moose had gotten to know that neighborhood well. 
He walked the streets and he organized community policing meetings. He 
recognized faces. Faces recognized him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soon after becoming chief," Moose recalled, "I found myself talking to civic 
groups and telling them about building up society from the ground up, moving 
into the community where you work. When it came to buying a house, my wife and 
I decided to look into a community that was struggling to stabilize itself." 
</P>
<P>
 When he worked in the neighborhood, Moose challenged residents to "turn on 
their lights" and "pull back their curtains." The neighborhood successfully 
closed down a crack house two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Moose, who just earned his doctorate in urban studies at the age of 40, sees 
his move as part of "walking the walk and talking the talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Moose is in the public's eye via local cable access programs. In one 
recent production, he was interviewed by a former Vietnamese gang member. When 
the young host questioned the chief, who is black, about the possibilities of 
success for minorities in America, Moose responded: 
</P>
<P>
 "America says if you do all this (stay in school and work hard), you get an 
opportunity to succeed. I feel like that piece of what America stands for has 
come true for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Moose would have had none of it if he had been unwilling to travel 3,000 miles 
for his job. He was recruited from North Carolina to join the Portland Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I was 21 years old and if I didn't like it, I could go back. Yet I 
know people who wouldn't go 300 miles for a job," the chief said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Moose's actions have led to a call for a community-sponsored program that 
would offer low-interest loans to attract police officers into buying homes in 
similar neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Rotary Club meeting, Neil Kelly, a professional home remodeler, protested 
that the community can't wait. He decided to offer three rental homes he owns 
in the Albina district at below market value to any police officer willing to 
move in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a response," Kelly said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six officers have added their names to the list. Two large banks in the 
neighborhood . . . have expressed interest in offering the best terms possible, 
and craftsmen working to ready the houses for sale have offered their labor at 
reduced costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said that work on the first house was recently completed.

U.S. WILL KEEP PRESSING CHINA ON RIGHTS; DIPLOMACY: OFFICIALS HOLD MEETING TO 
CLARIFY ADMINISTRATION STANCE. SOME HAD URGED A MORE CONCILIATORY APPROACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 After reviewing Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent visit to 
Beijing, top Clinton Administration officials decided Tuesday night to hold 
fast to their policy of pressing for human rights improvements in China, a 
senior Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been speculation in Washington that the Administration was preparing 
to change course on China by de-emphasizing the issue of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. business community is worried about losing out to foreign competition 
in the Chinese market, and top officials of the National Economic Council and 
the Treasury and commerce departments have been urging a more conciliatory 
approach to China. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a nearly two-hour Cabinet-level meeting at the White House, a State 
Department source said the Administration has decided to stick with its current 
human rights policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was basically a reaffirmation of the approach we have been following up to 
now," said the official, who supports Christopher's emphasis on human rights. 
"The bottom line from the meeting was that we need to stay steady and to 
encourage China to make progress" on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 An executive order signed by President Clinton last year requires the Chinese 
government to make "overall significant progress" on human rights by June to be 
eligible for a renewal of its most-favored-nation (MFN) trade benefits. The 
status permits China to export its goods into the United States under the same 
low tariff rates enjoyed by most other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 When Christopher visited Beijing 10 days ago, Chinese leaders greeted him with 
stony hostility. Chinese security officials detained several dissidents before 
and during his trip. 
</P>
<P>
 During the visit, Premier Li Peng warned Christopher that China has its own 
concept of human rights and will never submit to U.S. pressure for change. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday in Beijing, after weeks of tough talk from the Chinese regime 
about America, Li said China will make "great efforts" to improve its relations 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, I do not feel pessimistic about the prospects of 
Sino-U.S. relations," Li told a news conference Tuesday at the close of a 
session of the Chinese Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that China is willing to 
improve Sino-U.S. relations," Li said in a prepared statement. "We have made 
great efforts to improve relations and will continue to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. business leaders in Beijing had expressed their dismay with the 
Administration's policy of linking a renewal of China's MFN benefits to 
improvements in human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen suggested to reporters in Honolulu 
that America needs to change its approach to ensure that it is not 
"disengaging" from China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to explore alternatives to see if we can work this out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's White House session was designed to iron out differences within the 
Administration to ensure that China will not get conflicting messages. 
President Clinton was not present at the meeting, a State Department source 
said. But it is possible he will make a public statement soon to affirm that 
the China policy has not changed in the aftermath of Christopher's trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also has been moving to shore up support for its human 
rights approach, both in Congress and among Chinese students and dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, took to the Senate floor Tuesday to defend Christopher. He asserted 
that the secretary's visit to Beijing "was a necessary one, for it underscored 
to a Chinese audience too used to the accolades of businessmen the importance 
of human rights to American foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhao Haiqing, a former student leader who works with Chinese dissidents in the 
United States, said he was organizing a letter-writing campaign to defend the 
Administration's linkage of MFN benefits and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhao said extending China's trade benefits without any human-rights conditions 
"will be devastating for the democracy movement in China. It will really give a 
strong hand to the hard-liners. The hard-liners will be able to have their way 
inside China."

U.S. AT 'CRITICAL POINT' WITH N. KOREA, CHRISTOPHER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday that the Clinton 
Administration's diplomacy "has now reached a critical point" in its effort to 
thwart North Korea's nuclear ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made it clear to North Korea that it must become a responsible member 
of the international community or that community will have no choice but to 
pursue other options," he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "These 
other options include progressively stronger measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our commitment to South Korea's security remains firm," he added. "We're 
prepared to take all necessary steps to ensure that the north does not misread 
our determination to deter aggression." 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher did not spell out actions the Administration might take beyond 
three steps already announced: a succession of increasingly tough U.N. Security 
Council resolutions, resumption of U.S.-South Korea military maneuvers and 
shipment of Patriot missile-defense systems to South Korea. And U.S. officials 
said it may be weeks before any of those actions begins to bite. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, the United States and its allies were preparing a 
Security Council resolution urging North Korea to permit international 
inspection of its nuclear facilities. That measure is not expected to come to a 
vote before next week. The Pyongyang government will then be given an 
unspecified period of time to comply before the council considers a follow-up 
resolution imposing economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriot missile systems are already on their way to South Korea. But the 
Pentagon is sending them by sea, meaning that they will not arrive for at least 
a month. And the "Team Spirit" joint military maneuvers are unlikely to start 
before the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pyongyang, North Korea's official news agency described the military 
measures as "provocative steps . . . and a declaration of war," the Associated 
Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Christopher predicted Sunday that China would not use its Security 
Council veto to block economic sanctions against its North Korean ally, State 
Department spokesman Mike McCurry conceded Tuesday that China's vote is far 
from certain. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beijing, Chinese Premier Li Peng said his government opposes economic 
sanctions. "China is not in favor of applying pressure," Li said. "If pressure 
is applied on this issue, that can only complicate the situation on the Korean 
Peninsula, and it will add to the tension there."

S. AFRICA ASSUMES CONTROL OF BLACK CISKEI HOMELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Africa ousted the leader of the Ciskei black homeland Tuesday after 
hundreds of striking police holed up in a college and took colleagues hostage. 
It was the second time in two weeks that a homeland leader has been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The swift action was evidence of the determination by the government and the 
African National Congress not to let unrest interfere with South Africa's first 
all-race elections next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of the Bophuthatswana homeland was ousted two weeks ago following 
widespread violence. By contrast, Tuesday's action came with the cooperation of 
Ciskei's head of state, Brig. Oupa Gqozo. 
</P>
<P>
 Gqozo was replaced by administrators from the Transitional Executive Council. 
The multiracial council, dominated by the governing National Party and the ANC, 
is overseeing the government until the April 26-28 elections, which the ANC is 
expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Webb, Ciskei's representative on the transitional council, said the 
homeland had requested South African police and army troops to intervene 
against the striking police. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent South African Press Assn. said hundreds of strikers demanding 
early pension payments had barricaded themselves inside a police college and 
were holding 15 officers and members of their families hostage.

BESIEGED CITY GETS PLANELOAD OF FOOD, MEDICINE; BOSNIA: IT IS THE FIRST 
HUMANITARIAN AID TUZLA HAS SEEN SINCE THE SERBIAN REBEL BLOCKADE BEGAN TWO 
YEARS AGO. SPIRITS ARE LIFTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A single U.N. plane carrying food and medicine broke through rain clouds and a 
Serbian rebel blockade Tuesday to launch a humanitarian airlift to this crowded 
city, which has evaded shelling and "ethnic cleansing" only to become a magnet 
for the homeless, hungry and maimed. 
</P>
<P>
 The first flight into Tuzla's airport since the Serbian insurgency began two 
years ago lifted spirits among the dejected people here who have watched their 
multicultural city crumble into embittered factions as half a million Muslim 
refugees flooded in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing. We've been starved by the aggressors, and our city has been 
ruined," complained Azra Nisic, a wizened 41-year-old who blames the 
international community for leaving Tuzla so long at the mercy of the Serbian 
blockade. "But maybe God is helping us now; maybe we will finally get enough to 
eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 22 tons of wheat flour, medicine and school supplies accompanied the U.N. 
officials ferried in by the first flight to Tuzla for a day of inaugural 
fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 That first delivery also might be the last for weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Bickering over the number and nationality of U.N. troops needed to inspect 
incoming cargo has blocked an agreement between Serbian rebels and Muslim-led 
government forces to allow daily flights by the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees; the Tuzla shipments are to be like those that have 
kept Sarajevo from starving during two years of blockade and bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Serbs contend that the U.N.-operated airport, which is in government-held 
territory, could become a conduit for weapons smuggling. They have insisted 
that Russian members of the U.N. Protection Force be posted at the airport, 
which is within Serbian artillery range. Serbs see the Russians as allies, 
which prompts the government to object. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, said Yasushi Akashi, civilian head of the U.N. mission, 
only military flights to resupply 1,000 Scandinavian peacekeepers deployed to 
the Tuzla area will be allowed to land at the airport. Akashi said he hopes 
humanitarian aid flights can begin within a few days and "certainly within 
three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The limited achievement of opening the airport only for U.N. military use 
reflected the two-steps-forward, one-step-back nature of recent peace efforts 
in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 A cease-fire has held in Sarajevo for six weeks, and Muslims and Croats have 
reconciled after a year of deadly fighting over what land was left after Serbs 
conquered 70% of Bosnia. Yet war dangers still plague most of the country, and 
prospects for a negotiated settlement seem as distant as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for peace in Bosnia inevitably leads to the suspended conflict in 
Croatia, where Serbian rebels grabbed one-third of the country in 1991 and 
proclaimed their own state, the Republic of Serbian Krajina. Nationalists in 
Belgrade, the Serbian capital, want to link Krajina and Serb-occupied areas of 
Bosnia into a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian-mediated talks in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, between Krajina rebels 
and Croatian government officials got under way with the aim of drafting a 
final settlement of the conflict frozen by the U.N. deployment in early 1992. 
But the sides remain polarized, with the rebels insisting on independence and 
the Croatian leadership refusing to consider anything other than full 
sovereignty over Krajina. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mills, an aide to mediators at the first Serb-Croat talks aimed at a 
peace treaty, described the opening session as "detailed and purposeful" but 
reported no progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of tension also arose in Bosnia, with Serbs resuming efforts to block 
humanitarian aid to the Muslim enclave of Maglaj and ignoring demands by U.N. 
officials to remove a cache of tanks and guns discovered near Sarajevo, in 
violation of a NATO deadline for withdrawal of all artillery around the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which 
supplies Bosnia's nearly 3 million needy, further deflated the significance of 
the Tuzla airlift by noting that a genuine breakthrough for peace would be 
restoration of trade and transport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Humanitarian aid is not the solution; let's not fool ourselves," said Manoel 
de Almeida e Silva, spokesman for the aid agency. "What is needed is for the 
situation to return to normalcy, and one element of that is the resumption of 
commercial traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Serbian nationalists rebelled against Bosnia's proclaimed independence 
from Yugoslavia, the country has been carved up by the warring factions and 
studded with roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said months ago that opening an air corridor to Tuzla was vital 
to ensure that aid got through to the region's 800,000 people, more than half 
of whom are dependent on foreign handouts. Threatened NATO air strikes and 
diplomatic pressure from Russia compelled Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic 
to agree to the airlift. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuzla was getting as little as 12% of the aid targeted for the region late 
last year because of Serbian barricades on some convoy routes and because 
Muslim-Croat fighting blocked others. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Muslims and Croats now reconciled and some Serbian factions relenting 
amid the better atmosphere generated by the string of successful cease-fires, 
at least 45% of the needed food is expected to reach Tuzla this month, said 
Robyn Ziebert, the U.N. aid agency's Tuzla representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi presented Tuzla Mayor Selim Beslagic with a box of vegetable seeds as a 
symbolic gift, saying he hoped "like these seeds, the seeds of peace and hope 
will keep growing in this city and the whole country." 
</P>
<P>
 "These dark days are almost over," Akashi told Tuzla and Sarajevo officials 
assembled on the airport tarmac in driving rain. 
</P>
<P>
 He toured Tuzla's main hospital and a refugee reception center during his 
five-hour visit, praising the ethnically mixed city for its "indomitable 
spirit" amid conditions he described as subhuman. "It will take some time, but 
already positive change is in the air and we will capitalize on that," Akashi 
promised.

FACES RED IN BUCKINGHAM PALACE PAINTING THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Britain's royal household suffered another security embarrassment Tuesday when 
police revealed that a valuable painting was stolen from Buckingham Palace 
without anyone noticing. 
</P>
<P>
 A 22-year-old man who used to work at the palace was charged Tuesday with 
stealing the 17th-Century oil painting from a guest bedroom at Queen Elizabeth 
II's London home in January and also with stealing a rose bowl and some silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the theft came to light only when the painting, valued at up to 
$120,000, was offered for sale to a London auctioneer who recognized the scene 
of a couple seated at a table as part of the Queen's Royal Collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The theft adds to a growing list of security breaches involving royal palaces 
and members of the queen's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, thieves broke into private palace apartments that are home to 
Prince Charles, making away with personal items including expensive cuff links.

IMF FINALLY AGREES TO GIVE RUSSIA A $1.5-BILLION CREDIT; AID: THE AGENCY HAD 
DELAYED THE MONEY SINCE AUTUMN. IT WILL ARRIVE AMID DISILLUSION ABOUT WESTERN 
HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The International Monetary Fund finally agreed Tuesday to deliver a 
long-awaited $1.5-billion credit meant to further Russian economic reform, 
Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin announced after days of grueling talks 
here with IMF Director Michel Camdessus. 
</P>
<P>
 The IMF's willingness to deliver the money -- after the agency had delayed it 
since autumn -- gave Chernomyrdin a welcome sign of Western belief in his 
commitment to further Russia's excruciating reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin, seen as a tough pragmatist and new believer in tight budgets, 
told the Interfax news agency that an agreement on the credit will be signed 
soon. He gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the money came through for Moscow just as policy-makers here have 
been loudly expressing their disillusionment with Western aid and loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.5 billion "has no key significance for us," former Finance Minister 
Boris G. Fyodorov said. "We don't really need the IMF money; no good comes from 
it, and our debt is growing. If they gave us $15 billion, then it would be 
possible to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow's attitude toward Western aid, always ambivalent, seemingly has cooled 
considerably in recent months as the Kremlin has sought to espouse a more 
nationalistic, anti-Western line. And Western lenders have grown even more 
skeptical of economic prospects here since top reformers Yegor T. Gaidar and 
Fyodorov left the government in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have not been such cold relations between Russia and the IMF in the 
last 2 1/2 years," Mikhail Berger, an economics columnist for the daily 
Izvestia, said before the IMF loan agreement was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian politicians, already disappointed by spotty delivery of tens of 
billions of dollars in promised aid, see that "there is more political gain 
from public statements that Russia should go it on its own rather than depend 
on foreign aid that isn't coming anyway," said Ardy Stoutjesdijk, director of 
the World Bank office in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Chernomyrdin, Moscow has also shown more reluctance to abide by strings 
attached to IMF-type credits -- among them requirements to lower inflation and 
keep the budget painfully tight. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation has dropped lately to about 10% a month, but the latest draft budget 
proposed by Chernomyrdin's government includes a hideous deficit amounting to 
one-tenth of the gross national product. And that is at the very least; IMF 
officials believe that the government has overestimated its income and 
underestimated its spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.5 billion will come in handy. The Russian government had reportedly 
already figured the IMF credit into its expected budget income. 
</P>
<P>
 But the money can barely scratch the surface of Russia's economic mess. 
Inflation is expected to shoot upward again in the wake of recently imposed 
tariff increases on imported goods, including much of the food sold in this 
nation's biggest cities. At the same time, industrial production plummeted by 
24% in February compared with the same month last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials appreciate aid, but they acknowledge more and more openly 
that in a country the size of Russia with an economy so deeply in crisis, a 
billion here and there can no longer do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compare the size of the Russian debt, which is over $70 billion, and this 
credit of $1.5 billion," said economist Pyotr S. Filippov, one of Yeltsin's top 
advisers. "Furthermore, the volume of Russian money that escapes abroad is 10 
times more than the amount of aid we get. 
</P>
<P>
 "To receive an extra billion dollars is not a solution to the problem," he 
said. "The issue is to make our economy attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian businesses have so little faith in the country's political and 
economic future that they tend to siphon their money abroad, depriving Russia 
of the very investment it needs to fuel reforms and stop the drop in 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 The IMF is under no illusions about the Russian economy. But it is also under 
heavy pressure from Western leaders to do its part in helping to back Russia's 
reforms. It sees support for creation of a stable new Russia as one of its 
greatest tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the IMF had delayed the $1.5 billion since autumn reportedly because of 
doubts about Russia's budget and projected inflation, and talks had deadlocked. 
Camdessus' visit here was meant to bring a breakthrough, and it appears to have 
worked.

EUROPEAN UNION STILL DEADLOCKED ON 4 NEW MEMBERS; DIPLOMACY: TIMETABLE FOR 
ADMISSION OF SWEDEN, FINLAND, NORWAY AND AUSTRIA IS CLOUDED BY VOTING PROCEDURE 
DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For the third time in less than a month, the European Union's 12 foreign 
ministers failed Tuesday to break a diplomatic deadlock that threatens to 
undermine the organization's plans to admit four new nations at the start of 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasingly bitter dispute over voting procedures in an enlarged union 
has clouded the success of recently completed negotiations with the four 
candidate countries -- Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria -- and placed the 
timetable for their proposed entry in jeopardy. It also has tarnished the 
union's image in all four countries, where already skeptical electorates must 
approve terms of membership in votes scheduled for later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday's meeting failed, a clearly frustrated Greek European Affairs 
Minister Theodoros Pangalos announced that the ministers will next try to 
resolve their differences at an already scheduled, informal meeting this 
weekend in the northwestern Greek city of Ioannina. As the present holder of 
the union's rotating presidency, Greece will be host of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't accept the nightmare of not making a decision this weekend," Pangalos 
told reporters after the meeting. "If we can't, we'll be in a lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The EU enlargement is considered a vital step on the path to greater European 
economic and political integration. While the present dispute centers on how 
best to preserve the delicate balance of voting strengths among member states 
in an enlarged union, the real issues are the preservation of power and 
national self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 For very different reasons, two nations -- Britain and Spain -- have staunchly 
resisted what would appear to be a logical adjustment in an expanded union, 
namely to increase the minimum number of votes among member states required to 
block important new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Their resistance reflects divisions that have emerged in the union, formerly 
known as the European Community, as it has grown in size and ambition over the 
past 3 1/2 decades from a group of six countries pledged to close economic 
cooperation to 12 nations committed by treaty to full political and monetary 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the present system, the 12 states muster a total of 76 votes, with large 
countries such as Germany, Britain and France wielding 10 each and the 
smallest, Luxembourg, two. By agreement, a total of 23 "no" votes -- roughly, 
any combination of two large countries and one small -- is enough to block 
important new laws. (However, fundamental changes on how the union functions, 
such as the disputed voting issue, must be agreed upon unanimously.) 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the present crisis within the EU is reminiscent of the early 
constitutional clashes that unfolded during the formation of the United States 
more than two centuries ago. To accommodate the interests of both large and 
small American states, for example, the Founding Fathers eventually agreed on a 
two-house national legislative branch -- the Senate, where all states are 
treated equally, and the House, where representation is based on population 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 But against the background of a divisive history, sharply divergent cultures 
and nine separate languages (12 if the four new candidates eventually enter), 
the search for compromise in building a more unified Europe is proving far more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain's opposition to raising the size of a "blocking minority" to 27 votes 
reflects the fears of southerners being outvoted in a union suddenly prone to a 
northern bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain, on the other hand, worries about an erosion of the power of large 
states to protect their interests. British resistance is also driven by the 
right wing of Prime Minister John Major's ruling Conservative Party, a group 
long suspicious of its country's involvement in the union; it has threatened 
open revolt against the prime minister if he gives in on the voting issue. 
</P>
<P>
 As Tuesday's meeting ended here, Spanish resistance appeared to weaken 
slightly, but Britain remained unmoved in the face of mounting pressure from 
its partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "British intransigence now poses a threat to the very possibility of enlarging 
the EU," declared the European Parliament's Socialist leader, Jean-Pierre Cot, 
as Tuesday's meeting broke up. "This quarrel is not petty. It focuses on the 
very concept we have of the European Union."

GERMAN GOVERNMENT CALLS FOR KURDISH AGITATORS' EXPULSION; UNREST: REQUEST TO 
INDIVIDUAL STATES FOLLOWS FOUR DAYS OF RIOTS. AT LEAST 90 POLICE HAVE BEEN 
HURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The German government and a national police union called Tuesday for the 
expulsion of hundreds of supporters of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party after 
four days of violent demonstrations that have left at least 90 police injured 
and one protester dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have arrested more than 300 Kurds who rioted and set up fiery road 
barricades in cities throughout the country after the government prohibited 
their rallies for an independent homeland in southeast Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five Kurds have set themselves on fire at the demonstrations, which 
coincide with the Kurdish New Year. One of them, an unidentified woman who 
ignited herself in Mannheim, died of her burns Tuesday, RTL television 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Minister Manfred Kanther offered 600 federal police to German states 
late Tuesday to clear further blockades; he pressed state governments to act 
quickly to deport protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The acts of violence . . . by the Kurdish perpetrators challenge the state in 
an unbearable way," Kanther said Tuesday. "The offenders must, as far as 
possible, be expelled and deported from Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, foreigner asylum cases and deportations are handled by states 
rather than by the federal government, as happens in the United States. 
Foreigners residing legally in the country must be convicted of a crime before 
they can be expelled; those seeking political asylum have a right to finish the 
asylum process before they can be deported. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanther called a meeting of state officials for today to discuss ways to speed 
up pending asylum proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanther said Monday that the government will not deport Kurds who face the 
death penalty at home, in accord with international human rights conventions. 
But he also said the threat of arrest in Turkey would be insufficient grounds 
to prevent a Kurd's expulsion. He added that Kurds are not persecuted 
throughout Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights advocates responded that Kurds face certain arrest and possible 
torture and death in jails in Turkey, where the Kurdistan Workers Party, or 
PKK, has been fighting for an independent homeland since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The riots began last weekend when more than 7,000 Kurds demonstrated in the 
cities of Augsburg, Wiesbaden and Berlin. Hundreds of them hurled firebombs, 
stoned police and blockaded highways with buses and burning tires, officials 
said; 85 police were injured in the clashes, in which dozens of Kurds were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday and Tuesday, Kurdish demonstrators again lit fires and set up 
barricades on roads around Bonn, Frankfurt, Bremen, Berlin and other cities. 
They carried signs saying "Stop the Massacre in Kurdistan" and "No Military Aid 
to Turkey." 
</P>
<P>
 The German government provides weaponry to the Turkish government through the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, of which Turkey is a member. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported about 330 arrests in the states of Hessen, North 
Rhineland-Westphalia and Hamburg. Five police officers and three Kurds were 
injured in a clash in Giessen, north of Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
 German Police Union leader Harald Thielmann called for the Kurds' deportation, 
saying, "It is no longer acceptable to German citizens and to the police that 
these extremists wage their war here at the expense of the police and under 
cover of human rights conventions." 
</P>
<P>
 The PKK was banned in Germany last November after the government accused it of 
carrying out attacks on Turkish businesses.

CHIAPAS ENVOY RULES OUT PRESIDENCY BID; MEXICO: CAMACHO SOLIS SAYS NEGOTIATIONS 
REMAIN HIS PRIORITY. SPECULATION HAD UNDERMINED NATION'S POLITICAL STABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Peace envoy Manuel Camacho Solis said Tuesday that he will not run for this 
nation's presidency, ending speculation that he would use his negotiations with 
Indian rebels in southern Mexico as a platform to launch a campaign that was 
certain to split the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Camacho Solis said he will put all his effort into finding a peaceful 
solution to the peasant uprising that has left at least 145 people dead in the 
southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular former Mexico City mayor had flirted for months with the 
possibility of challenging the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI. The party has ruled Mexico for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But by refusing to squelch rumors of a maverick campaign, Camacho Solis had 
provoked criticism from party stalwarts and undercut Mexico's political 
stability -- one of the country's greatest attractions for foreign investors -- 
provoking wild swings in the volatile Mexican stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 He even appeared to be endangering the peace process. A rebel spokesman told 
foreign reporters last week that guerrillas would view a Camacho Solis 
presidential bid "with suspicion" because it would raise questions about his 
commitment to the negotiating process. 
</P>
<P>
 But Camacho Solis also used his position to pressure for political reforms 
demanded by rebels but not addressed in the government peace proposal. In a 
news conference two weeks ago, he threatened to seek the presidency unless 
democratic reforms were passed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Mexican Congress began a special session to consider a 
constitutional amendment and laws that would make electoral authorities more 
independent of the PRI and other parties; stiffen penalties for voter fraud, 
and modify ballots to preclude ballot-box stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho Solis' decision came after hours of closed meetings and telephone 
calls with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between seeking a presidential candidacy and contributing to the peace 
process in Chiapas, I choose peace," Camacho Solis said at a news conference. 
"If people continue to perceive that my priority is to be a presidential 
candidate, it would end up harming the peace process. On the other hand, if I 
make clear that above all else my priority is to guide the peace process in 
Chiapas, that will be useful for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican stock exchange index soared 5.41% to 2,511.93 on the news, 
recovering two weeks of decline in a single session. Investors had been leery 
of the populist Camacho Solis and even more concerned about a split in the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, the market had nervously anticipated a repeat of the 1988 
presidential election. That year, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas launched an independent 
campaign that divided the PRI and, eventually, the country, because many 
Mexicans believe that Cardenas lost because of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho Solis had been viewed as likely to mount a maverick campaign because 
he was openly disappointed in November at being passed over for his party's 
nomination in the Aug. 21 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 He resigned as mayor the day after Luis Donaldo Colosio's candidacy was 
announced. Eight tense hours later, Camacho Solis accepted the post of foreign 
minister, considered the first step to oblivion. But his political career was 
revived when Indian rebels calling themselves the Zapatista National Liberation 
Army invaded several towns in Chiapas on Jan. 1, demanding democracy and better 
living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial military response provoked an international outcry, convincing the 
government of the need for a negotiated settlement and opening the door for 
Camacho Solis, a noted conciliator. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, his peace efforts have overshadowed Colosio's presidential 
campaign. A peace proposal reached after nine days of talks and currently under 
consideration by grass-roots Zapatista supporters made Camacho Solis a national 
hero, increasing pressure in some circles for him to directly challenge the PRI 
candidate.

ASIA TIRES OF BEING THE TOXIC WASTE DUMPING GROUND FOR REST OF WORLD; 
ENVIRONMENT: A GLOBAL CONFERENCE IN GENEVA COULD END MANY RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN 
DEVELOPING NATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a large factory on the rutted outskirts of Manila every day, huge 
containers disgorge an unusual cargo -- thousands of dead car batteries from 
such places as Australia, Europe and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 With the politically correct-sounding name of Philippine Recyclers Inc., the 
factory was established in the early 1980s with tax incentives from the 
government to reprocess the world's discarded auto batteries by reclaiming the 
lead inside and using it to make new batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been a big success by the standards of the economically 
depressed Philippines, employing 280 people to recycle 24,000 tons of car 
batteries every year. In 1993, sales hit a respectable $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of similar companies have mushroomed across Asia in recent years as 
Western companies facing costly and environmentally sensitive waste-disposal 
problems at home have opted to ship much of their toxic trash overseas for 
reprocessing. 
</P>
<P>
 By one estimate, more than 100 tons of plastic, which many countries regard as 
toxic when burned, leaves the Port of Los Angeles every day for recycling 
plants in Asia. With cheap labor, economies desperate for investment and little 
or no regulation, countries from China to Indonesia to Pakistan scramble to 
compete for the waste business. 
</P>
<P>
 But an international conference taking place in Geneva this week could 
dramatically change the way the world disposes of its hazardous wastes and 
spell the end of companies like Philippine Recyclers. Even the term recycling , 
the mantra of "green" movements for the past two decades, is suddenly becoming 
a dirty word. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, we don't want to become the garbage dump of the world," 
said Philippine Sen. Orlando S. Mercado, a leader on environmental issues. "A 
lot of the industries, the recycling industries that are being exported to 
developing countries, are dirty industries. We have enough garbage of our own." 
</P>
<P>
 The Geneva meeting is designed as a follow-up to the 1989 adoption of the 
so-called Basel convention on international shipments of hazardous wastes, 
which was enacted under the auspices of the U.N. Environment Program following 
scandalous revelations about rich countries dumping toxic wastes in the 
territories of poor nations. In one famous incident, an Italian company rented 
a farm in Nigeria for $100 and used it to dump 4,000 tons of hazardous 
polyvinyl chloride wastes, or PVCs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Basel convention banned shipments of a long list of toxic wastes, but in 
the view of environmentalists it left two gaping loopholes. One is that 
shipments can still take place if the governments involved agree, and the 
second, more important exception concerns material that could be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Denmark suggested a dramatic tightening of the law, banning 
outright exports of hazardous wastes from the world's richest countries to all 
developing countries. While Italy, Spain and 77 developing countries expressed 
support for the ban, some of the world's leading industrial powers, including 
Britain, France and Australia, announced their opposition. That set the stage 
for the confrontation this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to our government that it is one of the worst forms of imperialism 
for us to want to keep a way of life in rich countries by getting rid of our 
waste by sending it to people who have no way of defending themselves," said 
Thomas Becker, an official with Denmark's Environment Ministry. The answer, 
Becker said, is for the rich countries to process the waste themselves or 
eliminate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, the United States will not have a voice in the debate because 
the George Bush Administration never sought ratification of the original Basel 
convention. So U.S. officials are attending the Geneva meeting as observers 
only. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Clinton Administration announced that it will 
introduce legislation banning exports of hazardous wastes, bringing U.S. 
regulations in line with the Basel convention. But the proposal exempts what 
are termed "safe recyclable" exports, such as plastics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. exports only a fraction of a percent of our hazardous waste," said 
Carol Browner, the Environmental Protection Agency chief. "But that fraction 
adds up to a significant amount. The current policy puts people in other 
countries at risk of dangerous exposures to toxic materials. That has to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), who heads an environmental group called Globe USA, 
said that it is important for the United States to set an example to the rest 
of the world by adopting strict limits on toxic exports. "If the convention is 
to be enforced, the least we can do is follow the regulations ourselves," Kerry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the worst examples of the United States exporting hazardous materials 
occurred in 1992, when a U.S. firm sold Bangladesh 6,300 tons of fertilizer 
that contained toxic lead and cadmium wastes from copper smelting. A U.S. court 
fined the company that provided the waste $1 million, but the damage was 
already done -- more than 3,400 tons had been spread on farms and could not be 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Asia has become the focus of the hazardous-waste debate because many other 
developing countries, notably in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific Islands, 
have banned imports of toxic materials. Nigeria and Cameroon have even imposed 
the death penalty for toxic-waste importers. 
</P>
<P>
 China, Taiwan and India are big importers of metals for recycling, while the 
Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand reprocess everything from batteries to 
scrap paper and plastics. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.S. company has proposed to pay the tiny Pacific island of Tonga $9 
million annually to establish a toxic-waste dump on a volcanic atoll, and an 
Oakland firm wants to ship trash as landfill to the low-lying Marshall Islands. 
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, among Asia's poorest and least regulated countries, 
have received offers from a number of Western corporations about opening 
waste-treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the environmental group Greenpeace, between 1990 and 1993, five 
nations -- the United States, Canada, Germany, Britain and Australia -- shipped 
5.4 million tons of toxic wastes to Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 A resolution this month in the Philippines' House of Representatives on the 
toxic-waste issue estimated imports at 15 million pounds in 1991 and 5 million 
pounds in the first quarter of 1992. They were mainly plastics, scrap metal, 
computer junk and lead scrap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philippines illustrates the often contradictory attitudes of Asian 
governments toward toxic wastes. While the Board of Investment has given 
millions of dollars in tax incentives to companies to set up recycling 
businesses, the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources has sent a 
high official to Geneva to campaign for a worldwide ban on shipments of toxic 
wastes for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Tagorda, president of Philippine Recyclers, the country's leading 
battery recycler, said a ban on battery imports would be fatal to his company 
as well as two other lead reprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagorda said his company uses technology imported from a firm in East Los 
Angeles and follows every applicable health and safety regulation. He 
acknowledged that blood tests have shown high levels of lead in some workers' 
blood but said the workers are transferred to safer jobs until the levels 
return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Leonard, a toxic-waste specialist for Greenpeace, said that tests of 
workers and agricultural land near lead reprocessors, not only in the 
Philippines but in Indonesia and Thailand, have indicated serious health 
concerns created by the industries, from lead levels in topsoil to pollution of 
drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Leonard said that the process of recycling plastics often releases 
hazardous gases and exposes workers in developing countries, who are too poor 
to afford protective clothing, to contamination from the chemicals contained in 
the plastics, such as pesticides and solvents. 
</P>
<P>
 Another industry that has been dramatically affected by the recent debate on 
recycling is the world trade in "technojunk" -- computers and related devices 
that have been overtaken by new technology and discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 After Greenpeace campaigners raided a Russian ship near Manila earlier this 
month, the Philippine government impounded two containers of computer junk sent 
to an Australian-owned company that separates the valuable pieces for resale. 
</P>
<P>
 Randell Carman, chairman of the recycling company, said he was astonished at 
the government's action because the firm had been operating with government 
approval for eight years. Carman said cheap labor in the Philippines made the 
business economically more practical than it would be in Australia, but he 
insisted that the work was purely mechanical and not harmful to either the 
workers or the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Raquel Vasquez, director of the government's Environmental 
Management Bureau, declared the shipment toxic because it contained 
unacceptably high levels of the element cadmium and ordered the seized goods, 
which had grown to four containers by the time a decision was reached, returned 
to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Philippines has learned to live by getting its basic commodities from 
recycling, and they are very good at it," Carman said. "Our business is 
basically finished without the imports."

75 ABOARD DIE AS RUSSIAN JETLINER CRASHES IN SIBERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Russian jetliner crashed in a remote forest in Siberia today, killing all 75 
people on board. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Emergency Committee said the Aeroflot Airbus A-310 apparently 
exploded and burned after crashing in the Kemerovo region.The 63 passengers on 
the plane included 23 foreigners, mainly from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to reach the plane were hampered for several hours as rescue workers 
forced their way through snowbanks up to three yards deep to reach the area, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident from a nearby village saw the plane burning in the forest and 
notified authorities, officials said. A helicopter later spotted the crashed 
jetliner, and rescue workers and police reached the site several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was four hours into a 10-hour flight from Moscow to Hong Kong when 
it went down, said Vassili Tkachenko, Aeroflot's general manager in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 The 183-seat plane disappeared from radar without sending a distress signal, 
he said. But because air traffic controllers saw it vanish from the screen, 
they were able to pinpoint its location, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jet had left Moscow with 63 passengers and 12 crew, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tkachenko said the plane was only 2 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Aeroflot official Vladimir Soukhov in Tokyo said the downed plane was about 
150 miles from Novokuznetsk, a town about 2,000 miles east of Moscow.

U.S. TO ISSUE VISAS TO GAY GAMES PARTICIPANTS WITH AIDS VIRUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration will allow foreigners with the virus that causes 
AIDS to attend the Gay Games in New York in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno approved a waiver Tuesday to the rule barring people 
with the AIDS virus from entering the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Visas granted under the waiver will allow stays of up to 10 days. The Gay 
Games take eight days. Two additional days were allotted for travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno acted after the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
advised her there was no public health reason to prohibit the brief stay, and 
the Department of Health and Human Services determined that visits up to 90 
days would not harm public health. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good news for people with AIDS and for people who oppose 
discrimination, and we are very, very happy," said Gregory King, spokesman for 
the Human Rights Campaign Fund, a gay lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 10,000 and 15,000 athletes and spectators from more than 40 countries 
are expected to attend the Gay Games, from June 18-25, according to a State 
Department cable obtained by the Associated Press last month. The games overlap 
related events that week, including the 16th annual International Lesbian and 
Gay Assn. world conference and Stonewall 25, a celebration of the 25th 
anniversary of a gay customer-police confrontation at the Stonewall Inn, a bar 
in Greenwich Village, New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short-term visits present minimal risk," said Immigration Commissioner Doris 
Meissner, who recommended the waiver on the basis of the HHS determination. 
Waivers have been used in the past to permit HIV-infected foreigners to attend 
academic and scientific conferences, obtain medical treatment, visit family 
members and complete temporary business. 
</P>
<P>
 Those seeking visas would not be required to state their HIV status but must 
show proof, such as tickets, of their intent to attend or participate in the 
Gay Games IV and Cultural Festival, said Justice spokeswoman Ana Cobian. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. policy denies visas to anyone with a communicable disease of public 
health significance, including HIV, which causes AIDS. That restriction led 
planners to move the annual International Conference on AIDS from Boston to the 
Netherlands in 1992.

WHITE HOUSE AIDE PAID $1,352 IN BACK TAXES FOR PART-TIME NANNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former law partner of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton who is now a White 
House attorney failed to pay Social Security taxes for a part-time nanny until 
just before his move to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 William Kennedy III paid $1,352.52 in back taxes and penalties before starting 
work in February, 1993, for the taxes owed from 1992, White House 
Communications Director Mark D. Gearan said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's duties as associate White House counsel include ferreting out 
unethical or embarrassing information about candidates for White House jobs. 
About the time of his repayment, the White House faced a controversy over Zoe 
Baird's failure to pay Social Security taxes for domestic help. The flap 
scuttled her nomination for attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Kennedy's delinquent taxes were 
paid under his wife's maiden name by an accounting firm, raising the 
possibility that he did not want the FBI to discover the lapse in its 
background check of him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gearan said Kennedy told him he was not trying to conceal the matter. 
Kennedy told Gearan that his wife wanted to use her maiden name, Gearan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy was reprimanded by the White House for "inappropriate" contacts with 
the FBI during last year's controversy over the firing of White House travel 
office employees.

'NANNY TAX' CLEARS PANEL; WOULD SIMPLIFY PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday addressed the "nanny tax" that has 
bedeviled the Clinton Administration, approving the first revisions in 44 years 
to laws governing the payment of Social Security taxes for household workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, approved on a voice vote, simplifies the payment procedures and 
raises the wage level at which the taxes must be paid from $50 per quarter to 
$630 a year. In addition, people under age 18 hired to do household chores or 
baby-sitting would be exempt from the Social Security tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation also would allow employers to pay the tax once a year, as part 
of the federal income tax return, rather than in quarterly payments. And 
employers would be required to provide an annual statement of earnings on a W-2 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill now goes to the full Senate, where its chances for passage are 
excellent, aides said. A similar bill will be introduced in the House shortly, 
and passage there is considered a virtual certainty, according to Rep. Andrew 
Jacobs Jr. (D-Ind.). 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to pay timely Social Security taxes on household employees was a 
factor in the withdrawal of the nomination of Zoe Baird, President Clinton's 
first choice for attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Other potential nominees were not appointed, partly because they had not paid 
Social Security taxes on domestic workers; some high Administration officials 
paid the taxes retroactively to comply with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the bill, according to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), 
chairman of the Finance Committee, is to provide greater Social Security 
coverage for domestic workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, only about one in four employers of household workers pays the taxes 
designed to provide government pensions for those who provide child care or 
other domestic help. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue has been a rather large problem for the Administration, starting 
last year with Zoe Baird and ending with Bobby Ray Inman," Moynihan said. 
Inman, who withdrew after being selected as defense secretary, acknowledged 
that he had not paid Social Security taxes for a domestic worker. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also would allow employers to pay federal and state unemployment 
taxes when they file their annual federal tax return, simplifying paperwork and 
eliminating quarterly reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, federal and state unemployment insurance taxes must be paid when a 
domestic worker earns more than $1,000 in any quarter.

CLINTON POLITICAL AIDES TO GET FBI CHECKS; WHITE HOUSE: OFFICIAL TELLS CONGRESS 
THAT SCREENING CARVILLE, THREE OTHERS IS PART OF A BROAD EFFORT TO TIGHTEN 
SECURITY. LAXITY HAD BEEN CHARGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to dispel any perception of slack security, White House officials have 
asked outside presidential advisers James Carville, Paul Begala, Mandy Grunwald 
and Stanley B. Greenberg to submit voluntarily to full FBI background checks in 
return for their White House passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Patsy Thomasson, director of the White House office of administration, told a 
House Appropriations subcommittee Tuesday that the checks would be run as part 
of a broader effort to tighten security. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think we have any Aldrich Ameses in the White House," she said, 
referring to the former CIA official now accused of spying for the Russians. 
"But we certainly could." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has moved to tighten security this month after earlier press 
reports revealed that about 300 of the White House's 1,031 employees, including 
15 at senior levels, have been working without full security clearances. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials insisted that most of the employees were kept away from 
classified information, although they acknowledged that at least one, Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers, has had regular access to secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 All White House staff members must pass quick background checks that would 
turn up records of felonies and outstanding warrants. But the full background 
checks, involving FBI interviews, take several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Begala, a partner with Carville in a Washington political consulting firm, 
works regularly for the Democratic National Committee. Greenberg, a pollster, 
and Grunwald, a media consultant, also work for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The four are among fewer than 20 people who have so-called "non-government 
service" passes, which are used for non-employees such as contractors who need 
regular access to White House grounds. Other regular advisers, including Susan 
Thomases, confidante of Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Betsey Wright, Clinton's 
chief of staff while Arkansas governor, enter on temporary passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Ross Lightfoot of Iowa, ranking Republican on the House 
Appropriations subcommittee that handles the White House budget, insisted that 
the four simply "ought not to have White House passes." But Thomasson asserted 
that "at no time will they have access to look at classified documents, because 
they do not have a need to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, (D-Md.), chairman of the subcommittee, said the four 
"perform the functions of the Democratic National Committee" and "need to talk 
to the President." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing brought protests from Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), who has written 
a series of letters to the White House seeking information on the pass issue 
and has been told consistently that nothing is out of order. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf cited a Feb. 24 letter, issued in the name of White House Chief of Staff 
Thomas (Mack) McLarty, in which he was told: "As I have previously stated, to 
our knowledge security clearances are being handled both in a timely manner and 
in accordance with the procedures of previous administrations and the 
requirements of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly this was false," Wolf said.

HOUSE OKS COMPROMISE ON WHITEWATER HEARINGS; CONGRESS: LEADERS AGREE THAT 'GOOD 
FAITH' EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO DISCUSS POSSIBILITY OF A PROBE. SENATE PASSED 
SIMILAR RESOLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Increasingly concerned about the appearance of a cover-up, House leaders 
reached an agreement Tuesday to negotiate "an appropriate timetable" for public 
hearings on the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, identical to a compromise worked out earlier in the Senate, 
later was ratified by the full House in a 408-15 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing, scope and avenue for the hearings were left undecided, however, 
and senior Democrats said later that the compromise struck with GOP leaders did 
not necessarily mean that congressional hearings would take place -- only that 
a "good faith" effort would be made in the coming weeks to agree on the terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an agreement to discuss the possibility that hearings will be held . 
. . not a concession that hearings will be held," House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.) told reporters shortly before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with concern clearly growing among rank-and-file Democrats that 
opposition to hearings might be perceived as an attempt to withhold information 
from the public, many lawmakers said they thought that a congressional probe 
was inevitable now that the House has joined the Senate in calling for one. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution calls for Congress to investigate "all matters related to the 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Assn., Whitewater Development Corp. and Capital 
Management Services Inc.," a fund operated by David Hale, who claims he made 
improper loans to then-Gov. Clinton and Mrs. Clinton. The resolution was 
adopted only hours after Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Altman became the 
eighth senior official to testify before a federal grand jury in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. was expected to question him 
later on his discussions with White House aides about the Resolution Trust 
Corp.'s investigation of Madison Guaranty, the now-defunct Arkansas savings and 
loan owned by James B. McDougal, one of Clinton's partners in the Whitewater 
land venture. Altman, in addition to his role as deputy Treasury secretary, 
also was acting head of the RTC when the meetings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is one of two -- the other will be sitting in Little Rock -- 
that Fiske is using to try to unravel a web of financial arrangements linking 
the bankrupt thrift to the Clintons through their failed real estate 
investments in the Whitewater venture. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury in Little Rock will probe allegations that depositors' funds 
were transferred improperly from Madison to Whitewater during the 1980s and may 
also have been used to help retire then-Gov. Clinton's campaign debts. The jury 
in Washington is investigating suspicions that Administration officials may 
have sought to delay or derail the RTC probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the courthouse after his testimony, Altman said he had laid out "all 
the facts" in the Whitewater case before the grand jury and stood "ready to do 
the same in any congressional inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Tuesday, the Treasury Department released a letter in which Altman 
again revised upward the number of contacts he had with the White House about 
issues related to Madison Guaranty. The revision was the third since Altman 
first testified on the issue before the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman said he had more talks about whether to disqualify himself from the 
case involving Madison than were revealed in a letter released last Friday by 
Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest letter, the talks occurred at an earlier-disclosed 
Feb. 2 meeting with White House aides. A few days later, Altman also spoke by 
phone with White House Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty about disqualifying 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 21 letter also shows Altman informed Clinton's deputy chief of 
staff, Harold Ickes, about his plans to step down as acting head of the RTC. 
That occurred on Feb. 23, the night before Altman announced the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, Altman said: "I literally bumped into" former White House 
Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, who told the deputy Treasury secretary about the 
Administration's plans to nominate a permanent head of the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have done my best to recall every communication with White House staff on 
anything which could be connected to this matter," said Altman, who eventually 
disqualified himself from the Madison Guaranty case on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the House hearing vote, Foley said that he and House Minority 
Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) would meet privately in the coming weeks to 
try to agree on a framework and timetable for congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and other Democrats warned they would not consent to hearings if it 
looked like they might turn into a partisan show trial at which Republicans 
will air unproven allegations in order to embarrass the President or stall 
action on health care and other legislative matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we cannot and should not ignore Whitewater, neither can we allow it to 
flood the chamber," said Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). "We have 
an obligation to ensure that our three-branch government does not become a 
three-ring circus." 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was largely to avoid a potentially embarrassing spectacle that the 
Democrats agreed to enter into negotiations with the Republicans over the terms 
for the hearings in the first place, lawmakers said privately. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement has less to do with any notion that Whitewater hearings are 
necessary than it has with getting the issue away from Henry," confided one 
Democratic source, referring to House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. 
Gonzalez (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 Foley acted after Gonzalez abruptly canceled a committee hearing that 
Republicans had hoped to use to air concerns about Whitewater and sent an 
abusive and personally insulting letter to the panel's mild-mannered ranking 
Republican, Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know that Henry's behavior is sometimes a bit quirky," another source 
said. But this time his behavior was becoming something of an embarrassment for 
the leadership because it was "creating the misimpression that Democrats were 
trying to cover something up," the source added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry's tactics . . . put the (Democrats) behind the psychological Eight 
Ball" and appeared to be one reason why the leadership abruptly turned around 
and dropped its opposition to hearings, agreed Leach.

DASCHLE WILL SEEK SENATE LEADERSHIP POST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), a protege of Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.), notified Democratic colleagues Tuesday that he will run for the Senate 
leadership post. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that this is the right time for me," Daschle said."I'm ready to take 
on that challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle, 46, said he called his potential challengers and had letters 
delivered to other colleagues announcing his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell announced March 5 that he would not seek reelection to the Senate 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle, the first to enter the leadership race, said he had already arranged 
appointments with a dozen senators to formally solicit their support. Some 
senators have committed to back him, but he declined to say how many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to be convinced that the level of support in South Dakota and the 
Senate was there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other senators may seek the post, including John B. Breaux of Louisiana, Jim 
Sasser of Tennessee and Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle said he began telephoning Democrats as soon as Mitchell informed him 
of his decision to retire. He said he wanted to make sure before entering the 
race that he had a good chance of winning it.

MCDOUGAL SHOWS HE KNOWS HOW TO DISH THE DIRT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pssst. Want the real dirt on Whitewater? 
</P>
<P>
 James B. McDougal, a former business partner of President and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton in a failed Arkansas real estate venture, is selling the right to dig 
up dirt from a three-acre plot of Whitewater land. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that everybody is trying to dig up their own dirt on Whitewater, so 
we are offering the public the opportunity to acquire their very own souvenir 
cubic foot of Whitewater for a minimum donation of $19.95," McDougal said in a 
press release Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donation? 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim's going to use part of the funds, I guess, to defend himself," said Chris 
Wade, president of Whitewater Marketing. Wade was the real estate agent for the 
Clintons and the McDougals on the Whitewater land sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade is leasing the three-acre Lot 24 in Whitewater Estates to McDougal for $1 
a year for 99 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who buys the dirt will get a "nonpartisan dirt deed" from the 
Whitewater Development Corp. According to the deed, "the only right that this 
conveys is to come upon Lot 24 of the above described property and dig up 
dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal owned the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan in Little Rock. 
Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. is trying to determine whether funds from 
Madison were illegally diverted in the mid-1980s to prominent Arkansans, 
including the Clintons and their real estate venture.

<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton christened a magenta-and-white tulip named in her honor 
with a sprinkling of Champagne Tuesday as it was presented to her on a silver 
platter. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Hillary Clinton" tulip was dubbed an official breed by Adriaan Jacobovits 
de Szeged, the Netherlands ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am thrilled," the First Lady said after reading the traditional tulip 
toast. 
</P>
<P>
 "May your planting each fall recall the need of foresight. May your long 
winter's sleep suggest patience. May your blooming each spring inspire joy and 
renewal," she read. 
</P>
<P>
 The Netherlands Embassy smothered itself in tulips of all shapes, sizes and 
hues for the ceremony, a celebration of spring and the 400th anniversary of the 
tulip's entry into that country. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton was presented with 200 of the tulips, which took 15 years to 
cultivate. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambassador said it will be five years before fields of the special variety 
will be developed and the Hillary Clinton will be available to the public.

WILSON AIDE ADMITS DRUNK-DRIVING ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson has been cited twice for drunk driving, once 
after an accident that injured the driver and passenger in another car, he 
acknowledged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign press secretary, said he was arrested for the 
second time early in the morning March 5. He was pulled over a few blocks from 
the Capitol as he drove a friend home from a downtown Sacramento bar and grill, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur, in an interview Tuesday night, said a breath test showed his 
blood-alcohol level to be .13% or .14%, far in excess of the legal limit of 
.08%. He said he was taken to Sacramento police headquarters and spent the 
night in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur, 30, said he intends to plead no contest to the charges when he appears 
in court next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to face whatever the courts decide the appropriate punishment will 
be," he said. He expects that punishment to be at least one weekend in jail, an 
extended term on a county work detail and a hefty fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur is a native of Wisconsin who worked for the Republican National 
Committee, the 1988 campaign of President George Bush and for the California 
Republican Party before moving to the Wilson Administration when Wilson took 
office in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been Wilson's deputy communications director and later the director of 
communications and press secretary. Known for his acerbic wit and ability to 
quickly come up with biting comments on the governor's opponents, Schnur moved 
over to Wilson's reelection campaign at the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur said he did not believe his troubles would undermine his role as 
spokesman for Wilson, who has built a reputation as tough on crime and 
substance abuse. He said he offered his resignation to Wilson after both 
incidents and both times it has been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's been very supportive," Schnur said. "If the governor thought that 
my continued involvement might cause a problem for the campaign, I'd resign 
without hesitation." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur said he has voluntarily entered an outpatient treatment and 
rehabilitation program and is in the process of quitting drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed at myself, not only for my foolish decision to drive home 
that night but for not recognizing how serious this problem was until it 
reached this stage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first incident, Schnur said he was arrested in January, 1992, after he 
turned left on a green light in downtown Sacramento and hit another car, 
injuring two people. The extent of their injuries could not be determined 
Tuesday.

 A moderate earthquake struck 25 miles east-southeast of Ensenada, Mexico, on 
Tuesday evening, rattling buildings as far north as San Diego but causing no 
reported damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech officials in Pasadena said the magnitude 5.0 temblor occurred at 6:59 
p.m., followed four minutes later by a magnitude 3.7 aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as if a very large truck passed by and made the buildings shake," said 
Eduardo de la Vega, director of the municipal police in Ensenada, which is the 
third-largest city in the Mexican state of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no reports of problems here or in other parts of the state," Vega 
said. Officials of the federal highway patrol in Ensenada also reported no 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 About 120,000 people live in Ensenada, with at least 80,000 in the surrounding 
countryside. Fire officials in the city said they had communicated by radio 
with Ajos Negros, a town of about 5,000 people near the epicenter, and that 
they reported no injuries or serious damage.

<P>
 On Tuesday, the Transport Ministry announced plans to introduce spot fines on 
Israeli roads for minor traffic offenses, which it did not define.

<P>
 It said motorists will be able to pay by credit card. Patrol cars will be 
equipped with the appropriate card machines and receipts.

3 CONDORS FLY BACK TO AREA THEY WERE REMOVED FROM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three California condors captured in the Sespe Condor Sanctuary near Fillmore 
last fall and relocated to a remote area in the rugged hills above Santa 
Barbara have flown home, wildlife officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists hope the wandering birds will be unable to find food in the 
sanctuary area and will return to the Santa Barbara back country. But if they 
do not, the vultures could be moved again or captured and kept as breeding 
stock for their endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stayed over there for quite a long time," Robert Mesta, condor project 
coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Monday. "It was last 
week that they moved back. They have a tendency to wander." 
</P>
<P>
 The female birds were born at the Los Angeles Zoo and released into the Sespe 
sanctuary in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 They are three of the four condors that were moved to a distant ridge along 
Lion Canyon in Los Padres National Forest last fall after scientists decided 
that structures and human activities made the Sespe site too hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 Three condors have been killed in recent years when they flew into power 
lines, and another died in 1992 after drinking antifreeze somewhere near 
Pyramid Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologist Michael Wallace, curator of birds at the Los Angeles Zoo and a 
member of the California Condor Recovery Team, said a group of scientists met 
in Los Angeles last week to discuss the wayward birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to wait and see what they're going to do," Wallace said. "The 
ideal situation is they'll get hungry enough and go back to where they know 
food is, in Lion Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're not going to behave, then they'll be brought back into captivity," 
Wallace added. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nine condors now in the wild, the oldest, named Xewe, has stayed in 
Lion Canyon with a group of five young birds released there in November. 
Wildlife experts are concerned that the three wandering vultures could lead the 
younger birds to the Sespe area.

PLUMBING NOT SOURCE OF TOXIC FUMES AT HOSPITAL, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The plumbing at Riverside General Hospital could not have leaked toxic fumes 
that overcame an emergency room crew treating a patient in February, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of the plumbing system eliminated any possible link between pipes in 
the hospital and the Feb. 19 incident in which patient Gloria Ramirez died and 
six doctors, nurses and attendants got sick or passed out after some noticed an 
ammonia-like smell. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Weiss of Hemet said last week that fumes from a sink made him vomit and 
drove him out of his third-floor room twice in January. Those incidents 
occurred before Ramirez, 31, was brought to the ground-level emergency room in 
cardiac distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County public information officer Thomas DeSantis said the county, 
which owns the hospital, brought in an independent specialist and other experts 
last week to check the plumbing, which got a clean bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office is still trying to determine what killed Ramirez and what 
made the workers sick, DeSantis said. Several staffers said fumes seemed to 
come from Ramirez's body or blood, and authorities are awaiting test results 
from her fluids and tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family has insisted that the problem was somewhere in the emergency room.

LAWYER FOR STATE HELD IN STALKING CASE; CRIME: CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE BOARD OF 
PRISON TERMS FACES A POSSIBLE PRISON SENTENCE ON A FELONY CHARGE. HIS FORMER 
GIRLFRIEND IS THE ALLEGED VICTIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief legal counsel for the state Board of Prison Terms, David Brown, has 
been arrested on a felony charge of stalking his former girlfriend, a spokesman 
for the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 32-year state civil servant, Brown, 57, who is out of jail on $25,000 bail, 
is scheduled to be arraigned in Sacramento Superior Court this week. The 
possible penalty for a felony stalking conviction is two to five years in state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has been placed on paid administrative leave from his state job, 
according to Board of Prison Terms President Jim Nielsen, who said the board 
will conduct an independent investigation, which could lead to Brown's 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison terms board is the state agency responsible for deciding whether or 
when prisoners serving life sentences, including murderers, can be released 
from custody. For lesser crimes, courts determine the duration of sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 As legal counsel, Brown represents the board in opposing appeals from inmates, 
and he defends the board in lawsuits. His salary is $81,192 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department spokesman John McGinness said Brown also is accused of 
making misdemeanor harassing telephone calls and writing angry letters to his 
former girlfriend, Mary Wimberly, a Sacramento school board member, in 
violation of a restraining order that she obtained against him. A conviction on 
this charge could mean up to one year in county jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The calls and letters apparently stemmed from the couple's breakup in 1990, 
McGinness said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We searched his (Brown's) home and office and found significant evidence to 
substantiate the claims of the woman," he said, adding that the arrest was made 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 J. P. Tremblay, a spokesman for the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, which 
oversees the Board of Prison Terms, said: "We heard about this case from the 
victim. She came to us. We looked into her complaints and determined there were 
grounds for concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen, a former Republican state senator, said: "He (Brown) is on 
administrative leave. The board will conduct an investigation and take 
appropriate action. I have no other comment."

PLAINTIFFS AWARDED $345,000 IN '89 POLICE BRUTALITY CASE; COURTS: JUDGE SIDES 
WITH A GROUP OF 26 PARTY-GOERS WHO SAID THEY WERE BEATEN WITHOUT CAUSE BY 
OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Superior Court judge has sided with a group of 26 party-goers who alleged 
that they were beaten up without cause by Los Angeles police officers as they 
attended a baptismal celebration in Arleta, awarding them $345,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of legal wrangling and a two-month trial that heard from more 
than 50 witnesses, Judge Richard Montes ruled for the plaintiffs. Police 
executives on Tuesday defended the officers involved, saying that they acted 
properly and that some officers were injured by violent party-goers. The city 
attorney's office has not yet decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Men, women and children were clubbed or otherwise assaulted by officers who 
ordered them to leave the house after responding to neighbors' complaints of a 
noisy party in April, 1989, said Leon P. Gilbert, a Woodland Hills lawyer who 
represented the party-goers. He called it the worst example of police brutality 
he had seen in years of representing plaintiffs in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 11 party-goers were treated for injuries at eastern San Fernando 
Valley hospitals after the fracas. Six of them, including two brothers who 
owned the house, were arrested on charges that were later dropped, according to 
Gilbert and court testimony in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographs taken by a family member after the party showed party-goers with 
missing teeth and bruised shoulders, arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Division police officers also were injured, police spokesmen said, as 
they tried to clear people out of a house packed with belligerent party-goers. 
They said relatives of those being arrested jumped them as they tried to haul 
suspects away. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes issued his decision in an order from the bench March 10. Although he 
has yet to sign the final judgment, attorneys for both sides said Tuesday that 
they have accepted this ruling as his final decision and that the signing is a 
formality. The Los Angeles city attorney's office -- which defended the 
officers, the Police Department and city officials named in the complaint -- 
and the judge refused to comment on the case until the city decides whether to 
appeal.  
</P>
<P>
 "This shows that the system works, that people who really have been taken 
advantage of by police authority still have the ability to obtain some type of 
justice by suing the city," Gilbert said. "The problem is it takes five years 
and a tremendous amount of aggravation, anxiety, emotional distress, after 
these people were beaten and then arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. Val Paniccia, commanding officer of Foothill patrol officers at 
the time of the incident, said the verdict shows it is "fashionable" for people 
to sue the police with false allegations of brutality, and for juries and 
judges then to award them damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry the judge made the decision he did, but that's because he didn't 
believe the facts," Paniccia said. "In my opinion, the officers were totally 
doing their jobs and nothing else. They were provoked and attacked, and these 
people then went after us for the lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Paniccia, now commanding officer at the LAPD's West Valley Division, said one 
officer also lost a tooth in the fracas and that other officers were punched 
and hit by party-goers who refused to disperse when officers asked them to. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilbert and the court testimony of party-goers painted a different picture 
of what happened that night. 
</P>
<P>
 The party-goers said that about 30 officers came to the house in the 9800 
block of Mercedes Street in Arleta about 10:45 p.m. the night of April 1, 
ordered that what neighbors said was loud music be turned down and told the 
crowd to disperse. More than a dozen people attending lived at the house, and 
several dozen more were guests. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court testimony in the case, the music was turned down after 
police arrived. But the police then ordered everyone to disperse and began 
forcing them out, said Gilbert. Officers formed lines outside the front door of 
the house, beating party-goers as they tried to leave, said Gilbert and some of 
the witnesses and party-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are having a baptismal party to celebrate and the police come in like 
storm troopers and force them all out of their house," Gilbert said. "People 
were getting trampled. And (the police) were hitting them with batons, and 
pushing them and pulling them and grabbing them. One's head was pounded into a 
squad car for no reason." 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office accepted the judgment. "Based on the number of 
plaintiffs and the number of allegations, I found the award was reasonable," 
said Deputy City Atty. Ellen Fawls, the chief defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the judge did not find that any of the officers acted with malice, 
and thus did not award any punitive damages. "As far as who hit who, I don't 
think it was clearly established as to whether it was intentional," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge determined that the police violated the party-goers' civil 
rights by acting too aggressively to shut down the party, and so the officers 
were responsible for the injuries that followed, she said.

SCHOOLS LACK ELECTROMAGNETIC MONITORING PLAN; SAFETY: THE DISCOVERY OF HIGH EMF 
LEVELS IN A SHERMAN OAKS KINDERGARTEN CLASS REVEALS A VOID IN TESTING, 
PREVENTIVE MEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent discovery of high electromagnetic fields in a Sherman Oaks 
kindergarten class exposed the lack of a concerted program to detect EMF hot 
spots in city schools. 
</P>
<P>
 EMF measurements were taken at Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary School because 
of a parent's concern about the placement of an electric transformer, not due 
to the vigilance of school authorities. As the episode revealed, testing for 
elevated EMFs -- linked by some studies to a small increased risk of cancer -- 
usually is limited to schools with worried parents or staff. 
</P>
<P>
 This passive approach -- which one critic called a "squeaky wheel" policy -- 
has not produced much information about EMF levels in local schools. In fact, 
only nine of more than 600 schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District 
have had EMF measurements, district records show. 
</P>
<P>
 More testing is likely following the Dixie Canyon flap, which involved a 
transformer installed inches from the exterior wall of a bungalow classroom. 
After a parent voiced concern, district safety officials sought measurements by 
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which obtained a high reading of 
107 milligauss at the teacher's desk. Typical readings in homes and offices are 
less than 2 milligauss. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents were particularly upset because the district installed the transformer 
in 1991 -- long after the EMF controversy surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only place on a three-acre campus where they could put this 
thing," Jeffrey Fried, the parent who first raised the issue, said 
sarcastically. "While the jury's out, they're just going to ignore all the 
statistical evidence. . . . When in doubt, put it (the transformer) seven 
inches away from the children." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, who have decided to relocate the transformer at a cost of 
about $100,000, say similar situations could exist on up to 100 other campuses 
where transformers have been added since 1989 to serve portable classrooms and 
new air conditioning systems. Rather than install the transformers as far as 
possible from classrooms, officials said they typically put them nearby to save 
money and space. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education since 1988 has required minimum setbacks 
from power lines for new schools and portable classrooms, but the standard does 
not mention other electrical installations. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Doi of the district's environmental health and safety branch said the 
risk of transformers creating higher EMF exposures "didn't register. . . . The 
focus with EMFs . . . was always with the power transmission lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Electric and magnetic fields are invisible lines of force that radiate outward 
from every electrical device, penetrating nearly everything around them -- 
including the human body. If EMFs are dangerous, distance is the best defense 
because their strength falls rapidly with distance from the source. 
</P>
<P>
 Several studies have found a small increased risk of cancer in children living 
near high-current power lines, while other EMF research has found elevated 
cancer rates among workers in electrical professions, such as utility linemen 
and film projectionists. A smaller number of studies found no connection 
between EMFs and cancer, and experts generally say a causal link has not been 
proved. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that a definitive conclusion may be years away, some authorities 
have called for voluntary adoption of no-cost and low-cost means to reduce 
exposures, in case EMFs ultimately are proven to be harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 Such "prudent avoidance" measures, as they are sometimes called, can be as 
simple as fencing off part of a playground or moving workstations farther from 
a source of EMFs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter last week to L.A. Unified officials, state health official Dr. 
Raymond R. Neutra, the state's point man on the EMF issue, wrote: "The weight 
of evidence has not yet reached the point where one can set a safety standard 
or mandate expensive retrofits." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Neutra wrote: "Our department does believe that there is sufficient 
evidence to warrant no-cost or low-cost measures to avoid sources of EMF when 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 But taking such precautions means knowing first where elevated fields exist. 
And in Los Angeles and many other areas, this data exists for a mere handful of 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 As a free service to customers, a number of utilities, including the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power, and Southern California Edison Co., by 
request take EMF readings in homes, offices and schools. But while the DWP has 
surveyed nearly 600 homes and offices during the past two years, it has only 
been asked to test nine schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Edison, the nation's second largest utility, has measured nearly 
3,900 sites during the past two years, fewer than 100 of these have been 
schools, said Mark Judy, manager of Edison's EMF education center. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many experts believe there are compelling reasons why such testing should 
be focused on schools. For one thing, some schools deliberately were built near 
power lines or other electric installations to take advantage of cheaper land 
costs. And by bringing large numbers of children and adults together in one 
place, schools concentrate any risks that may exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools have a special status, because they're public institutions to which 
people entrust their kids," said Neutra of the state Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is an EMF problem, the place you want to address it first is 
schools," said Louis Slesin, publisher of Microwave News, a newsletter that 
chronicles the EMF debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you should discover down the road that this is a credible risk, you know 
where the hot spots are, you've done your homework," Slesin said. 
</P>
<P>
 State health and education officials say a mandate to test all schools is 
unlikely any time soon -- particularly since there is no consensus on what EMF 
levels would be cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Until there is more "conclusive information" on the health risks, "you're 
probably not going to see any kind of statewide mandate for measuring 
exposure," said Duwayne Brooks, an assistant superintendent of the state 
Department of Education and member of a state task force on EMF in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing "will probably continue to be on a public response mode, instead of a 
blanket, 'everybody must do it,' " Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are veterans of emotionally charged health scares involving 
asbestos, lead and radon, school safety officials say they are floundering for 
lack of standards on EMF exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really want a regulatory agency to help us out in this situation," said 
Susie Wong, director of L.A. Unified's environmental health and safety branch. 
"They need to tell us what . . . we need to do. We need some guidelines. We 
can't act by ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Several testing initiatives are expected, however, in the coming months. In 
response to the Dixie Canyon episode, district officials said they will review 
building plans to pinpoint other campuses where transformers near classrooms 
may be causing heightened exposures. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate study, DWP officials are planning to take EMF measurements at 41 
schools that are near transmission lines and substations -- although the 
readings will be confined to school property lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP, Edison and other utilities are also involved in a statewide effort to 
chart the distance of all public and private schools to the nearest utility 
installations. In subsequent phases of the study, officials will take EMF 
readings at hundreds of campuses and use consultants to devise strategies to 
reduce exposures from external and on-campus sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for the latter phases of the research would come from a $5.6-million EMF 
research fund established by California utilities under an order last November 
from the state Public Utilities Commission.

<P>
 The elegant, half-century-old hillside estate, which has been the former state 
senator's pride during the eight years he has owned it, now stands vacant. It 
is a luxury he can no longer afford. 
</P>

 Things are not yet looking up for Robbins. Even though he spent 20 months in 
prison for racketeering and tax evasion, he still owes the federal government 
roughly $4 million in fines and restitution. On top of that are his substantial 
legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a self-made multimillionaire with a portfolio of real estate holdings, 
Robbins is now cash poor, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins claims that the drop in the real estate market left him with nothing 
to turn over to lawyers and federal authorities. But he's vague about his 
actual net worth, since it is in his best interest to appear penniless. Robbins 
is trying to persuade officials to give him back his real estate license, 
saying he needs it to pay his fines. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the latest downward twist for Robbins, who gained local fame and 
fortune during the 18 years he represented the San Fernando Valley in 
Sacramento, a job he says he misses a lot. Nonetheless, he remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me, 'How can you live in a one-bedroom apartment when you are used 
to having this beautiful, gorgeous home?' " said Robbins in a recent 
wide-ranging interview. "When you are accustomed to living with nothing, you 
develop an appreciation for every little thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he is busy chasing down his adversaries, the former business partners 
Robbins said denied him profits while he was incarcerated and who now find 
themselves the targets of numerous lawsuits he has filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of people trying to take advantage of me, the last being 
my tenant in this house who took the last thing I had left, my furniture," he 
said. But Robbins is philosophical. "There's an old Greek saying: If it doesn't 
kill me, it makes me stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 While residing in his tiny Westwood apartment, Robbins, 51, spends much of his 
time at the offices of a local law firm working on his own cases. This is 
vintage Robbins; acquaintances say he was never one to let the opportunity for 
litigation pass by. 
</P>
<P>
 He has won one of his suits, obtaining a $500,000 judgment in his favor -- 
handed down before he was released from a halfway house in Hollywood earlier 
this month. He says he has three or four other "major litigations" pending 
against people "who helped themselves to fairly large pieces of my net worth," 
plus "a few minor" suits to collect smaller debts. 
</P>
<P>
 As for life beyond the lawsuits, Robbins said, his future is an open question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still in the process of trying to figure that out," Robbins said. "I 
thought I had it figured out but, to be honest, I was thrown for a loop." 
</P>
<P>
 What caught him off guard was the recent revocation of his real estate license 
by a state commissioner who determined that Robbins "had lost his moral 
compass" and had not demonstrated he was rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Robbins plans to appeal that ruling, may try to regain his law license, 
and is examining a business proposal involving setting up a new phone network. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer appearing as gaunt and anxious as he did while incarcerated, Robbins 
speaks acceptingly of the lessons he learned in Lompoc Federal Prison Camp, 
where he was visited frequently by his son, 23; daughter, 21, and 82-year-old 
mother.  
</P>
<P>
 "I used to take it for granted that someone else would mop the floors and do 
the cleaning. Now I no longer do," he says. In prison, his jobs included 
washing dishes, mopping floors, scrubbing toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins says he also learned to accept punishment for his actions, which 
included extorting nearly $250,000 from a San Diego hotel developer, laundering 
money and using his office to extort cash and campaign contributions from a 
number of sources. 
</P>
<P>
 He blames himself for letting power go to his head. "In Sacramento, everybody 
bows and scrapes and laughs at your jokes. After a short while, you start to 
believe there was some reason other than just luck that you arrived there. You 
start to believe you have a right to expect people to attend your 
fund-raisers." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, toward the end of his legislative career, Robbins had developed a 
reputation as having an inflated view of himself. "There were a number of 
legislators who would have said I could have used a strong dose of humility," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 While in prison, Robbins read about 100 books, mostly dogeared paperbacks 
ranging from the out-of-date pop psychology books "I'm OK, You're OK" and 
"Passages" to whatever escapist best-sellers were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he was the target of animosity from other inmates who refused to 
believe he was an ex-state senator, not a former United States senator, and was 
not responsible for the federal laws that landed them in the work camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, who pleaded guilty to his crimes and cooperated with federal 
authorities' prosecution of other Capitol figures, said he never hit a truly 
low point during his sentence. "You prepare yourself as best you can, but it 
was a stark reality, nevertheless. I think the fact that I had made the 
decision to (plead guilty and serve prison time) made it easier for me," he 
said. "I didn't spend my time being angry. I didn't spend my time trying to 
figure out why I was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Other legislators caught in the FBI's long-running Capitol corruption probe 
have had a difficult time accepting their convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Former state Sen. Paul Carpenter (D-Downey), found guilty of racketeering and 
money-laundering after Robbins testified against him, fled the country rather 
than face sentencing. And former Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) has tried 
to convince supporters that he is innocent in spite of his guilty plea last 
month to using his office to obtain campaign contributions illegally.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every man and woman has to figure out how to deal with a situation," Robbins 
said. "I don't think I'm in a position to fault Assemblyman Nolan for the way 
he's dealing with it, or Sen. Carpenter for the way he's dealing with it. I 
dealt with it in the way that was right for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins' initial way of dealing with his accusers was to fight. It was only 
after two years of investigation by the FBI and Internal Revenue Service that 
Robbins resigned under pressure in late 1991, acknowledging that he used his 
office for personal gain. During that period, Robbins spent hundreds of 
thousands of dollars on legal fees in an attempt to dodge federal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 What's important to Robbins these days is that his conviction not overshadow 
what he considers the good deeds he did for the Valley's 20th Senate District. 
Chief among them, he said, was obtaining state funding for government projects 
and the annual San Fernando Valley Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state buildings I built are still there. The courthouses I built are 
still there," he said. "Some of the freeway sound walls I built are still 
blocking out the noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Other legislative accomplishments Robbins hopes to be remembered for include 
his crusade to end court-ordered busing and replace it with voluntary 
desegregation, which he says has been more successful. In addition, he authored 
a law to protect victims of rape from having their prior sex lives brought up 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in Sacramento say he is also likely to be remembered as a 
manipulative legislator who often withheld his votes until the last minute to 
ensure that lawmakers and special interests were beholden to him for his 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 The public may also recall Robbins as the defendant in a 1981 sexual 
misconduct probe. In that case, he was acquitted of having sex with two 
underage girls he met in the Capitol, but was left tarnished by an embarrassing 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 To those in Sacramento who have tried to distance themselves from Robbins 
since his conviction, he sends a message: "I think they would be well-advised 
to look at what they could do to clean up their own house. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they looked at what they really did, they would recognize that No. 1, they 
could be prosecuted and No. 2, if the whispered conversations between 
legislators and lobbyists were recorded, they wouldn't feel very good about 
their kids listening to them." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, those hushed hallway exchanges were recorded -- by Robbins. After 
federal authorities convinced the Democratic senator they could slap him with a 
lengthy prison sentence for his role in extorting bribes, Robbins agreed to 
wear a wire. 
</P>
<P>
 For four months, he secretly taped everything anyone in the Capitol said to 
him. And now, he strongly believes those tapes -- only a portion of which have 
been released -- should be made public. After all, he reasons, the Watergate 
tapes were eventually made available. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the unreleased recordings contain damaging material, Robbins 
replies: "I think that would be an understatement. I assume there are people in 
the state of California who will wish those tapes will never be released." 
There is little chance the recordings will be made public, however, while the 
FBI's investigation of influence-peddling in the Capitol continues. 
</P>
<P>
 As for political corruption, Robbins said he believes the problem still 
exists. He advocates reforms to prevent lobbyists from doling out dollars to 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state's current effort to extract promises from lobbyists to 
refrain from pledging campaign contributions is a start, he said, but a weak 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 In some Capitol quarters, Robbins is spoken of disparagingly by those who now 
regard him as a tattletale. But Robbins takes pride in the role he played in 
exposing the corruption of others, even if jurors said he did not strike them 
as credible. One juror called him a scumbag. And attorney Donald H. Heller, who 
represents lobbyist Clayton Jackson -- whom Robbins' testimony helped to 
convict -- routinely labels the ex-senator "an extortionist" and a liar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the federal prosecutors were surprised with how high my level of 
commitment was," he reflects. "I meant it when I said I was going to cooperate. 
I felt it provided a unique opportunity for the people of California to look at 
a slice of what really goes on in the Capitol." 
</P>
<P>
 It also provided Robbins with an opportunity to reduce his five-year prison 
sentence to two.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA CANYON; EDITOR SEEKS TO PRESERVE AN AREA'S LIFESTYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH HANANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man who thundered against the proposed Canyon Oaks Estates development 
atop Topanga Canyon seems a most unlikely titan. 
</P>
<P>
 Colin Penno sits in a bare room similar to the ink-stained newspaper office 
John Boy worked in atop Walton's Mountain in the television series "The 
Waltons." And like his fictitious TV counterpart, the editor of the community's 
bi-weekly newspaper -- the 2,000-circulation Messenger -- does not take lightly 
any threat to his beloved home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Messenger is really the glue that holds the canyon together," said Darlia 
Holland, a local real estate agent. "And Colin has always been there." 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old Penno hails from Cornwall in the south of England. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, he landed a job photographing an album cover for an 
expatriate British singer/composer living in Los Angeles. Penno flew over, and 
still recalls waking up his first morning in the record producer's Topanga 
Canyon house.  
</P>
<P>
 "I walked out on to the deck amid the oak trees, listened to the stream and 
the quiet," he said. "I knew I was home, and wept." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the singer's career faltered, Penno went back to Cornwall, sold most 
of his possessions, and returned to Topanga armed with only a duffel bag and 
$30.  
</P>
<P>
 His first job was digging ditches at $2 an hour. A couple of years later, he 
had saved enough money to buy a second-hand Plymouth Fury and endless rolls of 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Messenger started up in 1976, Penno signed on as news photographer. 
Two years later, he became the editor, learning to type as he learned to write 
and report. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his friends' urgings, Penno has stayed on at his $10,000-a-year job. 
With the zest of a Don Quixote tilting at windmills, he takes on all perceived 
enemies of the canyon, including the mass media he claims "trivialize and 
distort" canyon life and real estate developers who would "flatten and destroy" 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 His favored methodology is simple and direct. He takes dazzling photos of 
Topanga and pairs them up with dramatic captions. When the Canyon Oaks Estates 
development was headed for a final vote, for example, Penno ran a photo with 
the caption, "The Last Virgin: Topanga's Summit Valley Is Being Peddled in the 
Valley." Just minutes before the County Board of Supervisors was to vote on the 
project, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy announced it would buy the 
proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We advertise in the Messenger because it's the only local publication out 
there," said Judy Schokley, director of advertising for the Jon Douglas Co., a 
real estate firm in Los Angeles. Penno "doesn't turn away advertisers, and we 
don't turn away customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Penno have any regrets at his gadfly role. 
</P>
<P>
 'We're all aware that we're just one ridgeline away from L.A.," he said. "And 
yet, Topanga's a place where you can still smell the earth. It's small-town 
America, with the local paper, the gas station, the post office and two general 
stores." JOSEPH HANANIA

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; GALLERY OWNER LEAPS TO DEFEND JESSICA RABBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jessica Rabbit is no floozy.  
</P>
<P>
 Or so say her supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Gallery owner Howard Lowery defended the voluptuous cartoon redhead 
Tuesday, saying she played a pivotal -- and not solely sexual -- role in 
Disney's 1988 animated/live action film "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, who owns the Howard Lowery Galley in Burbank, has been buying, selling 
and auctioning animated art since the early 1970s.  
</P>
<P>
 Jessica, he said, is supposed to work with the animated character of Roger 
Rabbit to persuade a down-on-his-luck live action detective played by Bob 
Hoskins to investigate a murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by 9-by-12-inch animated cels of Jessica in various risque 
positions, Lowery said rumors that the character appears partially nude in the 
laser-disc version of the movie have been circulating among animated art 
collectors for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a Hollywood trade publication reported that several frames of the 
film show Jessica in compromising positions, including appearing without 
underwear. Disney declined to comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of several controversial scenes, which reportedly involves three to 
four frames, Jessica's skirt is hiked up above her waist after a fall off a 
motorcycle.  
</P>
<P>
 The first frame, visible because viewers can freeze a disc frame by frame 
using a laser disc player, shows Jessica wearing underwear. In the next frame, 
however, Jessica appears to have nothing on at all.  
</P>
<P>
 Someone watching the movie on a VCR or at a theater would be unable to see 
these cels because there are up to 24 frames per second in an animated picture, 
Lowery said.  
</P>
<P>
 Animators often "get carried away" when they're creating an animated film 
peppered with mischievous characters, Lowery said, adding that artists may add 
X-rated scenes to otherwise wholesome cartoons purely as a joke. JENNIFER

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; RESERVE DEPUTY WINS 
ANNUAL SHERIFF'S AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than 21 years, David Simon worked by day as the owner of a successful 
public relations agency. By night, he donned a uniform, a gun, and a badge and 
hit the streets as a reserve deputy sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 For his smooth transition from spin doctor for high-tech industry to deputy 
sheriff ferreting out "just the facts, ma'am," Simon has been honored as Los 
Angeles County's Reserve Deputy Sheriff of the Year. Selected from the 900 or 
so reserve deputies, Simon will be feted at an April 24 luncheon at the Music 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 63, he has worked all the big details: patrol, traffic, homicide and, 
for the past four years, forgery-fraud, where he investigates computer crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his reserve work now takes him into the highly specialized and 
relatively safe world of white-collar crime, Simon thinks like a street cop. 
Like many officers, he won't disclose where he lives. "Just say I live in the 
Valley," he says, acknowledging that he may have made a criminally-inclined 
enemy or two over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger, or potential for danger, is part of the excitement for some 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never shot anyone or been shot at," Simon says. "I was in a lot of 
places where there were people holding weapons in their hands and they chose 
not to fire them. There are a lot of guns and knives on the street. The fact 
that you have been doing it for years and it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean 
it won't happen tomorrow. It's a risk you take." 
</P>
<P>
 All this for the princely sum of $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most reservists have full-time jobs elsewhere, and work as part-time deputies 
in their free time. They undergo training and are sworn peace officers. Often 
they offer help in their particular area of expertise. Uniform reserves work 
the patrol cars and others are assigned to juvenile crime, narcotics, or the 
detective bureau. There are medical reserves, search and rescue reserves, 
marine diver reserves, motorcycle reserves -- even a mounted posse of reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 For Simon, filling up free time has never been a problem: He's also on the 
boards of directors of the Los Angeles Mozart Orchestra, the Odyssey Theater 
and for five years served on the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But the streets of Los Angeles always beckon, as they have for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was working patrol, I would finish a long day at the office and go to 
the station and put on a uniform. It was like a whole new day started," Simon 
says. "What I'm doing now is really interesting and challenging -- and a fair 
amount of whodunnit," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Ruth, indulges her husband's avocation. "As a PR type of guy, you 
have a doubt that what you are doing is meaningful. I checked his insurance and 
it said he was covered. I figured if he enjoyed it, I might as well let him do 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 When Simon sold his company and retired, it just gave him more time for the 
sheriff's office -- sometimes more than 40 hours a week.  
</P>
<P>
 The reserves, says sheriff's operations Sgt. Ben Kirtley, "just hook and book 
like anybody else." He said they play "an integral part" in the sheriff's 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 In nominating Simon, his superiors praised him for the sophistication of his 
investigations: "One of these included a major fraud case involving a 
telecommunications company that was ultimately presented to the grand jury for 
indictment. The investigation took over three years to complete and resulted in 
conviction of the three main suspects." 
</P>
<P>
 "He handles all his cases as if he was a regular employee," Lt. Jerry Dunphy 
says. "He files his own cases, assists the district attorney at the preliminary 
hearing and trial. He receives complex cases and spends numerous hours on those 
cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon says it's fun.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN STUDENTS TO VOTE ON FEE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Student Senate at Cal State Northridge has voted overwhelmingly to seek 
approval from students for a proposed $40 fee increase for athletics in next 
month's balloting for student elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action Tuesday, the senate also voted to ask students to approve 
a first step toward changing the school's nickname. As a result, the April 
ballot will ask students to authorize a marketing study to learn the effects of 
scrapping the existing nickname, Matadors, and replacing it with Quakes, or 
another moniker. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a Student Senate committee rejected the name Quakes for fear of a 
lawsuit by a minor league baseball team, the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. However, 
today's vote brings the proposal back. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of putting to a vote the proposed fee increase, which would be phased 
in over the next five years, was approved by the senate on a 17-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 If students approve the increase and administrators agree, fees paid to the 
Associated Students would more than double by the 1998-99 school year, 
increasing from $32 to $72 per semester. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee increase was proposed by the Northridge Athletics Congress and backed 
by the athletics department, which contends the money is needed for athletic 
scholarships and increased participation in women's sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Although recent tuition increases at Cal State Northridge have been debated on 
campus and blamed for lagging enrollment, the senate Tuesday spent little time 
debating the effect of an extra $80 per year in fees on students' pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 One senator, though, graduate student Peter Egeghy, argued against it, saying 
that the turnout in student elections is notoriously small and that approval 
might not signify a real mandate for the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in favor of the motion cited the lack of resources in CSUN's athletic 
department, the need for more women's sports, and the difficulties of athletes 
who must hold down jobs for extra cash to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students will benefit from their investment in athletes, argued Richard 
Gitahi, a distance runner and accounting student who argued for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Student athletes bring recognition back to the university," he said. JILL

<TEXT>
<P>
 A charity golf tournament to raise money to start a Boys & Girls Club in 
Burbank has been scheduled for April 29 at DeBell Municipal Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about $31,000 has been raised for the club, and organizers of the golf 
tournament predict the event will raise at least $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers are trying to line up sponsors for each hole, and so far support 
has come from associations of Burbank police, firefighters and city employees, 
an auto dealership, a local union and Walt Disney Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament had been planned for last October, but was canceled because the 
date conflicted with another golf tournament fund-raiser. ED BOND

 The body of a 46-year-old man was found inside his Van Nuys home by a pizza 
delivery driver, Los Angeles police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Colman was found Monday night in his home in the 14000 block of 
Bessemer Street with a single gunshot wound to the upper body, said Lt. Richard 
Blankenship, acting commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys 
homicide unit. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor told police that about noon Monday, Colman had a loud argument with 
a man inside the house, Blankenship said. The neighbor, whom police did not 
identify, also told investigators that a noise that might have been a gunshot 
was heard coming from the house about that time, Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colman's body was discovered about 7 p.m. when a pizza delivery driver 
mistakenly went to the victim's house with a pizza, police said. TIMOTHY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: STORM NOT LIKELY TO SLOW ROAD REPAIRS

<P>
 The third strong storm of the year is expected to arrive in the Southland on 
Thursday night, but it isn't likely to slow down efforts to repair 
quake-damaged roads or buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the work we're involved in currently involves demolition and heavy 
equipment," Caltrans spokesman Russell Snyder said Tuesday."The rain shouldn't 
hinder that." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday and Saturday pose the best chance for showers, and possibly 
thunderstorms, that could produce mudslides in areas affected by wildfires, 
said meteorologist Curtis Brack of WeatherData Inc., in Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to three inches of rain may fall in the mountains and up to an inch along 
the coast before clearing occurs on Sunday or Monday, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm is the result of a trough of low pressure falling south from the 
Gulf of Alaska and pulling in tropical moisture from the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Van Nuys Superior Court building, court manager Zoe Venhuizen said she 
anticipated that the seventh floor would be reopened today. It had been closed 
since Monday due in part to damaged ceiling tiles and light diffusers. VIVIEN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; DRIVE TO HONOR CHAVEZ RECOGNIZED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of residents surprised San Fernando City Council member Jose Hernandez 
by presenting him with a plaque for his drive to make San Fernando the first 
city in the nation to make Cesar Chavez's birthday a legal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one time when there was no quarrel," said Hernandez, clearly moved 
by the honor, which took place during a council meeting Monday."There was a 
full consensus to honor this American hero. Cesar Chavez represents traditional 
American values, which are close to our hearts. He believed in the dignity of 
the working man, and he preached nonviolence in the face of aggression." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously last June 7 to make Chavez's birthday, March 31, 
a city holiday. Hernandez proposed the idea last year after residents in the 
city, which is 83% Latino, pushed for a permanent tribute to the late Chicano 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Orijel was chosen to speak on the behalf of the Cesar Chavez Memorial 
Committee, the group that had originally pushed for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that it was important to bring forward the contribution of Cesar 
Chavez to human rights," she said. "We wanted young people to know what this 
great man stood for, and (Councilman) Hernandez helped us realize that." MIGUEL 
BUSTILLO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; PROBATION GIVEN IN ABANDONMENT CASE

<P>
 A Reseda woman was placed on probation Tuesday and ordered to continue 
psychiatric care as a result of her conviction on charges of leaving her 
18-month-old daughter in a shopping cart in a West Hills discount store. 
</P>
<P>
 Hang Tran, 35, pleaded guilty Feb. 3 to one misdemeanor count of child 
abandonment as a result of the incident in the Target store at the Fallbrook 
Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main position was that she receive treatment and (to ensure) the safety 
of the kids," Deputy Dist. Atty. Leonard J. Shaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran pleaded no contest -- the equivalent of a guilty plea in criminal court 
proceedings -- as a result of a plea bargain in which prosecutors dismissed two 
felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Judge Jessica Perrin Silvers sentenced Tran to three years 
probation and ordered that all contact with her two children be supervised by a 
responsible adult. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim in the child abandonment case recently turned 2 years old. A second 
daughter, a 10-month-old, was not left in the store. The children are currently 
being cared for by the parents of Tran's estranged husband, who live in El 
Toro, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran is undergoing treatment in the Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives have blamed the incident on Tran's mental illness and her inability 
to speak English. Tran lived in Vietnam during the war and fled when Communists 
took over South Vietnam. THOM MROZEK

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FIRM FINED $2,000 FOR LATE DISCLOSURE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A major development firm will not be able to obtain any building permits from 
Los Angeles County until it pays a $2,000 fine imposed Tuesday for failing to 
report its lobbying activity on time. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors fined Dale Poe Development Corp. of Agoura 
Hills despite a last-minute move by the developer to avoid the penalty.The 
company filed its quarterly lobbying report Monday -- two months and one day 
after it was due. The company, best known for building Stevenson Ranch, a 
master-planned housing community in Santa Clarita, listed no activity in the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is the first to be sanctioned under the county's tough new 
ordinance on lobbying, said Larry Monteilh, executive officer of the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday, but earlier this 
week attributed the delay to a shake-up in the firm after the death of founder 
Dale Poe in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance requires lobbyists and their employers to submit quarterly 
reports on all money spent on lobbying activities, including campaign 
contributions. Companies and groups that spend more than $5,000 on public 
relations campaigns to influence county officials also have to report their 
expenses, even if they do not hire a lobbyist. The law also prohibits lobbyists 
from giving gifts worth more than $50 to public officials. TRACEY KAPLAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FREE QUAKE DEBRIS REMOVAL TO CONTINUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A free curbside quake debris removal program for Los Angeles residents will 
continue in the San Fernando Valley until June 30, city officials said. The 
program will end for the rest of Los Angeles on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 Northridge quake, contractors hired by the city's Department 
of Public Works have removed about 120,000 tons of quake rubble and debris. 
Most of the cleanup has been completed in the Los Angeles areas south of 
Mulholland Drive and in the Sunland-Tujunga areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But because an additional 100,000 tons of debris remain in the Valley and many 
property owners are still waiting for federal emergency and insurance 
inspectors, the free cleanup program will be extended in the Valley, said 
Andres Santamaria, director of the newly formed quake cleanup division. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup teams are still driving through the hardest-hit areas of the Valley in 
search of quake debris. But to make certain that debris from a home or business 
is not missed, property owners can call the Bureau of Engineering at (800) 
498-CITY. HUGO MARTIN

SUSPECT IN COMPUTER THEFTS ARRESTED; CRIME: MAN LINKED TO A SERIES OF LOS 
ANGELES-AREA ROBBERIES IS CAPTURED IN PHILADELPHIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Philadelphia authorities have arrested a man linked to a ring of Los 
Angeles-area thieves who robbed people trying to sell expensive computers 
through classified ads, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Worline was arrested about 11:30 p.m. Monday as he stepped off a plane 
at Philadelphia International Airport, said Detective Bill Speer of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division, which is investigating 
the series of at least nine robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was quite surprised," said Speer. "He probably never thought we'd 
track him down." 
</P>
<P>
 Worline, 23, of Inglewood, is one of several men suspected of going to 
victims' homes under the pretense of looking at the top-of-the-line Macintosh 
computer systems they had advertised for sale, and then stealing the machines 
and other valuables, said Speer. He said that Philadelphia authorities arrested 
Worline on a fugitive warrant after being contacted by Los Angeles police, and 
that he will be extradited as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Worline was the bandit who shot two Reseda men Saturday night 
while attempting to rob them of a computer, and that he suffered gunshot wounds 
to the buttocks after being shot by one of his victims in a gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
 After escaping the victims' house, Worline returned to South-Central Los 
Angeles and called 911 for medical treatment, reporting that he had been 
wounded in a drive-by shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, police already had identified Worline as a suspect and were seeking 
him for questioning, said Speer. An arrest warrant was obtained Monday, when 
authorities learned that he was in the process of fleeing to Philadelphia to 
escape arrest, Speer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The armed thieves responded to ads in the weekly Recycler, a classified ad 
publication, and have struck at homes on the Westside, South Bay and other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have outstanding suspects in this," Speer said. "We will attempt to 
identify them, but Kenneth definitely is a part of the ring." 
</P>
<P>
 Worline will be charged with three counts of attempted murder, since three 
people were in the house Saturday night when he allegedly tried to rob them 
before exchanging gunfire with one resident, Speer said. He said Worline will 
also be charged with one count each of attempted robbery and burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 After Worline called 911, he was taken to Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical 
Center where he was treated for gunshot wounds. At the hospital, he was 
interviewed by police, who were unable to find any witnesses to verify his 
account of a drive-by shooting. That interview, however, helped police 
corroborate other evidence linking Worline to the Saturday shooting, Speer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the gunshot victims have identified Worline through photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims of Saturday night's shooting remained in critical but 
stable condition at a Northridge hospital, with wounds in the chest and leg. 
The other victim was treated for a superficial gunshot wound to the chest and 
released.

CANDIDATES IN VALLEY RACES RELYING ON LOANS TO FUND CAMPAIGNS; POLITICS: 
FINANCE DISCLOSURE REPORTS ARE FILED. CONTENDERS CITE TOUGH FINANCIAL TIMES, 
CROWDED FIELDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Campaign finance reports filed Tuesday reveal that candidates for several 
high-profile San Fernando Valley-based seats are relying heavily on borrowed 
money to finance their political quests, with one tapping his own wallet for 
$125,000 while another got a $275,000 loan from a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates say tough financial times and a plethora of office seekers and 
races have forced them to increasingly finance their own campaigns or turn to 
family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of nights that we can hold a fund-raiser and not have it conflict 
with other fund-raisers are few and far between," said Adam Schiff, a former 
assistant U.S. attorney who is running in the Democratic primary for the 43rd 
District state Assembly seat formerly held by Pat Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff has borrowed $50,000, at 4% interest, from his family to finance his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday was the deadline for filing campaign finance disclosure reports for 
the 13 candidates seeking Nolan's old seat, based in the Glendale-Burbank area, 
and the 10 candidates running for the 41st District seat held by state 
Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Brentwood). The reports were for the period Jan. 
1 to March 17.  
</P>
<P>
 Nolan was forced to resign last month after pleading guilty to one count of 
political racketeering, while Friedman is running for a Superior Court 
judgeship.  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest borrower in the two hotly contested races was Peter Repovich, an 
LAPD officer with sizable real estate investments, who borrowed $275,000 from 
Susan E. Barnes, a Los Angeles therapist, at 7% interest to get his campaign 
for the 43rd District going. Repovich also has raised $71,000 in direct 
contributions from dozens of donors, giving him a war chest of $346,000 to run 
against seven others in the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Having little to show in his fund-raising statement was Municipal Court Judge 
James E. Rogan, who was strongly endorsed earlier this month at a 
mini-convention of area Republicans for the 43rd District seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Rogan said he did not seek the Nolan seat until the last minute and thus was 
able to raise only $10,578 before the filing period ended for the current 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 A report for Julia Wu, a Los Angeles Community College candidate also running 
for the Nolan seat, was not available Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the 41st District, attorney Edward Tabash of Malibu took the 
lead in fund raising among those running in the Democratic primary when he 
pumped $125,000 of his own money into the campaign in the form of a no-interest 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the 41st District Democratic primary also relied heavily on 
borrowing to put together their war chests. 
</P>
<P>
 Law professor Sheila Kuehl reported that she raised a total of $70,425, with 
$20,000 of this being a loan; businessman John Shallman's entire campaign war 
chest of $20,525 came from a loan to himself; and attorney Bill Rothbard 
reported that $15,000 of his $85,000 came from a loan to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fund raising is particularly hard now because of the tight economy due to the 
recession and to the earthquake damage," Rothbard said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's also incredible competition for financial resources because of the 
crowded election year," he added. In addition to the statewide elections for 
U.S. Senate and governor, Los Angeles has a bumper crop of sharply fought local 
elections this year, including one to recall state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 But Rothbard added, "Having to borrow is an indication of one's political 
support or lack thereof." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidates for the 41st seat could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky has continued to extend 
his vast fund-raising lead over his opponents for the 3rd District seat on the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Yaroslavsky reported Tuesday that he 
had raised $176,000 during the last two and half months, bringing his total for 
the campaign to $900,000. Former Fire Capt. Don Wallace, widely seen as 
Yaroslavsky's nearest competition, has raised only $16,500 for his campaign.

JUDGE TRIES TO BLOCK RIVAL'S STATEMENT; POLITICS: REQUEST FOR AN ORDER TO KEEP 
COMMENTS OFF BALLOT IS DENIED. A HEARING IS SCHEDULED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Arguing that it is a personal attack on him, a Burbank Municipal Court judge 
is trying to block county election officials from printing the ballot statement 
submitted by a lawyer running against him in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Judge Marion E. Gubler asked a Superior Court judge Tuesday 
for a restraining order preventing the county clerk from printing the statement 
of Rand Rubin, a lawyer who lives and practices in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing before Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne, Gubler's lawyer said 
Rubin's statement violates a California Elections Code section that limits what 
candidates in judicial elections may say in comments that appear on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The law states that candidates may comment on their "own personal background 
and qualifications," but it prohibits them from making references to other 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin's statement "goes into great detail, into an attack on the Burbank 
courts," said Gubler's lawyer, Jerry K. Staub. "He's simply not allowed to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne denied the request for a restraining order, but scheduled a hearing on 
the case three days before the ballots are scheduled to be printed and 
encouraged both sides to try to resolve the dispute themselves before then. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy stems from references to "the Burbank Court" that appear in 
Rubin's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments such as, "Burbank Courts are wasting taxpayer money" and "our Burbank 
Court has been censured by the California Supreme Court for its mistreatment of 
our citizens," are personal attacks on Gubler, Staub said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984 the Commission on Judicial Performance publicly censured Gubler for 
his "zealous efforts to obtain payment from criminal defendants" in an effort 
to reimburse the county for legal services provided by the public defender's 
office. He was also censured for authorizing the private sale of guns 
confiscated from convicted criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin's attorney, Phillip L. Heeger, said the statement was not an attack on 
Gubler. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't refer to the judge, it refers to the Burbank courts," Heeger said. 
"I think the language speaks for itself."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; RAIL LINE FORCES BUSINESSES TO MOVE; 
TRANSPORTATION: CONSTRUCTION OF A 10-MILE EXTENSION OF THE METROLINK ROUTE INTO 
LANCASTER LEADS TO THE RELOCATION ALONG SIERRA HIGHWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nine Sierra Highway businesses will be relocated to make way for commuter rail 
tracks being laid between Palmdale and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink spokesman Francisco Oaxaca said the decision to move all of the 
businesses adjacent to the tracks between avenues J and K was made last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Stanger, Metrolink executive director, decided that relocation was the 
safest thing to do. It would also make installing the tracks easier. Initially, 
it was thought that only a few businesses would have to relocate or do minor 
remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Oaxaca said Metrolink is expecting most of the costs to be borne by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink commuter rail service was extended to the Antelope Valley in the 
wake of the Jan. 17 earthquake that crippled Southland freeways. The 
Metropolitan Transit Authority already owned track between Santa Clarita and 
Palmdale, but it did not have any line along the 10-mile stretch between 
Palmdale and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a temporary agreement, trains have been able to run to Lancaster on 
Southern Pacific track since service began Jan. 24, Oaxaca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink is building its track between Sierra Highway and the existing line 
within a 40-foot corridor that MTA purchased from Southern Pacific more than a 
year ago. The nine businesses that are being relocated are on the MTA-owned 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Oaxaca said the $12 million in track work is about 60% complete and should be 
finished by the first week in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The businesses, at least one of which has already moved, were given notice 
that they have to be off the property by June 14, Oaxaca said. "The idea is to 
have them out as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The businesses will be given money to help with relocation costs but amounts 
have not been determined, he said. "Results of the appraisals and cost 
estimates are not complete yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Jordan and Yolanda Higuera, co-owners of a hair salon called The 
Bushwackers, are being forced to relocate after 17 years at their Sierra 
Highway location. 
</P>
<P>
 They are keeping an optimistic view about their pending move. "What are you 
going to do?" Jordan asked. "You have to make the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Higuera added: "We have to go. It isn't like we can fight them. We just don't

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAJOR DEVELOPER PREPARES SANTA CLARA RIVER 
BLUEPRINT; ENVIRONMENT: NEWHALL LAND AND FARMING CO. PROPOSES 49 CONSTRUCTION 
CHANGES ALONG A 15-MILE STRETCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A major developer here has prepared a blueprint for construction along 15 
miles of the Santa Clara River that is expected to influence development along 
the entire waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 The document outlines 49 changes to the river -- bridges, levees, bank 
controls -- over the next 15 to 20 years and is subject to approval by the U. 
S. Army Corps of Engineers. The agency is accepting written comment from the 
public through April 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real balance between wildlife values, resource values, utilities and 
development issues," said Mark Subbotin, vice president of planning for Newhall 
Land and Farming Co., which wrote the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land has been working toward comprehensive river management guidelines 
since 1986, including this specific plan for the past 18 months, and has spent 
more than $500,000 on river-related studies, Subbotin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for preserving the Santa Clara River's natural soft bottom and 
adding materials to riverbank sections where erosion occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10% of the 1,300 acres of river land addressed by the document would be 
somehow modified, with a net addition of five acres of riverbed. Earth would be 
deposited to build up 62 cumulative acres of riverbank land and inhibit 
erosion, and another 67 acres would be excavated to widen the waterway in 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
 The work regulates the river's path without narrowing the banks and covering 
them with concrete. Concrete channels speed up water flow, scour a riverbed 
farther downstream, disrupt river wildlife and prohibit water from seeping into 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists agree that the plan can set a precedent for future 
construction along the 100-mile river, but are cautious to endorse it. Few have 
yet read the plan's two 4-inch-thick bundles of supporting documents, and 
cursory glances haven't erased their skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I can see, there's a lot of bank stabilization going on and I'm 
distressed about that," said Lynne Plambeck, vice president of the Santa 
Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Any plan for the Santa Clara River should call for both a soft river bottom 
and natural banks to allow as much absorption of water into the ground as 
possible, Plambeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Friends of the Santa Clara River are to meet with Newhall Land 
officials today to discuss the plan. Chairman Ron Bottorff is concerned that 
the document is too restrictive for the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though they don't call it much of an impact by their standards, we think 
it is significant in how much it (limits) the meandering of the river," 
Bottorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists said they hadn't examined the plan enough to comment on its 
creation of additional riverbed land. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the plan should be discussed in public hearings before the Army 
Corps of Engineers rather than simply addressed by written letters. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also have had only a cursory read of the document, but say any 
long-range plan for the river will assist their efforts to prepare for the 
river's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking forward to learning more about it," said Jeff Kolin, deputy 
city manager.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEW DAY-CARE CENTER TO BE LEARNING TOOL FOR 
STUDENTS; LEARNING: SITE AT ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEGE WILL BENEFIT EARLY 
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAM, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 It may be the smallest of the new buildings popping up at Antelope Valley 
College, but in terms of impact, the college president believes the Child 
Development Center may be the largest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It opens up a whole new program on campus we never had," Allan Kurki said. 
"It's something the college has been talking about more than 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The 8,822-square-foot center will serve a dual purpose: provide another 
day-care opportunity in the community and offer early childhood education 
students a chance for hands-on experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The early childhood (program) has really worked in a vacuum for many years 
because we haven't been able to put into practice the learning in the 
classroom," said Selma Minet, an Antelope Valley College instructor who 
oversees the early childhood education program. "This will provide an 
opportunity to model the best in early childhood education, to have students 
work under master teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Once construction on the $1.6-million center is complete, expected in about 
one year, Minet said all early childhood education students will likely be 
required to spend at least one semester gaining practical experience by 
spending time at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Walton, a state community colleges facilities planning and utilization 
specialist, said it is because child development centers provide an educational 
opportunity for students that the state has recently been willing to fund them. 
</P>
<P>
 The centers are still, however, found at only a small number of the more than 
100 community colleges in the state, he said. That is changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of them in the mill," Walton said, noting that in the past 
two years the state has funded about a dozen centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley College will receive nearly $1.4 million from the state to pay 
for construction of the center, said Bill Fellers, assistant superintendent of 
facilities planning and campus development. The college will kick in another 
$220,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Minet said the college has only recently started determining whether children 
of students or staff will be given priority admission, and how much it will 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will have room for 60 children, ages 6 weeks to 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly going to get it going as fast as we can," she said. "At the 
center of all our thinking is the development of the child."

DROPPING OUT; RATE DECLINES AT VALLEY HIGH SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A majority of the 16 regular high schools in the San Fernando Valley recorded 
a decline in dropout rates last year, according to Los Angeles Unified School 
District figures released last week. Districtwide, the number of dropouts -- 
decreased from 15.28% to 13.51%. 
</P>
<P>
 The dropout rates -- which the district began recording in 1985 -- show the 
actual number of students who missed more than 45 days of school without 
officially transferring to another school or alternative education program. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education uses a different method to calculate dropout 
rates, projecting figures over a three-year period to show how many 10th grade 
students actually finish high school. The 1991-1992 state figure for the 
district was about 37%. Los Angeles Unified School District

SEIDLER-FELLER ON HEBRON MASSACRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller ("Look Within for the Personification of Evil," 
Commentary, March 14) sees darkness and demons in the soul of Jews generally 
because one man, living under siege and betrayed by his government, committed a 
massacre. The rabbi, a board member of Peace Now, should have addressed his 
remarks to the Arabs, whose purpose he serves, since they have had much more 
experience in committing massacres. He evidently didn't see darkness in the 
soul of Jews during all the long years they were victims of Arab terrorism, and 
evidently not yet in Arab souls. 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp contrast to Arab massacres, the recent Hebron massacre was not 
planned and encouraged by a government or an organization, and virtually every 
Israeli government official and citizen with access to the media have rushed to 
publicly condemn the killings. Nonetheless, predictably, the Arabs and others 
are vilifying all Israelis and they are trying to extract even more 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 B. MEHLMAN

</P>
<P>
 As a religious Jew, I take offense to Rabbi Seidler-Feller's commentary. How 
can he claim that anyone teaching has the power of evoking violence, any more 
than one can blame a line in a song or book for an individual's actions? 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially true when quoting about Amalek, a people that contemporary 
Jewish sources consider to be unrecognizable to us today. It is ridiculous to 
criticize Jewish teaching for Baruch Goldstein just as it would be to criticize 
Christian doctrine for David Koresh. Neither Christianity nor Judaism 
intentionally encourages violent aggression of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kach Party and Kahane Chai must be recognized as a fringe group, outside 
mainstream Orthodoxy. And though militant, they, unlike Hamas, have not 
accepted terrorism as a policy for determining the outcome of the peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Seidler-Feller's assertion that the Jews have made Palestinian Arabs 
the Amalek of this generation, I argue that if anything, Israel has been very 
tolerant to an Arab world largely hostile to the state of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I resent Seidler-Feller's implication that only religious Jews are 
extremist. What about Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, both of whom were 
leaders of underground movements, Leumi Zvi and the Stern Group, that through 
the result of their actions caused the death of innocents during the British 
Mandate in Palestine. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Seidler-Feller deftly sidesteps the basic issue of the pernicious influence of 
religion in secular affairs throughout history. In the Zionist movement the 
inspiring driving forces were non-religious humanists; the yarmulkes and beards 
were merely a latter-day sprinkling among the vast majority. Today they are 
trying to do to the democratic land of Israel, which from its outset has 
welcomed all peace-loving people to its shores without imposing any beliefs 
upon them, what religious zealots throughout history did and still try to do: 
to impose their will on the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning them in Israel is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM S. GREENE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As a strong critic of the Kach and Kahane Chai organizations, and as one who 
debated Rabbi Meir Kahane on national TV and condemned in the strongest terms 
the actions of Baruch Goldstein in an article published in papers across the 
country recently, I believe that the Israeli government decision to ban the 
Kach and Kahane Chai organizations is fundamentally flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as I despise the philosophies of Kach and Kahane Chai, in a democratic 
state debate in the open marketplace of ideas is critical. To arbitrarily 
arrest individuals for being part of a group even if they have committed no 
wrong act is contrary to democratic principles. 
</P>
<P>
 All arbitrary administrative detention directed against Jews or Arabs is 
wrong. It is illegal in America and should be declared illegal in Israel as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Even from the perspective of the Israeli government, which today wrongfully 
carries out arbitrary arrests, the Rabin administration does so selectively and 
is guilty of a double standard. Of the thousand convicted Palestinian 
terrorists, including many from Hamas who were released recently, none were 
asked to give up their ideological commitments or beliefs. These individuals 
are allowed to roam the roads of Israel with no restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO's national council has never formally denounced terrorism and 
according to news reports the PLO has entered into a working alliance with 
Hamas. If they can operate an office in Jerusalem and PLO flags can be flown 
all over the city, then it should not be illegal to wear a Kach T-shirt.

 Malaysia is a country of rich cultural diversity, with many ethnic groups and 
a long history of trading with other cultures. Business relationships reflect 
this background. DO: 
</P>
<P>
 - Allow time for businesses to make decisions on your proposals. Malaysians 
tend to be cautious and want time to shop around. 
</P>
<P>
 - Expect most Malaysian workers to speak English. Most learn English from the 
first grade and the literacy rate is over 75%. However, correspondence with 
government departments should be in Bahasa Malaysia, the national language. 
</P>
<P>
 - Check ahead on how to address the person you are meeting, especially if it's 
someone of royalty. Titles can be complicated, but it helps to use them 
correctly.  
</P>
<P>
 - Use taxis -- they're a lot cheaper than the ones in the United States. 
Rental cars tend to cost more, especially if you need an automatic 
transmission. If you choose to drive, note that vehicles drive on the left side 
of the road. Malaysia has in recent years greatly expanded and improved its 
highways and rail lines.  
</P>
<P>
 - Date documents the way Malaysians do to avoid confusion: day/month/year.  
</P>
<P>
 - Accommodate religious needs. Because Islam is the official religion, some 
Muslim employees observe prayers at set times of the day. One of them is around 
7 p.m., so be prepared for a late dinner if you plan one. Also, it's 
traditional for men to attend noon prayers on Fridays at mosques. Those usually 
last an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 - Hire local lawyers because Malaysian laws are based on the British system. 
Local lawyers would be more familiar with details like registering a local 
company and handling disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 - Use pay phones to make long distance calls. They're found easily in major 
cities, and rates are comparable to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 - Meet with government officials because they're fairly accessible to foreign 
investors, and can provide networking opportunities. DON'T 
</P>
<P>
 - Say no directly. It's polite to listen to an entire proposal, think about 
it, and then excuse yourself from it. Expect the same from Malaysians -- they 
may not say no right away, but that doesn't mean they agree. Negative remarks 
are usually subtle.  
</P>
<P>
 - Make meal appointments with Muslims during the fasting month, known as 
Ramadan. Try to avoid ordering pork when dining with Muslims because it shows 
disrespect. Malaysian food can be extremely spicy, so tell your host if that's 
a problem for you. 
</P>
<P>
 - Expect open arms when competing with the domestic market. Because the local 
market is relatively small, export-oriented products are preferred. Joint 
ventures are generally favored among local investors. The Malaysian government 
also provides tax incentives in certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
 - Just rely on a handshake. But when there is a problem with a contract, be 
flexible. Malaysians are often willing to make reasonable adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 - Take legal action immediately when a business dispute occurs. That would 
shows a lack of respect. Try to resolve it, usually with a third party like 
another partner or manager. Only settle the situation in court if negotiations 
fail.  
</P>
<P>
 - Bank on similar banking hours as the U.S. The hours are shorter, from 10 
a.m. to 3 p.m. However, most banks are open on Saturdays from 9:30 a.m. to 
11:30 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 - Be offended if a member of the opposite sex refuses to shake your hand. 
Muslims may be simply following religious rules. 
</P>
<P>
 - Bring in weapons, illegal drugs or pornographic material. There's a death 
penalty for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 - Insist on using pounds and gallons as measuring standards. Only the metric 
system is used.

 Following years of rapid industrialization, the nation is now in a period of 
consolidation. It must manage its success while dealing with a labor shortage, 
infrastructure bottlenecks and the threat of inflation. A pragmatic and 
efficient government hopes to slow growth to a sustainable rate while 
diversifying the economy. The country benefits from minimal corruption and an 
educated work force. Manufactured Exports Malaysia is the world's largest 
exporter of computer chips and the third-largest chip producer, after the 
United States and Japan. It is home to Intel Corp.'s largest overseas plant. 
The nation has also become a major producer of VCRs and air-conditioning units. 
By 1991, electrical machinery, appliances and parts grew to 58% of total 
exports, which exceeded $40 billion last year. Labor Shortage Malaysia is 
essentially at full employment, with labor shortages in the industrial regions. 
Restrictions on foreign workers were lifted in 1992, but multinational firms 
generally must draw workers from rural areas. Wages and benefits have risen 
faster than productivity. The average daily wage was about $6.50 last year, 
compared to $1.50 in Indonesia and Vietnam. However, Malaysia's skilled labor 
force has begun to resemble those of countries with higher labor rates, such as 
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Agriculture The government has encouraged 
palm oil production since 1960, and Malaysia is now the largest producer and 
exporter of the oil, accounting for about 55% of world production in 1992. 
Overall, agriculture provided about 15.7% of gross domestic product in 1992 and 
engaged 26% of the population. But income is distributed unevenly in rural 
areas because agriculture is divided into relatively high-income estates, 
predominantly owned by ethnic Indians and Chinese, and a low-productivity 
sector composed of indigenous groups. A major aim of the government has been to 
redress the balance. Consumer Demand Growth has created a large lower-middle 
class that seeks credit to buy durable goods and property. Although the 
government hopes to dampen demand for imports by restricting credit, consumer 
spending is robust. Passenger car sales rose a remarkable 32.7% in the third 
quarter of 1993, and a new local vehicle factory is beginning operations. 
Rubber Traditionally the principal export, rubber has declined in importance. 
The acreage planted with rubber trees has been cut due to falling prices and 
the labor shortage. In 1991, Indonesia and Thailand superseded Malaysia as the 
world's major rubber producers. Tin and Oil Tin, another traditional export, 
has declined, making Malaysia the world's fifth- instead of second-largest 
producer. Of 847 tin mines operating in 1980, only 63 were open in early 1993. 
Meanwhile, oil has emerged as the largest export earner, accounting for almost 
9% of the total in 1992. About a quarter of the oil goes to Singapore, while 
most of the rest is sent to Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Reserves, mostly 
offshore, should keep production at current levels for at least another decade.

O.C. MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES; CHAMBER GROUPS FIND POWER IN SMALL NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lots of American orchestras are floundering in red ink these days. Chamber 
groups, on the other hand, are generally doing fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? Chamber music has "portability, durability and resilience," says 
David Shifrin, artistic director of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you need for a chamber concert is a few people to play the music and a 
few people to listen," Shifrin said in a recent phone interview from 
Harrisburg, Pa., where the ensemble was starting a cross-country tour that 
continues at the Irvine Barclay Theatre today in a concert for the Orange 
County Philharmonic Society and the Laguna Beach Chamber Music Society. The 
group also plays at Pepperdine University in Malibu on Thursday and at the 
Queen Mary in Long Beach on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to fill a hall with thousands of people," he said. "Some of 
the most satisfying performances are in homes. You can adapt to environments as 
diverse as the home and the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can also talk about quality and economics in the same phrase because it's 
possible to hire a trio of the finest musicians in the world for a lot less 
than it costs to hire a 100-piece orchestra of the finest musicians in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the repertory supports it. There is far more chamber music than symphonic 
repertory. Beethoven wrote nine symphonies but maybe six evenings (worth) of 
string quartets. Mozart wrote a couple of hundred chamber works. Brahms wrote 
four symphonies, but with all the quartets and quintets he wrote, a quite 
amazing (chamber) repertoire is there." 
</P>
<P>
 The society will play the same program of work by Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel 
and Debussy at all three sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1969, the Lincoln Center group is currently celebrating its 25th 
season and has recently developed a different strategy for extending that 
longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing now," said Shifrin, "is to have clusters of concerts of 
brief tours, lasting a week and a half -- but to do many of them. So we do lots 
of different programs with different instrumental combinations, rather than 
booking a month of one-night stands, doing one program with one ensemble." 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup for this tour swing includes, besides clarinetist Shifrin, flutist 
Ransom Wilson, violinist Ani Kafavian, violists Paul Neubauer and Carmit Zori, 
cellist Fred Sherry and harpist Nancy Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way we get to vary the repertoire and vary what different sponsors might 
be interested in programming," Shifrin said. "It's an interesting puzzle to put 
together. It's also absolutely to survive and to keep it interesting for us as 
well as for the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Shifrin began playing as a guest with the group in 1980 and by 1989 had become 
a regular member. He became artistic director in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although chamber music has often embodied the most austere and abstract 
musical thinking of the great composers, Shifrin said that "the esoteric" label 
of the repertoire "simply doesn't hold true in my opinion. . . . You could say 
the same thing about symphonic repertoire: Webern's Five Pieces for Orchestra 
are not as accessible to people who know Beethoven's Fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program on this tour consists of the most accessible music one could ask 
for. Mozart's Clarinet Quintet is one of his most-heard pieces, and justifiably 
so. Ravel's Introduction and Allegro is this wonderful harp concerto. Debussy's 
Sonata is a unique piece. The Saint-Saens is a really charming violin solo with 
harp accompaniment." 
</P>
<P>
 To those who think chamber music lacks the instrumental variety and the big 
sound of an orchestra, Shifrin said: "What you lack in the big effects, the 
bombast, the big sound, you make up with immediacy and intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot to be said for chamber music in which one musician plays on a 
part and the audience can identify with the music-making, as opposed to a less 
personal music ensemble where as many as 16 people are playing the same line." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the audience becomes even more important in a chamber-music program, 
Shifrin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being close to the audience and having them involved in the music-making is 
an inspiring process, especially if you have the feeling that they're with you 
and involved with that," he said. "You feel that much more when you're in a 
smaller space. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're definitely aware of the audience. Otherwise, you would just want to 
make recordings, like some musicians have decided to do. But there is nothing 
like the live experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "On recordings you can make (the playing) note perfect, edit all you want, but 
a live event has a beginning, middle and end. It's an event where anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>

LAGUNA TO STUDY SLIDE DANGER IN MYSTIC HILLS AREA; DISASTER: FRUSTRATED 
RESIDENTS ARE TOLD AT SPECIAL COUNCIL MEETING IT COULD BE 8 TO 10 MONTHS BEFORE 
SOME FIRE VICTIMS GET PERMITS TO REBUILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Worried about the discovery of a possible geologic problem, the City Council 
voted 4 to 0 Tuesday night to further study the Mystic Hills area before some 
property owners are allowed to rebuild homes lost in the Oct. 27 firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 The special council meeting was called after a consultant reported that an 
ancient landslide may lie beneath about 50 lots in the neighborhood and that 
the land might have to be stabilized before reconstruction can safely begin. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials informed the council that if the hillsides must be stabilized, 
it could be eight to 10 months before some fire victims receive building 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The council took the action before about 150 frustrated residents who packed 
the council chambers urging the city to let them proceed with rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's get on with it," one of the fire victims said. "We want to get back in 
our homes." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to spend $35,000 on further geologic study that could take 
four to six weeks. The study is intended to determine whether an ancient 
landslide actually exists. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members expressed sympathy for residents eager to rebuild but 
said they must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the area is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lately life has been dealing us a tough deck," Councilwoman Lida Lenney said. 
"Just when you look around and think it can't it get any worse, it does." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert F. Gentry, whose Mystic Hills home burned in the fire, was 
on vacation and thus absent from the council meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 After news of the possible ancient landslide circulated through town Tuesday, 
contractors and architects filed steadily through City Hall seeking information 
about what it might mean to their rebuilding plans. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire that damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes in Laguna Beach, 
the city had promised to make the rebuilding effort as speedy as possible by 
expediting the permit approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while hillside residents must normally gather a "second opinion" 
from a city-hired geologist before getting a building permit, the city wanted 
to waive that requirement for fire victims, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, residents throughout the fire-damaged areas will have to take 
that additional step. They will be required to deposit $500 with the city for a 
second geologic review of their lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The snag in the rebuilding effort came after at least two geologists drilling 
test borings discovered evidence of a landslide almost 50 feet down. After 
studying the test results and aerial photographs, they "began to get a picture 
that something was wrong," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ground must be stabilized, one method would be to pour concrete into 
drilled holes and secure the posts with steel supports. If retrofitting is 
necessary, Frank said, it would have to be done on the entire section of 
hillside at once. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's in the middle of a slide and the slide is 50 feet deep, there is 
nothing you can do for one house at a time," he said. The work "would encompass 
the fire-damaged lots and the houses that are left standing so everybody's home 
would be made safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, whose Mystic hills home also burned, would not speculate how much 
retrofitting would cost, but said "I think most people will find it's 
financially feasible." It is unclear who would pay for the work if it is 
needed, Frank said, but added that he would likely recommend that a special tax 
assessment district be formed to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has received about 80 applications for building permits, and so far 
two have been approved. On Monday, city officials stopped work at one of the 
two sites because it is located in the potential slide area, which encompasses 
several streets on a hill above City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 While coming geological tests could reveal problems elsewhere in the city, 
Frank said he expects the inspection and permit approval process will go 
smoothly for most property owners.

RAMS MAY FACE EVICTION FROM PRACTICE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Rams have failed to come to terms on a lease agreement for 
their practice facility and have been told to expect an eviction notice as 
early as this week, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jack L. White said the city and the Rams have failed to beat a 
deadline set by Magnolia School District officials, the owners of the property, 
to sign a lease or face having the National Football League team evicted from 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look promising," White said about reaching a lease agreement with 
the Rams and preventing the team's eviction. "We're at the mercy of the school 
district." 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Tuesday night, White said, the city was still waiting to hear from 
the team about an 11th-hour proposal it had made. He said if the team accepts 
the offer today, he hopes the district will consider an extension of the 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia School District Supt. Paul S. Mercier said the district had not been 
formally notified of the lease impasse but said if the Rams refuse to sign an 
extension, "the district will be forced to ask them to vacate the property 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had hoped that this matter could have been resolved," said Mercier, who 
noted that the district's deadline for signing the lease already had been 
extended twice. "The Rams are making their decision. We're not kicking them 
out, they're walking away from a fair lease." 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Rams executive vice president, said he hasn't "even contemplated 
looking for a new practice facility, because it's incomprehensible to me that 
the city and school board would evict the Rams from their practice facility. 
Maybe I remain an optimist, but until we're actually evicted, I won't look for 
a new facility site." 
</P>
<P>
 The lease dispute is further indication of strained relations between city and 
Rams officials, who have publicly said they intend to explore moving to another 
city with greater financial opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a separate issue" from moving, said Shaw, who is in Orlando, Fla., 
this week for the NFL owners' meetings. "But I feel the city is giving us a 
signal in the way this whole matter has been handled." 
</P>
<P>
 City and district officials said they feel the same about the Rams' 
negotiating style. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the city and school district officials -- who lease the site to 
the city, which then sublets it to the Rams -- have tried unsuccessfully to 
meet the team's demands over the extension of the lease.  
</P>
<P>
 One point of contention is who should pay up to $1.2 million to restore the 
site, formerly the Juliette Low Elementary School, to its original condition 
should the Rams leave. The school district wants that amount, plus a $250,000 
penalty, if the team terminates the proposed lease early. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams say restoration costs plus the penalty are too much. They said the 
city implied in the past that it would pay half the restoration. But, Shaw 
said, after school district officials toured Rams Park and came up with a 
worst-case figure of $1.2 million, the city amended its offer to something 
significantly less. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was not acceptable," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has maintained that the Rams were obligated under their old lease, 
which expired Dec. 31, to pay for the restoration themselves. City Manager 
James D. Ruth said the city was willing to pay some restoration costs for 
changes made to accommodate the team when it moved into the facility 15 years 
ago, but the Rams have demanded more from the city.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no rational reason why we should pay for that," Ruth said. "We feel 
we've made every reasonable effort to resolve this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams say a larger issue causing a rift between the city and the team is 
the inadequate condition of Rams Park and promises the team believes the city 
has made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our understanding that the city would provide a new facility at the 
expiration of that lease or $7 million in improvements at Rams Park," Shaw 
said. "We have said that Rams Park is an inadequate facility; that's the whole 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they made no such promises. They have said in the past that 
the city only agreed to provide a new facility if the school district decided 
not to lease the site and reopen it as a school. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mercier said the district probably would ask the team to vacate 
immediately, he did not know when they would leave, noting that the Rams might 
try to challenge the action in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the Rams might consider legal action upon receiving an eviction 
notice, Shaw said, "We feel the city has breached a promise." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have announced they intend to exercise an escape clause in their 
Anaheim Stadium lease on May 3. They are currently being courted by several 
cities, including Baltimore and St. Louis.

COUNTY WILL HOLD SUMMIT ON TOURISM; LEISURE: SUPERVISORS SAY STRATEGY IS NEEDED 
TO COMBAT IMAGE PROBLEMS AND STEPPED-UP COMPETITION IN CRUCIAL INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling tourism "the lifeblood" of Orange County's economy, the Board of 
Supervisors agreed Tuesday to hold a summit geared toward crafting a marketing 
strategy that will lure more visitors and keep them here longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The tourism summit is expected to convene sometime in the next 30 days at the 
Anaheim Convention Center and will feature more than two dozen representatives 
of the tourism industry across the county, said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, 
who came up with the idea after meeting with tourist industry representatives 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 38 million tourists visited the county in 1991, the most recent 
year for which figures are available, and pumped $4.5 billion into the economy. 
But the recent spate of Southland disasters, combined with the recession and 
the lure of tourist meccas such as Las Vegas and San Francisco, have 
contributed to a decline over the past few years, Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the uprisings, the earthquakes and other issues have 
not only had an immediate effect on certain groups canceling, but others are 
choosing other areas," Vasquez said. "The underlying feeling is, 'We don't want 
to be here.' We need to regain some of that tourist dollar and there was a 
feeling that we needed to develop a countywide effort for marketing in order to 
do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said that in addition to the stigma of "fires, earthquakes, mudslides 
and everything else," Orange County is simply being beat out by other areas 
that have stepped up efforts to draw a wide range of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles and San Diego have recently expanded their convention center and 
meeting facilities, and most significant of all perhaps is the retooling of Las 
Vegas, which is now going after the family dollar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible topics for the summit: how to accommodate more trade shows and how to 
tap the Latin American tourist dollar, particularly travelers from Mexico who 
are increasingly visiting the region on business because of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, coordination will help visitors tap area resources with greater 
ease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a tourist in Orange County now, and you want tickets to the (Orange 
County) Performing Arts Center, tickets to Disneyland and tickets to the Pond, 
there isn't one number you can call to get them," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Packaging the county in a complete way may keep tourists here a day or two 
longer, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we promote the Mission at San Juan Capistrano, if we promote the Richard 
Nixon Library, and that results in a tourist staying an extra day or two . . . 
well, you multiply that by 10,000, and you have just increased your revenue 
significantly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez and Supervisor William G. Steiner recommended the summit, which will 
be co-hosted by Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not well-known that our performing and visual arts represent the 11th 
largest non-governmental employer in Orange County and $336 million a year in 
benefits," Steiner said. "That's why I think we need a broader approach to 
marketing our county, rather than the traditional Disneyland and Knott's Berry 
Farm. There's more to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner added that there are 130,000 people employed in the Orange County 
tourism industry -- in restaurants, hotels and amusement parks.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lot of people and a lot of jobs, and we need to nurture that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the summit prompted widespread support Tuesday from industry 
leaders, some of whom planned the summit with Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knott's is committed to participation at any level," said Knott's Berry Farm 
spokesman Bob Ochsner. "Out-of-area tourism is somewhat down, and it has a lot 
to do with the earthquake in the short term. But I think it also has something 
to do in the long run with a lack of cooperation among all the chambers, the 
bureaus and the various attractions." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Hynes, spokesman for the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, said conventions 
have kept up hotel business this year, but the number of leisure visitors are 
down.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have realized over the last several years that while our hotel is in 
Anaheim, near the Convention Center and just two blocks south of Disneyland, we 
are in Orange County and part of the appeal and the attraction should be that 
we are part of the fun and the sun of Southern California," Hynes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Ken Moore, president of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry: "To continue to assume that people will come without us making a 
coordinated effort is probably wrong. The objective of the summit is to be sure 
that people who come to visit our attractions, like Disneyland or Knott's Berry 
Farm, know that there are other things they can do, whether it's going to the 
beach or to the mountains, or to a (Mighty) Ducks game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The summit is part of a larger realization in Orange County that in order to 
compete for business as well as tourism, cities must come together, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The chamber is now working on a countywide economic development consortium and 
also expects to sign an agreement with the county in April for a film office 
that would promote Orange County to the television and film industry, Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When cities have pooled resources to market their goods, the effort pays off, 
said Diane Baker, president of the Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Baker won support from 16 cities and from Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder to publish a 32-page Orange County visitors guide. Now, about 5,000 a 
week are distributed through John Wayne Airport alone, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have inquiries from Australia and all over asking for more guides, and 
then they're calling the individual cities who advertised for more 
information," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker is spearheading a new brochure, scheduled for publication within two 
months, that touts the attractions of six coastal communities, from Long Beach 
to Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit is exactly the type of communication that will help individual 
cities attract more visitors and keep them in the region longer, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at regions, not just cities," she said. "The more 
communication you can get between the 31 cities in Orange County, the more 
opportunity you have for business. We need to focus on how safe this area is, 
and all the attractions, both the natural and all the man-made attractions, 
because we really have both."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CLEANUP CAMPAIGN SCHEDULED FOR MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city and the Laguna Fire Relief Coalition are promoting a communitywide 
garage sale and cleanup campaign for May in hopes of clearing out trash that 
could become a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will be encouraged to leave unwanted items at their curbs for 
pickup, donate items to nonprofit organizations and hold garage sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to help everybody, and it sounds like a lot of fun," said 
Councilwoman Kathleen Blackburn, who joined in the unanimous City Council vote 
endorsing the program last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ann Christoph said incentives may be added, such as giving a prize to 
someone who cleans out a garage that had been too full for a car. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to her colleagues, Christoph said the problems of accumulated trash 
are multifaceted. When vehicles are edged out of the garage, the city's parking 
problem is compounded and emergency vehicles that might be needed in case of a 
fire have less space in which to maneuver, the memo says. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Lida Lenney said she wondered whether recycled items might simply 
be relocated to another section of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a part of me that wonders if what somebody sells at one garage sale 
won't end up in the garage of another" resident, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Mangels, director of the Laguna Fire Relief Coalition, said she is 
hoping residents who hold garage sales will donate a percentage of the money 
collected to the coalition, which was formed after the October fire to help 
fire survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangels said coalition volunteers and members of the Boy Scouts of America 
will help residents sort, price and sell items. 
</P>
<P>
 The communitywide garage sale is scheduled for May 14. Throughout the 
following week, residents may place trash and unwanted items, including 
furniture, at curbside to be hauled away by Waste Management Inc. at no cost to 
the resident. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LEARNING PRINCIPLES OF PRINCIPALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi may have been the acting principal 
at a local high school Tuesday, but he was also a student. 
</P>
<P>
 During his visit to Valley High School in Santa Ana, the gubernatorial 
candidate took a crash course on running a campus and listened to the concerns 
of youngsters and school officials. Afterward, he said anyone in government who 
influences education should take a similar tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before you make educational policy, you should walk in the shoes" of 
educators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's visit coincided with a statewide event called "Principal for a 
Day," in which civic leaders and business people act as school administrators 
for a closer look at how students are educated. 
</P>
<P>
 At dozens of schools countywide, new "principals" from the community led 
campuses in the pledge of allegiance over intercoms, visited classrooms, and 
met with students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance commissioner, who subbed for Bob Nelson as principal at Valley, 
said that such visits can help local and state officials learn more about the 
school system and use that knowledge to improve it.  
</P>
<P>
 Strong schools are crucial for the community and the economy, he said. "If you 
don't have a good educational system, nothing else works. Everything falls 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
 During his visit, Garamendi taught an honor government and economics class. 
Stepping up to the lectern, he took off his coat, rolled up his sleeves and 
said with mock seriousness, "I'm your principal, so I don't want any messing 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi lectured on a topic he knows well: how campaigns for state office 
are run. He described how candidates primarily seek television coverage to 
reach voters, staging colorful, unusual events designed to draw media 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said they appreciated the visit. "It's good to see someone from the 
political area come to school. It's a good idea," said Zarah Declaro, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, she added, as principal, "he did a good job." JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO GET 11% PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga will receive an 11% salary increase 
starting in February, the City Council decided Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The raise was approved by a 4-3 vote and will put Uberuaga's salary at 
$142,457. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer said Uberuaga has "done a fine job and I think he's 
saved us some money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman David Sullivan said he could not vote for the raise.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who have done good jobs during this recession and 
they haven't gotten increases," he said. Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson and 
Councilman Jim Silva also voted against the raise.  
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga began as city administrator four years ago and has not received a pay 
raise since 1991. The 11% raise would equal the increases that other city 
department heads have received since 1991, Uberuaga said. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; WELFARE FINGERPRINT SYSTEM IS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors Tuesday approved a plan to improve safeguards against 
welfare fraud by installing a sophisticated computer system that uses 
fingerprints to identify "double-dippers." 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.37-million system would scan and index the fingerprints of the county's 
3,000 General Relief recipients, then compare them to the rolls of recipients 
both locally and in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the system would save enough money each year to cover the cost 
of operating it. Within five years, the system would probably save more than 
$104,000, officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the system, recipients of General Relief -- which pays $300 monthly, 
primarily to single adults -- would be fingerprinted at one of the program's 
two offices. The print on each recipient's index finger would be scanned and 
stored by an electronic eye beneath a glass pane. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of seconds, the system could compare the print against everyone 
else receiving General Relief payments in Orange County and the more than 
100,000 General Relief recipients in Los Angeles County, said Bob Griffith, 
chief deputy director of county social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members praised the plan, which they said would crack down on bogus 
claims and preserve the system's money for the truly needy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to catch double-dippers, and I think this system will go a long way 
toward doing just that," said Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who has long 
advocated the oft-discussed system. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tim Shaw, an advocate for the homeless, said the assumption that the 
system is necessary -- and the way it operates -- are suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, the executive director of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force, 
said welfare fraud is an exaggerated problem, inflated for political reasons. 
He also questioned the claim that the new system would indeed be 
cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think the system is necessarily a good use of money," Shaw said. 
"There is not that much fraud in the system. The perception that there is a 
great deal of fraud was created by politicians who want to cut welfare so they 
can balance their budgets. They would rather do it on the backs of the poor 
than by getting rid of tax loopholes for the rich." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said fingerprinting relief recipients also is unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard enough for a proud person to go in and ask for this temporary 
help," said Shaw. "We stigmatize it enough. Now what you're saying to them when 
they walk in is that you're assuming they are dishonest, too." 
</P>
<P>
 While Shaw disputes the need for the system, Orange County officials point to 
the success of the fingerprinting program in Los Angeles County. The system 
there is estimated to have saved more than $12 million and been "extremely 
successful," said Lisa Nunez, a computer services chief for the neighboring 
county's social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The system would "piggyback" an identical Los Angeles database that has been 
operating since 1992, saving Orange County tens of thousands in setup costs, 
Griffith said. Sharing the same database will also help nab recipients whose 
bogus claims have gone unnoticed because they crossed the county line and 
offered a false name, Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's vote gave county social services officials the go-ahead to begin 
negotiations with their Los Angeles County counterparts. The system could be 
installed by October. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; MAN TO STAND TRIAL IN MOTHER'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A South Orange County Municipal Court judge on Tuesday ordered a San Clemente 
man to stand trial on charges of suffocating his 76-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford L. Burgess, 45, will be arraigned in Superior Court on April 4 and 
remains in custody on $250,000 bail.He was arrested earlier this month in 
connection with the Sept. 6, 1992, slaying of his mother, Mary Burgess, who 
died of suffocation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess may enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity at his upcoming 
arraignment, his lawyer, Jack Earley, said Tuesday. Earley said his client has 
a history of severe depression and has been in and out of mental hospitals 
three times since his mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess was first arrested in 1992, a few hours after his mother was found 
dead in her San Clemente home, but was released the next day because of a lack 
of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 He had called police that day and told them he found his mother dead and that 
he tried to commit suicide by slitting his wrists after finding her body, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In statements to police, Burgess said he had dreamed of his mother's death, 
but wasn't sure if he was involved, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence collected at the bloody scene and re-evaluated since the merger of 
the San Clemente Police Department and the Orange County Sheriff's Department 
links Burgess to the crime and resulted in his second arrest, authorities have 
said. ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; SWEEP OF 4 MOTELS NETS 14 DRUG ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police swept a strip of four motels in the 5600 block of Lincoln Avenue on 
Tuesday, arresting 14 people on narcotics charges, Sgt. Gordon Re said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two months, undercover members of the Police Department's special 
narcotics team had targeted street-level drug dealers along the strip, where 
methamphetamines and other drugs were sold from motel rooms, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the investigation, warrants were issued for five men and five women, 
ranging in age from 22 to 42, Re said. At 8 a.m. Tuesday, 26 members of the 
Police Department began serving the warrants at the four motels -- Sunshine 
Inn, Country Club Inn, Cloud 9 Motel and Cypress Lodge. Warrants also were 
served at two residences, in Cypress and Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 All 10 suspects named in the warrants were arrested on suspicion of felony 
sales of a controlled substance, and were being held in Orange County Jail on 
$25,000 bail each, Re said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process of serving the warrants, officers arrested three other adults 
and one juvenile on suspicion of possessing methamphetamines. Two of the adults 
were being held in county jail and one was cited and released, and the juvenile 
was released to his parents, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six minor children, ranging in age from 1 to 12 years old, were taken into 
protective custody in connection with the arrests. They were taken to the 
Orangewood Home for Children.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SALARY 'SPIKING' COST COULD HIT $13 
MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cost of salary "spiking" by retiring city employees could reach about $13 
million, according to a report submitted to the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost to the city had previously been estimated at $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Bob Franz estimated that 144 current employees who 
may retire in the next five years could cost the city an additional $10.5 
million in pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like turning over rocks with slime on them. It's always worse," 
Councilman David Sullivan said of the new figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking is the practice of inflating an employee's salary to increase 
retirement benefits, which are based on pay. Employees simply fill out a form 
designating their final year's salary. They can artificially inflate that 
figure by including vacation pay, auto allowances, and other perquisites as 
part of their salaries.  
</P>
<P>
 Current employees may still spike their pay, even though state law will 
prohibit the practice starting July 1 of this year, and the new estimates are 
based on the potential debt from these employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan likened salary spiking to a "fiscal time bomb that keeps ticking." 
</P>
<P>
 While it has not been illegal, spiking is considered an abuse by state 
officials because it doesn't give the retirement system enough time to save the 
money required to pay an inflated pension. 
</P>
<P>
 In November and February, the city was billed by the California Public 
Employees Retirement System for $918,413 to cover the cost of spiking by 10 
employees.  
</P>
<P>
 A recent PERS report stated that 34 Huntington Beach employees, including 
those 10, spiked their pay by an average of $79,000 the year before retirement. 
The city has not received a bill for all of those employees because PERS 
covered the cost in the form of higher retirement rates charged to the city 
starting last July, Franz said.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's total annual budget is $195 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The council formed a committee Monday to investigate whether the city can 
prevent current employees from spiking their salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members also wanted a legal opinion on whether the city is really 
liable for the spiked portions of the retirement benefits or if PERS should pay 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city officials will not defend the most egregious cases of spiking, 
some view it as a legitimate way to reward long time city employees and 
managers, who generally make less than their counterparts in the private 
sector.MARY LOU PICKEL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four newspaper racks containing pornographic publications have been removed 
from a Marina Drive sidewalk by their owner after city officials informed him 
that the vending machines violated city laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The removal was cheered by residents and merchants on the street who had 
complained to City Hall soon after the machines appeared about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must have been (installed) during the dead of night," said Mayor Gwen 
Forsythe. "We would have seen it if they were put up during the day." 
</P>
<P>
 The machines sold newspapers containing what Forsythe described as "hard core" 
pornography. "It was just extremely offensive material," she said. The city 
investigated the machines and found that none had the required business 
license. Officials informed the owner of the violations and said he would have 
to apply for a license or remove the machines. The racks were gone within a few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is completing an updated newspaper rack ordinance aimed at better 
regulating the scores of machines that line many of the city's busy streets.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; OFF-DUTY DEPUTY SHOOTS DRIVER, 18 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An off-duty Orange County sheriff's deputy shot and wounded an 18-year-old 
woman after seeing a passenger in her car allegedly open fire on the occupants 
of another vehicle on First Street on Monday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident, which took place shortly before 7 p.m., was the fourth 
officer-involved shooting in Orange County within five days. The other 
shootings occurred in Westminster, La Palma and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Monday's shooting, Soda Chan Chhum of Westminster was arrested 
in the emergency room of Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, 
where she had gone for treatment of a wounded left shoulder and left leg. She 
is being held at Santa Ana Detention Facility on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon, Santa Ana police Lt. Robert Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday morning, police arrested a 17-year-old male from Midway City who 
leaned out of the passenger window of the car driven by Chhum and pointed a gun 
at the deputy, Helton said. The teen-ager, whose name was not released because 
of his age, did not fire at the deputy and apparently was unaware that he was 
an off-duty law enforcement official, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deputy thought he was going to be shot," Helton said. "He fired several 
rounds at the suspect's vehicle as it was coming past him." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began as the unidentified deputy, an eight-year veteran of the 
Sheriff's Department, was driving westbound on First Street between Newhope and 
Euclid streets. He came up behind two vehicles that had appeared to be chasing 
each other and were stopped at a traffic signal, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 17-year-old gets out and goes over to the other car and shoots into it," 
Helton said. "The car that was shot into drove away, so the deputy focused his 
attention on the other vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy called 911 on his car phone and began following the car occupied by 
Chhum and the 17-year-old. The deputy told police that the car made a U-turn 
and came past him, heading eastbound on First Street. As the vehicle raced past 
him, the deputy fired, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not located the 17-year-old's gun, Helton said. Nor have they 
found the occupants of the car that the teen-ager allegedly fired into. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has come forward, so it's doubtful that anyone was struck," Helton 
said. "But you never know. If it was a minor wound, they might not have sought 
medical attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager is being held at Juvenile Hall on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was the latest in a string of officer-involved shootings that 
began Thursday, when two suspects were shot, and one killed, in separate 
incidents by police in Westminster and La Palma. A third officer-involved 
shooting took place in Santa Ana on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office is investigating all the shootings, a 
requirement under a county policy adopted in 1985. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; SCHOOLS ADOPT POLICY BANNING WEAPONS

<P>
 Brea Olinda Unified School District trustees this week adopted a policy 
prohibiting students from carrying firearms or other weapons at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the policy, students who bring weapons -- including guns, knives, dirks, 
daggers, razors, pepper spray, Mace or other dangerous instruments -- and 
display or threaten others will face expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who are caught with replicas of weapons also face suspension, 
district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 District employees also have the right to confiscate any weapons they find on 
school grounds or at school-sponsored events elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the district had relied on Education Code guidelines against 
weapons. The new policy now bans specific weapons and outlines the consequences 
for carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Since school began in September, two students have been expelled for carrying 
knives in school, Assistant Supt. Peter J. Boothroyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy, he said, "makes it clear to the community that we do not allow 
weapons at school." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; 1 CRITICALLY HURT IN 3-CAR FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>

<P>
 Morning rush-hour traffic was backed up for about four miles Tuesday following 
a three-car accident on the San Diego Freeway that left one driver critically 
injured, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters traveling south on the freeway were stopped at Edwards Street, where 
the 8:15 a.m. accident occurred, to about Seal Beach Boulevard for more than an 
hour, said CHP officer Joan Rivas. 
</P>
<P>
 Northbound lanes also had to be closed for about 20 minutes so a rescue 
helicopter could land on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to close the northbound lanes as well because you have everybody 
trying to watch and that can cause more accidents," Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that a car with a flat tire parked on the shoulder of 
the southbound lanes and some scrap sheet metal in the middle of the freeway 
may have contributed to the accident, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were driving on the right shoulder to avoid the metal," Rivas said. "A 
freeway service patrol driver had pulled over to tell the driver with the flat 
tire to move his car when he heard brakes and saw a car going out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 The car was being driven by Diana Pine Gilley, 36, of Garden Grove. Gilley's 
car was spinning out of control toward the center divider when it was struck by 
a car being driven by Juan Zarate, 53, of Hawthorne, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarate apparently struck Gilley's car and caused it to spin and face north. At 
that point, she was hit head-on by a southbound pickup driven by Kriengkri 
Chanprakrit, 35, of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilley suffered major head injuries, a broken left arm and broken left leg in 
the accident. She was airlifted from the freeway to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, where she underwent surgery Tuesday afternoon. She was listed in 
critical condition, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chanprakrit complained of chest pains and was taken by ambulance to a local 
hospital. An air bag in Zarate's car activated upon impact and he was 
uninjured, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 No citations were issued pending completion of an investigation. The CHP is 
asking that any witnesses to the accident contact Officer Bob Messing at (714) 
892-4426. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; MAN WHO STRUCK 2 PEDESTRIANS CHARGED

<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office on Tuesday filed a misdemeanor 
manslaughter charge against a motorist in connection with the deaths of two 
senior citizens who were fatally injured last week as they crossed a busy Costa 
Mesa intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Francisco Jimenez, 25, of Costa Mesa was questioned and released 
by police the day of the accident and remains free. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Del Wright, who is handling the case, said that based on 
the evidence, "Jimenez was in violation of the law" when he failed to stop for 
the two senior citizens at the T-intersection at Meyer Place and West 19th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said he filed a misdemeanor involuntary vehicular manslaughter charge 
at Harbor Municipal Court and is waiting for a judge to issue a warrant for 
Jimenez's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred March 15 at about 6:20 a.m. as Fred B. Young and 
Patricia E. Crowell, both 78 and residents of the Bethel Towers retirement 
center, were returning home after breakfast at a McDonald's Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez, who was traveling east on West 19th Street on his way to work, failed 
to see the two pedestrians as he moved into the fast lane to pass a car that 
had stopped for them, Wright said. Young and Crowell were walking within a 
marked crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez told police the sun had blinded him and he did not see the 
pedestrians. He could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who in his youth had been a prizefighter and later a chef, was buried 
last Thursday. Crowell worked part time at Mother's Market and Kitchen in Costa 
Mesa. She was buried last weekend, according to Bethel Towers officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection at Meyer Place and 19th Street has been a troubled spot for 
pedestrians. In 1990, a woman was seriously injured by a car at the same 
intersection. The woman sued the city for $400,000. The case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Bethel Towers have for years been asking the city to place a 
traffic light at the intersection. City officials said they have slated the 
intersection for a traffic light in June. FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; LOW-COST HOUSING FOR SENIORS PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. on Tuesday unveiled plans to build 600 units of low-cost 
housing for senior citizens at four site across the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said the proposal reflects the city's growing senior 
population, which now stands at about 14,000 but might triple over the next few 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think there is a market and a need for this kind of product," said Dawn 
McCormick, spokeswoman for the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds to build the apartments must still be secured. Irvine Co. officials hope 
to receive federal Community Block Grants and other government monies through 
the city. They also expect private investors to help fund the project because 
they would receive investment tax credits from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Keith Greer, president of the company's Irvine Community Builders, 
estimated that the project will cost $25 million to $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has already selected sites for the four senior complexes. Each 
would consist of about 150 units contained within wood-framed apartment 
buildings. Each site would include such amenities as a social room, lounge, 
library and laundry facilities. Both one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments 
would be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 The sites are: 
</P>
<P>
 * At the corner of Main Street and Veneto in the Westpark village. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the corner of Santa Alicia and Santa Clara in the Westpark II area. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Alton Parkway near East Yale Loop in Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Between Jeffrey Road and Sand Canyon Avenue in an undeveloped village known 
as Planning Area 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 600 units would be available for senior citizens who earn less 
than 50% of Orange County's median income, or about $27,000 a year. An 
apartment is expected to cost between $550 and $650 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the first of the buildings could begin in 1995 and be 
completed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer presented the plan to the City Council on Tuesday night. He asked that 
the city give the project a high priority as it moves through the planning 
process.SHELBY GRAD

TRUSTEE CENSURED FOR ALLEGED LEAK OF SCHOOL LAND DATA; CONTROVERSY: SANTA ANA 
BOARD'S ROSEMARIE AVILA DENIES ANY VIOLATION LINKED TO PROPERTY PRICE DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fueling the continuing controversy over two multimillion-dollar land 
purchases, trustees of the Santa Ana Unified School District on Tuesday 
censured a board member for allegedly leaking confidential documents related to 
the deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Censure of a board member is a pretty drastic step, but I think there's some 
serious violations going on here of the board's trust," Trustee Robert W. Balen 
said before the board voted to censure trustee Rosemarie Avila.  
</P>
<P>
 Avila said she will "fight any action of censure in court, because I did not 
violate any law of confidentiality. If you want to censure me, you can expect 
to see me and my lawyer in court." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a hundred residents jammed a school board meeting Tuesday to debate 
whether the Santa Ana Unified School District pays too much to acquire land for 
future schools. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they had called the meeting to fully explain the 
district's process of buying land and to defend themselves against allegations 
that they paid millions of dollars too much for two sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The district plans to build a school on 11 acres, despite contentions that the 
nearly $22-million price tag for the land is more than twice what it is worth. 
Some proponents of the plan argued Tuesday that the price should not be an 
issue, since the state has agreed to fund the project. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said they want a full investigation because they believe taxpayer 
money is being squandered. In addition to that purchase, they complained about 
the district's 1990 acquisition of a new school and headquarters at Grand and 
Chestnut avenues.  
</P>
<P>
 Financial data showed that the district paid $18.5 million for an 18-acre 
industrial site that had sold for $12.6 million just a few months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 On the motion to censure Avila, Trustees Balen, Audrey Yamagata-Noji and Sal 
Mendoza voted in favor. Trustee Tom Chaffee opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for the school district advised the board to distance itself from 
the release of the documents in case any of the matter they contain leads to 
litigation.

TEEN-AGER KILLED IN WEEKEND TRAFFIC DISPUTE IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Tuesday identified the victim killed in a weekend shootout as a 
17-year-old Santa Ana boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Rodriguez was shot Saturday when what police described as a deadly game 
of cat and mouse between two moving vehicles erupted into gunfire, according to 
Lt. David Nick. 
</P>
<P>
 A dispute between passengers in the two vehicles, which were traveling along 
city streets, apparently led to the shootings, police said. Rodriguez was shot 
in the head, and a second man, Ramon Martinez, 26, also of Santa Ana, was shot 
in the back, Nick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not made it clear which cars the two shooting victims were in. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they believe that some of those in the autos were gang 
members. No arrests have been made.

 Roger Altman -- Because of an editing error, The Times implied Tuesday that 
Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman attended a now-controversial Sept. 29 
meeting at which Treasury Department general counsel Jean Hanson briefed 
then-White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum on the Madison Guaranty Savings & 
Loan case, telling him that President and Mrs. Clinton would be mentioned as 
possible beneficiaries of illegal activities at the thrift. Altman did not 
attend that meeting, but did receive an earlier briefing from Hanson in which 
he was told a criminal referral in the Madison case was under consideration. 
Altman says he was not told substantive details of the case.

AND THE OSCARS COME TO -- FASHION ISLAND

<P>
 Party guests were given the star treatment on Monday when the Assistance 
League of Newport-Mesa staged its own Oscar night bash. 
</P>
<P>
 Atrium Court in Fashion Island Newport Beach was transformed into a 
small-scale Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, complete with larger-than-life Oscar 
statues and a red carpet for receiving more than 450 party-goers for the 
league's first-ever "Night of the Stars" Academy Awards celebration. The 
$100-per-person gala was expected to raise about $75,000 for the league. 
Everybody's a Star 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved the Academy Awards. I knew about the party they had at 
Wolfgang Puck's, and I thought it would be fun to do that in Orange County," 
said Charlene Wardrup, chairwoman of the league's Virginia Castle Auxiliary, 
which helped stage the event. 
</P>
<P>
 In true Oscar tradition, guests were greeted by a bleacher filled with "fans" 
who screamed, applauded and snapped pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 As they made their way up the red carpet, party-goers were interviewed on 
camera. Those already inside watched the interviews on two wide-screen 
televisions. While most were a little tongue-tied before the camera, guest 
Eileen Passo had the right idea. Not missing a beat, she told interviewer 
William Yingling: "I'm just ecstatic about my nomination, and even if I don't 
get (an Oscar), I'm ecstatic to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Many dressed like Hollywood stars, the men in tuxedos and the women in flowing 
chiffon gowns, little black dresses and beaded sheaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lynn Bergman-Rallis was covered head to toe in gold and black stars that 
matched the decor. Her blazer, strapless top, skirt and even shoes were all 
covered with stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to make this a star-studded evening," she joked. "It's all Escada. 
I actually had this in my closet, and it matches the decor perfectly." Special 
Effects 
</P>
<P>
 Atrium Court was filled to capacity with tables draped in black cloth and 
sprinkled with gold confetti. Huge gold stars hung on the walls, and tall gold 
vases filled with white flowers adorned each table. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do something new and different," said Mary Jean Simpkins, event 
chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests were served smoked salmon with pecans and a honey mustard sauce, mixed 
greens with a roasted beet and shallot vinaigrette, grilled chicken with 
sun-dried tomato butter sauce, pureed garlic potatoes, Tuscan beans with 
prosciutto, and a fresh fruit tart for dessert, all the work of Specialty 
Catering. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meal, they watched the awards ceremony on the wide-screen TVs, 
applauding when their favorite actors and actresses picked up a gold statue. 
During commercials and after the broadcast, Barry Cole and his Sounds of Music 
Orchestra played the best songs from movies dating back to 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner the league saluted two "philanthropic stars," Virginia Knott 
Bender and Byron Allumbaugh, for their community service on behalf of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the event will go to assistance league programs, including the 
Children's Dental Health Center, Grace Hoag Child Day Care Center and Operation 
School Bell, which provides clothes to needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending were Patti Rose, league president, and her husband, 
Chris; Jim Roberts, auctioneer; Ronnie Allumbaugh, Ted Simpkins, Mary 
Roosevelt, George and Judie Argyros, Jim and Patty Edwards, Gerald and Marge 
Elmer, Robert and Elaine Bassmajian, Roger and Jocelyn Gilbert, Dale and Joann 
Johnston, Jerry and Janie Kingsley, Sam and Linda Mayeda, Mary Dell Barkouras,
