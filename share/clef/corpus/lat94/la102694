MOVIE REVIEW; FIORENTINO'S 'SEDUCTION': AN ICY CHILL OF A HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "She can't be all bad, no one is," is the best anyone can manage about Jane 
Greer's malevolent Kathie Moffett in the classic film noir "Out of the Past," 
but Robert Mitchum's Jeff Bailey isn't buying. "She comes the closest," is his 
curt reply, but then he never met Bridget Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
 As played with career-making gusto by Linda Fiorentino, Bridget Gregory is a 
virtuoso of venom. Nasty, brutish and short to all concerned, her cold 
amorality leaves bystanders gasping. "You're not human," is a typical response, 
and even her lawyer has to ask, "Anybody check you for a heartbeat?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fiorentino's diabolical performance is the delectable heart of "The Last 
Seduction," the latest film by the polished John Dahl, whose "Red Rock West" 
was this year's most unexpected (and well-deserved) independent film hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Both "Seduction" and "Red Rock" had to overcome the hurdle of prior showings 
on HBO before getting theatrical distribution, and although "Red Rock" is the 
more satisfying film, "Seduction" is pure Dahl and that is reason enough to pay 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 With only three features to his credit (the first was the Val Kilmer/Joanne 
Whalley-Kilmer-starring "Kill Me Again"), Dahl has made a reputation for 
himself as a modern master of a much imitated and overworked genre, the 
dark-end-of-the-street film noir. 
</P>
<P>
 While most directors approach noir from the outside, taking a paint-by-numbers 
approach to its components, Dahl intuitively penetrates to the heart of the 
beast, luxuriating in its fatalism, duplicity and despair, not to mention its 
baroque plot lines. And he also understands that laughter and shivers can be 
bedfellows, that being true to the spirit doesn't preclude having a little fun 
on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory, on the other hand, is all business. "The Last Seduction" opens with a 
glimpse of her at work, so pitilessly castigating the telephone solicitors 
under her charge that the word "eunuchs" is as mild as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her unsavory doctor husband Clay (Bill Pullman) is out setting up a 
drug deal, making what he thinks is the score of a lifetime for both of them by 
selling a large quantity of pharmaceutical cocaine. Bridget, however, has other 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Coolly absconding with the cash and headed as far out of town as she can get, 
Bridget stops for gas in the Upstate New York hamlet of Beston. With some time 
to kill, she wanders into the local bar and there, all unknowing, sits Mike 
Swale (Peter Berg). 
</P>
<P>
 A Beston native just returned after an unhappy stint living in nearby Buffalo, 
Mike is looking for someone or something to give him the nerve to leave town 
again. Bridget's abrasiveness fascinates him, and the more abusive she gets, 
for instance advising him to "make nice little cow babies and leave me alone," 
the more pleased he becomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Beston's friendliness makes Bridget want to throw up, circumstances 
force her to stick around for a while, making such cold-bloodedly carnal use of 
Mike he feels "like a 4-H experiment." Meanwhile, back in Manhattan, Clay is 
plotting revenge, and Bridget is coming up with a few new wrinkles of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 In part a tribute to "Double Indemnity" (an insurance company figures 
prominently, and Bridget at one point calls herself Mrs. Neff), "Seduction" is 
the first Dahl film the director himself didn't co-write. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time screenwriter Steve Barancik definitely works in the Dahl spirit, 
maybe too much so. Even "Last Seduction's" admirers will have to admit that the 
film's ornate plot goes more seriously haywire than usual, dispensing with 
plausibility early on and never bothering to look back. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping to counteract the plot's dizziness is Dahl's feel for the genre and 
his skill in making scenes that sound like cliches, for instance passionate sex 
on a rainy night to a muted jazz score, play like they're supposed to. Dahl 
also works well with actors, and in addition to Fiorentino he has fine support 
from the devious Pullman and Berg's perfect dupe. 
</P>
<P>
 With its brisk audacity and the deliriousness of its plotting, "The Last 
Seduction" must have tickled its director as much as it pleases audiences. Like 
its amoral protagonist, this little item likes to play with people's minds and 
has the panache to pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for strong sexuality and language, and for violence. Times 
guidelines: It includes scenes of energetic lovemaking, mayhem and a general 
air of amorality. 'The Last Seduction'

FAMILY; MANLY, MAGICAL DAYS OF YORE; THE LAGUNA PLAYHOUSE YOUTH THEATER SPINS 
AN IMAGINATIVE VERSION OF THE ARTHURIAN LEGEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Laguna Playhouse Youth Theater's "Sword in the Stone," a man becomes a 
fish, a boy turns into a sparrow and a sword pierces a boulder swiftly and 
effortlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 These slices of fancy from Arthurian legend are appealing enough, but it's 
their Middle Ages setting that's even more toothsome to modern viewers -- a 
once-upon-a-time era in which knights were valorous, ladies were virtuous and 
chivalry was its own reward. 
</P>
<P>
 But this mostly involving production is no spun-sugar "Sword." The two 
one-acts were created years apart by Kathryn Schultz Miller and presented 
together by Youth Theater director Joe Lauderdale for the first time. Sunday's 
matinee performance was manly enough to hold young audiences, including a large 
showing of school-age boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Though this production and Disney's 1963 animated version are spinoffs from T. 
H. White's book, Miller's work is strikingly different from the movie, an 
entertaining but mostly featherweight film that -- as Christopher Finch 
described in his book, "The Art of Disney" -- "totally misses the tone" of 
White's story. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest difference can be seen in Merlin, the ageless sorcerer and teacher 
who serves as Arthur's mentor and adviser throughout his life. Instead of 
Disney's testy, bungling eccentric, Miller's Merlin is wry, intense and cloaked 
in mystery. He reserves his considerable magic to school his young pupil and 
guide him through difficulties during his reign. Lauderdale handles the moments 
gracefully while encouraging children to use their imaginations; his use of 
swirling silk to suggest wind and water were especially effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Dey leads the cast admirably as Merlin. At 33, Dey is the oldest in the 
show (the other actors range from 15 to 18) and he has considerable stage 
experience; his Fagin at the playhouse's production of "Oliver!" last year was 
incredible. Dey's Merlin is just as memorable, brooding and just dark enough to 
be intriguing, with a dusting of dry wit. 
</P>
<P>
 As Arthur, Brad Bredeweg handles nicely the task of aging his character from a 
wide-eyed youth to an aging king. Michael Tryon starts out a bit flat as 
Lancelot, but gathers steam quickly. Jenny Rees' Guenevere is comely and has a 
pleasant touch of sass. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-schooled by fight choreographer Rand Hudson, the cast presented several 
stirring fight scenes complete with clashing swords and rousing battle cries 
against a dramatic backdrop of sound and light. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece's first act follows Arthur, a feisty 12-year-old squire to his older 
brother Kai, as he is groomed by Merlin to assume the crown of a troubled 
England. The famous scene in which Arthur pulls Excalibur from the stone and 
hence earns the throne binds the two acts together; it closes the first and is 
repeated in the opening moments of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Act 2 carries on the story, relating some of the high and low points in 
Arthur's life, including his alliance with Lancelot and his Knights of the 
Round Table, his marriage to Guenevere and his trials at the hand of the 
sinister witch Morgana. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it takes a fair amount of talk to pass on the wisdom of the ages, 
and while Miller's dialogue contains some beautiful and sometimes funny 
passages, by the middle of the second act it started to wear thin with young 
viewers. The problem is compounded by the fact that in Act 2, Miller has tried 
to compress decades of Arthur's rule into less than 40 minutes. And she often 
shifts tenses; some events are presented as if they are happening currently, 
others seem to be recollections shared by Merlin and Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because Miller intended each of the acts to stand alone, you can't 
blame her for occasional unevenness; perhaps Lauderdale could have eased the 
flow by trimming and blending the two scripts more. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hudnall's lighting design and David Edwards' sound design back up the 
action effectively, especially in the battle scenes. The six weeks that Hudson 
spent working with the cast were fruitful; the conflicts are exciting and the 
movements surprisingly graceful. (And yes, in case you were wondering, the 
swords are real. The edges are blunted but the tips, as evidenced by a flesh 
wound or two among the cast, are sharp.) Brigitte Harper's costumes ran mostly 
toward the coarse fibers typical of the Middle Ages, with the exception of 
Merlin's beaded collar and cape lining. 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, Lauderdale invited audience members to sit in with cast 
members and crew in an open discussion he calls StageTalk. The program will 
also be offered after the evening shows Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sword in the Stone" is the first of four shows to be presented in the Laguna 
Playhouse Youth Theater's 1994-95 season. Also scheduled are "White as Snow, 
Red as Blood," an adaptation of the Snow White story by Virginia Glasgow Koste

MUSIC REVIEW; BORISKIN AT BING THEATER IN FIRST OF THREE PIANO RECITALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Boriskin speaks well, plays the piano well and returned to Southern 
California this week with a fine concept: a three-recital survey of 
20th-Century piano music, to be spread out during the 1994-95 Monday Evening 
Concerts season. 
</P>
<P>
 Heard at the first installment, Monday night in Leo S. Bing Theater at the 
County Museum of Art, Boriskin's achievement did not attain the level of his 
ambition.A program of music by Witold Lutoslawski, Henry Cowell, Lou Harrison, 
George Perle and Ravel -- half of which the youngish New Yorker had played here 
previously -- often fell flat. 
</P>
<P>
 What was missing was color, variety and panache, not necessarily in that 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 Boriskin's palette seems monochromatic, his dynamic resources limited, his 
imagination not fully operative. One could admire all this music for its bright 
invention, but not the narrow range of its execution. 
</P>
<P>
 What the pianist played best, Ravel's "Tombeau de Couperin," indicated the 
parameters of his musical/technical arsenal. Boriskin gets around the keyboard 
easily, but fails to produce the sound-differentiations and nuances one expects 
in this repertoire. His softest playing lacks delicacy, just as his loudest 
lacks weight. This wondrous suite became neutral ground, mechanically a field 
of mezzo-forte. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasing homages to Chopin and Debussy began each half of this agenda, first 
in two Etudes Lutoslawski wrote in 1941 (down payment on a set the Polish 
composer never completed, Boriskin told his sparse audience), then in Perle's 
characterful "Six New Etudes" of 1984. Boriskin also exhumed three handsome 
pieces by Cowell, played efficiently but without passion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the program's center was Harrison's cherishable Suite for Piano (1943), 
which had been given its world premiere at Evenings on the Roof, precursor of 
Monday Evening Concerts, half a century ago.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JENNINGS PLAYS WITH TEXAS-SIZE PERSONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never underestimate the dedication of the country music fan. At the Crazy 
Horse Steak House on Monday, Waylon Jennings was beginning to tell about the 
time he was hospitalized with heart problems between shows at the very same 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 "About seven years ago. . . ." he began. He got no further before several 
members of the audience interrupted to correct him: "It was six years ago and 
one day!" 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the date, for the hard-living country singer to whom Rodney Crowell's 
"I Ain't Living Long Like This" seemed a personal credo, it was a significant 
turning point. Not long after the Crazy Horse incident he wound up having 
coronary bypass surgery and changing his ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've given up everything except oxygen and you-know-what" he declared. "And 
you know which of those I'd give up first." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings is looking the trimmest he has in decades and the gray has 
mysteriously vanished from his now-styled hair. His early show performance may 
not have been as rowdy and rambunctious as some in the past, but there's 
something to be said for clear-eyed determination as well.  
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see Billy Ray Cyrus do that!" Jennings crowed after rocking the 
aforementioned Crowell tune down like a thrown bull. The 57-year-old Texan 
clearly knows how to rock with a ferocious personality lacking in the current 
rock-raised crop of country singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other country legends, personality is at the core of Jennings' talent. 
His voice, lyrics, banter and guitar work all speak of who he is and where he's 
been. There have been times when that's verged on self-parody with all that 
"Outlaw"-era swagger, but who didn't trip over their legend a few times in the 
'70s? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings -- who was playing in Buddy Holly's band when Holly died in 1959 -- 
has certainly done enough for one lifetime to have earned the right to coast on 
his legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead he's touring with a spunky, challenging new album, "Waymore's Blues 
(Part II)." Produced by Don Was, who has revitalized the careers of Bonnie 
Raitt and the Rolling Stones, the album features more Jennings-penned songs 
than we've heard in ages -- some brave solid stuff, and a few toss-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the better songs didn't make it to his set list Monday. Of those that 
did, there was the album's title track, a slow-chugging blues-shaped song about 
the ups and downs of his scraggly ways. Of the downs, he sang: "I couldn't make 
out with a credit card in that cat house over there / Women got my number, but 
they don't call 'cause they don't care." The other winner was another song 
about losing, "No Good for Me," about a wild-living love who looked like an 
angel, "And for somebody else she may be / But she was just no good for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other album songs, Tony Joe White's "Up in Arkansas" was a 
pleasant-enough tune, accented by band member Jerry Bridges' wah-wah guitar 
work, but it offered Jennings little to make it a personal statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, his between-song talk is nearly as expressive as his songs, and 
he prefaced the tune with a remembrance of his own small-town upbringing in 
West Texas, where the land was so flat, "Your dog could run off and you could 
watch him go for around three days."  
</P>
<P>
 Jennings' other narrative excursions included an account of his most recent 
hospitalization for operations on his hands that temporarily left him unable to 
unbutton his jeans. "There I was in New York, looking for an honest face." 
</P>
<P>
 In doctor-speak, he'd been told, "You may suffer a bit of discomfort," he 
said. The subsequent pain he felt, he said, made him inclined to seek out the 
doctor once his hands healed "and pinch him on the cheek and say, 'That's "a 
little discomfort." ' Then I'm gonna take a pair of pliers and pull his bottom 
lip over the top of his head and say ' That's what it feels like.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His digits are clearly functioning again, given the guitar solos he was 
snapping out. On the slow, moody "Amanda" he rolled out a throbbing low solo on 
the Duane Eddy section of his Telecaster's neck. As usual, Jennings had a sharp 
band, particularly pedal steel player Fred Newall. A recent addition to the 
band, Newall's soaring solos were watched with rapt attention by Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessi Colter, Jennings' wife, joined him on "Suspicious Minds" and "Divided 
We're Through."

MUSIC REVIEW; MIAMI STRING QUARTET PASSIONATE AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The local debut of the Miami String Quartet at Ambassador Auditorium on Monday 
provided the keenest kind of listening pleasure, in which seldom-heard 
masterpieces are delivered with passion and aplomb by gifted, intelligent young 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Floridians -- violinists Felicia Moye and Cathy Meng Robinson, 
violist Chauncey Patterson, cellist Keith Robinson -- ventured the formal 
perfection of the Quartet in C from Haydn's Opus 20, with its striking 
harmonies and contrapuntal complexities, in a reading of tremendous verve, 
faultless balances and centered intonation, all within the context of bright, 
sometimes fiercely projectile ensemble sonority. 
</P>
<P>
 To close, there was the String Quartet in A, Opus 41, No. 3, of Schumann -- 
all heart and a formal shambles -- which inspired an uncommonly successful 
display of why one tolerates Schumann's convolutions: the deeply affecting 
melodies with which this work is overpopulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Expansive when the composer demanded, taut when he needed all the help he 
could get, the Miami String Quartet exhibited this flawed gem in the most 
appealing light possible. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an outright novelty on the program,too: the world premiere of 
"Whispers of Mortality," written for these performers by Bruce Adolphe, about 
whom the program notes offered not a single biographical fact beyond the year 
of his birth, 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece is hardly off-putting, rather, a collection of familiar devices, 
including jagged, Janacek-like alternations of narrow intervals and octave-plus 
leaps and a schematic layout derived from Bartok's Fourth Quartet, down to the 
central, cello-dominated slow movement from which the work seems to flow 
outward. HERBERT GLASS

DANCE REVIEW; BOCCA LEADS BALLET ARGENTINO IN CERRITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when nearly all the great ballet virtuosi subordinate themselves to 
one choreographic vision or another, Julio Bocca remains a brilliant gadfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternately burning up the stage and chewing the scenery, the 27-year-old 
Argentine looked equally at home in neo-Soviet kitsch, 19th-Century bravura and 
balleticized exhibition-ballroom on Monday -- the first night in his weeklong 
engagement at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Mikhail Baryshnikov and Irek Mukhamedov, Bocca hasn't yet expanded 
ballet virtuosity by developing unprecedented signature steps that are 
eventually copied and assimilated into the vocabulary. Instead, he refines the 
innovations of others to the absolute limits of speed, complexity and clarity, 
warming the chilly perfection of that achievement with playful, boyish charm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monday program paired him with Argentine ballerina Eleonora Cassano in 
three archetypal depictions of Latino temperament. First came "Carmen" (a.k.a. 
"Carmen Suite"), the 1967 Alberto Alonso dance drama originally choreographed 
for Maya Plisetskaya and also identified with Alicia Alonso. These icons were 
in their 40s at the time and used the meager choreographic text as an occasion 
to glory in their star power. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the conscientious but none too intimidating Cassano couldn't 
obliterate the choreography in this manner, and you kept wondering why the role 
required so little actual dancing -- especially on pointe. As for Bocca, he 
flew through flawless multiple turns-into-extension, demonstrated a magnificent 
command of expressive gesture and emoted floridly. 
</P>
<P>
 Supplementing their efforts: an attractive, hard-working, well-coached and 
very, very young 12-member ensemble from Buenos Aires dubbed Ballet Argentino. 
Poor babies, the cigarette girls in "Carmen" dutifully ran their hands over 
their bodies and tried to look sluttish but seemed just as virginal as the 
young men did in "Tangos" when they dutifully ran their hands over their thighs 
and tried to look pent-up. 
</P>
<P>
 With choreography by G. Mollajoli, Julio Lopez and Juan Carlos Copes, the 
six-part "Tangos" focused more on stifled sexuality than on the intricacy and 
drive of tango dancing, but at least Bocca and Cassano fully explored the 
yearning and sensuality of their first duet and proved very stylish indeed in 
the formal ballroom display of their second. 
</P>
<P>
 In a generous suite from Petipa's "Don Quixote," however, Cassano grew 
technically overambitious, and even Bocca suffered from several insecure 
terminations as they piled up high-velocity combinations without end. Yes, his 
supersonic final turns were amazing, but eight years after his Southern 
California debut, shouldn't an artist of his caliber be doing more than 
confirming what we already knew about him? 
</P>
<P>
 Taped music accompanied all the ballets and the either-or cast list never 
specifically credited the subsidiary dancers. Of the lot, Natalia Magnicaballi 
attracted the greatest attention as a striking embodiment of Destiny in 
"Carmen." 
</P>
<P>
 * Julio Bocca, Eleonora Cassano and Ballet Argentino appear nightly at 8 
through Sunday at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700 Center 
Court Drive. (310) 916-8500. Tickets: $20 to $35.

TV REVIEWS; A PICTURE OF MOVIES FOR BLACK AUDIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the space of one hour, directors Bestor Cram and Pearl Bowser and writer 
Clyde Taylor do an excellent job in "Midnight Ramble" of surveying "race" 
movies, those films made expressly for black audiences in a segregated society 
and spanning four decades, beginning about 1910. 
</P>
<P>
 "Midnight Ramble," which refers to the after-hours screenings many of these 
approximately 500 films received, rightly focuses on the pioneering Oscar 
Micheaux, who managed by sheer tenacity to make more than 40 features between 
the teens and late '40s and was dedicated to teaching "the colored man that he 
can be anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Micheaux urged African Americans to settle in the rural West, warned against 
the snares of urban life and dealt repeatedly with the thorny issue of skin 
color as he constantly urged his audiences to better themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Micheaux always had more passion than talent, skill or money, and his work 
suffered with the costly advent of sound, which along with the Depression, 
tended to diminish the aspirations of race filmmakers, as serious dramas tended 
to give way to musicals and gangster pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the documentarians make clear that Hollywood and TV ultimately co-opted 
race pictures while only occasionally dealing with the social issues that the 
most ambitious of them had tried to confront. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, part of PBS' "American Experience" series, points out that the 
biggest challenge facing early black filmmakers was D. W. Griffith's eternally 
controversial "The Birth of a Nation" (1915), the film that at once 
demonstrated that the American film could be an art form and a vehicle of naked 
racism as Griffith, a Southerner, mythologized the exploits of the Ku Klux Klan 
in the wake of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, negative stereotypes of African Americans persist in films and 
TV, yet even in its brief running time, "Midnight Ramble" shows us enough 
vintage clips to suggest how effectively the black filmmakers countered this 
tendency with realistic images of African American life. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Midnight Ramble" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and at 8 p.m. on 
KPBS-TV Channel 15 and KVCR-TV Channel 24. KEVIN THOMAS

TV REVIEWS; 'STATE OF STATE' FINDS NO SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It shouldn't be surprising to anyone who regularly tunes in to KCET's "Life & 
Times" that, of the show's three co-hosts -- Latino poet-journalist-liberal 
Ruben Martinez, conservative activist Hugh Hewitt and sort-of-liberal reporter 
for The Times Patt Morrison -- it's Morrison who ventures around California to 
offer a "State of the State" report. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the trio has gifts; Morrison's is that she seems able to rise above 
any constituency, scan the Golden State for where the tarnish is building up 
and deliver keen if not profound observations -- of which "State of the State" 
is full. 
</P>
<P>
 Few she interviews in her video travels from Sacramento to Los Angeles 
(California's second largest city, San Diego, apparently doesn't rate) want to 
see the state divided into three -- described in a characteristic Morrisonism 
as "Logland, Fogland and Smogland." Other than that, though, no consensus is 
reached here on solutions to California's complex problems. 
</P>
<P>
 While Common Cause's Ruth Holten points to the chasm between the diverse 
population and the mostly white, upscale voter pool, Glide Memorial Church 
Pastor Cecil Williams says that fear is the wall that divides races and those 
within and without the city. Monterey Bay Aquarium Director Steve Webster wants 
a more systematic, ecological approach to wildlife preservation, while almond 
farmer Fred Starrh says some farmers are ready to "pick up their guns and go to 
war" over water rights and the meddlesome Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Can such a disparate group be governed? Probably. But without a comprehensive 
overview of Sacramento gridlock, the collapse of the state's 
military-industrial base and the rise of new industries, Morrison's "State of 
the State" goes only halfway in mapping California's crises and promise. 
</P>
<P>
 * "State of the State" airs on "Life & Times" at 7:30 tonight on KCET-TV 
Channel 28. ROBERT KOEHLER

TV REVIEWS; 'FAR SIDE'S' ODD UNIVERSE ON CBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One might have assumed that "The Far Side" would join Charlie Brown, Cathy, 
Garfield et al in making the transition from paper toon to TV special when cows 
fly. But tonight, ladies and gentle-membranes, is that night: "Gary Larson's 
Tales From the Far Side," an appropriately macabre Halloween special, marks the 
cartoonist's first foray into fully animating his still lifes and still deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-too-brief half-hour is made up of 10 vignettes that occasionally 
overlap in a transitional fashion that's overtly Pythonesque. Surprisingly, 
given how superb Larson has always been at writing punch lines, there's no 
dialogue to speak of -- just visual gags, occasional guttural utterances and 
the alternately spooky and countrified music score of hepster Bill Frisell. 
Guess that will make for an easy sell to Latvia, no? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not necessarily; the special does capture the wonderfully morbid -- 
i.e., somehow truly nature-reflective -- nature of the strip, which means it 
won't be for every country, or every kid. Larson continues to be obsessed with 
the black comedy that is the food chain, on up from insects (an airline flight 
full of bugs, where the in-flight movie is a certain Vincent Price flick) to 
deer (a terrific, sad sketch where a drunken buck watches home movies of his 
ex-doe) to humans to, of course, aliens (just because bipeds have to get their 
comeuppance too). 
</P>
<P>
 If it's not consistently funny, it almost hardly matters; there's joy just in 
seeing a universe that is all too instantly digested on a daily one-panel basis 
suddenly entering a dimension of time. 
</P>
<P>
 With Larson retiring the strip for good Jan. 1, fans can only hope there are 
more of these in the offing. He owes us, man. 
</P>

TV REVIEWS; VICTIMS' FAMILIES SHOW 'FORGIVENESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rare television hour of moral probity, "From Fury to Forgiveness," a 
(U.K.) Yorkshire Television documentary produced by Sheldon Himmelfarb and 
picked up for U.S. broadcast by the Discovery Channel, presents three 
resoundingly tragic cases of murder -- and how relatives of the victims forgave 
the murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1973 kidnaping of Marieta Jaeger's young daughter Susie led the mother on 
a soulful journey to a kind of empathy with the abducter-killer, David 
Meierhofer.When Meierhofer called Jaeger exactly a year after the kidnaping to 
confess, she says that she had already quashed any desire for revenge -- the 
only way, she counsels other victims' relatives, to make oneself better than 
the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 What Jaeger's family felt about her kindness isn't revealed here, but much of 
Bill Pelke's family thinks he's wrong for not only forgiving Paula Cooper for 
the brutal murder of Pelke's Bible-teaching grandmother, Ruth, but also 
campaigning for commuting her death sentence and for the worldwide ban of the 
death penalty. It's what his grandmother would have wanted, says Pelke, which 
is what SueZann Bosler says about her father, the Rev. William Bosler, fatally 
stabbed in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosler's anguish as she recalls the slaying in horrible detail doesn't 
overcome a deeply Christian belief in turning the other cheek. Himmelfarb's 
film, though, ignores the inherent virtues of ultimate punishment for ultimate 
crime. It makes "From Fury to Forgiveness" a virtual anti-death-penalty 
propaganda work. 
</P>
<P>
 * "From Fury to Forgiveness" airs at 10 tonight on the Discovery Channel (with 
a repeat at 1 a.m.). ROBERT KOEHLER

JAZZ REVIEW; FOURTH ANNUAL DREW BENEFIT ENDS ON SOME BRIGHT NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under skies where patches of light blue contrasted with ominous grays, the 
fourth annual Jazz at Drew benefit was brought to a close Sunday by organist 
Jimmy Smith's friendly screeches on a romping blues number with Gerald Wilson's 
All Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day event, held Saturday and Sunday on a grassy area of the Charles R. 
Drew School of Medicine and Science in Willowbrook, spotlighted Smith, Joe 
Henderson, Bobby Hutcherson, Cedar Walton, the Brothers Johnson and many 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpeter Oscar Brashear and pianist Billy Childs, who followed the Fremont 
High School Pathfinder Jazz Ensemble and the B Sharp Jazz Quartet, offered a 
succulent set Sunday that included Walton's gorgeous "Clockwise" and an ardent 
prance through Monk's "I Mean You." There, Brashear unleashed buzzy then bright 
tones, his notes flowing. Then Childs played runs that glistened and jagged 
chords as hard as rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutcherson played with Walton's trio, which sported drummer Billy Higgins, 
whose emphatic accents moved the music in marvelous ways. The band played 
Walton's alluring "Bolivia," where the pianist was economical and elegant, and 
a medium blues, which Hutcherson tore up with dynamic ideas. Henderson joined 
the foursome and was, as usual, sparklingly inventive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's crew played four numbers, among them "You Better Believe It!," with 
fat-noted solos from Snooky Young (trumpet) and George Bohanon (trombone), and 
"Milestones," where altoist Buddy Collette was spry and most modern and 
tenorist Herman Riley offered dancing, robust ideas. Singers Carmen Bradford 
and Ernie Andrews each performed with verve and power. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland Betts, Jazz at Drew's executive producer, called the two-day festival a 
success, and estimated the crowds at 2,500 for Saturday and 2,000 on Sunday, 
about twice the size of last year's attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The only drawback to the show was the sound system, which sometimes buzzed, 
and other times muffled some instruments so that they could hardly be heard.

TV RATINGS; ABC'S 'GRACE UNDER FIRE' IMPROVES ON 'HOME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After spending the first month of the new TV season on top of the ratings, 
ABC's "Home Improvement" fell to second last week, edged out by the show that 
follows it on Tuesday nights, "Grace Under Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 "Grace Under Fire," which stars Brett Butler, was seen in about 19.5 million 
homes, according to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC had four other shows in the Top 10 but wound up in a tie with CBS for the 
weekly lead, with NBC in third despite its new hospital drama 'ER" finishing 
No. 3 for the week. The only other first-year series to crack the Top 20 was 
NBC's "Madman of the People." 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic element in the weekly ratings was that only one network 
newsmagazine finished in the Top 20: CBS' venerable "60 Minutes," at No. 5. 
ABC's once-mighty "PrimeTime Live," pitted last Thursday against "ER" and "Eye 
to Eye," finished 87th among the week's 96 prime-time network programs.

MORNING BRIEFING: DESPITE WYCHE'S TOUGH TALK, BUCCANEERS STILL FEATHERWEIGHTS

 After the Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost, 41-16, to the San Francisco 49ers on 
Sunday at Candlestick Park, Coach Sam Wyche said of his team's aggressive style 
of play:  
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't come here to play courtesy football. At least we wanted to 
establish toughness, that we were a mean . . . nasty football team." 
</P>
<P>
 Comment from C.W. Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle: "Here's a suggestion. 
If you want to look mean, why don't you start by taking that plumed fop with 
the pencil-thin mustache off the side of your helmet? 
</P>

 "It's hard to scare anybody when the side of your head looks like Louis XIV."

 Different view: Larry Guest of the Orlando Sentinel in Florida recalls that 
former Washington Redskin quarterback Sonny Jurgensen used to throw annual 
back-yard parties for his offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 One year the linemen asked Sonny's 5-year-old son, Hans, if he knew what his 
dad's jersey number was. It was 9 but he said 6 and was teased about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonny retorted, "That's because, thanks to you goons, every time he sees me 
I'm upside down." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Collector's item: Woody Woodburn of the Ventura Star-Free Press writes that 
regardless of how well Michael Jordan plays for the Scottsdale Scorpions of the 
Arizona Fall League, he's a bargain, considering he gets only $16 a day in meal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, his endorsement on the back of a check is worth about three times 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Selective memory: Fritz Shurmur, a former Ram defensive coordinator who now 
holds the same position with the Green Bay Packers, on defensive end Reggie 
White: 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there is no one in the league playing at his level right now, and I 
doubt that anyone ever has." 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, Fritz, ever hear of Deacon Jones, the Rams' Hall of Fame defensive end 
who had an estimated 180 quarterback sacks before the statistic became official 
in 1982? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is it worth it? More on the llamas used as caddies at a golf course in 
Horsham, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Their use requires a foursome because the animals must carry two bags apiece 
for balance and walk the course in pairs to ensure that the animals behave.  
</P>
<P>
 A handler must also go along to keep them from wandering away. 
</P>

 Say what? Greg Hansen of the Arizona Daily Star commenting on Arizona's game 
with Oregon on Saturday at Eugene, Ore.: 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be the biggest game in Oregon history, without question." 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible that Hansen forgot about Oregon's Rose Bowl game with Ohio 
State in 1958? 
</P>
<P>

 Looking back: On this day in 1969, the Oakland Raiders beat the San Diego 
Chargers, 24-12, tying the AFL record for consecutive regular-season games 
without a loss at 15.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas was on the phone from Churchill Downs, a strong case of Breeders' 
Cup-itis in his voice. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Tabasco Cat's work this morning was his best in a long time," the trainer 
said. "He went six furlongs in 1:13. That's a monster work here. He likes this 
track and he's been here for 49 days, so maybe he'll have the home-court 
advantage in the Classic." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Cat is only one of eight horses Lukas probably will send postward in four 
races on Nov. 5. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas hasn't saddled a winner in the Breeders' Cup since Steinlen in the Turf 
in 1989, but still has twice as many winners, 10, as any other trainer and has 
averaged one a year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always put great emphasis on this day," he said. "I've won more than 
anyone and have had more starters (79) than anyone. In the spring, we showcase 
3-year-olds. But the Breeders' Cup is a showcase for the entire thoroughbred 
industry.". . .  
</P>
<P>
 When entries are announced today for the seven-race card, these are expected 
from the Lukas stable: Flanders, Serena's Song, Cat Appeal and Lilly Capote in 
the Juvenile Fillies, Timber Country in the Juvenile, Harlan and Chimes Band in 
the Sprint and Tabasco Cat in the Classic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You would think that starting four two-year-old fillies in the same race for 
three different owners might be sticky for a trainer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be," Lukas said. "But you've simply got to do the best possible job 
with each horse.". . .  
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten Flanders, who romped by 21 lengths in her last race, is expected to 
be an odds-on favorite and the most probable winner of the day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a gifted athlete, a professional beyond her years," Lukas said. "Like 
Lady's Secret used to, she takes you out of your game plan. If you go with her, 
you don't finish. If you stay back seven or eight lengths, you can't catch 
her.". . .  
</P>
<P>
 "But Serena's Song's numbers jump out of the past performances too. If she had 
run in the Frizette and Flanders hadn't, she might have won by 21 lengths.". . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Some diplomat, that Lukas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Maddux's unprecedented third consecutive National League Cy Young Award 
was well deserved and is a remarkable achievement. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But Sandy Koufax might have won four in a row from 1963-66 if there hadn't 
been only one selection made in the major leagues then. . . .

 When he was asked for the umpteenth time a week ago if tailback Harvey 
Williams would finally start in place of Ty Montgomery, Coach Art Shell said to 
a reporter, "Starting is really important to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently it is to Williams as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his first Raider start in the team's seventh game last Sunday against 
the Atlanta Falcons, the former Kansas City Chief who signed in the off-season, 
responded with the first 100-yard effort by a Raider running back in two years, 
gaining 107. Williams also caught eight passes for 43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell conceded that starting Williams probably provided a psychological lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure it did," Shell said. "It puts in his mind that, 'Hey, I'm going to 
have a chance to get 100 yards now that I'm starting the game.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the second time in his career that Williams, now in his fourth 
season, has rushed for more than 100 yards.

 Quarterback Brett Favre, forced out of last Thursday's game against Minnesota

diagnosis, said Falcon spokesman Frank Kleha. . . . Cincinnati signed free

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: TALKS AIM TO SALVAGE MEXICAN TUNA SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Diego's fleet of long-range boats is preparing for another season at 
Mexico's Revillagigedo Islands, home of the world's largest yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, there might not be a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico has called for a management plan to be developed for the offshore 
archipelago, which last June was designated a nature reserve. And until the 
plan is completed, the government says no sportfishing permits will be issued. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is scheduled for completion in January, which would be well into the 
long-range season. The plan would then be subject to review and would not have 
to be activated until June 5, 1995. The season would be over and the fleet 
would be out hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sportfishing Assn. of California, which represents the interests of the 
Southern California fleet, is not giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnard Thompson, an attorney hired by SAC, has been talking with Santiago 
Onate Laborde, chief of staff for lame-duck President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson was told that when Mexico's Desert Bighorn Reserve was established a 
few years ago, a similar situation existed for hunters from the United States. 
Because they had historically been issued permits, an exception was made and 
they were able to conduct limited hunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said he might be able to use that as a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue has now reached the highest levels in Mexico," Thompson said in a 
statement. "And we can but hope that some sort of solution will be found in 
order to issue, at the very least, provisional permits until the management 
plan is implemented." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just when it seemed things were getting back to normal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the El Nino 
phenomenon that creates abnormal weather patterns on both sides of the Pacific 
and sends unusually warm water up the coast of California, appears to be 
developing again in the tropics. 
</P>
<P>
 NOAA said in a news release that during El Nino , the abnormal warming of the 
eastern Pacific usually begins in mid to late December and peaks in spring, 
which, depending on its magnitude, could bring tuna, dorado and blue marlin -- 
among other tropical and subtropical species -- into local waters as it did in 
1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs often chase cats, but Buddy the pit bull nearly met his match recently 
near Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Outdoors magazine reports that Mark Norton, 30, of Boulder, had pulled 
over at a mountain turnoff to let his dog take care of business, but the 
animal, a bull terrier-English Staffordshire mix, instead ran snarling into the 
bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton ran to the rear of the car, where the dog had clamped its powerful jaws 
on a cougar's throat. 
</P>
<P>
 The big cat eventually broke free, however, and took off with another cougar 
that had been standing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy was treated for puncture wounds on his head and scratches on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton credited the "lock-jaw ability pit bulls are so famous for" for saving 
its life. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTHLAND FISHING -- The local fleet has basically said goodby to the tuna and 
hello to chili peppers, reds, vermillions and the rest of the bottom-huggers 
generally lumped into the rockfish category. There are still some flurries of 
big-game activity, however, notably at the northern Channel Islands, where 
squid have ridden the currents, throwing white sea bass into a mild frenzy. "We 
had a feeling they were there, but trying to get the people to go out there on 
a hunch was difficult," said John Shull, skipper of CISCO Sportfishing's 
Pacific Dawn, which along with other Oxnard boats will be making trips to the 
islands as long as the bite lasts. The Grande reported 21 fish -- between 15 
and 25 pounds -- on Monday and 24 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 BAJA FISHING -- The Bisbee's Black and Blue marlin tournament gets under way 
today off Cabo San Lucas, and it figures to be competitive as blue marlin, 
though not as abundant as in previous weeks, are showing daily. Largest of the 
week, a 620-pounder caught by Jim Wettlaufer of Massachusetts aboard La Brisa. 
The black marlin that stormed the area two weeks ago seem to have left, 
although Larry Burson of Jig Stop Tackle in Dana Point did land a 551-pounder 
on the panga Catalina. The small-game scene is dominated by dorado, which have 
invaded the Sea of Cortez in what some are calling record numbers. The fish are 
thick north to the East Cape region and beyond to La Paz. Farther north at 
Loreto, the focus is shifting from dorado and sailfish to yellowtail and 
cabrilla. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTEWORTHY -- The Billfish Foundation is holding its annual conservation 
awards dinner on Thursday at Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. Cortez Yacht Charters of 
Lemon Grove, which specializes in fishing trips to Baja and is a staunch 
promoter of catch-and-release, will be honored as the recipient of the award 
for group achievement for its promotion of billfish conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- San Diego's city lakes' duck program is under way, with mixed 
results. Barrett was the most productive, as 50 hunters on Saturday bagged 107 
ducks, with mallards, widgeons and ringnecks accounting for most. At 
Sutherland, 24 hunters on Sunday shot 20 ducks, mostly mallards. At Otay, 40 
hunters killed 39 ducks, mostly green-wing teals. . . . The Department of Fish 
and Game says more than 100 tags remain for the A-24 Monterey either-sex 
archery deer hunt, which ends Nov. 6. Details: (408) 649-2870. 
</P>
<P>
 SURFING -- Surfline-Wavetrak reported in its newsletter that Florida surfer 
Tyler Callaway "almost became a part of the food chain" recently at a Sunshine 
State surf spot called Stuart Rocks. Tyler was reported as having pulled his 
foot from the mouth of a black-tip shark in the nick of time. His cuts required 
27 stitches but, according to Wavetrak, "he still has all his toes."

FISHING REPORT: CATFISH ANGLERS WOULD LOVE TO BE IN THEIR BOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Catfish season is winding down, but what a way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Hai of Westminster set an Irvine Lake record with a 61-pound 8-ounce 
catfish under a full moon last Saturday. And then Bon Seng, also of 
Westminster, landed one at 58-8 -- from the same boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hai's fish might also be a state record for channel catfish. A biologist from 
the Department of Fish and Game will determine whether it is a channel or blue 
catfish today. Blue catfish grow considerably larger than channel catfish.

 The parade of NFL scouts that streams through UCLA practices every season had 
a new entry Tuesday. Rick Mueller has jobs with the Jacksonville Jaguars to 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion team, which will participate in the draft for the first time in 
1995, has 14 choices in the seven rounds, including the second overall, behind 
its expansion-mate, the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scouting is scouting," Mueller said. "We're looking at the same thing 
everybody else is." 
</P>
<P>
 But more things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the difference is that we have to look at everybody," he said. "We have 
a lot of spots to fill, so we will look at guys who would perhaps be free 
agents, too, instead of just the guys in the draft." 
</P>

 With a 47.9-yard average for seven punts against Arizona, UCLA's Darren 
Schager has taken over the Pac-10 lead, at 43.2 yards per punt. USC's John 
Stonehouse is second at 42.8. . . . UCLA's Kevin Jordan continues to lead the 
Pac-10 in receptions, 55, and receiving yards, 869. He is averaging 108.6 yards 
per game. JIM HODGES

LAKER UPDATE; THIS SPARTAN'S NICKNAME FAR FROM MAGICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Michigan State, they called him only by his name. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Forum, his new home as a member of the Lakers, they announce him -- no, 
honor him -- by adding in the nickname: Anthony (Pig) Miller. Rarely has anyone 
been more proud to be mentioned as a barnyard animal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it a lot," the 6-foot-9, 225-pound rookie power forward said. "At 
State, they just called me Anthony. But I like this better." 
</P>
<P>
 Which now means everything is working out well. Miller, who was first called 
Pig as a baby because of his hearty appetite, could have been with the Golden 
State Warriors, the team that drafted him in the second round in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Or he could have played in Europe, where he probably would have gotten more 
playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 But his decision to stay in Los Angeles is working out nicely for him and the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller went into Tuesday night's exhibition game against Seattle in Vancouver 
averaging 5.3 rebounds in only 16 minutes and was leading the team in rebounds 
per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Lakers might have found someone to improve their results on the boards 
after finishing 23rd by percentage in 1993-94, including 27th and last on the 
defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers mean Miller, who was traded to the Lakers shortly after the 
draft for a second-round pick in 1995, has a good chance to move his trough 
into the Forum for good. 
</P>
<P>
 The only person not pleased by Miller's performance is Antonio Harvey, the 
second-year player who is battling the rookie for a reserve job at power 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers improved their exhibition record to 5-2 with a 114-113 victory over 
the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
 George Lynch's 15-foot jumper with 22 seconds left was the winner before 
13,895 at the future home of an NBA franchise in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle (5-1) had a three-point attempt by Nate McMillan fall short with three 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch led all scorers with 26 points, including 17 in the first half. Vlade 
Divac added 23 points and a game-high 11 rebounds. Vincent Askew led Seattle 
with 21 points and Gary Payton added 19. 
</P>
<P>
 James Worthy was not with the Lakers and will miss Thursday's exhibition 
finale against the Jazz at Ogden, Utah, after the death of his mother. The 
funeral of Gladys Worthy is today in Gastonia, N.C. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

 Florida Coach Steve Spurrier said Danny Wuerffel will start at quarterback

 "I've done a lousy job coaching Terry Dean," Spurrier said, ending speculation

fifth-ranked Gators' 36-33 loss to Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurrier, 44-11 at Florida, was criticized after the loss to Auburn for poor

<P>
 It's about time for Californians to finally get mad enough to get rid of the 
law that allows (and invites) making law by referendum. How many initiatives on 
this year's ballot? I only know because I looked at my Voter's Guide, but it is 
too many. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiatives were supposed to give the people a last resort if the Legislature 
fails to act. It has become a game and a big business, with Californians the 
losers. 
</P>
<P>
 I will vote against every initiative on this year's ballot. I wish everyone 
else would too. Then, let's see a change in the state Constitution that raises 
the threshold. How about requiring both houses of the Legislature to have had a 
bill before them with the exact wording of a proposed initiative for one year 
before anyone can circulate a petition for it?

CULTURE WATCH; GOOD SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there another country in all the world that could have spread before the 
citizens of Los Angeles the artistic feast that the United Kingdom has spread 
in the two dazzling months of the UK/LA arts festival? There surely is none 
whose artistic treasures, thanks to the bond of culture and language, are so 
immediately accessible. Artists like Lynn Redgrave, Neville Mariner, David 
Hockney (who designed the poster for the festival) and the Monty Python 
comedians are Los Angeles household words. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival does not end until Nov. 13, and some of the best has been saved 
till the last. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has just opened a 
controversial retrospective of the work of R. B. Kitaj, an American artist who 
has lived for years in England. Peter Hemmings, who came from the Scottish 
Opera to head the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, is offering Handel's 
"Xerxes," Oct. 29-Nov. 5. The Royal Shakespeare Company will perform "Henry VI" 
at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts Nov. 2-6, overlapping Prince 
Charles' Oct. 31-Nov. 4 visit. And this is, so to speak, just the beginning of 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a wonderful show, and we'll hate to see it close. But then it won't, 
quite. As UK/LA director Bruce Joseph stressed at the start, the United Kingdom 
is in its own distinct way a multicultural, multiracial society whose exchanges 
with our own society are not a historical curiosity but an unfolding present 
reality. We are proceeding by different paths to a common destination, and, as 
always, our artists are among the first to arrive.

CONGRESSIONA RACES. KEY CONTESTS; RECOMMENDATIONS IN HOUSE RACES; TIMES BACKS 
REELECTION OF REPS. BEILENSON, HARMAN, HORN AND BROWN AND SUPPORTS CHALLENGER 
MARK TAKANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times does not endorse in every race for the U.S. Congress but instead 
chooses to recommend candidates selectively on a case-by-case basis, as well as 
to acknowledge the achievements of some local incumbents who are expected to 
win reelection with relative ease. 
</P>
<P>
 24th District. Substantive, smart and honest, Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland 
Hills) deserves to be reelected. Beilenson has been enormously thoughtful on 
the deficit and other spending issues, independent on immigration and 
supportive of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. After the 
Northridge earthquake he helped gain an immediate infusion of federal funds for 
his hard-hit district, which includes parts of the San Fernando Valley and 
eastern Ventura County. He also deserves credit for his successful amendment to 
the crime bill, a provision requiring the federal government to reimburse 
states for part of the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants who have been 
convicted of felonies. With bipartisan support, his amendment got $33.4 million 
for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 His Republican challenger, Richard Sybert, an articulate lawyer and a former 
Wilson Administration official, favors welfare reform, like most candidates 
regardless of party affiliation, but, alas, offers only vague ideas on the 
topic. He dismisses as "industrial welfare" the defense conversion money the 
bipartisan California delegation worked so hard to deliver to a state 
devastated by defense/aerospace cutbacks. And he pans the crime bill as an 
ineffective piece of legislation, even though it will put more police officers 
on our streets. The Times endorses Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 36th District. This coastal district, which runs from Venice to the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula and San Pedro, was reliably Republican until 1992. That year 
Jane Harman, a corporate lawyer with extensive Capitol Hill experience, won the 
seat on President Clinton's California coattails and with a promise to help the 
district's reeling aerospace and defense industries. Harman has been notably 
effective as a freshman, winning seats on key committees and helping rescue 
McDonnell Douglas' C-17 cargo plane from the congressional ax by forging a 
bipartisan alliance with Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach). She differed with 
President Clinton on certain major issues, such as health care reform and 
NAFTA, but she supported the crime bill and its ban on assault weapons, thereby 
earning the fearsome enmity of the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Republican challenger, Susan Brooks, a Rancho Palos Verdes City Council 
member, attacks Harman as a carpetbagger who has lived in Washington for most 
of the last 20 years, but Brooks has not offered a consistent program of her 
own. Harman is far better equipped to represent this key district as it 
struggles to convert from a defense to a civilian economy. She has earned 
another term. 
</P>
<P>
 38th District. As noted above, Steve Horn, who represents Long Beach, is 
another impressive freshman. He capitalized on the considerable Capitol Hill 
experience he gained in his days as a Senate aide in the 1960s. That was before 
he taught political science, and later became president, at Cal State Long 
Beach. His alliance with Harman to save jobs in the Long Beach area is a prime 
example of how Congress should work. He constantly advocates bipartisan 
governance. The scholarly Horn supported the crime bill, the Brady handgun 
control bill, the assault weapons ban and abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 His Democratic opponent, Peter Mathews, a professor at Cypress College, 
strongly supports all sorts of government intervention. He is refreshingly 
idealistic, but he is unclear on how he would pay for Washington's new largess 
without inflating the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 42nd District. Every year political professionals speculate that the venerable 
George E. Brown Jr., a Democrat, is in trouble as his Inland Empire district 
becomes more Republican in registration. Yet this political Lazarus perseveres 
every time, and we urge voters to return him to Washington again. 
</P>
<P>
 If reelected, Brown will become the dean of the Democrats in the 52-member 
California delegation in the House. He is chairman of the House Science, Space 
and Technology Committee and as such has long had an interest in boosting 
federal support for basic science and emerging technologies, even though most 
other members of the delegation have paid scant attention to this matter, a key 
one for California. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has been targeted again by the national GOP, and is being challenged by 
Rob Guzman, a Rancho Cucamonga businessman who runs a job-training company. He 
faults Brown for his long-time incumbency and says the congressman is out of 
touch. But Guzman has no real vision for the district, instead supporting 
dubious panaceas like the balanced-budget amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 43rd District. Congressional freshman Ken Calvert (R-Riverside) does not merit 
reelection. The real estate developer is less known for accomplishment in 
Washington than the scandal that erupted when police found him in his car with 
a known prostitute. The episode prompts questions about his judgment, as does 
his record. He voted against family leave, the motor voter bill, budget deficit 
reduction, the desert protection bill and the crime bill. His rhetoric is 
particularly unhelpful on immigration. The Inland Empire, one of the state's 
fastest-growing regions, desperately needs jobs to compensate for defense 
cutbacks. So far, Calvert hasn't delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces Mark Takano, a Harvard graduate who is a public school teacher, in a 
rematch of the close contest that sent Calvert to Congress two years ago. The 
energetic and intelligent Takano promises to fight for more federal defense 
conversion money to support job-generating projects. He also advocates 
increased federal support for education, tougher crime prevention, increased 
border patrols and welfare reform that would put more recipients to work. 
Takano has proven effective on the Riverside Community College board of 
trustees. We endorse Takano. 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy Incumbents. Southern California is represented in Congress by many 
influential veterans who are likely to be easily reelected on Nov. 8. There are 
several whose accomplishments over the last two years merit special notice. 
</P>
<P>
 One is Jerry Lewis, a moderate Republican who represents the 40th 
Congressional District, which covers nearly all of San Bernardino County. We 
have endorsed him in the past because of his admirable and welcome efforts to 
avoid the rigid bipartisanship that too often gridlocks Congress. He was 
absolutely indispensable on the earthquake relief bill. Though we disagreed 
strongly with his opposition to the desert protection act, we applaud his many 
other strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Other incumbents who deserve another term include Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama 
City), one of the best political strategists in Congress; David Dreier (R-San 
Dimas), a hard-working member who tirelessly pushes for congressional reform 
and bipartisan cooperation; Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), an intelligent 
spokesman for fiscal responsibility and an expert on foreign affairs; Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who is indispensable on AIDS and other health issues; 
Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), who has offered constructive rather than 
reactive leadership on immigration and strong advocacy for more federal 
education funds; Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), a powerful subcommittee 
chairman of the coveted House Appropriations Committee who regularly delivers 
federal projects and much more to the region; Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), 
a former labor union leader who took a genuinely courageous stand in voting for 
NAFTA, and Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who fights feistily on behalf of 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California has several huge and expensive challenges that can be 
addressed only with Washington's help -- defense downsizing and immigration 
foremost among them. And nine months after the Northridge earthquake, the state 
needs still more federal disaster relief to renovate "ghost towns," help 
business owners rebuild and aid homeowners still hurting from the temblor. 
These challenges can be better faced if these local members of Congress return 
to Capitol Hill.

JOHNSON ON RELIGIOUS RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The column by Warren Johnson, "Who's the Model for the Christian Right?" 
(Commentary, Oct. 14), is right on. It's time people of faith stood their 
ground against the onslaught of intolerance toward any opposing view that may 
deter their agenda. God has blessed us with a democracy. Democracy works best 
when we can see each other as brothers and sisters, fellow citizens who are 
able to discuss the issues and reach a compromise. Democracy will not work if 
we resort to name-calling, division and hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does the religious right attempt to shipwreck my faith because of my 
political views? There are hundreds of issues with hundreds of degrees between 
the far right and the far left of each one. Why then do we need the black and 
white labels of "conservative" and "liberal," except to create an 
us-against-them mentality? 
</P>
<P>
 The Pharisees, the religious leaders in the Roman Empire during Christ's 
physical presence on Earth, believed that they were chosen by God to represent 
him and to interpret and impose his moral and political views on citizens while 
keeping close political ties to Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar?

 * I found Johnson's column to be less than persuasive. He cites biblical 
cautions about the love of money to disparage capitalism and support government 
controls. While I agree that the Bible is not a "capitalist manifesto," I have 
yet to uncover any Scriptures that argue for government coercion either. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, it is debatable whether our free-market economy is responsible 
for the many social ills that Johnson ascribes to it. Despite any inherent 
flaws, however, I would argue that capitalism in the long run raises all ships, 
and its non-coercive nature makes it the most moral choice available.

 As a person who dedicated a great deal of time to youth activities and youth 
groups, I was impressed by how frequently teen-agers would ask many of the same 
questions cited by Johnson. As a Scout leader, I was asked to explain behavior 
observed in parents that could hardly be considered Christian. These young 
minds needed guidance they were not getting at home. The commitment of 
parenthood must be recognized by parents, by the community, yes, and by the 
denizens of industry along with the federal government in order to preserve the 
family.  
</P>
<P>
 There are problems. They are real. We do not need the hypocritical pollution 
espoused by the religious right.

PROPOSITION 184 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Opponents of Proposition 184, the "three-strikes" initiative, parade a 
string of criminals and expect us to shed tears for a murderer who also steals 
meat, a moron who repeatedly burglarizes homes, a thief and attempted 
jailbreaker who falls asleep drunk in his vehicle with a gun and illegal drugs 
and other such misfits (Oct. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 These felons did much more than just "steal for a job interview," "steal $6 
worth of meat" and "steal a few slices of pizza," as the opponents of 184 would 
have us believe.By their obsessive criminal behavior, they demonstrate an 
inherent inability to conform to the rules of civilized society. To render them 
unable to further victimize others, they must be permanently removed from 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their criminal clients, opponents of 184 just don't get it: We don't care 
why some people habitually commit criminal acts, we don't care what factors 
"made" them do it (as if they should not be held accountable for their own 
actions) and we don't separate one criminal act from an individual's lifetime 
history of crime. In such cases, there is no difference between the theft of "a 
few slices of pizza" or a million dollars. Theft is theft. Period. If they 
can't get it, lock them up and throw away the key.

 Since 62% of voters polled think it is fine with them for wealthy candidates 
to use their own money to buy elections (Times Poll, Sept. 15), then why not 
hold an auction for political offices and do away with elections altogether? 
Think of the money to be saved! 
</P>

 Instead of spending all that money (it must be hundreds of millions all over 
the U.S.) on nasty campaigns, the funds raised from the auction could go toward 
paying off the national debt.

NOBEL FOR ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Albert Schweitzer, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Andrei Sakharov and . . . 
Yasser Arafat? Arafat surely deserves some credit for negotiating with Israel, 
but a Nobel Peace Prize? He is a self-described terrorist who was essentially 
forced to seek an agreement with Israel because of his rapid decline in power 
and popularity within the Palestinian ranks. Whether one believes in his 
political aims or not is irrelevant; he sanctioned killing as a means to his 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
 True men of peace, i.e., King and Gandhi, forward their political and social 
agendas through peaceful means. To put his name alongside the true peacemakers 
of the 20th Century is unconscionable.

alternative is victory for continued warfare, and in a nuclear age, eventual 
destruction of planet Earth itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who question the Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to Arafat, Shimon Peres 
and Yitzhak Rabin should vent their emotions over the failed rescue effort to 
free Israel's kidnaped soldier from Hamas, but not lose sight of what the 
committee said in making the selection: 
</P>
<P>
 "By concluding the Oslo Accords, and subsequently following them up, Arafat, 
Peres and Rabin have made substantial contributions to a historic process 
through which peace and cooperation can replace hate and war." 
</P>

 The greatest tribute we can give to the heroic dead is to continue the 
process, move forward and establish the peace.

WORLD BANK AND HAITI DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four weeks ago I spent more than an hour with Lisa McGowan explaining, among 
other things, the inaccuracies in her assessment that donors were imposing a 
development plan on President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his government. I 
explained to her what the World Bank, specifically, would fund in support of 
Haiti's effort to reconstruct the Haitian economy and reduce poverty. In the 
light of that conversation, I am frankly disappointed to read her commentary, 
which is inaccurate ("Forcing a Deal With the Devil," Commentary, Oct. 4). 
</P>
<P>
 The World Bank increasingly seeks ways to encourage participation of local 
people and beneficiaries in the projects it finances because projects designed 
by participants and beneficiaries are known to be better in quality, 
effectiveness and sustainability. Just last month the bank released a report 
documenting its experience in participatory development, the benefits realized, 
and identified plans to strengthen participation in the projects it funds even 
more in the future.  
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Haiti, a World Bank credit will finance an ongoing, 
demand-driven, anti-poverty program that was suspended at the time of the 
military coup in 1991. The program includes funding for rural health centers, 
water supply and sewerage disposal systems, primary schools and rural 
farm-to-market roads -- all of which the people of Haiti will design. The 
program is like a social investment fund. Local people can apply to the fund 
for the things they need most. 
</P>
<P>
 I should reiterate what I told McGowan: There is no World Bank program imposed 
on Haiti. There is an "economic and social reconstruction strategy," which was 
developed by President Aristide and his administration while in exile and which 
has gained broad support from a consortium of friendly countries and 
international donors, including the World Bank. That strategy does not include 
funding for export agriculture that will benefit the rich as McGowan claims. On 
the contrary, it provides funding for small-holder farmers. And the overall 
strategy has a strong anti-poverty bias.

PLATFORM; SOMETHING IS ROTTEN IN SEOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSIE MOON, a senior at Chatsworth High School, emigrated from South Korea 
when she was 3 years old. She comments on corruption in her native country: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many times my opinions have been forgiven with a condescending "she's still 
young." I do not require forgiveness, just an ear. So out of a desire for the 
betterment of Korea, I say: There is something rotten in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 The "something rotten" is the teachers, the students, the parents and everyone 
else who participates in bribery. During a recent trip to Seoul, I learned that 
bribery is rampant and was shocked that no one is taking steps to abolish it. 
Despite the awareness that the practice is illegal, parents offer huge sums of 
money to teachers so the teacher will favor their child. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonchalant attitudes the Koreans have developed toward this worries me 
greatly. If corruption is prospering at the bottom, what is to stop it from 
festering at the top? 
</P>
<P>
 The fountainhead of the recent collapse of the Songsu bridge over the Han 
River in Korea may be this bribery. Those responsible for the construction of 
the bridge -- the architects, builders, businessmen and politicians -- probably 
received their education under the safe tarpaulin of the won (unit of Korean 
currency). Instead of being taught history, sciences and literature, they first 
learned the importance of money. After giving money to administrators for 
entrance into a prestigious middle or secondary school or university, these 
students probably forked over another bundle to guarantee further success. 
</P>
<P>
 These same people may have received a certain amount to build the bridge, used 
a meager portion in the actual construction and the rest in the purchase of a 
fifth television set and other luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of Korea's top universities a few years back, the director of the dance 
department was found guilty of having received bribes from students. Her 
response to the verdict was something to the effect of "How dare you! I'm a 
prominent member of the church." 
</P>
<P>
 Many say there is no honesty or respectability in the Korean educational 
system. No future can exist when the ones who are to inherit the land are as 
morally underdeveloped as their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of the bridge is a metaphor for the decline of Korean morality and 
should be seen as a warning. The first step toward change is recognizing that 
the belief that wealth supersedes talent is just a myth. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught between a cultural rock and a hard place puts me in a strange 
situation. I wish to see a huge improvement in the bad aspects of the Korean 
society and yet I am angry and resentful that Korean society should be this way 
in the first place.

SEEING 'ETERNITY IN AN HOUR'; AN UNEXPECTED SIDE OF THE POST-ENLIGHTENMENT POET 
WHO WANTED TO TURN THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN TO GET IT RIGHT. 
</P>

 Some may settle for heaven when they die; I hope to go to the Huntington 
Library and Art Gallery in San Marino. It is a paradise of peace, refinement 
and scholarship. With its splendid gardens, collections of canonical authors 
and rooms filled with 18th-Century paintings, it seems to many visitors an 
embodiment of Establishment values. 
</P>
<P>
 But something odd is happening at the Huntington. No, "Blue Boy" and "Pinkie" 
have not suddenly vanished. Rather, the walls are now also adorned with the 
wild works of William Blake. While Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Thomas Lawrence 
painted fashionable portraits of the aristocracy, Blake was almost unknown. His 
art and ideas strongly opposed the ruling conventions of his day. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake was a poet-prophet-painter in the age of the French Revolution. Like 
other British radicals, he gave it his passionate support. In his poems 
"America," "Europe" and "The Song of Los," he projected political revolution 
into a more general apocalypse that would change human consciousness as well as 
governments. He wished to turn the world upside down to get it right side up. 
Blake's subversive allegiances were most clearly voiced in "The Marriage of 
Heaven and Hell." There, he sides with the devil and denounces all "sacred 
codes." The Proverbs of Hell in "The Marriage" reveal Blake's extreme 
iconoclasm:  
</P>
<P>
 The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.  
</P>
<P>
 Prudence is a rich, ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.  
</P>
<P>
 Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.  
</P>
<P>
 The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.  
</P>
<P>
 In other words, repression is bad, energy is good. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his writings and paintings, Blake's life was marked by the bizarre and 
the dangerous. According to an early biographer, a friend came upon the poet 
and his wife (un)dressed as Adam and Eve while reading passages from Milton's 
"Paradise Lost." In 1803, Blake tossed a drunken soldier out of his garden. The 
rowdy accused Blake of assaulting him and shouting, "Damn the King" -- which, 
given his political views, Blake may very well have done. In that age, such 
words were seditious, punishable by hanging. With the help of friends and a 
sharp lawyer, Blake beat the rap, but it was a close call. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake claimed that even as a child he had visions, such as beholding a tree 
filled with angels. Later in life, he believed some of his poems were dictated 
to him by spiritual presences. These visions and voices (combined with a dash 
of paranoia after the sedition trial) offer some evidence for those who 
suspected that Blake was crazy. But he was never institutionalized, and many 
who knew him declared him a mild-mannered fellow. If indeed Blake suffered from 
mental illness, he seems to have had a remarkable ability to channel his 
unusual ways of seeing and thinking into the production of great poetry and 
art. Once, while ascending the stairs in his house, he saw God creating the 
universe with golden compasses. He transformed this experience into his famous 
design, "The Ancient of Days." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the artist's most impressive works are his illuminated books. These he 
wrote, illustrated, etched and, with the help of his wife Catherine, printed 
and hand-colored. In our world of specialists and social fragmentation, Blake 
has come to represent a romantic union in which the creator controls the means 
of production. As one admirer put it, never was a man so completely the author 
of his books. 
</P>
<P>
 A generous selection of pages from these volumes can be viewed in the 
Huntington Art Gallery. (The Blake exhibit runs through Jan. 15.) Images of 
burning tigers, chained angels, a blacksmith forging suns and Satan in his fury 
give a glimpse of what Blake strove to see -- "Eternity in an hour." In the 
midst of the Huntington's tranquility and order, he is a radical artisan and 
agitated soul. If you think the Huntington too elitist, take another look. 
Blake composed his works for those he called "Children of the future Age."

RIORDAN, FERRARO WANT TO WORK WITH NFL ON STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and City Council President John Ferraro have 
told NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue that they are ready to "jointly explore 
options with you" on providing a stadium as a permanent home for the Super Bowl 
and an NFL theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 The language in the Oct. 17 letter to Tagliabue released by Riordan's office 
was not clear as to whether Riordan and Ferraro thought a new stadium, as 
proposed Oct. 2 by Tagliabue, is feasible, or whether they hope to use a 
renovated Coliseum, with luxury boxes added, as the stadium in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan was unavailable to explain what was meant in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer said, "The mayor unambiguously feels the 
Coliseum is the crown jewel of sports. This letter written with John Ferraro is 
really to leave the door open to the NFL's interest in our city as to a place 
to come to the Super Bowl many, many times in the future. That's all this was." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro said in interviews that improving the Coliseum is more feasible than 
building a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to have a brand new stadium somewhere, but where do we get 
it?" Ferraro asked. "As tough as the revenue situation is with the city and the 
county, I don't see any money coming (available). . . . And to build a stadium 
in the city of Los Angeles, to find the necessary amount of land to do it, 
without any opposition from homeowners or others, would be very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 A close associate of Riordan, Steven L. Soboroff, president of the city's 
Recreation and Parks Commission, said he was present at a meeting at Hollywood 
Park in early summer at which Riordan told Raider owner Al Davis and R.D. 
Hubbard, chairman of Hollywood Park, that parcels adjacent to the track were 
outside the city, and the mayor did not favor a new stadium there. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro said, and other sources confirmed, that the Coliseum Commission is 
considering building perhaps 40 luxury boxes on the Coliseum rim for the 1995 
season, even if Davis does not sign a long-term contract to play in the 
facility. Boxes might also make the stadium more appealing to the NFL for a 
Super Bowl, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, for now, has shown no readiness for serious negotiations on a long-term 
contract, Ferraro said.  
</P>
<P>
 Other sources said that at a meeting on Oct. 3 between Coliseum negotiator Don 
C. Webb and Davis, the Raider owner was unwilling to even say what he wants in 
Coliseum improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders did not return a call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Ferraro's letter to Tagliabue characterized the commissioner's 
Oct. 2 comments about putting the Super Bowl in a new stadium in the Los 
Angeles area on a rotating basis, perhaps every other year, as "very 
encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 "We share your optimism that such a commitment by the NFL could form a unique 
public-private partnership yielding an unprecedented level of innovation in the 
funding of stadium capital improvements," the two wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 "The manner in which the Los Angeles Coliseum was quickly restored from the 
devastation inflicted by the Northridge Earthquake demonstrates the city's 
commitment to enhancing an environment which is friendly toward sports and 
other businesses," the letter continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "But even though the Los Angeles Coliseum has undergone a transformation 
which, given the circumstances, was arguably more challenging than the 
construction of a new stadium, we agree that all options in the city should be 
objectively evaluated. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "We look forward to working with you and members of the NFL to ensure the 
development of a plan which carries the NFL and the City of Los Angeles forward 
well into the next century," Riordan and Ferraro concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Brown, a spokesman for the NFL, said Tuesday that Tagliabue sent a reply 
to the letter on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them we are continuing to assess various aspects of the stadium 
matters internally and we would be in touch with them or their staffs as we 
proceeded," Brown said. "We appreciate the willingness of Mayor Riordan and 
John Ferraro to be open-minded to ideas relating to stadiums in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake-damaged Coliseum was reopened on Sept. 3, with $60 
million in repairs largely financed by the federal government, Coliseum 
officials expressed hope that Davis would come to terms quickly on a long-term 
playing contract that would allow the financing of extensive Coliseum 
renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 But negotiating with Davis has never been quick or easy, and Coliseum sources 
say that Davis has already begun talking about taking the team elsewhere.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; WORLEY PUT ON NON-FOOTBALL INJURY 
LIST 
</P>

<P>
 Chicago Bear running back Tim Worley, who missed a team flight over the 
weekend and is said by the team to be tending to personal matters, was placed 
on the reserve non-football injury list. 
</P>
<P>
 His roster spot was filled by Kenny Shedd from the New York Jets' practice 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, a two-time offender of the league's substance-abuse policy, missed 
Saturday's team flight to Detroit. The Bears lost, 21-16, to the Lions on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the Bears nor Worley's wife, Becky, knew where Worley was until 
Sunday. He finally showed at home that afternoon and met with Bears Coach Dave 
Wannstedt on Monday. He has since remained unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Brett Favre, forced out of last Thursday's game against Minnesota 
with a muscle tear in his side, said that he expects to play against Chicago on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 He took part in only part of Tuesday's light workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Guy McIntyre also expects to play against the Bears, which would be only 
his second appearance this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-time Pro Bowl selection has been sidelined the past six games because 
of a blood clot and the medication he was taking to treat it. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Mike Kenn underwent his second magnetic resonance imaging 
exam in two days for a back problem that could cut short his 17th and final 
season with the Atlanta Falcons. Kenn, 38, underwent an MRI exam Monday in a 
bid to find the problem, believed to be protruding disks.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; MULTICULTURALISM: CONTROL OR SENSITIVITY?; 
DICTATORSHIP OF VIRTUE; MULTICULTURALISM AND THE BATTLE FOR AMERICA'S FUTURE BY 
RICHARD BERNSTEIN ; KNOPF $25, 378 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rodney King asked exactly the right question: Can't we all just get along? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Bernstein offers a disquieting answer in "Dictatorship of Virtue." The 
politics of race, gender and ethnicity in America have become so vicious, 
Bernstein argues, that we are hopelessly out of touch with the notion of a 
color-blind and classless society that was once the ideal of American 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Bernstein argues, we are threatened with a bizarre kind of cultural 
and intellectual authoritarianism in which every American is defined by his or 
her minority status, ranging from color to sexual orientation to physical 
stature, and every dissident is punished by Orwellian thought police. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole sorry mess, Bernstein suggests, is encompassed in the phenomenon of 
multiculturalism and all that it implies. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what is multiculturalism? According to Bernstein's rather snide 
definition, it's "a set of goals that ranges from teaching first-graders in 
Oregon about the achievements of sub-Saharan African civilization to racial 
set-asides and quotas at newspapers on the East Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 But multiculturalism is not merely a matter of race, according to Bernstein's 
superheated polemic. Rather, multiculturalism (and its cognates, such as 
diversity, inclusion and sensitivity ) describe what has become a holy war on 
not only racism but also sexism and "ageism," "classism" and even something 
called "lookism." 
</P>
<P>
 The examples of multiculturalism that Bernstein cites in his book are 
carefully chosen to make the point that multiculturalism is thought control, 
ranging from the merely silly to the downright sinister.  
</P>
<P>
 At times, he justly and correctly points out that the emperor of 
multiculturalism has no clothes, and he plausibly suggests that the most 
militant advocates of diversity are actually the guardians of a rigid 
orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They exalt racial and sexual rage over reason," he writes of what he 
characterizes as the Red Guard of multiculturalism in America. "They will turn 
almost anything they do not like into one of the new cardinal sins -- racism, 
sexism, sexual harassment, homophobia -- and they will try to punish those who 
commit those sins." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, who now works for the New York Times, is a veteran journalist who 
saw the worst excesses of thought control in the People's Republic of China, 
where he served as Beijing bureau chief for Time magazine. Now he gives us a 
parade of horribles intended to show us that the worthy goals of 
multiculturalism have been turned into a grotesquerie worthy of the Great 
Proletarian Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein visits the Philadelphia Inquirer, where an editorial on birth 
control prompted a public scourging of the editorial writers, who were accused 
of advocating "slow genocide" of African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 And he quotes from a feminist critic who says she discerns in the first 
movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony "the throttling, murderous rage of a 
rapist incapable of attaining release." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein cannot be faulted for the liberal and humane values that he espouses 
in "Dictatorship of Virtue" -- he calls on us to keep an open mind, but he 
insists that it be used for clear thinking and plain speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 But the subtext of "Dictatorship of Virtue" is mostly a matter of politics. 
When Bernstein defines multiculturalism as "a code word for political ambition, 
a yearning for more power . . . " for example, he is betraying his own anxiety 
about the changing balance of power in America -- the traditional Establishment 
is facing some vigorous competition from some very assertive people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insofar as culture is involved in multiculturalism," Bernstein writes, "it is 
not so much for me to be required to learn about other cultures as for me to be 
able to celebrate myself and for you to be required to celebrate me, and, along 
the way, to support my demand for more respect, more pride of place, more jobs, 
more foundation support, more money, more programs, more books, more prizes, 
more people like me in high places, a higher degree of attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein clearly disapproves of such demands. But we might well ask 
ourselves: Exactly what is wrong with the ambition for "more respect, more 
pride . . . more jobs"?  
</P>
<P>
 What weapons do we prefer the powerless to use in their struggle -- words or 
guns? And where do we want the struggle to take place -- on the campus and in 
the workplace, or in the streets?

CAMP CURBSIDE; NEIGHBORHOODS: HOMELESS FIND SAFE HAVEN IN THEIR VEHICLES ALONG 
A STRETCH OF STREET IN SILVER LAKE. RESIDENTS CALL FOR THEIR OUSTER, SAYING THE 
CAMPERS ARE SPOILING THE AREA AND HURTING PROPERTY VALUES. 
</P>

<P>
 For four years, a 1972 Dodge van with its tiny bed has been home to Ralph 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 A few steps away a man known only as Ed spends his days watching a small 
portable television in a pickup truck with a camper on top. Behind them, Betty 
West lives in a trailer with her dog Blondie. 
</P>
<P>
 This fleet of homes on wheels -- which sometimes can grow to 20 or more -- is 
not located in a trailer court. Instead, it is parked along Riverside Drive 
just south of Fletcher Drive in Silver Lake, a place that Smith and others say 
they heard about from friends as a safe haven from harassment by police. 
</P>
<P>
 To the dismay of nearby property owners, some of the campers, who say they 
have no other place to live, have parked here for as long as six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a preferred spot," explained Stan Carpenter, who unlike many 
others in the small motor community has been able to occasionally find work 
fixing cars. "It's very noisy and very dirty. We stick together basically 
because there is no place else for us to be."  
</P>
<P>
 Although they say they feel sorry for the campers, nearby residents also have 
bitter complaints and want them removed.  
</P>
<P>
 "A city street is not a trailer park," said homeowner John Ruege. "Get the 
people off the street and find them jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruege and others were so outraged six months ago that they complained to City 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg about transients urinating, defecating and 
littering along the street, accosting passersby for money and intimidating 
residents. They also blamed residents of the encampment for a rash of car 
burglaries and graffiti in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The transients say none of those charges are true and ask why they would want 
to spoil the area where they live, even if it is only a street. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Farfan, one of Goldberg's aides, said the city could force those in the 
motor community to leave, but that it would be unfair for the city to harass 
them unless there is a suitable alternative location for them.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's staff think they have such a solution. They hope a trailer court 
will be included in a proposal by the mayor's office to turn a vacant city 
block in the eastern part of Downtown into a homeless drop-in center. 
</P>
<P>
 If such a trailer park is established, Farfan said, those along Riverside 
Drive would have to abandon their current spot. 
</P>
<P>
 When questioned about that suggestion, Gene Boutilier, who heads the Los 
Angeles Homeless Services Authority, said he likes it. "That's a strategy that 
ought to be part of the mix of alternatives," he said. "Let's work on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the complaints from residents, Goldberg's office had garbage 
cans put near the campers, established regular trash pickups, installed a 
portable toilet and restricted parking to about a one-block area. 
</P>
<P>
 But property owners say such actions are only a quick fix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's part of an effort to clean up," Ruege said. "But that's also 
welcoming them. It's like telling them it's OK to live there. There needs to be 
a real solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Micheal Frances, who helped organize the Riverside Drive Neighbors' Alliance 
to deal with the complaints, said that as long as the trailers are on the 
street, "it lowers our property values and makes rental very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter and others said they do not want to live on the street, but they do 
like staying in their portable homes. "It feels more free to be in a motor 
home," Carpenter said.  
</P>
<P>
 David Hershey-Webb, another Goldberg aide, said, "There are people all over 
the city living in vehicles. Most of these people can't pay rent. Most have 
been evicted. Living in a van gives them a feeling of security." 
</P>
<P>
 The campers unfairly get blamed for everything that goes wrong in the 
neighborhood, Carpenter said. He said they try to keep the area clean and call 
Goldberg's office when they see something unusual. "They are our eyes and 
ears," Farfan agreed. "They call us about people dumping sewage. They sweep and 
clean." 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, many of the campers drive around so they can recharge 
batteries running their televisions and lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Most don't have jobs. None have a telephone and they get their mail from post 
office boxes. Only a few have sinks or refrigerators, so they stock up on 
canned food and items they can heat on their portable stoves. Many have to use 
the showers at a local swimming pool or the YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who counts on his neighbors to guard his van when he must go to the 
hospital, says he does not want to leave a community he has grown to trust. "If 
I park in a new place I've got to learn the people," he said. "If you shave and 
get a haircut they're wary of you. You're Mr. Clean." 
</P>
<P>
 West, who is now in the hospital, says she has a heart condition that prevents 
her from holding down a regular job. She lives on a monthly Social Security 
check of $690, which she says is not enough for an apartment or house rental, 
or even a space in a mobile home or trailer park.  
</P>
<P>
 Although property owners are still pressing for removal of the campers, both 
Goldberg's office and police say they are receiving fewer complaints. "In the 
last four to five months we haven't had more than three to four calls," Farfan 
says. "I don't think it's as disruptive to the community as a few people say it 
is."  
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think if somebody is going to be living somewhere seven days a week, 
with their license plates exposed, they would wander off right in their 
neighborhood and rob somebody?" Smith asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The fleet now sits on Riverside Drive with the Golden State Freeway on one 
side and a steep embankment on the other. It is about one block away from the 
nearest homes. Before the area where they could park was restricted, the 
transients would scatter along Riverside from Los Feliz Boulevard to Fletcher.  
</P>
<P>
 For their part, property owners want the campers out of their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't want them in my back yard," Ruege said.

 When they took their 1-year-old daughter to a pediatrician two years ago, 
Jorge and Josefina Morales of El Monte were simply seeking to have her runny 
nose and chest congestion checked. They were not expecting that a test recently 
mandated by the state would show the baby also had dangerously high levels of 
lead in her blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The test, administered in August, 1992, prompted a routine investigation by 
county health officials. The finding: The baby had been poisoned by lead paint 
flaking from the windowsills and bathroom door of the family's two-room 
apartment.  
</P>
<P>
 The Moraleses sued their landlord. Today, trial in their Pomona Superior Court 
case is scheduled to begin, setting a precedent of sorts. While other 
lead-paint poisoning suits have resulted in out-of-court settlements, theirs is 
the first in California to go to trial, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 While the case may stand out in legal terms, the Moraleses' story is a 
distressingly familiar one to Los Angeles County health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since testing of children from low-income families became mandatory three 
years ago, the number of reported lead poisonings in the county has jumped from 
a couple of cases a year in the mid-1980s to 529 last year.  
</P>
<P>
 County officials this year hired 65 additional health department employees to 
take on the burgeoning caseload and a backlog of 800 other cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the federal government had previously recommended blood-lead testing 
for children of low-income families, California did not adopt such a policy 
until it was sued by a variety of civil rights organizations in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, the county budget for lead cases remained stagnant -- only enough 
to pay for one investigator to handle the lead poisoning cases part-time -- 
while reported cases were climbing to 271 in 1992 from 44 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after County Supervisor Gloria Molina made lead poisoning an issue in 
1992 did the county begin applying for millions of dollars in federal grant 
money and state money from special fees assessed against the paint industry and 
other lead-emission producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the county has 75 employees to handle lead poisoning, including nurses who 
examine children with lead levels higher than 15 micrograms per deciliter of 
blood, environmental investigators who track down the source of lead poisoning 
and educational workers who provide prevention information. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes illustrate how California has belatedly overcome the false notion 
that the West Coast, with its relatively young housing stock, was free of 
lead-based paint, said Ellen Widess, an attorney with Lead Safe California, a 
nonprofit environmental advisory agency created earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Federal health officials estimate that more than 580,000 California children 
under age 6, or one in five, live in pre-1950 housing likely to contain paint 
with heavy concentrations of lead. Only 10% of California's low-income children 
-- the ones most at risk for lead paint poisoning because they are more likely 
to live in older and substandard housing -- have been tested so far, Widess 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although paint manufacturers in Europe stopped making lead-based paint in the 
1920s, the U.S. paint industry did not lower its high lead concentrations until 
1950. The U.S. government banned lead paint altogether in 1978.  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, building owners can be cited by the county and required 
to reduce lead concentrations by repairing their buildings. Failure can result 
in civil prosecution with fines of up to $2,500 a day, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Lisa Kaas of the district attorney's consumer protection division. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the division has filed lawsuits against auto body shops and 
battery manufacturers for releasing hazardous lead emissions into the air, Kaas 
said. Lead paint violations are a new ground for prosecution, with five 
landlords currently under investigation for possible legal action, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lead contamination can present landlords with an unexpected and overwhelming 
problem. Completely removing lead-based paint can cost tens of thousands of 
dollars per housing unit, according to Widess of Lead Safe California. Simple 
dry scraping of lead-based paint can release dangerous dust into the air, 
creating a worse hazard, comparable to asbestos removal. And the estimated 
number of houses with lead-based paint -- 2.2 million in California -- would 
overwhelm the few removal companies with the specialized skills and equipment 
to do the job safely, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Lead Safe is trying to devise containment measures such as coatings to 
encapsulate the chipping paint, special vacuums, wet mopping and removal and 
replacement of portions of buildings, such as lead-painted doors and sills. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the cases of lead poisoning in California are from Los 
Angeles County, state statistics show. And the Los Angeles-Long Beach area 
ranks among the top three metropolitan areas nationwide in the number of 
children at risk, Widess said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The myth was that kids had to eat paint chips, but it's in microscopic bits 
of lead flaking from houses that are not kept up and dust that seeps into the 
soil," she said. Jorge Morales, a 40-year-old battery plant worker, and his 
wife, 35, did not realize lead paint was a health problem when they moved into 
their Elliot Avenue apartment in 1987 with their two children, ages 6 and 7, 
said their attorney, Mark Ravis. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple complained to their landlords, Patrick and Rita Quan, about the 
peeling and chipped brown paint flaking from around the window sills and door 
frame because it looked ugly, Ravis said. 
</P>
<P>
 But their complaints went unanswered, they said. The Quans promised repair 
work but did none, Jorge Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Quans' attorney did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On May 8, 1991, the Moraleses' third daughter was born, a lively baby who sat 
with the family at the kitchen table under the flaking and peeling window sill. 
Because California did not require lead screening for children of low-income 
families until late that year, the baby's blood was not tested for lead until 
she came down with an unrelated flu-like illness nearly a year later, and was 
tested by a doctor covered under her father's medical insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
 After the county investigated, the Quans were cited. They replaced the window 
sill and door frame, but the child's blood lead levels remained high. Another 
visit by a county investigator revealed lead paint flaking from the bathroom 
door and frame. The Morales family moved out for a month in 1992 while the 
Quans made repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 There is still debate over what level of lead exposure is harmful to children. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider unsafe any 
level higher than 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood -- a ratio similar to an 
eyedropper of liquid in a gallon bucket. The Morales baby's blood-lead level 
was 34 micrograms per deciliter. Children younger than 6 can be without 
symptoms at the 10-microgram level, yet still suffer mental retardation, 
learning disabilities, impaired growth, hearing loss, limited attention span 
and behavior problems, according to the federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
 No treatment exists. Decreased exposure and a good diet help eliminate the 
lead from the child's body over time, experts said. Extreme exposures of 45 
micrograms per deciliter of blood can require intervention with drugs, called 
chelation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moraleses decided to sue their landlords after they discovered that their 
daughter might have been permanently harmed by her exposure. Her lead blood 
level is now 20 micrograms per deciliter, still above the federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 3-year-old girl is still too young for IQ testing, medical 
experts will testify in the trial that her IQ could be decreased by 15 points 
as a result of the exposure, attorney Ravis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Josefina Morales said her daughter seems to be lagging behind developmentally 
and is a pensive child. Talking has come more slowly for her than for her two 
older siblings, now 13 and 14. The family remains in the 18-unit apartment 
complex where peeling wooden doors and sills in other units were recently 
replaced with unpainted wooden doors and aluminum sills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it's clean here," Josefina Morales said. "But if I would have known what 
was in the paint, we would have left before." Lead Poisoning The number of 
lead-poisoning cases reported in Los Angeles County rose sharply after 
screenings of low-income children were required in November, 1991, and the

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: SIMPSON CASE JURORS DESERVE MEDALS, NOT ATTORNEYS' 
SCORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unbelievably, the prospective jurors are becoming the villains of the O.J. 
Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the people to trash in this tragic extravaganza, jurors are the least 
likely targets. They've been conscripted into duty in and pressed into action 
in a run-down, dirty Downtown courthouse. They must remain there all day, 
herded like cattle, isolated in dank waiting rooms, treated as if they were 
wayward children. And all this for $5 a day and free parking a good distance 
from the Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury panelists should be given public service medals. But instead they've 
been portrayed by prosecution and defense lawyers as greedy opportunists, eager 
to lie their way onto the Simpson jury to snare a lucrative interview contract 
with a tabloid TV show. Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark reflected this cynical 
and uncharitable view last week when she said at a hearing that "many if not 
most" of the panelists had lied in an attempt to get on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of hypocrisy in the attorneys' outrage. While they're 
complaining about the jurors trying to manipulate them, it's the lawyers who 
are the real manipulators, as if they were political campaign managers, trying 
to twist and turn the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I knew this before jury selection began. But I got a clearer and more precise 
view of the process from a book called "The Trial of OJ: How to Watch the Trial 
and Understand What's Really Going On" by Los Angeles attorney Charles B. 
Rosenberg, former legal consultant to the "L.A. Law" television show. 
</P>
<P>
 To Rosenberg, a trial is an exercise in storytelling. "Stories have a 
beginning, a middle and an end," he writes. "Stories have characters. Stories 
have a plot. Most of all, good stories make sense to people who hear them. 
Jurors are people." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a very simple idea, so simple, in fact, that I ignored it in first 
reading Rosenberg's book. But when I took a second look, I realized his thought 
explained what's now going on in the Criminal Courts Building during the long, 
tedious process known as voir dire, the questioning of potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers have campaign managers for the trial, known as jury consultants. 
Like the political consultants who are polluting our fall air with foul 
commercials, the jury consultants use polling and test groups -- "focus groups" 
-- to find jurors receptive to the prosecution or defense stories. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants, Rosenberg says, pose questions for the focus groups to learn 
something about people's attitudes: "What do they think about a person who buys 
a knife? What do they think of African American men? Are athletes people who 
work hard for their money or are they overpaid people who get too much 
attention? Do police accuse people fairly or just pick someone to blame so they 
can call the crime solved?" 
</P>
<P>
 When the data is assembled, the consultants prepare a statistical analysis, 
showing how attitudes vary among people of different education, income and 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 "So," says Rosenberg, "if you see jurors in voir dire being asked seemingly 
innocuous questions, you can be sure that the jury consultants hired by the 
defense and prosecution are busy crunching the answers through their 
statistical models, trying to decide if the answers predict good or bad 
receptivity attitudes concerning the story the jurors are about to hear. If 
they are thought to be inappropriate, the jurors may ultimately be challenged 
with a peremptory challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Having read this, I understood prosecutor Clark's questioning of a male 
prospective juror Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark asked a question right out of the Rosenberg book -- What do you think of 
the Los Angeles Police Department? "I haven't had any run-ins with them," the 
man said. Then Clark asked the man what he thought of her. This seemed strange 
until I remembered speculation that Clark had softened her manner and attire on 
the advice of jury consultants who said she came across as too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look like you're pretty tough," he replied. I wonder what the statistic 
crunchers made of that answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The next man in the box was even more of a challenge to the consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without saying much, he had a couple of strikes against him. He'd had two 
run-ins with the police, although not in Los Angeles. His brother is a National 
Football League team publicity director who'd met Simpson although "he hasn't 
told me anything" about the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 But even without this, the lawyers might object to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-prosecutor William Hodgman probed the psyche of the man, trying to find out 
if he was a Simpson fan and a potential not-guilty vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "You refer to him as O.J.," Hodgman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think many people know him as Mr. Simpson," replied the man, a 
plain-speaking African American who works two jobs and says he pays no 
attention to the "jaw jacking that usually goes on in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman tried another route into the man's mind. Were you surprised, he asked, 
when Simpson was arrested? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think America was surprised," the prospective juror replied. "Were you 
surprised?" he asked Hodgman. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a witness with something to hide, the prosecutor hesitated, then declined 
to answer. "It's not a fair question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A freethinker. A question-asker. I could be wrong, but I don't think this is 
the kind of person either side wants on the jury.

D.A. ASKED TO INVESTIGATE SUSPECTED VOTER FRAUD; ELECTION: A SIGNIFICANT 
PORTION OF NEW REGISTRATIONS TURNED IN BY 'BOUNTY HUNTERS' APPEAR QUESTIONABLE, 
COUNTY OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder Beatriz Valdez on Tuesday said her 
office has uncovered pockets of fraudulent voter registrations in Burbank, 
Pasadena and other locations around the county and she has forwarded the 
results of a preliminary investigation to the district attorney for possible 
criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez found that a quarter of the 143 people registered at one Burbank 
apartment complex by paid agents, known as "bounty hunters" in the political 
campaign trade, were questionable and likely fraudulent. Similar findings were 
uncovered at a Pasadena location. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, only about 4% of registrations are found to be questionable in spot 
checks by the registrar, officials said. Among the reasons for invalidating 
some of the registrations were improper signatures, underage applicants and 
lack of residency or citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 The questionable registration forms from Burbank and Pasadena had been issued 
to the Assembly Statewide Voter Registration Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alison Harvey, chief of staff to Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento), 
who heads the committee, acknowledged that there may have been a problem with 
two employees identified in the registrar's report. She said the committee had 
not been contacted by either the district attorney or the registrar regarding 
the registrations, but added that the committee will cooperate in any 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another organization investigated by the registrar, the Diverse Strategic 
Organization, also was found to have submitted a high number of improper voter 
registration forms. 
</P>
<P>
 In a check of 1,300 registrations filed by this group, about 12% contained 
incorrect information or listed an unusable address. Nearly 70% of the 
questionnaires mailed by the registrar to check on accuracy of the 
registrations were not returned. That is about double the usual rate, according 
to Darlene Bonds, assistant registrar-recorder, and will be among the 
statistics brought to the attention of the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Griego, who identified himself as the manager of Diverse Strategic, 
would not comment on the registrar's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Field, the deputy district attorney who heads the special investigations 
division that probes public corruption, said he had not yet seen the 
registrar's report, but added, "I'd be very interested to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the registrar must issue voter registration forms to 
virtually any group that requests them. It is routine to issue thousands of 
cards at a time to these political and civic organizations, according to Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the organizations, including those cited in the report, pay canvassers 
to sign up voters. Often they are paid by the card, or "bounty," as a 
registration form is referred to in the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey said that her organization ran about 15 crews of 10 to 12 workers each 
in the state this year, registering 223,540 new voters. Some workers were paid 
a flat rate of $6 an hour, others $2.50 per registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey said her group does a spot check of about 10% of the cards turned in by 
canvassers, to try to weed out problems. "They're stealing from us, too," when 
the canvassers bring in bogus registrations, Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never fails in this sort of drive that someone will do this," said Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who asked the registrar to investigate the 
allegations that were brought to his attention by constituents, said he 
believes the problem is widespread. He said he suspects many illegal immigrants 
are registering to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney has to make this a top priority," said Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harvey said the allegations may be more politically motivated. "We've been 
very successful in registering Democrats this year," said Harvey. "That's why 
they are upset."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
PHARMACISTS AT 7 COUNTY HOSPITALS STAGE SICKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly all the pharmacists at Los Angeles County's seven hospitals stayed off 
the job again Tuesday to protest a three-year wage freeze and cuts in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ralph Vogel, president of the Guild for Professional Pharmacists, 
said the sickout will be short, with pharmacists expected to return to work 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that the pharmacists will walk off the job again if no agreement 
is reached. He said 210 of the 220 pharmacists who work for the county 
hospitals were off the job Tuesday. The union has been negotiating with the 
county for several months.  
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we're getting no place fast," Vogel said.  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Giannini, a staff analyst for the county Department of Health Services, 
said supervisors and management personnel are filling prescriptions and 
outpatient clinic work is being performed by pharmacists hired by the county.

 Such respect for the judicial system is truly heartwarming: Crown Books 
outlets in Southern California are sequestering copies of Faye Resnick's lurid 
work, "Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted," behind 
placards that say: 
</P>
<P>
 "Attention Potential O.J. Simpson jurors. We will be happy to hold your book 
until after the trial."

 Actually, it's probably a toss-up: Perhaps you've noticed some mysterious 
billboards popping up around the Southland -- the ones that say, simply, "We 
Suck Less." We're sure that a punch line and an advertiser's name will be added 
later. In the meantime, we got to wondering who would make such a humble, 
low-class statement. We've narrowed it down to two candidates: the Democratic 
and Republican parties.

 Post-election special?Judging from the signs outside a Democratic Party office 
in Long Beach, there's one thing you can say about gubernatorial candidate 
Kathleen Brown. She's not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem Amtrak has avoided: While there's talk of crime being on the 
increase, it certainly isn't true in all categories. For instance, when was the 
last time you heard of a train robbery around here? 
</P>
<P>
 We thought about that while watching a documentary, "Gunfighters of the Old 
West." It recounted how, on Feb. 6, 1891, a gang led by the Dalton brothers 
held up Southern Pacific Train No. 17 on its way to L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 Posing as passengers, three of the robbers jumped up from their seats, donned 
red bandannas and climbed into the locomotive cab. 
</P>
<P>
 A shootout ensued and the Daltons left empty-handed. (In "Bloodletters and Bad 
Men," author Jay Robert Nash points out that such was their code of honor that 
the Daltons, like the Youngers, refused to rob passengers). 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Dalton brothers, Grat, was arrested and sentenced to 20 years in 
prison but escaped. He was later killed with brother Bob when the gang tried 
the difficult, robbing-two-banks-simultaneously stunt in Coffeeville, Kan.  
</P>
<P>
 By the way, the documentary attempts to put Ma Dalton's family in perspective. 
Sure, there were problems. But, in point of fact, only four of her 15 children 
became outlaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The devil's work: Lorna Lubarsky of Woodland Hills received a neighborhood 
flyer that seemed to confuse soles and souls. miscelLAny The first movie that 
Warren Beatty and Annette Bening made together was "Bugsy," which told the 
story of L.A. mobster Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel. Coincidentally, the couple, 
who've since married, named their son Ben. But he was named for Bening's 
father, not for Siegel.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICER'S SUSPECTED 
KILLER DIED FROM TWO SHOTS, AUTOPSY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apparently contradicting information released earlier, the coroner's office 
said Tuesday that a man suspected of murdering a Los Angeles police officer 
died from both a police rifle shot and a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Chief Willie L. Williams had told reporters that a police rifle 
shot fatally wounded Manuel Vargas Perez, 26, after a three-hour standoff that 
day at a Hollywood motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Monday, police said that an autopsy performed on Perez -- the 
suspected killer of officer Charles D. Heim -- showed that Perez died from a 
shot fired from his own .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun moments after police 
shot him in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on Tuesday, a coroner's spokesman said the autopsy concluded that 
Perez died from both wounds. The death is being ruled a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the opinion of the deputy medical examiner that both wounds caused the 
death of Mr. Perez," coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said. He said that 
information was passed to two police detectives who witnessed the autopsy on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police spokesman Capt. Bruce Hagerty acknowledged Tuesday that the detectives 
"should have probably communicated that (information) better," but Hagerty 
added that the issue "is really a matter of semantics, because you could say 
the self-inflicted gunshot wound advanced the inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the case will be turned over to the district attorney's office as a 
justifiable homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said Tuesday that they were still investigating the circumstances 
surrounding Heim's killing Friday night, when he and his partner, Felix F. 
Pena, were met by a barrage of bullets as they tried to enter Perez' room at 
another Hollywood motel after receiving a tip about drug dealing there. Perez 
reportedly jumped out a window and fled.  
</P>
<P>
 Heim died a few hours later at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Pena, wounded in 
his right hand, was treated and released the next day. ROBERT J. LOPEZ

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WALTERS 
URGES EXPANDING OLVERA STREET COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Rita Walters has proposed expanding the size of 
the city panel that oversees management of the park around Olvera Street, so 
that blacks have a chance to serve.  
</P>
<P>
 "Although the commissioners are of various racial composition, the board is 
not fully representative of the racial diversity that characterizes the 
ancestry of the city," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her motion, Walters noted that the original settlers in the area in 1781 
were made up of 11 families of Hispanic, African, Native American and mixed 
descent. In the mid-1800s, immigrants of Chinese, French, Anglo and Italian 
origin also settled in Los Angeles, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument Authority board consists of 
five Latinos, a Chinese American and an Italian American. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters wants to add two more commissioners. Her motion did not specify that 
African Americans be appointed to fill the new slots. The council's Arts, 
Health and Humanities Committee will consider her proposal at a future hearing.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; 2 HELD IN 
FATAL BEATING OF HOSPITAL EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica police have arrested two men in Panorama City on suspicion of 
fatally beating a 38-year-old Santa Monica hospital executive on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The bound body of Edward Patrick Broderick was found in the kitchen of his 
Santa Monica duplex. Police said they found items from his dwelling in the 
apartment of Lloyd Fred Smith, 24, and Norman Tooks, Jr., 28, after the two men 
were arrested on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said the men were traced through fingerprints and other evidence 
found at Broderick's duplex. Police said the suspects apparently selected 
Broderick's home at random and ransacked the place, taking cash, a cellular 
phone and credit cards after killing him.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WOODLAND HILLS; COUPLE 
CHARGED WITH FILING FALSE CLAIMS IN FLOOD, QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland hills couple have pleaded not guilty in Los Angeles federal court 
to charges that they filed fraudulent damage claims with the Small Business 
Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency after both the 1992 
flood and last January's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first incident of someone . . . who has taken advantage of two 
natural disasters," said Assistant U.S. Atty.Nathan Hochman. 
</P>
<P>
 After the flood of February, 1992, Douglas Maskart, 53, and Joyce Maskart, 44, 
applied for compensation for damage to their home. They sent forged rental 
receipts and received 18 months of rental assistance from FEMA totaling 
$11,256, Hochman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, the Maskarts filed three FEMA applications for disaster 
relief, claiming they had lost $34,380 in personal belongings. They also 
submitted four false disaster home loan applications with the SBA, Hochman 
said. Their trial is set to begin Dec. 13.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; WOMAN PLEADS 
GUILTY IN ACCIDENT INVOLVING CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood woman whose 2-year-old son knocked her idling car into gear, 
causing it to run over five children in her driveway, pleaded guilty Tuesday to 
a misdemeanor child-endangerment charge and was sentenced to 24 months' 
probation and 150 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Estela Lopez, 33, entered her plea in Van Nuys Municipal Court as part of an 
agreement with prosecutors.She originally had been charged with two 
child-endangerment counts in connection with the freak accident and, if 
convicted, faced up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the neighborhood children, ages 5 to 10, were hospitalized in serious 
or critical condition July 30 after the car struck a sofa on which they were 
playing, driving it into a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said witnesses told them that Lopez left her child in the car with the 
engine running while she ran inside the house to get her purse. Lopez 
maintained that her son somehow opened the car door and climbed in on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the district attorney's office declined to file charges. Later, 
however, the city attorney's office decided to file the misdemeanor charges, 
questioning Lopez's account of what happened.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; DISPUTE ERUPTS OVER PLANNED RADIO SPOTS 
FOR PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With two weeks left before Election Day, the battle over Proposition 187 
continued to heat up Tuesday with controversy erupting over a planned 
last-minute pro-187 radio ad campaign by a national immigration reform 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams and the Board of Rabbis of Southern 
California issued statements opposing the sweeping ballot measure, which seeks 
to eliminate most government services for illegal immigrants and require 
educational, health and law enforcement officials to report suspects to federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio flap concerns purchase of ad time by the Washington-based Federation 
for American Immigration Reform, a group known as FAIR that previously had 
indicated it was making no financial contributions in support of Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 FAIR Executive Director Daniel A. Stein, acknowledging that the organization 
has reserved radio time for the last week of the campaign, said it is doing so 
only to be able to respond to recent ads aired by Taxpayers Against 187, a 
coalition of organizations opposed to the ballot measure.  
</P>
<P>
 But spokesman Joel Maliniak of Taxpayers Against 187, which made public the 
pending FAIR radio campaign Tuesday, said that FAIR officials have "been caught 
lying with their pants down." 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, FAIR, whose former Sacramento lobbyist, Alan Nelson, 
co-authored Proposition 187, has come under repeated attack from the taxpayers 
group for receiving a portion of its annual funding from the New York-based 
Pioneer Fund. The latter is a group that has also sponsored research by various 
scientists, including the late William B. Shockley, who contended that blacks 
are inherently intellectually inferior to whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the indirect link between Nelson and the Pioneer Fund, Taxpayers 
Against 187 have charged in their radio ads that the ballot measure is backed 
by white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein said any ads that FAIR now runs would be "to defend ourselves." Stein, 
who has previously taken pains to point out that his organization had nothing 
to do with the drafting of Proposition 187, added that his group's ad "may 
(also) say vote for 187 -- it won't say vote against it." 
</P>
<P>
 "FAIR has attempted to distance itself from Proposition 187," responded 
Maliniak. "This latest development completely contradicts FAIR's denials and 
leaves absolutely no doubt about its involvement behind the scenes at the Yes 
on 187 campaign."

TOP OF THE HEAP; CLAREMONT MAN WINS CONTEST FOR MESSIEST HOME OFFICE IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't a good day to come visit, Clive Miller acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax extension he got six months ago was up. And the 56-year-old writer and 
financial investor was busy at his Claremont office hunting for lost tax 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way things go when you work in the messiest home office in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Piles of old mail, stacks of books and a hodgepodge of file folders spilling 
their contents cover a desk and table tops. Somewhere under wobbly towers of 
old bank statements and investment magazines are a fax machine and a computer 
printer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickety plastic in and out trays and particle-board shelves scattered around 
the 300-square-foot office are hopelessly crammed. File cabinet drawers are 
stuffed full, and loose sheaves of paper overflow the cabinet tops. An old 
roll-top desk in the corner is barely visible: So much stuff is piled on it 
that its top no longer rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The mess is enough to put Miller on the top of the heap in a contest to find 
the nation's most cluttered work space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a little like the Menendez boys: I don't know whether to feel elation 
or shame at what I've done," Miller said of the award. 
</P>
<P>
 His prize includes computer gear aimed at turning his into a paperless office. 
And a four-day visit from a clutter control expert who will help clear a spot 
for Miller to put his winnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried that four days won't be enough," said Miller, poking through 
papers, boxes and grocery bags full of letters smothering a couch in the center 
of his office. "I'm looking for a zero-coupon bond. It's mystifying where I put 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The contest, conducted by Home Office Computing magazine, drew hundreds of 
entries. Besides snapshots of their messy offices, entrants had to send in a 
200-word essay explaining how bad things were. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mine turned out to be 800 words," said Miller. When his 19-year-old son, 
Dhimitri, chided him for the length ("Well, Dad, here's an example of the 
problem right here"), Miller reluctantly tossed out 600 words. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's editor, Kathy Brower of New York City, said the contest was 
started a year ago in response to readers' complaints that home offices lack an 
amenity found in downtown offices: janitorial service. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller heard about the clutter competition last spring on the radio. "It was a 
little happy note at the end of a newscast," he recalled. "I called the 
magazine and they sent me a copy that explained the contest. But of course I 
put it in here somewhere and couldn't find it after a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's pictures portrayed an office so messy that judges telephoned his wife 
to ask if the place was really that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'Don't get me started,' " said Sophia Miller, his wife of 31 
years. "My husband is kind of super-compulsive. He drives me crazy. I'd like to 
throw everything away." 
</P>
<P>
 Clutter has been accumulating for about 10 years, acknowledged Miller, a 
former literature professor at Stanford University whose own writings include 
one published novel -- and bits and pieces of several partially finished 
manuscripts hidden among the piles. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the mess is reference material for a volume he is writing on the 
history of Hollywood. But a lot of it -- such as the discount coupons for 
doughnuts that expired four years ago -- isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Disorganized offices owned by two other Los Angeles-area residents were also 
cited by the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Aubrey Pilgrim, a computer book author from Long Beach with thousands of 
computer magazines stacked in his converted two-car garage office, was third 
runner-up. The 70-year-old retired Lockheed electronics engineer said Tuesday 
that his place is so cluttered that "after the earthquake I couldn't tell if 
I'd had any damage or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Mirk Mirkin, a marketing and meeting planner who lives in Sherman Oaks and 
admits he has "cluttered up half the house," won an honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The scope of Miller's mess was a shock to clutter-removal expert Lisa Kanarek, 
the Dallas-based author of "101 Home Office Success Secrets" who will visit 
Claremont next month to clean it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gauge is: If you haven't looked at something in a year, get rid of it," 
Kanarek said Tuesday. "I'll have help with me when I go there. The goal is to 
work within Mr. Miller's organizational style." 
</P>
<P>
 What if she finds Miller has no such style -- or no desire to throw anything 
way? 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wants to save everything, we'll have to sit down and have a long talk," 
she said.

NEEDLE SWAPS ILLEGAL, COUNTY COUNSEL SAYS; GOVERNMENT: LEGAL ADVISER TELLS 
SUPERVISORS THAT ALLOWING AN EXCHANGE TO HELP PREVENT AIDS WOULD BE AGAINST THE 
LAW EVEN IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles County Counsel DeWitt Clinton, in a brief but definitive opinion, 
told the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday that it would be illegal to allow 
needle exchange programs for drug abusers under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's opinion appeared to dash, for the moment, the hopes of several board 
members who favor needle exchange programs to reduce the spread of AIDS among 
intravenous drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 The county counsel said it would not only be illegal to allow such exchanges 
but that the county could be liable for any harm that results from such a 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The opinion comes a month after Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and the City 
Council took steps to foster needle exchange programs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council's urging, Riordan declared a state of emergency in an attempt 
to avoid state law that normally bans the public issuance of needles for 
illegal drug use and without a doctor's prescription. San Francisco officials 
made a similar declaration in 1993 to allow exchange programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But County Counsel Clinton said that in his opinion the declaration of a local 
emergency still "does not permit the violation of state law." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. James K. Hahn and Police Chief Willie L. Williams have as taken a 
more flexible stance. In response to the declaration by the mayor and counsel, 
the city attorney's office is handling cases of needle exchange on a 
case-by-case basis, said Earl Thomas, assistant chief of the criminal division 
of the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not bound by the (council action) but it does weigh in our 
consideration" when determining whether to prosecute, Thomas said. Police are 
also seeking to abide by the council's request and are not actively pursuing 
grass-roots groups that sponsor needle exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving the county counsel's opinion, the Board of Supervisors delayed 
a vote on implementing needle exchanges, and instead asked for more opinions on 
the topic. A spokesman for Supervisor Ed Edelman, who has been advocating 
exchange programs since 1988, said the board will continue to look for a way to 
implement an exchange program legally.

COUNTY CELEBRATES COST-CUTTING, BUT SOME QUESTION ITS FIGURES; GOVERNMENT: 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY SAVED TAXPAYERS $253 MILLION IN LAST YEAR. THEY ADMIT, 
THOUGH, THAT ESTIMATES SUBMITTED BY PROGRAM MANAGERS WERE ACCEPTED AT FACE 
VALUE. 
</P>

<P>
 Under the glare of popping flashbulbs Tuesday, Los Angeles County officials 
beamed for the cameras, claiming to have saved taxpayers a whopping $253 
million by cutting costs during the last fiscal year, more than four times what 
was saved the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the county's Productivity and Quality Commission sponsored the 
brief celebration at the Hall of Administration to mark what they called a 
banner year of cutting government waste, encouraging innovation and improving 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems little doubt that some of the programs -- such as consolidating 
courts in Santa Monica -- have reduced costs from last year's $13.7-billion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But on closer examination, even some commission members questioned some of the 
claimed savings. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Department of Health Services estimates that it earned an extra $10 
million in revenue through more efficient Medi-Cal billing at Harbor/UCLA 
Medical Center. But the commission failed to note that the department lost $24 
million at some of its other hospitals because of delays in Medi-Cal billing 
caused by the collapse of an expensive computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Department of Public Works estimated that 451 homeowners in Malibu and 
the San Gabriel Valley could save $50 million over the next three to four storm 
seasons if they heeded the department's advice and took steps to reduce erosion 
of fire-ravaged hillsides. Although the Post-Burn Mudflow Protective Advice 
Program may indeed reduce property damage and prevent the loss of lives, "I 
wondered myself about whether it is really a direct cost savings to the 
county," said Virginia Bortin, the commission's executive director. 
Nonetheless, the $50 million was added to the tally of savings. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Department of Community and Senior Citizens Services helped land a 
$20-million federal grant for homeless programs that the commission counted as 
part of the savings. But not only is the money to be shared with the city of 
Los Angeles, the county probably would not have spent that much on such 
programs had the grant been denied.  
</P>
<P>
 County officials acknowledged that some of the alleged savings may be 
questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission accepted at face value the estimates submitted by 184 program 
managers. "We probably should have proved those numbers first," said Robert M. 
Hertzberg, an attorney who sits on the 17-member commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, their annual effort to recognize programs that cut costs and improve 
services is still worthwhile, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has spinoff value," said County Administrative Officer Sally R. Reed, who 
has urged the county to be more fiscally responsible since she was hired a year 
ago. "The more positive attention you give to those kinds of efforts, the more 
county departments are going to be that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Health Services Director Robert C. Gates said, "If you always balance the 
gains against the losses, and say no one deserves recognition, you've 
eliminated the incentive for people to make improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 Massive state budget cutbacks have forced the county to save more during the 
1993-94 fiscal year, which ended in July, than in each of the past seven years 
since the commission has kept track of such data, Bortin said. "Departments 
were under the knife," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Gloria Molina, a frequent critic of the county's fiscal 
policies, suggested that much more needs to be done.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are good things that go on; you can't dismiss those things," she said. 
"But whether we're more efficient now? I don't know whether that's a claim we 
get to make yet."  
</P>
<P>
 The steps the county took to save taxpayers' money or improve public services 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 *Installing better computer systems in the Department of Mental Health and 
Administratively Unified Courts that reduced the county's costs by $3.9 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 * Consolidating the Santa Monica Municipal and Superior courts, avoiding the 
need for a new $56-million courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Using volunteer attorneys in Glendale Superior Court to resolve civil cases. 
The program saved about $1.9 million in court costs.  
</P>
<P>
 * Reducing illness or injury claims in several departments -- including the 
County Administrative Office, where a wellness program was projected to save 
more than $2 million annually, and in the Public Works Department, where a 
safety program saved $4.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing a county team to investigate financial abuse of the elderly. 
Counting the Savings Los Angeles County officias praise cost-cutting programs 
that have saved taxpayers $253 million for the 1993-94 fiscal year. Closer 
examination raises some questions about county arithmetic. * 
</P>
<P>
 The Good Department: Courts Program: Consolidate Santa Monica municipal and 
superior courts. Estimated savings / revenue: $48 million Explanation: Avoids 
need for new $56-million courthouse. *

BUILDER FINED $447,125 FOR SUBWAY SAFETY VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the largest job safety fines in recent years, state and federal 
inspectors levied $447,125 in penalties Tuesday against the builder of Los 
Angeles' troubled subway for safety violations found after last summer's tunnel 
explosion injured three workers. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cal/OSHA official also confirmed that the agency is conducting a criminal 
investigation into the explosion that rocked a tunnel beneath Vermont Avenue 
and 6th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine raised the total penalties levied this year against tunnel contractor 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny for safety violations to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers' safety was cited by federal officials when they cut off funds Oct. 5 
for the subway until the Metropolitan Transportation Authority demonstrates 
that it can competently manage the project. Tunneling has been halted since 
Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, a joint venture of three construction 
firms, said in a statement: "SKK has the best safety record for all the 
tunneling contractors on the Metro Red Line and is well below the national 
average for lost work day incidents." The company is appealing all of the 
citations to a special panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The action Tuesday by state and federal Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration officials grew out of an investigation of the July 18 explosion 
that injured three workers, including one who remains hospitalized with burns 
over more than 70% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal-state investigation found that the explosion occurred after a 
270-pound steel bracket, which was being cut by a welder, fell about 10 feet 
and punctured an acetylene tank. The tank caught fire, and the heat caused an 
adjacent cylinder to explode, creating a flash fire that burned oily rags, 
hoses and timber lagging, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA officials cited the contractor for, among other things, failing to 
secure the steel bracket before it was cut loose, failing to provide fire 
protection equipment when cutting torches were in use and failing to inform all 
employees of emergency response plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors issued 15 citations, including five for "willful serious" 
violations -- which imply that the contractor knew of the hazards but ignored 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the violations were failure to place welding cylinders far enough from 
the cutting operations so that sparks would not reach them and storing more gas 
tanks in the tunnel than permitted.  
</P>
<P>
 MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White has said he will not seek to 
terminate Shea-Kiewit-Kenny's contract, citing the additional costs and delays 
to the subway project.

RIORDAN BACKS MID-VALLEY SUBWAY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just hours before a crucial vote today on mass transit in the San Fernando 
Valley, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan weighed in Tuesday on the side of a 
mid-Valley subway line, dealing what could be a decisive blow to proposals for 
an elevated train above the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's announcement came less than 24 hours before the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority is expected to decide the issue, the subject of years 
of bitter debate over the best way to link the West Valley to the Metro Rail 
system running from the East Valley to Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 With the mayor's backing, supporters of a mostly underground line paralleling 
Burbank and Chandler boulevards now have at least four votes lined up on the 
13-member MTA board. In addition to Riordan, the proposal has won the blessing 
of Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman -- the underground route's most 
outspoken advocate -- and two of Riordan's three appointees to the MTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the most ardent champion of the Ventura Freeway 
route, blasted Riordan's decision as a "slap in the face" to Valley voters, who 
favored a monorail above the freeway in a non-binding 1990 referendum.

TIGER STILL ON COURSE OF HISTORY; GOLF: STANFORD FRESHMAN WOODS WINS COLLEGE 
TOURNAMENT AT CONTROVERSIAL SHOAL CREEK IN ALABAMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tiger Woods insisted he never thought about the social significance of what he 
was doing Tuesday. To him, it was just another golf course, another tournament, 
another victory. After all, he's only 18. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was hard not to think back as Woods walked off that final green at 
Shoal Creek, a winner on the course that forever will be linked with golf's 
civil rights awakening. If there was any doubt before, this willowy, 
multiethnic teen-ager was proving again that this sport is not for whites only. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just went out and wanted to play well," said Woods, a Stanford freshman 
from Cypress. His two-shot victory in the Jerry Pate National Intercollegiate 
tournament helped the Cardinal, the defending national champions, win the team 
competition by 27 shots. "The significance to me is our team won, and I also 
happen to be the individual champion," Woods said. "That's what we came to do. 
We play to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Shoal Creek founder Hall Thompson sparked a national furor 
when he said his all-white country club wouldn't be pressured into accepting 
African Americans before the PGA Championship. Eventually, one African American 
was admitted, and the PGA was forced to re-evaluate the membership policies of 
clubs around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, while three African American activists protested outside the front 
gate, Thompson spent a good part of the day trailing Woods around the course, 
probably as amazed as everyone else by his talent. Woods finished with a 
25-foot birdie putt up a steep incline for a three-round, 10-under-par total of 
206. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a great player," Thompson said to Woods as he walked off No. 18 
following a 5-under 67. "I'm proud of you. You're superb." 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the day three shots behind Auburn's Ian Steel, Woods overcame that 
deficit before they made the turn. But Stanford teammate William Yanagisawa 
made a charge, finishing at 208 with his second consecutive 68 to put the 
pressure on Woods heading into the final two holes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the par-five 17th, Woods wound up on the left fringe about 50 feet from the 
hole in two and two-putted for birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 At No. 18, a downhill par-four, Woods' second shot rolled into a valley on the 
steeply sloped green. "Go Tiger Woods!" someone yelled from a nearby house. 
When the putt snaked up the incline and dropped for another birdie, Woods 
raised his putter to those fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit the ball exactly the same way as I did the first two rounds," said 
Woods, who this year became the first African American, and the youngest 
player, to win the U.S. Amateur, confirming his status as the sport's rising 
star. "It's just that more putts fell today." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about trying to reach the green in two at No. 11, the other 
par-five on the back nine, Woods seemed befuddled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" he asked. "It was in my range, so I decided to go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods' two-iron sailed over a creek and onto the green. The other two in his 
group, including Steel, laid up short of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Auburn's Steel admitted it was tough to cope with the Tiger factor, 
especially with up to 100 people following their group around the course. 
College tournaments, including this one, usually draw only a handful of 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew most of the people out there were watching Tiger," said Steel, who 
struggled to a 73 in the final round and finished tied for third at 209. "It's 
always tough when you have one of the best amateurs in the world playing with 
you. You can't really block it out."  
</P>
<P>
 Woods, who already has won two college tournaments, said he was impressed with 
Shoal Creek, which was designed by Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely awesome," Woods said. "This course was (built) before 
Nicklaus went crazy with his designs. It's pretty flat and straightforward, and 
not so diabolical around the greens except at 18. That's the way I like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even against a strong field, which included the last four NCAA team champions, 
Stanford won easily. The Cardinal carried a 10-shot lead into the final round 
and finished with an 18-under 846. Auburn was a distant second. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only Tiger, it's the whole team," said John Daly, who is helping 
coach Arkansas, his alma mater, during his sabbatical from the PGA Tour. 
"They've got everything. Stanford is better with the short game than any team 
I've ever seen."

BURROUGHS SERVED VERY WELL BY ITS ACES; VOLLEYBALL: HART CAN'T RETURN SERVICE 
17 TIMES IN ABSORBING FOOTHILL LEAGUE SWEEP. RUSSELL CONTRIBUTES 15 KILLS.

 Linda Murphy, Burroughs High girls' volleyball coach, said she knows her team 
is playing well when its serving is on. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first game of Tuesday's Foothill League match against Hart, Murphy 
knew Burroughs was in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs had eight aces in the first game and 17 overall in a 15-13, 16-14, 
15-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs, Hart and Canyon have two league losses. The sweep by Burroughs 
means the league champion will not be decided until the Foothill League 
tournament next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kara Older led Burroughs (10-3, 5-2) with six aces, including one on match 
point. None of Older's aces came in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our serving can really make a difference in close games when we're playing 
against a good team," Murphy said. "There's no question we served very well 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Four players had first-game aces. Elizabeth Vejar had three in a row as 
Burroughs took the lead for good, 12-10. Christy Russell and Julie Pham each 
had two aces, Suzy Babko had one. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart (9-4, 6-2) was plagued by serving problems throughout the match, but did 
finish with six aces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply just gave away points," Hart Coach Mary Arispe said. "We blow five 
or six serves in a game, we're not going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside hitter Russell finished with 15 kills, four in a row at one point. She 
added four blocks and four aces. Eleven of the kills came in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Holowach had 14 kills for Hart.

 Marina, led by Marcy Crouch's 27 kills, moved into a third-place tie with 
Esperanza in Sunset League girls' volleyball by beating Fountain Valley, 10-15, 
17-15, 15-6, 15-12, Tuesday at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (8-7, 3-4) took an 11-4 lead in Game 4 but had to hold off Fountain 
Valley.The Barons scored eight of the next nine points to tie the score, 12-12, 
but Jessica Lyon served an ace and Crouch had two kills to end the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last game we got up a little bit and started pressing ourselves," Marina 
Coach Jason Bilbruck said. "In the timeout, I told Marcy, 'You're the one we 
need to win this one.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley (4-6, 2-5) was led by Kristin Moro, who had 20 kills, 
including six in the first game, when Marina made several unforced errors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Vikings' play improved in the second game, which had four lead 
changes. At 15-15, a double-hit was called on Fountain Valley, and on the next 
point, Moro's kill attempt was wide, giving Marina the game. GABE LACQUES

SIDELINES; BUENA'S SWARTOUT MIGHT PREFER TO FACE MUSIC IN THE POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing the two-meter position, Buena High's Matt Swartout spends entire water 
polo matches in a pool with opponents climbing on him, elbowing him in the 
head, jamming his face underwater and kicking him. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's kind of ironic that Swartout would suffer a serious injury . . . at a 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
 While watching a band play earlier this month, Swartout said, he was 
accidentally smacked in the face by an overzealous fan. He suffered a 
concussion and a cracked left cheekbone. 
</P>
<P>
 "My face still feels numb," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Swartout, one of the top players for Buena, missed the Bulldogs' key game 
against Santa Barbara last Tuesday but, despite some discomfort, played 
Thursday against San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
 One final note. The name of the band -- Face to Face. 
</P>
<P>
 Take two: Soon after the public-address announcer started rattling off the 
numbers of door-prize winners, it became apparent something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was showing up to claim the spoils. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Haller, Antelope Valley College's sports information director, had 
arranged for a local hotel to supply prizes for randomly selected fans at 
Antelope Valley's game Saturday against Desert. Now, it seemed, nobody was 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until the game was almost over was Haller informed that stadium workers 
had mistakenly failed to return ticket stubs -- with the numbers on them -- to 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize drawing has been rescheduled for Antelope Valley's final home game, 
Nov. 12 against Citrus College. 
</P>
<P>
 Been there, done that: A guy should be considered an up-and-comer only for so 
long. Phil Gonzalez, a Crescenta Valley High senior, has passed that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, competing in his first full cross-country season, is one of the 
region's top runners -- period. Proof positive: his third-place finish Saturday 
in the boys' individual sweepstakes race of the Mt. San Antonio College 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gonzalez's five-race winning streak came to a close, his time of 15 
minutes 25 seconds over the three-mile course put him in a tie for sixth among 
Southern Section competitors at all levels in the two-day meet. 
</P>
<P>
 John Greene of Agoura (15:27), the defending Southern Section Division II 
champion, was among the more renowned runners who finished behind Gonzalez.

 Telling it like it is: 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley running back Chris Hedrick, on last week's 34-20 Pacific 
League loss to Hoover: "We underestimated them and they kicked our butts." 
</P>
<P>
 And like it was . . .: Alemany Coach Pat Degnan, after opening Del Rey League 
play with consecutive losses to Bishop Amat (49-0) and Loyola (37-0): "We're 
really happy to have those first two out of the way." Stats 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge safety Joseph Vaughn made his seventh pass interception 
of the season last week to tie the NCAA Division I-AA single-season record set 
in 1990 by Robert Turner of Jackson State. With 249 yards on interception 
returns, Vaughn is two shy of the I-AA single-season mark set by Zack Bronson 
of McNeese State in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, a senior from Sylmar High, has returned four interceptions for 
touchdowns. Other than kicker Matt Ornelaz, he leads the Matadors in scoring. 
He also leads Northridge with 62 tackles, including 11 last week when he was 
selected the team's defensive player of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit hard: Because of injuries, the Camarillo High football team has lost its 
opening-day starters at nine of 22 positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Time off: Barring a big comeback, the Saugus High girls' volleyball team will 
not make the playoffs, ending a streak of 15 years that a team coached by 
Bobbie Estes has qualified for the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Estes' teams at La Canada High qualified for the playoffs 12 consecutive years 
before she took over at Saugus in 1991. Honors 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Duc Ngo of Cal State Northridge, who caught 11 passes last week, has 
been selected American West Conference and team offensive player of the week. 
Ngo, who has 111 receptions in his career, last weekend broke the school record 
of 106 set by Dick Billingsley in 1966-67. Ngo's 11 catches also tied an AWC 
single-game record set last fall by Joe Wade (Canyon High) of Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy returns: Glendale College receiver Tim Hilton has been selected Western 
State Conference offensive co-player of the week. Hilton returned four kickoffs 
for 175 yards, including one 78 yards for a touchdown, in a 38-6 victory over 
Ventura. He also had a 44-yard touchdown reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsmen crowned: Cal Lutheran defensive back Chad Valousky has been selected 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference defensive player of the 
week. Valousky had three interceptions, including one he returned 55 yards for 
a touchdown, in Cal Lutheran's 43-14 victory against Azusa Pacific on Saturday.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; RATE WORRIES HURT STOCKS FOR 4TH DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street stocks fell for the fourth straight session Tuesday, as traders 
grew pessimistic about rising interest rates and the falling dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond has continued to trade above 8%, 
raising fears that higher interest rates could lure investors from stocks and 
also inhibit corporate profits next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just that fear of rates," said Jack Regan, market analyst at 
Josephthal, Lyon and Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average closed down 4.71 points at 3,850.59 -- bringing to about 
85 points the amount the index has lost since it began falling last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 9 to 5 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where a hefty 326.11 million shares changed 
hands, up from the previous session's 287.64 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's bellwether long-bond yield remained stuck at its 2 1/2-year 
high of 8.04%. Its price ended down 1/32 point, or 31 cents per $1,000 in face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter-term Treasury securities ranged from unchanged to 1/16 point lower, 
the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that they've broken through (8% on the long bond yield) and held 
through it just worries people a little more," said Marshall Acuff, portfolio 
strategist at Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was a spillover from yesterday. A continually weak bond market is 
continuing to put pressure on the equity market," said Acuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The falling dollar also added pressure, since it is a sign that foreign 
investors are leaving U.S.-based assets. The dollar hit a fresh post-World War 
II low against the Japanese yen and a new two-year low against the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 It closed in New York at 96.83 yen, down from 97.13 late Monday. The dollar 
also was changing hands in New York at 1.495 German marks, up from 1.494. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers said the dollar is likely to continue downward until a change in 
fundamentals, such as an increase in U.S. interest rates or a sustained rally 
in stock and bond prices, attracts buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock and bond markets have been weak for several days amid signs that growth 
in the U.S. economy isn't slowing down enough to prevent resurgent inflation. 
Investors are waiting for the Federal Reserve Board to make its next move to 
raise interest rates, hoping that the central bank can once-and-for-all get a 
handle on rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds, which pay a 
fixed interest rate over months or years. The Fed's chief weapon against 
inflation -- raising rates -- can hurt stocks because rising rates make 
corporate borrowing more expensive and make shares less attractive compared to 
safer investments like certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Discher of Dain Bosworth said the dollar, bonds and stocks have been 
moving in a "chain reaction." The dollar weakness spills over and depresses 
bonds, which then have a negative influence on stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Economically sensitive stocks were among the weakest, reflecting concern about 
growth in the economy if interest rates continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 30 stocks that make up the Dow average, Alcoa fell 1 1/8 to 85 1/8 
and International Paper gave back 1 5/8 to 75 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mobil surged 3 to 83 1/4 on news the company plans to further restructure 
its operations. Dean Witter upgraded the stock to strong buy from accumulate. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest rate uncertainty pushed down big cyclical stocks, which rise and 
fall with the economy. Paper companies were down, such as Georgia Pacific, off 
2 1/4 to 73; along with chemical companies including Dow Chemical, down 1 5/8 
to 73 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexican telecommunications company Telefonos de Mexico tumbled 3 1/8 to 57 
3/8 in heavy trading after reporting disappointing nine-month earnings late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other Mexican stocks sank along with Telmex and the Mexico City Bolsa 
plummeted 55.24 points to 2,578.38.

THE MOMMY TRACK -- TAKE II; PARENTING: AT 71, LIZ CARPENTER THOUGHT SHE'D DONE 
IT ALL. BUT WHEN HER BROTHER DIED, SHE ANSWERED THE CHALLENGE OF RAISING KIDS 
-- AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SLAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the sort of plug a publisher could die for. 
</P>
<P>
 There into the midst of Liz Carpenter's lunchtime talk about her new book, 
"Unplanned Parenthood: The Confessions of a Seventysomething Surrogate Mother" 
(Random House), strolled Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 As a much-moved Carpenter choked back tears and the small audience at a 
downtown bookstore controlled its excitement, the First Lady effusively 
complimented the book and even read aloud her favorite passage, about the time 
Carpenter brought the wrong dog home from the vet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe," Clinton said. When Carpenter 
started to praise her back, Clinton cut her off gently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to brag on you and tell people all you've done and all you can do 
if you put your heart and mind in the right place," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 What Carpenter, a former press secretary to Lady Bird Johnson and longtime 
women's rights advocate, has done is take responsibility for the three teen-age 
children of her brother, Tom, who died of cancer in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, she thought she was simply fulfilling a duty. There was no one 
else who could care for the kids properly and besides, she said, she lived in 
the "best school district in Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 Then "I realized I was a figure in a national trend," she said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the bookstores, everybody who comes up tells me, 'I know somebody who is 
in your circumstances.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Told that a recent study showed that only 50% of American children live in 
traditional nuclear families, Carpenter quoted her nephew, Tommy, as 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mine is an orphan generation," he told her. "I have only two friends who live 
with both their natural parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter's book, a breezy 231 pages, recounts her efforts to overcome a 
generation gap the "size of the Grand Canyon" in providing love and discipline 
to Tom and his sisters, Liz and Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, it gives an engaging portrait of Carpenter, a feisty exemplar 
of Texas womanhood in a colorful line that extends to Gov. Ann Richards -- not 
surprisingly, among Carpenter's legion of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty close to our frontier pioneer mothers and grandmothers who were 
sturdy types," explained Carpenter, whose own sturdy frame was draped in 
unabashed red down to her socks and orthopedic sandals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They crossed the Red River with a rifle on their shoulder and a baby in the 
back. They didn't worry about their femininity, which bothers Phyllis 
Schlafly." 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth-generation Texan whose great-great-grandfather fought alongside Sam 
Houston, Carpenter went to Washington during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Married to another reporter, Les Carpenter, she covered the capital while 
raising two children -- Scott and Christy -- the latter conceived on the couch 
in their National Press Building office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a slow news day, as I recall," Carpenter said dryly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such wit and audacity got her through her subsequent days in the White House, 
where she talked back to LBJ, penned the words Johnson spoke after President 
John F. Kennedy's assassination and was the "greatest press secretary ever," 
said veteran reporter Helen Thomas. "It was more damn fun traveling with her 
and Lady Bird," agreed Nan Robertson, a longtime reporter for the New York 
Times. "The men (who covered President Johnson in that era of reportorial 
sexual segregation) all envied us terribly." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Johnson decided not to run again, the Republicans won the White House and 
Carpenter's husband died suddenly in 1974. A decade later, Carpenter survived 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 She took on the challenge of raising teen-agers a second time at a very ripe 
71, when she needed a nap every day and had "one bosom gone, one deaf ear, a 
swollen arthritic ankle and the weakest bladder in Travis County," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But if slightly the worse for wear, this Texan Auntie Mame also has more than 
the average surrogate mom's share of emotional and other resources. 
</P>
<P>
 How many other kids get hand-me-down clothes from Lady Bird Johnson's 
grandchildren, chicken and rice casseroles from her niece, and stayed with her 
daughter, Lynda Byrd Robb, wife of Sen. Chuck Robb (D-Va), on a summer jaunt to 
Washington (where they also ate pizza on White House china with Chelsea 
Clinton)? 
</P>
<P>
 When her eldest charge and namesake, Liz, was in danger of not graduating from 
high school, Carpenter called on two other old buddies for research on term 
papers -- feminist icon Betty Friedan and Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo). 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel guilty because everybody helps their kids. We just kind of did 
it in a Liz Carpenter way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most influential friends could not fend off the worst horrors of 
teen-agehood, like the time Mary, then 13, was stopped by the police driving 
Carpenter's car the wrong way on a one-way street in downtown Austin at 1:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirteen is the worst age going," Carpenter told the bookstore crowd. 
"They've got to break one rule a day and you're lucky if they break just one." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter also had to contend with the threat of drugs and, more benignly, 
teens' bottomless appetite, preference for bands with such names as "Smashed 
Pumpkins" and Nine-Inch Nails and music to match, and a talent for mess-making 
that led Carpenter to dub the kids' room the "Bay of Pigs." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's teen-agers, Carpenter sighed, "don't read Nancy Drew, play Michigan (a 
card game) or make fudge. They meet at the convenience store. They like to get 
there by crawling out the window late at night." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said her three teen-agers may have turned a corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz has a job in New York and is going to school part time, hoping to become a 
photographer or filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy has just been elected president of his senior class and plans to attend 
Carpenter's alma mater, the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Mary has passed that "sullen, silent time" when teen-age girls don't talk 
to anyone, Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a huge coming out party for the book at the LBJ Library in Austin last 
month, Mary stood up and greeted an audience of 1,000 like she was Queen 
Elizabeth, Carpenter bragged. 
</P>
<P>
 So while not an experience she would necessarily advocate for other 
septuagenarians, Carpenter said she was not sorry she had taken the kids -- and 
not just because she had gotten a book out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitten by a rabid dog at the age of 6, "I learned early in life that what 
looks like a disaster can lead to a widening world," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next to raising my own children, taking on these three young people may be 
one of the most important things I have ever done."

 Once a week, we foist the bambina off on a baby-sitter and sneak off to the 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 We go for the same reason all working slobs do -- to transcend the banality of 
the human condition, as a movie critic might put it. In lay terms, we go to 
avoid the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because what I do for a living often involves exploring the various ways in 
which life can really suck, I try hard to leave my feminist psychic baggage at 
the theater door. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, I didn't agree that "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" was a slap 
at working mothers. If you recall, the insane nanny tried to off the mommy who 
was busy building a greenhouse instead of nurturing her kids. The message I got 
from the film was not that bad things befall moms who hire baby-sitters, but 
that if your nursing child suddenly refuses your breast, make sure the 
baby-sitter is not lactating.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor was I offended by Glenn Close's bunny boiler in "Fatal Attraction." Never 
mind that violence is visited far more often upon women by their male lovers 
than the other way around, her character became a kind of shorthand for a 
particularly distasteful type of female pathology. Still, I chose to interpret 
the movie as an Old Testament-ish reminder of what happens to deceitful 
daddies. 
</P>
<P>
 Thelma and Louise, of course, were good strong symbols of female independence, 
but jeez, aren't there better ways of proving it than driving off a cliff? Ever 
hear of divorce, ladies? Or Prozac? 
</P>
<P>
 And even though Jamie Lee Curtis' wimpy, thickheaded wife in "True Lies" was 
ripped by some critics as a stinging, mean-spirited sexist stereotype, I 
thought she was funny, and I am one of the few people I know who loved the 
movie. (I have a weakness for Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. Sue me.) 
</P>
<P>
 So why did "The River Wild" completely tick me off? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I promise not to give anything away, but if you don't want to know the broad 
outlines of the movie's plot, you should probably skip to the comics. 
</P>
<P>
 Meryl Streep stars with David Strathairn. For the purposes of this discussion, 
I'll call them Meryl and David.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyhow, Meryl and David are married and live in Boston with their two kids. 
Meryl is an angry teacher and David is a humorless, workaholic architect. Meryl 
grew up somewhere with mountains and rivers with white water rapids. And when 
she was a teen-ager, she was a really talented river guide. For her son's 
birthday Meryl plans a rafting trip. She will leave her young daughter with her 
parents, and take her son and husband along in hopes of recapturing the freedom 
and confidence of her youth -- and maybe, if she is lucky -- her sense of 
life's possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But her husband is too busy to join them. He's always too busy to join them. 
He hasn't joined them for years, for decades, maybe even for centuries, because 
he is such a relentless, joyless drone. And for Meryl, who feels her marriage 
is crashing into the rocks already, his absence is the last straw. 
</P>
<P>
 But Daddy unexpectedly shows up. 
</P>
<P>
 I won't delve into their adventures on the river, which turn on a couple of 
bad-guy bandits attempting an unconventional escape. Suffice to say Meryl is 
not having a good year -- either at home or on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a happy ending in the Hollywood sense: A little blood is shed, a couple 
of people we don't especially care about get killed, and Meryl and David 
rediscover their passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, I'd think Meryl was a pretty good ol' role model here. She is strong 
and competent, nobody's fool. But the filmmakers couldn't leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
 No, in a perfectly obnoxious revelation about David's abandonment of the 
family, we learn that Meryl's perfectionism has driven him away. Her high 
standards have kept him at the office night after night. He doesn't want to 
disappoint her , see, so he spends all his time working. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, I can buy Meryl as a worn-down, lonely wife. I can buy her as a flawless 
river guide. I can even -- although this is stretching it -- buy that bad guys 
still only come in two sizes: lean (psychopathic charmer) and pudgy 
(doofus-with-a-conscience). 
</P>
<P>
 But I can only suspend disbelief for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 David's shortcomings as a father and husband are all Meryl's fault? And now 
that she sees the error of her ways, they'll live happily ever after? Like, she 
won't care if he loses the next 10 accounts, as long as he comes home for 
dinner? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
 If this guy represents life's possibilities, I'd be tempted to join Thelma and 
Louise.

DOES A KID NEED A DAD; ANGUISHED PARENTS LOOK TO THE EXPERTS FOR ANSWERS. BUT 
STUDIES SHOW ONLY THAT THE DEBATE WILL CONTINUE TO RAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ilona Sherman was 43 and divorced when she set about having a child on her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marriage did not answer my needs. But I wanted to have a child. I was getting 
older. I wasn't going to wait to meet someone to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 She opted for artificial insemination and gave birth to a son, Adam Robert, 16 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a father is very important, and I would like to get married at some 
point. But I'm a big believer that if you give a child enough attention and 
love, that's what is important," says Sherman, who owns a public relations firm 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Biller, however, takes issue with mom-alone types like Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of (women) who say that fathers are the disposable parent," 
says Biller, a psychologist and well-known researcher on fatherhood at the 
University of Rhode Island. "They say, 'Just give us enough money and we'll put 
the child in a good school.' I don't agree with that. I think you are putting 
kids at risk without a regular, quality, consistent relationship with a man." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he notes, with a hint of resignation: "Despite mounting evidence for the 
importance of the father-child connection, many people still believe that Dad 
just provides a little extra and that kids get what they really need from Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if you look at childbirth in 1994 in the United States, you might 
conclude that, after the sperm, the presence of a father is optional. 
</P>
<P>
 Births to unwed mothers have jumped a shocking 70% since 1982, according to 
the 1993 census, with 27% of children under 18 living with a single parent who 
had never married. And when divorce or death is figured in, about 55% of 
children will spend some portion of their lives in a single-parent household, 
almost always headed by the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, fatherlessness is a social trend to be reckoned with, experts note, 
especially with so many public policy issues -- from welfare reform to child 
custody judgments -- being hashed out with a closer look at what the father 
contributes to the nuclear family. 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding Dan Quayle's point of view, society needs to know: Does a kid 
need a dad? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Single, divorced or widowed mothers tend to cling to the view that a child's 
overall environment matters more than the presence of a father -- and research 
backs them up, to some extent. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Gale was a toddler when her parents divorced, and her father faded out 
of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 So at age 42 and single, she thought long and hard about her desire to raise a 
child on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is confident about her decision. She did fine without a father, Gale 
reasoned, so would her daughter, Gabriella, who was adopted at birth in June, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Gale, who has her own entertainment company in Los Angeles, is irritated by 
the frequent theme of politicians who point to single-parent families -- which 
are headed by mothers 86% of the time -- as the root of many social problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have them come to my house," she scoffs. "I don't think my child will lack 
for anything -- emotionally or otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Other mothers point out that even with the potential drawbacks, life without 
father is sometimes better than with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Owens walked out of her home 22 years ago with her toddler, a suitcase 
and $32 in her pocket. She wasn't concerned about leaving her baby's father 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought her being with me and not with a father was more emotionally 
healthy than being in a two-parent household where there was discontent and a 
lack of respect," says Owens, a Los Angeles talent agent. "But I had a really 
great support system. My point of view is that a child will be well-adjusted if 
they have a good environment. And a good environment doesn't have to be a 
mother and father." 
</P>
<P>
 Zulma Garcia, 16, tried living with the father of her baby for about a year 
after the child's birth. After they broke up, he stopped seeing the child, who 
is almost 2 years old. And Garcia is relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about her not having a father," says Garcia, who lives in Los 
Angeles. "At this point, I think it's best to let it go because of the kind of 
person he is. I think I'm doing the best for her with him not being around. 
What's the use of having a father and a mother in the house if they don't get 
along and there is always mental and verbal abuse? That doesn't mean this child 
will grow up very healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Research is not clear on whether a stable, secure, loving environment can 
fully compensate for the lack of a father. But some recent studies indicate 
that if a mother has other, supportive adults to lean on, the child fares well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beneficial for children to live with two adults, but they don't 
necessarily have to be two parents and they don't necessarily have to be people 
of the opposite sex," says Helen Wintrob, an assistant professor of psychiatry 
at the State University of New York, who has studied father absence. She is a 
single mother of an adopted child. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies of families headed by homosexual couples, moreover, have found few 
negative effects on the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence of adverse effects on kids raised by two women," says 
Ross Parke, director of the Center for Family Studies at the University of 
California, Riverside. "That raises the issue that constantly occurs in this 
field: Is it the effects of the father per se or the effects of having an 
additional person around to be supportive? There is some evidence that fathers 
are important. But there is still a question of what unique roles they play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because fathers have long been viewed solely as breadwinners, little research 
has been done to pinpoint their emotional, spiritual, moral and intellectual 
contributions to their children. But that doesn't mean that fathers don't 
greatly influence a child's development, say a growing legion of social 
scientists studying fatherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Research has shown that while a child may not become a felon or societal 
outcast simply because he or she is fatherless, there is a distinct "two-parent 
advantage," says Biller, the University of Rhode Island psychologist.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, children with fathers tend to get along better with their peers 
and display more social confidence. They face new situations better, adapt to 
change more easily, and score higher on intelligence and aptitude tests. They 
are typically more independent and responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man and woman raising a child together will present a child with a broad 
range of experiences," Biller says. "They treat children differently, and by 
doing so, provide them with different ways of approaching life." 
</P>
<P>
 The fatherless child lacks something in a purely emotional sense, too, argues 
Dr. Martin Greenberg, a San Diego psychiatrist and the author of several books 
on fatherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an absence of images, thoughts and stories related to fathers," he 
says. "There is an absence of a role model, but worse than that is the absence 
of a spiritual structure; an image based on feelings and memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Since mother-only families often translate to economic hardship, too many 
Americans think of fatherlessness only in terms of the dollars lost, Greenberg 
says. But you can't put a price on a father. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still very little recognition of the importance of a father," he 
says. "There is a tendency to see the father as the bringer of money. There is 
not a sense of how a father provides spiritual meaning and values." 
</P>
<P>
 Fathers who participate fully in child-rearing enrich their children's lives 
immeasurably, Biller says. Independence, assertiveness, attitudes about 
femininity and masculinity, and choice of occupation are all areas in which 
fathers tend to be more influential, studies show. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Fatherless children) are less likely to actualize their potential," he says. 
"They are more likely to succumb to peer pressure and less likely to take on 
responsibility. But they may not have severe problems; some studies have not 
found big differences. The problem in these studies, very often, is that you 
are not defining what you mean." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Biller and others point out, studies of fatherless children may 
not consider whether the child has one or more "father figures" or supportive 
adults in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, many people who were deprived of their fathers grow up to be 
normal, healthy adults who lead normal, healthy lives and are more than 
adequate husbands and wives, mothers and fathers," notes Biller in his book 
"The Father Factor: What You Need to Know to Make a Difference" (Pocket Books, 
1994). "They may have benefited from having the kind of mother who could cope 
with the challenges of single parenthood. Or they may have had older brothers, 
uncles, stepfathers, or male teachers who filled in the gaps in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the disastrous results predicted for children who grow up without 
fathers are based on studies of the most extreme cases of father absence, abuse 
or neglect." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the strong feelings on both sides, the bulk of the research provides 
no clear answer on whether a child needs a father. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the research on fatherlessness has focused on children whose parents 
divorced or whose fathers died, showing that the circumstances surrounding 
fatherlessness matter greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the question, "Will a child suffer from not having a father?" is so 
very difficult to resolve, Parke says. 
</P>
<P>
 "People aren't sure if the effects on a child are from the lack of a father or 
the conditions surrounding it. It's tricky." 
</P>
<P>
 What seems to matter is economic security, the presence of an extended family, 
the security of a neighborhood, the child's gender and whether the mother has 
ever been married. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, children who lose contact with their fathers after a divorce tend 
to show some problems depending on their age and gender. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fair bit of consistent evidence on this," Parke says. "One is that 
girls seem to do better than boys. After a couple years, girls, particularly 
younger girls, seem to settle down and do fairly well compared to non-divorce 
families. The boys, however, do not seem to fare as well. There is more tension 
between the mothers and boys. Mothers seem less effective at controlling the 
boy. That tends to translate into not doing as well in school, not getting 
along with peers." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a classic study found that fatherless boys often develop "hyper 
masculinity" to compensate for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it has to do with the fact that a male child who didn't have the 
advantage of having a father would tend to identify with the mother and her 
feminine characteristics," says the study's author, Dr. Allan Barclay of the 
University of Missouri, St. Louis. "In order to adjust to the masculine role, 
they had to adopt a more high-powered masculinity." 
</P>
<P>
 Other research has revealed that problems for girls may occur later in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although a lot of girls who grow up fatherless seem to develop without 
problems, so many of them run into difficulties later in life because they now 
are having to deal more with men," Biller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Research on children born to unwed mothers paints another, generalized picture 
of children handicapped to some degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids generally don't do very well," Parke says. "For boys, there tends 
to be behavioral problems. But again, it's not clear if that is just 
father-absence. It could be the mothers' lack of education or poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line in all of the research, Biller says, is that "we have to 
preface things in individual differences. There are always exceptions. To make 
a statement that every child will be affected in a particular way is 
impossible. We can only talk about probabilities."

THE FAMILY FILE: '90S FAMILY; LINKING GRANDPARENTS AND GRANDCHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Compiled from Times staff and news services. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Arthur Kornhaber calls it the "vital connection," the special link between 
grandparent and grandchild. But in a world where grandparents and grandchildren 
may live miles and miles apart -- and where grandparents may be living lives as 
full and as demanding as their adult children -- maintaining that tie is 
sometimes complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 As founder of the Foundation for Grandparenting (Box 326, Cohasset, Mass. 
02025), Kornhaber runs multi-generational summer camps that promote the 
relationship between grandchildren and grandparents. Campers, he notes, range 
in age from 3 to 90. 
</P>
<P>
 Kornhaber, a psychiatrist, is also the author of a new book on the subject, 
"Grandparent Power!" (Crown). With 60 million grandparents in this country, the 
grandparent's role in the family is evolving, Kornhaber points out. 
Grandparents live longer, more energetic lives, and often are better educated 
and more financially independent than in past generations. Divorce, day care 
and geographical separation also are changing the rules of grandparenting, he 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Find your grandparenthood among all your diverse identities," Kornhaber 
counsels. "Try to give it priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "That, after all, is what a long life is for." Setting the Stage for Better 
Communities 
</P>
<P>
 The Children's Bureau of Southern California's Inglewood office has received a 
$150,000 grant from the James Irvine Foundation to assist with its "Build 
Caring Communities" project. 
</P>
<P>
 This program focuses on encouraging parents to help other parents living in 
the same community -- in this case, to establish a Family and Community 
Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will also promote development of Children's Bureau family support 
and child abuse prevention strategies. Giving Preschoolers a Healthy Outlook 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida-based John S. and James L. Knight Foundation will invest $1.7 
million over the next two years to raise immunization levels among preschool 
children in 25 cities across the country -- among them, Long Beach and San 
Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 80% of all vaccinations are required by a child's second birthday, 
the Knight Foundation points out that national statistics show that between 40% 
and 60% of 2-year-olds have not received such vaccinations, making them 
vulnerable to such preventable diseases as measles, mumps and whooping cough. 
</P>
<P>
 This immunization project will target specific communities. In San Jose, for 
example, a poster in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and Cambodian will feature 
pictures of babies from one of the city's neighborhoods. Exploring the World of 
Adoption 
</P>
<P>
 Vista Del Mar Child and Family Services in West Los Angeles is offering a 
two-part Orientation to Adoption for families. The orientation will present an 
overview of adoption, covering such issues as the emotional impact, various 
avenues of adoption (open, international, agency and collaborative), and 
consent and relinquishment. The cost is $75 for couples, $45 for singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Vista Del Mar also offers pre- and post-adoption workshops. For more 
information, call Joan Apt, (310) 836-1222, Ext. 280.

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; FRIENDS FOREVER -- OR UNTIL THE FIRST BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children change friendships -- for better, for worse, sometimes permanently, 
sometimes just for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, this 35-year-old married woman from Los Angeles liked to go 
out for weekend brunch with her lifelong friend. "We'd talk about families, 
men, friends, what we did. We'd spend four hours drinking coffee and talk. 
You'd end up very wired and feeling like someone's listened to you," she 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the scene is like this: "I get to her house and sit and wait while she 
gets the baby ready for an hour. Then we go out. We talk about the baby for a 
half-hour. Then she wanders out to the car or bathroom to change the baby again 
for another half-hour. I'm alone waiting for her in some fashion for an hour 
and a half. The rest is only partly normal talk and commuting." 
</P>
<P>
 Smart and savvy professionals, both women knew something like this might 
happen. "She asked me right before she gave birth, 'If I get too boring about 
my child, tell me and I'll try to be better.' How can you tell someone who has 
this precious, precious baby that she should chill out?" 
</P>
<P>
 She's hoping against all odds that her friend will eventually bore herself, 
find other things to talk about, and return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 The poignant reality is that her friend's life has been irreversibly turned 
inside out, and "normal" is an idea whose time has vanished. She probably 
already knows she's boring. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Los Angeles woman, a 46-year-old mother of three young children, said 
she suddenly realized how boring she had become to childless women during a 
recent needlepoint class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five of us were sitting at a table. We spent the entire evening talking about 
kids. 'My son did this.' 'My daughter did that.' 'This one is driving me 
crazy.' Yadda yadda yadda." 
</P>
<P>
 After two hours, she said she noticed one woman hadn't said anything. She 
found out the woman had no children. "I said to myself, 'If I were at this 
table without children I would have vomited.' It was awful." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother said she's already lost several friends due to parenthood. "If you 
are a halfway-involved parent, you become literally consumed with children's 
stuff and have very little time for women's stuff," she said. "Two of my 
dearest friends are now only acquaintances. It's very sad. I can't begin to 
tell you how sad it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Because it took her so long to start a family, she is also loath to leave her 
children with a sitter to go out with other adults. Now she and her husband 
gravitate to friends who either have children or who like to be with children. 
</P>
<P>
 According to social anthropologist Sheila Kitzinger, author of "The Year After 
Childbirth" (MacMillan, 1994), childless women have difficulty comprehending 
why new mothers can't organize themselves better. "They do not understand how 
restricted life can become and the superhuman feats of organization required to 
get out of the house and be on time." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as babies drive a wedge between some friends, they also bring some 
people together. Mothers make new, often surprising friendships, finding common 
ground with women they never thought they would -- younger women, older women, 
women from various backgrounds with different and enlightening ideas on 
mothering.  
</P>
<P>
 It's always possible for old friends to reconnect when the children are older. 
At first, what friends need to understand, Kitzinger said, is that "your 
friendship is now in a completely different context and needs some working at 
if you think it's worth maintaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the woman without children feels awkward about broaching the problem 
with her friend. Needs are emotions usually talked about only with lovers, not 
women friends. She wishes there were some rules here on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 If somehow she could send her friend a message, wrapped perhaps in a diaper 
like a fortune cookie, it would say, "Can we set an egg timer and talk about 
your baby 40 minutes and life in general for another 40? I need you too."

'90S FAMILY; SEEDS OF SHAME AND SCANDAL; EVERY FAMILY HAS SECRETS -- BOTH GOOD 
AND BAD. AND TO UNDERSTAND YOUR HISTORY, YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT BOTH.

 Mary Ann Ruelas had a great-grandfather who was part of a group that waged a 
violent attack on the women and children of a group of Apaches in Tucson in 
1871. The issues were complicated and the rules of the game in the Wild West 
were ragged at best. But Ruelas was never told about the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in reviewing court documents from the period that Ruelas, assistant 
director of programs for the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles, 
discovered the unmentioned truth. "It never came down in oral tradition through 
the family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's notable is that the situation must have been incredibly fascinating at 
the time," said Ruelas, adding that the slaughter, known as the Camp Grant 
Massacre to historians, almost caused President Ulysses S. Grant to declare 
martial law in the state. But Ruelas and her parents knew nothing of her 
great-grandfather's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists and historians say that many families contend with some issue 
that they either embellish over the years or consistently work to cover up or 
ignore. For some, there's a real pirate in their past; for others, it might be 
an adolescent pregnancy, a murder or a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The most exciting stories may elevate the scoundrel to heroic proportions 
generations later and be told proudly to children or new acquaintances. But the 
distasteful scenario that could lower the family's social standing or public 
image is most often kept mum, said Chaytor Mason of Pomona, a retired USC 
professor of psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably everyone would like to have a spotless family tree. So we either 
ignore those stories, or modify them, or glamorize them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many families, facing their titillating past may require a level of 
honesty and self-esteem that can be hard to come by, said Lili Endlich, a 
Sherman Oaks marriage and family therapist. "People want everyone else to think 
they're perfect and wonderful. We compare our insecure insides to other 
people's competent and well-functioning outsides," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until Endlich's mother's death that she learned that her grandmother 
had sold cocaine in St. Petersburg, Fla., after her grandfather left to fight 
in World War I. "People did all kinds of things in war and desperate 
circumstances, but in quieter times, no one talks about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those at greatest risk for suffering from a family scandal are people whose 
sense of self is closely related to the family name or to their parents, said 
Barry Slone, a clinical psychologist and marriage, family and child therapist 
in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sense of self is tied to our parents and to the family," Slone said. "We 
identify with the other person, they're a piece of us, and we internalize the 
situation. People wonder, 'If this could happen to someone this close to me, 
perhaps there's something wrong with me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks woman who asked that her name not be used attended her birth 
mother's funeral not long ago and felt tangible tension among friends and 
relatives as they discussed the time 40 years ago when "Louise had to go away 
to Boston." Even such a long time later, the family referred to the 
then-controversial unwed pregnancy as "the situation," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But times change, and what was a scandal at one time may be more -- or 
evenless -- understandable generations later. In Ruelas' case, people of this 
decade could in fact judge her great-grandfather's actions more harshly than 
would his 19th-Century peers, given the violence of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's shameful in one period may be honorable in another," Mason said. "I 
can foresee a time when we'll be burying photos of grandpa just because he had 
a cigarette hanging from his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Even what you hear or remember cannot be accepted as is. Mason had a patient 
who believed that she had witnessed her grandmother killing someone in Glendale 
years ago. Mason researched the issue and eventually discovered that there was 
a movie out at the time with such a plot, and the female star looked a lot like 
the woman's grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people struggle with the memory of having their own personal scandals 
swept under the rug, forcing them to deny their pain or avoid discussing what 
they were facing with their family and friends. Laura, the daughter of a 
prominent Southern California attorney, said she attempted suicide at 12 and 
later became pregnant. Her parents ignored the situation, then admitted her to 
a psychiatric facility and continued to refuse to allow her to discuss the 
issues, even years later, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their attitude changed my whole life. I sabotaged all my relationships, found 
it hard to make friendships, was always afraid that if I didn't act right, 
someone would put me back in the funny farm," Laura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring scandals doesn't necessarily ease the tension for most families, 
Slone said. Typically, it reduces communication on many levels among family 
members, because individuals have to avoid a host of topics to ensure they 
won't tread on dangerous turf. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be particularly tough is accidentally stumbling upon a family scandal 
that had long been hidden. "There's a sense of deception, of feeling left out, 
of not having been equipped with all the armament to face life," Mason said. 
And for most people, once a family scandal is discovered, they want to know 
more, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ruelas, learning about family scandals is a natural way to tackle history 
and develop a better understanding of one's personal past. "I know some people 
carry a lot of guilt from the past," she said. "I think we have to put these 
things in perspective."

TIPS ON DIGGING DEEPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To those tempted to dig into their family past to understand scandals that may 
have been brushed off or ignored over time, psychologists offer these 
suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Figure out why you want to know. Barry Slone suggests starting the process 
by identifying your specific goals and understanding the motivation to learn 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prepare for a challenge. Digging for scandal information is fraught with 
conflict, so it is important to understand why the relative who may know 
something is holding back, Slone said. "Say something like, 'Please help me to 
understand what you perceive might be the disadvantages of my learning about 
this situation,' " he suggested. Such an approach may open up discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Try to find a cohort to join you. Slone suggests finding an ally in the 
family who can appreciate your interest and help communicate it to relatives. 
Chaytor Mason said curious family members can easily be labeled as dirt 
diggers. "It's a common defensive tactic by people who feel guilty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tell your children what you can. Mason advises parents to try to be frank 
with their children and to give them all the information they need so they can 
understand and embrace their personal family history. In some cases, the 
information will provide valuable genetic clues to diseases and other 
propensities; in other cases, it's just valuable to know you know, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seek records. For those who face a flat-out roadblock, Mason recommends 
genealogical research or scouring old newspapers from the era and town for 
potential clues. BARBARA BRONSON GRAY

R S V P; A BIG HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BRIDGET BYRNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Do you know this one?" jazz vocalist Bobby McFerrin teased the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic as he riffed the players and audience into a rendition of "Happy 
Birthday" at the conclusion of the orchestra's 75th birthday concert. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a "have your cake and eat it too" night at the Los Angeles Music Center 
as, following the rousing performance led by past and present music directors 
Zubin Mehta and Esa-Pekka Salonen, the onstage ceremonies concluded with the 
cutting of a giant cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a spillover crowd of more than 750 flowed into the Grand Hall of the 
Founders' Circle and the loge level foyer of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for 
a celebratory black-tie dinner that raised more than $250,000 for the 
Musicians' Pension Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 David Jones had transformed the dining areas into a parterre , the tables 
decorated with mini citrus trees in white crates, the balcony railings 
festooned with fruit-laden garlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Stack ably stepped in to emcee the evening after Gregory Peck dropped 
out because he had hurt his leg and first substitute Michael York was called 
back to Prague for retakes on a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Stack, a fifth-generation Angeleno who admitted to being six months older than 
the orchestra, regaled the audience and his table companions (his wife 
Rosemarie, Nancy Daly and Mayor Richard Riordan, and Founders' Board of 
Directors President Curtis Tamkin and his wife, Priscilla) with stories about 
the early musical life of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Stack's great-grandfather owned an opera house in Downtown Los Angeles. By 
literally cutting off at the pass and offering generous hospitality to a 
European opera company traveling up from Mexico, this cultural pioneer managed 
to put one over on the then more sophisticated San Francisco by staging the 
American premiere of Puccini's "La Boheme" in 1897.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, many of the miners and homesteaders who came to that performance 
thought they were going to see 'The Bohemian Girl,' " Stack said, "but it is 
reported that after they paid their 25 cents and had not seen any dancing 
girls, they nevertheless exclaimed 'Well, we're not sure what opera is all 
about, but those people sure could sing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the next table, record executive Joe Smith teased Dodgers' owner Peter 
O'Malley. Would his stadium be available to rent for rock concerts next spring? 
O'Malley answered it would be busy with baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Mehta was not able to attend the dinner, having taken a red-eye flight to 
conduct the Israel Orchestra today in celebration of the Jordan-Israel peace 
treaty signing.  
</P>
<P>
 Salonen and his wife, Jane, were among the diners, as were Shinji and Ryuko 
Sakai, Joan and John Hotchkis, Felisa Vanoff, Suzanne Marx and Judi and Gordon 
Davidson.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; EASING JAIL JITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Orange and the county of Orange were smart to talk rather than 
fight over the proposed expansion of the Theo Lacy Branch Jail. Suing each 
other would have done no one any good. 
</P>
<P>
 The county long has faced jail overcrowding problems: Sixteen years ago a 
federal judge ordered the county to improve conditions behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Jails designed for 3,200 inmates hold nearly 5,000. As a partial solution, 
county officials have proposed increasing the number of beds in the Lacy jail, 
situated in Orange, from 1,326. One plan called for Lacy to have 4,480 beds in 
an emergency, which would be too many. 
</P>
<P>
 After fierce objections from Orange, its city manager and County Supervisor 
William G. Steiner began discussing a more reasonable number. Both said they 
were willing to compromise to settle the issue out of court. That was sensible; 
spending money on a court fight would be foolish and would delay a jail 
expansion at a time of immediate need. 
</P>
<P>
 To make space for those accused of serious crimes, the sheriff has been forced 
to let those charged with lesser offenses leave jail early. That means more 
hardened criminals in Lacy. Packing tougher criminals tightly together 
increases the chances for violence among inmates, and one day earlier this 
month there were two separate fights in Lacy between Latino and African 
American inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The county must move quickly to add more beds to existing jails. The 
willingness of the city of Orange to help out is welcome.

ORANGE COUNTY PLATFORM; PARTY LABELS DAMAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMA BRANDEL GIBBS, the former mayor of Huntington Beach and Seal Beach, 
comments on the politicizing of nonpartisan local election races: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though I have been a registered Republican for over 30 years, I am 
dismayed to see a nonpartisan office, such as the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors, being politicized by the Republican Party. Historically, local, 
district and county offices have been regarded as independent of partisan 
politics in Orange County. Now I see lines are being drawn in the 2nd district 
supervisorial race. Candidates who resort to labeling by party affiliation are 
doing a disservice to the role and the philosophy of county government. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the strengths of a nonpartisan office is that the voter can focus on 
the candidate who is best prepared or qualified to address the issues facing 
county government. The problems of Orange County require a supervisor who is 
not handicapped by a party label. On the contrary, to solve the problems of 
Orange County he/she must have the freedom and capabilities of working with the 
political machinery of the state and federal levels. There is wisdom and 
strength in the concept of nonpartisan offices, and those who constantly raise 
the banner of party labels will only succeed in weakening the effectiveness of 
the very critical position of county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 California's pioneer of political reform, Hiram Johnson, a Republican, and 
other leaders of both parties saw the wisdom in keeping partisan politics out 
of local races. The record of accomplishments of each of the candidates should 
gauge their worthiness to hold local office, not their political affiliation. 
This is true because local public officeholders are closer to the people, they 
are more accessible and their records can be more easily examined. Political 
party affiliation at the state and national level make more sense for 
accountability, but even their reliance on them is a crutch to allow one to 
vote by membership in a party as opposed to qualifications and record as a 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blind partisanship" is exactly why many Democrats and Republicans alike are 
dropping out as voters, or following Ross Perot's leadership stressing common 
sense and grass-roots, people-oriented issues, rather than special-interest 
issues associated with political parties. Services to people do not require 
"partisan allegiance" and most local elected officials deal with these type of 
issues. The law wisely does not permit candidates for local elective office to 
use their party affiliation on the official ballot or on their official 
candidate's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 We should be able to decide the election on the qualification of the person 
rather than the label of the party. If we must promote polarization, let us do 
it on ability rather than affiliation.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: FIRE SURVIVOR IS THANKFUL BUT NOT IN A MOOD TO CELEBRATE 
ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By POLLY SLOAN, Polly Sloan now lives in Monarch Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The anniversary of the Laguna Beach firestorm is here. Celebrations are 
planned by the city of Laguna Beach, and by several organizations to go on for 
days, beginning on the actual date, October 27. I am not in a celebrating mood, 
except for the fact that my husband and I are grateful that we did survive. So 
did our neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But our lives didn't. Our homes and everything in them are gone, and I still 
feel a sadness. I believe that we were semiconscious the first few months, and 
now as I try to remember, it is all a fog: the blue-gray smoke, throwing things 
into a suitcase, grabbing photos of grand parents and children off the wall, 
feeling my chest and my throat tighten as we found it difficult to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 It took three days before we knew our house was gone, a heap of ashes. The 
firemen said it was too hot up there to let us through. So we stood on Main 
Beach, two days after the fire and stared up through binoculars lent by a 
friend. I refused to believe what my husband said he saw. I think they call it 
denial. The next day, standing in front of the place I had lived for 22 years, 
all I could think of was what a beautiful view. What a pity that house, with 
mementos from 48 years of marriage, was nothing now but a chimney etched 
against the still blackened sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends called and took us in. If it were not for them, helping agencies and 
the kindness of perfect strangers, I am sure I would have been in a deep 
depression. Not for the loss of belongings, but the irreplaceable nostalgic 
things that now have to live only in my memory. 
</P>
<P>
 I do still grieve for the movies of our four sons growing up, and pictures of 
special holidays when our family was all together. I still look in the closet 
for the red wool suit my husband bought me in Vienna many years ago. It is no 
longer there. I miss the first watercolor and India ink drawing of a Victorian 
house my artist-son created in the 11th grade and proudly presented to us. I 
feel sad that the china I wanted to give to a granddaughter did not survive. 
Those are all "just things" -- material possessions, but they are so much more. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a lesson in humility to have to go to the Presbyterian church and look 
for shoes to wear and a sweater to keep out the cold. Friends and local 
merchants gave me things to wear and soon I had an adequate but eclectic 
wardrobe. We lived in a rented house for nine months, a "Laguna charmer," and I 
remember how amazed I was that I couldn't find the fly swatter or a Band-Aid or 
my cookie sheet because they just weren't there. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, it seems we thought of something else we lost and thought we 
couldn't live without. But we did. And we waited and waited to get a permit. 
Because we were in Mystic Hills, where a "possible ancient landslide" might 
have taken place, it has taken many months to ascertain if there would be a 
hazard in rebuilding on many of the lots, ours included. When nine months had 
passed with nothing resolved, we decided we had to get on with our lives. So we 
took our money from the insurance and bought a house. 
</P>
<P>
 I like it here in my new abode. But periodically I get guilt feelings that I 
am not going through the aches and pains that go with building a house, as so 
many of my neighbors are. We had the plans for our house that my architect son 
had completed and city staff had approved, and I was excited about seeing it 
become a reality. But really, how long can you wait? 
</P>
<P>
 A year has passed and so much has changed. I was angry for weeks wondering why 
our life had to be disrupted in our so-called "golden years." Angry too because 
I had lost every article, every story I had ever written, magazines and 
newspaper clippings, with poems and articles I had published. There had been 
stress-filled days of insurance adjusters, visits to agencies to replace 
automobile pink slips and birth certificates, and to banks to replace checks. I 
was angry because we were waking up at daybreak before we had time to shop for 
curtains or blinds and the sun came streaming in. 
</P>
<P>
 I know now that was nothing to be angry about. It was an all-inclusive anger 
that included everything, and sometimes innocent bystanders like my husband. It 
took awhile to figure that all out. 
</P>
<P>
 One year later and we are planting fruit trees. My husband is playing his 
violin a lot (it was the first thing he rescued). I am unpacking boxes and 
hanging pictures. We both value whatever time we will have together now much 
more than before. We are more loving and more tolerant. We are more 
appreciative of our children and we savor every minute we have with our 
grandchildren. One thing for sure. We found out you can survive without a fly 
swatter, a cookie sheet or even Band-Aids.

DOES A KID NEED A DAD ; NETWORK GIVES FATHERS CHANCE TO SHARE THEIR OWN SPECIAL 
NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Put a bunch of guys in a room on a balmy weekend when USC is beating up on a 
hapless Cal team and chances are good that talk will turn to sports. 
</P>
<P>
 But touchdowns were not on the agenda Saturday when a dozen men gathered in a 
Costa Mesa hotel suite. Instead, conversation turned on the hard realities of 
colostomies, Down's syndrome, spinal meningitis and pediatric AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The men took turns telling how the birth of a special-needs child is reshaping 
their relationships with spouses, offspring and friends. Some spoke of anger, 
others of doubt, many of sadness. Nearly all quietly conveyed the never-ending 
anguish that's part of being a parent to a child with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the storytelling served a purpose.  
</P>
<P>
 "These guys weren't banging drums or eating quiche," said James May, national 
project director of the Seattle-based National Fathers' Network. "They were 
telling honest stories of how a child has affected them as a husband, a father 
and an individual. And there's a power in that telling." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from seven support groups around the state were in town to 
consider creating a statewide umbrella organization. And the absence of women 
during the two-day meeting wasn't accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 "The power of a father's group is that men have a chance in a safe setting to 
talk about these powerful emotions," said May, who helped run the weekend 
meeting sponsored by the Coalition of Parents, Educators, Deaf, Blind,a 
private, El Toro-based organization.  
</P>
<P>
 "Women always wonder what we talk about at these meetings," acknowledged one 
father. "They think we talk about sports and work. Or they think we're talking 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no tales told out of school. These fathers focused on the 
uphill battle to form an organization that can help fathers navigate the 
maelstrom of emotions unleashed by the birth of a special-needs child. 
</P>
<P>
 They agreed to create a loose-knit umbrella organization that will help new 
groups get off the ground. The fledgling coalition also intends to lobby in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The diverse group included black, white, Latino and Asian American men -- and 
a representative from a newly formed Los Angeles support group called Programa 
Padres Positivos that will serve fathers whose children are HIV positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a sexist program," said Bil Aulenbach, a Dana Point resident and 
the father of a 29-year-old special-needs daughter. "What we're saying is that 
if we can get more fathers actively involved in parenting (through men-only 
meetings), it reduces the chance of other families being put at risk (of 
domestic violence)." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Aulenbach said, fathers must come to grips with the typical 
American male's de facto decision to turn care-giving chores over to Mom. Even 
absent a special-needs child, Aulenbach said, American men typically cede the 
majority of child-rearing duties to their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the child has special needs, the absence of male involvement can be 
amplified, Aulenbach said. Agencies and programs typically are dominated by 
women. And, because American fathers typically aren't as involved as their 
wives, the system sometimes seems to forget that dads exist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine resident Hogan Hillingonce took his 5-year-old special-needs son to a 
doctor for treatment of a fever. He remembers the prescription: "Tell the boy's 
mother to give him two aspirin and plenty of fluids -- as if I couldn't have 
done it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Danzlof Poway told of a neonatal intensive care nurse who wondered aloud 
why he was interested in learning how to attach a 19-inch colostomy bag to his 
18-inch baby. "Men," the nurse observed, "usually just don't get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Another dad told of school administrators who spoke of him in the third person 
during a meeting -- even though he was sitting in the same room. "Why don't you 
ask him," the dad said. "He's sitting right here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ill-equipped to handle the new challenges -- and often left out of the loop by 
professionals -- "the next thing we know," Aulenbach said, "we're saying 'I'll 
avoid this whole issue and let (the wife) be the child protector.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't an indictment of women," May said. "It is a statement of belief 
that men don't play a significant role in most American families." 
</P>
<P>
 May, who said there are about 70 such men's support groups nationwide, 
maintains that men want to take an active role in parenting -- but that most 
must first harness the powerful emotions sparked by the birth of a 
special-needs child.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're dealing with the death of the dream of the perfect child," May said. 
"There's this tremendous range of emotions, including rage, sadness, loneliness 
and fear." 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the tremendous letdown," Danzl said of the days after doctors 
diagnosed a rare colon disorder in his son. "I wanted to talk about the 
feelings I had . . . but I didn't know where to turn. We were constantly riding 
on this roller coaster . . . (but) I didn't know who to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 How much healthier it would be if delivery-room doctors and nurses were 
steering anguished fathers to dads who've already come to grips with the 
powerful emotions and doubts, said Santa Ana resident Jeff Braun, whose child 
has Down's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Just recently, doctors and nurses at some Orange County hospitals began 
steering new fathers of special needs children to The Fathers Network of Orange 
County. The group's next meeting will be at 8:30 a.m. on Nov. 5 at the 
Providence Speech and Hearing Center in Orange. Call 714-651-9839 for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call and ask for five minutes on the phone," Braun said. "An hour or 
more later, you finally hang up. Some of them take a while to get to a meeting, 
but once they start coming, most attend religiously." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of support didn't exist when Aulenbach's daughter, Heidi, was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Aulenbach had feared the worst after his wife, Anne, contracted rubella during 
the pregnancy. When Heidi was born, she "was overcooked, undernourished. . .she 
had red dots all over her, and she had a fully developed cataract in her right 
eye," said Aulenbach, then a 33-year-old Episcopal priest at a small parish on 
Maui. 
</P>
<P>
 Honoring their pledge to "do our best for this child," the Aulenbachs planned 
a move to Santa Ana, where Heidi could enroll at a school known for its 
programs for the hearing-impaired. But a bishop answered his request for a 
mainland transfer by wishing him well in the secular world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember thinking 'What the hell have I done?' " Aulenbach said about his 
dismissal. But the family remained committed to finding help for Heidi and 
packed up and left. "Here I was walking the streets of Los Angeles unemployed; 
I'd just bought a new house, and I had three kids." 
</P>
<P>
 So many new fathers gaze at their sons and dream of raising the next Joe 
Montana, Aulenbach said, that "when your baby is born with a half of a brain, 
Down's syndrome or is deaf and blind, it can adversely affect your dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 But dreams can be revived once fathers master innovative ways to gain 
gratification from kids who'll never learn to challenge a left-handed pitcher 
or strap on a pair of in-line skates.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel real honored now to have this kid," Danzl said. "I was really 
afraid of dealing with this before, but dads can learn so much from these 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Aulenbach says father's support groups play a key role in helping dads 
reconfigure their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dads need to hear from (those of) us who've moved through it all, who've come 
out the better for it." Aulenbach said. "We need to tell them that it's OK, 
that you can do neat things with these kids, things that will change your life 
and make you a better person." 
</P>
<P>
 Aulenbach often talks about his daughter, who is profoundly deaf and blind. 
"Heidi's still got issues to deal with; it isn't perfect," Aulenbach said. "But 
she's now living in Colorado, and she's engaged. So many of these parents need 
to hear that there's going to be something 30 years later."

THE LONDON CHAMBER ORCHESTRA: MAXIMIZING MINIMALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was easy for Christopher Warren-Green to put his stamp on the London 
Chamber Orchestra when he took it over in 1988. He fired everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody -- well, hardly anybody -- got upset, he says, because that's what he 
was brought in to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The orchestra was slightly in the doldrums," the 39-year-old 
conductor-violinist said in a recent phone interview from his home in London. 
"Players had left. The standards were not very high. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, the very first time the job was offered to me, I didn't want to 
take it. Then they came back to me and said, 'To be honest, we'd rather you 
re-form the orchestra.' So I sacked all the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren-Green was 32 at the time. Always something of a musical whiz kid, he 
had joined the prestigious Academy of St. Martin in the Fields as a fiddler 
when he was 19, became concertmaster of the BBC Welsh Symphony at 21, 
concertmaster of the Philharmonia Orchestra of London at 24 and returned to St. 
Martin's as concertmaster at 30. He stayed there until he moved to the LCO. 
</P>
<P>
 As if that's not enough, Warren-Green also teaches at the Royal Academy of 
Music and plays a Habaneck Stradivarius violin on loan from that institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he's another conductor-violinist in the tradition of Neville Marriner, 
who formed the Academy of St. Martin's in 1959. "My dream was really to do both 
-- play and direct from the violin and conduct when necessary," Warren-Green 
said. "It wasn't one career or the other. More and more instrumentalists do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 To reconstitute the London group, which -- founded in 1921 -- is the oldest 
chamber orchestra in Great Britain, Warren-Green assembled a nucleus of 13 
musicians who have independent careers as soloists or as members in chamber 
groups or other orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only way to get a higher standard of player," he said. "I would 
far rather have really good quality players than augment the ranks and then 
risk somebody not being equal to the others."  
</P>
<P>
 On its current U.S. tour, which includes an Orange County Philharmonic 
Society-sponsored concert Friday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, the group 
travels with 14 musicians, although as many as 22 play at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never want the group to work more than six months in any year. A lot 
of British orchestras work too hard. We will have 27 concerts this year in 
America. More than 100 concerts, that would get too much. It's a kind of 
super-group idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The super-group plays in a now uncommon arrangement -- first and second 
violins flanking the podium -- "as orchestras used to be (seated) before 1920," 
he said. In another departure from standard operating procedure, he has the 
musicians play while standing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can make more sound that way," he said. "They play much better. We even 
record that way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recordings and concerts by the revitalized orchestra have been earning 
enthusiastic reviews. But when the group began playing at several rock 
festivals in Europe, classical-music critics got upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Oh, they've sold out to commercialization.' Nothing could be 
further from the truth. You're taking a hell of a risk playing at a rock 
festival. Rock audiences essentially will throw bottles at you if they don't 
like you." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting people to like them -- and to like the music -- is a key concern for 
Warren-Green. The conductor made frequent disparaging references to what he 
called "the petrified atmosphere" in many classical-music concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember a young teen-ager who started to applaud at the end of the first 
movement at one concert," he said. "No one else did. People shushed him. I was 
worried, so I spoke to the audience. I said, 'In Bach's time, if people wanted 
to applaud, they would have. So feel free.' People did." 
</P>
<P>
 The story had another happy outcome. Sometime later, he said, a stranger came 
up to him at the end of a concert and said, " 'I was that lad. I would never 
have gone to another concert, but I've gone ever since. I went from feeling 
like a heel -- you made me feel like a hero.'  
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of (snobbery) really worries me. So many people won't come to 
concert house for that reason. They don't want to be patronized." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Warren-Green feels "absolutely dedicated to get new music to the people, 
especially young people; who really love 20th Century so-called 'classical' 
music. But they're not just getting it. So they're going to Michael Nyman," 
composer and performer of "The Piano" film score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music, for me, if you can describe art at all," he said, "is anything that 
makes you feel -- right across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes 20th-Century music, which the group will play here. Britten's 
"Simple Symphony" and Bartok's Divertimento for String Orchestra have gone into 
the mainstream repertory. But John Adams and Philip Glass, whose works round up 
Friday's program, remain outside that august company despite their popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Adams' "Shaker Loops for Seven Strings," Warren-Green said, "has the 
most extraordinary effect on me. I have to admit it. Even though I am a 
professor of music, it took me a few listenings to understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 He is equally direct about his reactions to Philip Glass' "Company" pieces, 
written for the Samuel Beckett play of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're four very pretty pieces," he said. "That's an awful way of describing 
them. I really like them. I don't like everything Philip Glass wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 * The London Chamber Orchestra conducted by Christopher Warren-Green will play 
works by Britten, Bartok, John Adams and Philip Glass on Friday at the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. 8 p.m. $14 to $25. The program is 
sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society. (714) 856-5000.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: 'NEWSHOUR' CHASES THE NEWS, NOT SIMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "More Simpson updates on the hour!" -- KNBC-TV Channel 4 at 1 p.m. Monday. 
"Here's the latest!" -- KCBS-TV Channel 2 at 2 p.m. Monday. So many lies to the 
detriment of the people, so much frustration, so much worry about a fair trial. 
Given all of the publicity being whipped up around the O.J. Simpson murder 
case, sequestration does have a certain appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't be difficult to find a possible site for it, an area near a 
college campus, perhaps, where these sequestered persons could remain cleansed 
and clear of mind, where they could walk, smell flowers, frolic, exercise, play 
volleyball and attend lectures and old Walt Disney movies, where transporting 
them to and from court would be convenient. 
</P>
<P>
 But enough about the media. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the First Amendment did not prohibit shutting away the many 
high-polluting, low-functioning Beavises and Butt-heads who have attached 
themselves to the Simpson case like leeches. These media types are deployed 
throughout television. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A hypocritical "tsk tsk" quality permeates some of the reporting, with media 
perpetrators remarking, in effect, "How tragic that prospective jurors are 
being exposed to the relentlessly salacious coverage that we're relentlessly 
exposing them to." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to TV news, in fact, only one pristine pocket remains. It's "The 
MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour," TV's only newscast suitable for viewing by potential 
Simpson jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Memo to Judge Lance Ito, who has ordered potential Simpson jurors to avoid all 
media: "NewsHour" is safe, as close to being Simpson-free as TV news gets. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's edition of the weeknight PBS program was typical: a news summary, a 
story about President Clinton's announcement of lower national deficit figures, 
another about a campaign controversy concerning possible plans to further trim 
the deficit, another about the Democratic Party's troubles in Tennessee, a 
lengthy interview with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, an essay on the 
movie "Quiz Show." 
</P>
<P>
 And once again, not one word about Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing itself as an alternative to other national newscasts, "NewsHour" earns 
only a minuscule audience by commercial TV standards, hardly an incentive for 
favoring substance over sleaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet talk about heeding a different drummer. Media critic-come-lately Judge Ito 
should publicly give thanks for this newscast, which, amazingly, has virtually 
boycotted the double-homicide case that much of television has been chomping on 
with the frenzied fierceness of a pride of ravenous lions savagely tearing 
apart a poor wildebeest. 
</P>
<P>
 While other newscasts, and faux newscasts, have dwelt obsessively on the 
Simpson case -- constructing banner headlines from every crease, nit, speck and 
pinprick of microscopic minutiae -- "News-Hour" has focused specifically on it 
just once. And that fleeting blip was all the way back on June 20, when some of 
the newscast's regular contributors spent part of a Monday segment hashing over 
implications of the previous Friday's dramatic freeway pursuit and arrest of 
Simpson for the slashing murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. On two other occasions, the PBS program briefly mentioned 
the case in wider stories on spousal abuse and the importance of DNA evidence 
in trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Which means? 
</P>
<P>
 Either "NewsHour" is (a) stuffily, snootily, highfalutinly out of touch . . . 
or (b) acutely in touch with its journalistic responsibility as a serious 
newscast to enlighten the public on issues beyond the titillating and 
sensational. 
</P>
<P>
 "NewsHour" executive producer Lester M. Crystal picks (b). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case "doesn't really fit in with what we do," Crystal said by 
phone from New York. "This is a program that deals with crime as a problem -- 
not as a staple." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but we're constantly told by those operating from deep within the 
epicenter of the Simpson Zone that this case is not just any crime. Given the 
unprecedented sweep of the coverage, this undoubtedly qualifies as the murder 
case of the millennium, right? Larger even than the murders of Julius Caesar, 
Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King rolled 
into one? So significant that the major networks almost daily lavish chunks of 
their slender 22-minute evening newscasts on it, to say nothing of using their 
fleets of morning shows and newsmagazines to hot-pursue every aspect of the 
case? 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal: "Their priorities are out of whack." 
</P>
<P>
 He has some perspective, having spent 20 years with NBC, ultimately heading 
the network's news division in the late 1970s prior to his 1983 departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal's reply is an emphatic "no" when asked if there was any way he could 
have envisioned, say 15 years ago, what many in the media have become today. 
"It's a different world now," Crystal said. "You didn't have cameras in the 
courtroom then. You didn't have CNN and Court TV the way you have today. We 
would have felt it (1994-style Simpson coverage) would have been an 
inappropriate use of resources for the news division. It may be a very 
appropriate use of money for the entertainment division, and maybe that 
(traveling an entertainment path) is what the news divisions are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously so. While "News-Hour" continued to blaze its Simpson-free trail 
across the airwaves, yet another Simpson tome did air Monday on "NBC Nightly 
News," the program that Crystal once oversaw in an era when newscasting, though 
not golden, was a higher calling than it is now. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" airs weekdays at 3 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on 
KCET-TV Channel 28, at 6:30 p.m. on KPBS-TV Channel 15 and at 7 p.m. on KOCE-TV

MOCA GETS MAJOR GIFT -- WORKS BY 10 LOCAL ARTISTS; ART: THE PANZAS, RENOWNED 
ITALIAN COLLECTORS, MAKE A MAJOR DONATION OF 70 ITEMS THAT WILL GO ON DISPLAY 
IN 1997. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Giuseppe and Giovanna Panza di Biumo -- an Italian couple who have acquired 
legendary status in the art world as extraordinarily dedicated collectors of 
advanced American and European art -- have given Los Angeles' Museum of 
Contemporary Art 70 works by 10 local artists.  
</P>
<P>
 The donation includes major sculptures by internationally known artist Robert 
Therrien, as well as work by Peter Shelton, who was recently the subject of a 
solo exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Other artists whose 
work was donated are Greg Colson, Jeff Colson and Gregory Mahoney, who have 
established themselves more recently, and Mark Lere, Roy Thurston, Lawrence 
Carroll, Ron Griffin and Ross Rudel, who are less well-known outside Southern 
California. The museum declined to disclose the value of the collection, but 
sources familiar with the artists' market estimate its worth in the low 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panza's gift is only the latest event in the collectors' longtime 
affiliation with MOCA. Giuseppe Panza became a trustee of the museum in 1980, 
during its formative stages, and a selection of light-and-space installations 
and conceptual works from the couple's collection was among eight collections 
on view in "The First Show," the museum's 1983 inaugural exhibition. The 
following year, the Panzas sold the fledgling institution 80 works of Abstract 
Expressionist and Pop art for $11 million, which form the bedrock of MOCA's 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "This magnificent gift complements our earlier acquisition from the Panzas," 
MOCA Director Richard Koshalek said. "The collection we acquired in 1984 
represented New York and, to a lesser degree, Europe, but not California. This 
one represents a strong commitment to artists from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "But most importantly," he said, "the gift focuses on the work of younger 
artists (who are all under 50). This is the kind of institution that needs to 
take this risk. We are very fortunate that there are two individuals, the 
Panzas, who are also willing to risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "MOCA must draw strength from the city and the creative individuals working in 
the city," Koshalek continued. "The best way we can do that is to show work of 
artists from Los Angeles, especially emerging artists and younger artists, and 
to add them to the collection. The Panzas' generosity has made this possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Giuseppe Panza said he hadn't purchased the works with the idea of giving them 
to a museum, but he has acquired far too many works by the 10 artists to 
display in his home in Varese, Italy. In making the gift, he said, he selected 
seven representative pieces by each artist that are better suited to the 
museum's exhibition space. Panza said he gave the works to MOCA because of his 
relationship with the museum and the art's connections to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Panza began collecting contemporary art in 1956, after inheriting his family's 
real estate and distilling business interests along with a substantial amount 
of money. He began making regular art-buying trips to New York in 1960 and soon 
added Los Angeles to his agenda, when he became interested in the work of 
Robert Irwin and other artists who were creating art from light and space. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 38 years, the Panzas have built three collections: the first 
consisting of Abstract Expressionism and Pop art; the second of 
light-and-space, conceptual and Minimalist works (about 300 of which have gone 
to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York as a combination gift and 
purchase); and the works of relatively young artists from Los Angeles, New York 
and Europe. In each case, the Panzas purchased the works while they were 
affordable, before the artists achieved international renown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are always looking for new artists and new art, which is no easy task," 
Giuseppe Panza said. The couple devote an unusual amount of time to the 
project, typically conducting thorough research, visiting studios, establishing 
long-term relationships with artists, looking at all their work and finally 
buying in depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my free time in the last 40 years has been devoted to art study," Panza 
said. "I don't watch television. I don't travel for tourism. My pleasure is to 
go to artists' studios." 
</P>
<P>
 "We never go to the cinema," Giovanna Panza added. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple say they simply seek quality and buy what they like, making no 
attempt to tell the history of contemporary art or to follow trends. 
</P>
<P>
 They were initially attracted to Los Angeles as "a new city where artists were 
making something different," Panza said, but their interest in the region's art 
has continued. They now visit Los Angeles twice a year for two weeks at a time, 
spending most of their time with artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know of no other collector who has made this kind of commitment to the work 
of artists from this part of the country," Koshalek said. "Artists from 
Southern California have found two individuals who are willing to support their 
work and support it in depth, and that's what an artist needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panza gift adds to MOCA's holdings of works by Shelton, Therrien and Lere, 
but provides the museum with its first pieces by the seven other artists, 
according to curator Paul Schimmel. 
</P>
<P>
 The donated works are currently in Switzerland, where they are being examined 
by MOCA's registrar, Koshalek said. The collection is expected to go on view in 
1997 at the museum on Grand Avenue, in conjunction with an exhibition of the 
1984 purchase. As he did in MOCA's initial exhibition of that acquisition, 
Giuseppe Panza will design the installation of the show.

NEA ANNOUNCES NEW CUTS IN FUNDING; ARTS: AGENCY SAYS $1.65 MILLION REDUCTION IN 
GRANTS IS RESULT OF CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET SLASHING. AFI WILL LOSE OVER $700,000 
FOR FILM PRESERVATION AND FILMMAKERS.

<P>
 The National Endowment for the Arts has announced $1.65 million in funding 
cuts, including more than $700,000 in support for the American Film Institute's 
preservation program and its support to independent film and video makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those funds are among so-called "sub-grants" -- money given to organizations 
that funnel funds to artists or arts groups -- that will be suspended by the 
NEA in the next couple of years. The NEA maintains it is making the cuts 
because Congress has pared $3.4 million from the endowment's 1995 budget. 
Critics, however, are charging that the moves are partly designed to deflect 
political problems for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions are concentrated in the area of film and video, including 
$355,000 for the AFI's Film Preservation Program and $350,000 for the 
institute's grants to independent film and video makers -- programs that have 
been in existence for 27 years. Additionally, the NEA is eliminating $315,000 
in regional fellowships for film and video makers, and $170,000 in support to 
the National Alliance of Media Arts and Culture. NEA spokesman Cherie Simon 
denied that film and video was targeted in the paring process. "We're extremely 
supportive of the AFI," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sub-grant programs that will be suspended include Meet the Composer 
($125,000), which sponsors new commissions (past recipients include the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic and the Music Center Opera); the Rural/Inner City Arts 
Presenting Regrant Initiative ($90,000); and the Artists Projects Regional 
Initiative ($250,000), which supports experimental and interdisciplinary arts. 
Last year, the West Coast portion of the program was co-administered by Los 
Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions and New Langton Arts in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any move by the NEA in the last six years can easily be construed as being 
motivated . . . to avoid controversy," said Christiane Robbins, executive 
co-director of the New Langton Arts. "If this had happened in 1990, there would 
have been an outcry in the community. I'm not seeing that happen this year, 
which is disturbing to me. It's the frog being (slowly) boiled in water." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some NEA sub-grants have been troublesome for the agency in the past. In 
March, the NEA's recent budget battles were touched off by a $150 grant given 
by Minneapolis' Walker Arts Center to performance artist Ron Athey. The budget 
fracas was touched off by complaints to Congress about a performance in which 
Athey, who is HIV-positive, carved a pattern onto the back of another artist, 
who was said to not have the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 NEA spokesman Josh Dare denied that the move to slash sub-grants was designed 
to consolidate granting decisions in Washington. He said the grant category 
that funded Athey's performance was untouched by the latest cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent film and video makers should feel the cuts most directly. The 
AFI's program, for example, has awarded $6 million to more than 600 artists, 
including Mira Nair, Gus Van Sant, Wayne Wang, Robert Wilson and Marlon Riggs, 
whose film "Tongues Untied" was pilloried in 1992 by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), 
who said it promoted homosexuality. That film, however, was not supported by 
the AFI program, and the NEA's Dare said the cuts were not made to stem further 
controversy. (Independent media artists will still be able to apply directly to 
the NEA for grants.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An NEA source said that agency Chairwoman Jane Alexander believes the private 
sector, including the film industry, hasn't carried its weight in supporting 
the arts. Alexander promised to help AFI raise private funds to offset the 
loss, although she hasn't specified how she will do that, said AFI Director 
Jean Firstenberg. The $355,000 cut in AFI's preservation program halves the 
public funding available for film restoration nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very distressing message . . . that support at the endowment for 
preservation, that is restoration projects, no longer exists," Firstenberg said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The AFI Preservation Program has doled out $9.5 million to archives including 
the UCLA Film and Television Archive, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City 
and the George Eastman House in Rochester.

FAMILY; 'HEART AND SOUL' HOPES TO ENGAGE MINDS

<P>
 When "Frankenstein" opens on Halloween night at the Odyssey Theatre in West 
L.A., it'll provide chills and thrills, promises director Debbie Devine. It 
will also dig a little deeper than that. 
</P>
<P>
 The production, presented by the Glorious Repertory Company, a new group 
composed of theater professionals, inaugurates "Heart and Soul," a series of 
three plays that will "celebrate the word, the visual and human interaction." 
The adult theater series was created with a purpose: to also be accessible to 
young people ages 10 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not enough theater about real-life human issues that is appropriate 
for adults to bring children to," Devine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work we do is not something where you're going to want to drop your kid 
off and pick him up after. It's really provocative material that you need to 
share and talk about together, because it's complex stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankenstein," set in 1845 Vienna, has a cast of 15, including a Bob Baker 
marionette. Two actors play the monster's body and mind; the latter being 
portrayed by Allan Hendrick, a former member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. 
Makeup was designed by Blake Shepard ("Star Trek: The Next Generation") and 
multi-Emmy Award winner Tom Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the play was chosen "partly because of the L.A. riots," Devine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Shelley's "book is really about a scientist who creates a monster and 
rejects him. And, out of that rejection and abandonment, the monster kills 
Victor Frankenstein's friends -- everything he loved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe if you don't nurture the individual and society, it's going to . . 
. hurt you." In the play, the struggle of Vienna's underclass runs "in tandem 
with what happens with the monster. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of the plays in the series explore "our community" in one way or 
another, Devine noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The second play will be a reprise of the Odyssey's 1993 holiday production of 
"The Snow Maiden," about a Russian photographer's courageous search for her own 
humanity. It will be followed in the spring by a collaboration with Jose Cruz 
Gonzales from South Coast Repertory and members of his Latino Theatre Lab that 
looks at the issue of immigration. Dates have not yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Each play, Devine said, will appeal to adults and to youths old enough to 
"grasp moral ambiguity and in-depth characters and to reason through material." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is also a wonderful initiate experience to theater for adults," Devine 
said. It is "highly theatrical, fast-paced and visually engaging" -- elements 
that are important in "the struggle to get people in the door and show them 
that theater can be compelling and exciting. I want to make sure they're both 
challenged and mesmerized by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Odyssey is known for very adult, often cutting-edge theater, the 
"Heart and Soul" series is part of a new effort, according to Ron Sossi, the 
Odyssey's artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Devine's other theater company, the Glorious Players, which 
presents plays for young children, a youth conservatory is in the planning 
stages and the theater is "pursuing grants for arts in education" programming. 
"We have a kind of major move going on," Sossi said. "We're doing everything we 
can to encourage and develop a younger audience." 
</P>

7:30 p.m.; Saturday, 2 p.m.; Sunday, 1 and 4 p.m. through Dec. 4. $12.50; (310)

MIKE PENNER: HOCKEY PLAYERS STRIKING OUT FOR GREENER PATCHES OF ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as Pavlov had his dog, Gary Bettman had his hockey players, and a theory 
to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 Drop the puck, Prof. Bettman maintained, and hockey players are at their 
happiest -- wide-eyed, panting, entirely captivated by the simple joy of 
chasing and fetching a small, round play toy. 
</P>
<P>
 But stop the puck, Bettman hypothesized, and it won't take long before the 
players are reduced to drooling, quivering basket cases. One month ought to do 
it. Take away their paychecks, lock them out of their rinks, and the players 
are going to break ranks. First by ones, then by twos and threes, they are 
certain to cave in and cross and come back to play. 
</P>
<P>
 And so they have. 
</P>
<P>
 They have crossed the Atlantic to play for professional teams actually playing 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Jari Kurri, Teemu Selanne and Esa Tikannen to Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaromir Jagr, Martin Straka and Frantisek Kucera to the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Quinn and Calle Johansson to Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Reichel and Josef Beranek to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrik Carnback and, any day now, Tomas Sandstrom, Mats Sundin and Peter 
Forsberg to Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they are planning to cross league affiliations. Alexei Yashin, runner-up 
for 1993-94 NHL rookie of the year, has jumped to Las Vegas of the IHL, a 
franchise that also has offered to provide sanctuary for wayward thug Marty 
McSorley. Two of Toronto's most prized Maple Leafs, Doug Gilmour and Dave 
Ellett, are presently mulling proposals from the IHL's Detroit Vipers and the 
CHL's Wichita Thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they are contemplating crossing the international date line. Former NHL 
defenseman Slava Fetisov is attempting to organize a Russian "super team" and 
barnstorm Europe, playing exhibitions against club teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Might there be anyone in Switzerland interested in paying to see Pavel Bure, 
Sergei Fedorov and Alexander Mogilny skate on the same line? 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany? 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the state of North American major league hockey, circa late October 
1994. The agony and the exodus. Financial hardship was supposed to be the 
sledgehammer in Bettman's toolbox -- bludgeon the players into submission was 
the basic strategy -- but Bettman and his NHL board of lemmings neglected two 
important details when they decided to lock the players out on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 1. They locked the players out, but they didn't shut them in. 
</P>
<P>
 2. They forgot this was hockey and not baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 On a global scale, baseball is a regional phenomenon. Big in Japan, yes. Huge 
in the States, well, once upon a time. Central America. The Caribbean. Canada's 
a Johnny-come-lately. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, career opportunities in baseball are rather limited. Venture south 
of the equator, or east of Manhattan, and it's pretty much all soccer fields, 
basketball courts and bull rings. 
</P>
<P>
 And hockey rinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jari Kurri has options Barry Bonds never dreamed of. Europe is teeming with 
professional hockey leagues, with more than a half-dozen NHLs of its own, all 
operating at the same time of the year, all competing for the best available 
talent -- or eager to bring it back home. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many Finns, Swedes, Czechs and Russians playing here -- amid 
unfamiliar surroundings, alongside teammates speaking a strange tongue -- the 
NHL lockout was a clarion call to phone home. 
</P>
<P>
 What's to keep Carnback, a young Mighty Duck forward born and raised in 
Goteborg, Sweden, hanging around in Anaheim while Bettman and Bob Goodenow 
refuse each other's phone calls? 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when his old club team, V. Frolunda, can not only guarantee him ice 
time, but also regular paychecks, dinners with the family and a few laughs with 
the old gang? 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' counteroffer was a spot on the fourth line, maybe, provided the 
season resumes some time before next Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow Swedes Sandstrom, Sundin and Forsberg are poised to book return 
flights, too, now that the Swedish league has decided to relax restrictions on 
signing stranded NHL players. Sweden had to do something, with all the deutsche 
marks being thrown around by the Germans, blatant opportunists that they are. 
</P>
<P>
 German hockey has always trailed Scandinavia and Russia in reputation and 
prestige, and you know how the Germans hate that. For them, the NHL lockout is 
a chance for a quick-fix, and German clubs are rolling out the short-term, 
open-ended, stay-as-long-as-you-like contracts for any goal-scoring winger 
hankering to sample each and every one of the top 35 beers of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like keeping up with the Joneses," says NHL player agent Jeff 
Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
 So there go the Makelas and the Jagrs, to their safe European homes, with 
others undoubtedly to follow as Bettman holds press conferences to announce 
he's whittling the regular season down to 80 games . . . and then 76 . . . and 
then 70 . . . and 60 . . . and 50, if we're lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we know Bettman's game plan, and a brilliant one it is. He and the Gang of 
26 have taken the NHL -- an entirely functioning and flourishing athletic 
league -- and turned it into the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
 Why hockey would want to borrow soccer's headaches is a mystery, but the 
owners have gone and done it. Now we have two sports where the best players in 
this country, if they wish to play for reasonable pay, are forced to pack a 
duffel bag and do so abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 And what are we left with? 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey in the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, we can get up for these foreign sports once every four years.

HOSTETLER STANDS BEHIND SHELL AMID TURMOIL; PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDER QUARTERBACK 
SAYS CONFRONTATION HAD NO RACIAL CONNOTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine days after engaging in a heated dispute with Art Shell on the sideline 
during a game against Miami, in full public view, Raider quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler stood up to defend his beleaguered coach against allegations that 
Shell had injected racism into that argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of things happened on the field," Hostetler said at a hastily convened 
news conference on Tuesday. "There was a long discussion, a heated discussion, 
but I can honestly say I don't ever recall hearing anything racist being said 
to my face by Art, and I don't feel he would make that kind of comment." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Hostetler said he couldn't remember everything said in the 
confrontation, triggered when Hostetler changed two plays in the huddle late in 
the first half of a game against the Dolphins in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our discussion, there were a lot of things said," Hostetler said. "I remember 
some of them and a lot of them I don't remember. If there was something, he was 
talking to me. OK? He wasn't talking to anybody else. It was in the heat of 
battle." 
</P>
<P>
 It was reported on ESPN Sunday that Shell had uttered a racial remark in his 
argument with Hostetler before replacing him with backup Vince Evans for the 
rest of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, three independent sources, talking to The Times, said Shell 
derisively compared Hostetler to former Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder. 
Versions of Shell's statements varied slightly, and generally had Shell calling 
Hostetler "another white quarterback, just like Schroeder." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell vehemently denied the ESPN story Monday. When Hostetler was also given 
an opportunity to deny it by a Times reporter after practice Monday, he chose 
not to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we, as a team, had put that behind us," Hostetler said at 
Tuesday's news conference. "And I made a comment yesterday that I had no 
comment about that type of situation and that, in turn, was turned (around) so 
that it made me look like I wouldn't say yes or no to what was going on, and 
that was as far away from the truth, and as far away (from) the response that I 
wanted to come across. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel extremely angered that Art had to go through this, and that I'm any 
part of this. I mean, I feel like we as a team have handled a lot of adversity 
and this doesn't have any place on our team or in the Raider organization or in 
the NFL or in L.A. or across the States." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler started the second half of that Dolphin game, which the Raiders lost 
in overtime. But he continued to seethe over the dispute and his brief 
benching. On the Monday after the dispute, Hostetler considered skipping 
practice because he still hadn't cooled down. Instead, he showed up as 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our meeting on Monday as a team and Art felt that it was over," 
Hostetler said. "The situation was over and it was a heat-of-the-moment type 
situation and you let it go. At that point, I probably had a tougher time 
leaving it go than he did and that's why I went in and I met with him (last) 
Tuesday morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler and Shell spent several hours talking about the team's disappointing 
offense, which had largely contributed to the team's 2-4 start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt really good about what was discussed," Hostetler said. "When I left, I 
felt as good about our relationship as I have since I've been here because I 
think we both realized we were on the same page, wanting the same thing. We 
were going ahead in the same direction." 
</P>
<P>
 He said they concluded that there had been communication problems with the 
offensive staff, which also includes offensive coordinator Tom Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Art and I both found out in our meeting . . . if we would have known 
certain things beforehand, the situation would never have occurred," Hostetler 
said. "Our meeting on Tuesday was probably the most positive thing that's 
happened to us in the first four or five weeks of the season because I think 
there were a lot of things that were revealed to both of us that the other 
wasn't aware of. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked out of that meeting feeling really good that a lot of positive 
things came out of the confrontation in Miami. Now we're taking that positive 
meeting, (but the media) is trying to turn it around to drag somebody through 
lower than the sewer." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler was asked how big a distraction the racial allegations have been to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been huge," he said. "Ever since Sunday after the game, when I first was 
made aware that something was reported of that, I've been thinking about it the 
whole time," he said. "And I know it's been on Art's mind the whole time also. 
How could it not be? And I think it needs to be laid to rest. And that's the 
reason that I wanted to get this done. We felt like we had it laid to rest last 
week and now this pops up. It's done with. I mean, it's over. This should not 
be. It's a shame that it's come down to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler was asked if his respect for Shell had grown because of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, definitely," Hostetler said, "And I can't express it enough. . . 
. I really feel for him right now. He's the head coach. He takes the majority 
of the blame for anything that goes on. We've had a rough beginning this year 
and I think he's handled it well. I think there are times that he does things 
the way he wants them done and I may not agree with him. I'm allowed to 
disagree with him. He's allowed to disagree with me. That's what makes us all 
unique and our own person. 
</P>
<P>
 "To try to turn a disagreement on the field in the heat of battle, instead of 
taking that for what it's worth and exactly what it was, to end up in this 
situation here, this is bad news. It's almost on the realm of unbelievable. 
But, I've learned you always expect the unexpected in the NFL. I guess I'm 
being amazed every day.'

MIKE DOWNEY: HOPEFULLY, HOSS GETS IN LAST WORD ON THIS SUBJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here in a city of nasty, hateful little stories, none of us needed this one. 
Maybe we can blink and make it go away, now that Raider quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler has said that, to the best of his recollection, his African-American 
coach made no derogatory comment about Caucasian quarterbacks, the kind that 
would have led to serious repercussions were the shoe on the other foot. 
</P>
<P>
 We got it Tuesday, straight from Hoss' mouth. "To drag somebody through lower 
than a sewer . . . " Hostetler said of the Art Shell bombshell, reported Sunday 
on national TV. "This is bad news. I mean, it's almost in the realm of 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabloid television being preoccupied with bigger, juicier stories from Los 
Angeles nowadays, this one thankfully can vanish as quickly as it came, unless 
someone digs up a sound bite of Shell actually making some remark, or unless a 
book about the secret lives of Shell and Hostetler gets written by Faye Resnick 
or Prince Charles. Good riddance to this rubbish. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, it was not an unimportant issue, even if said in jest. But if nobody 
can prove Shell said such a thing, and if Shell contends he never said it, and 
if Hostetler never heard him say it, then there is no story here, no issue. Al 
Campanis was not misquoted. Jimmy the Greek was not misquoted. Misguided, 
maybe. Misunderstood, both insisted. But never misquoted. 
</P>
<P>
 We presumably can let both coach and quarterback get back to their business, 
without dredging this up ever again. Hostetler says his relationship with Shell 
not only is OK, but never stronger. He says they now understand things about 
each other they never understood before. He denies having heard anything about 
being "another white quarterback, just like Schroeder," a quote attributed to 
Shell in which the biggest insult is debatable, being singled out as white or 
being compared to Jay Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
 In hiking boots, denim shorts and sunglasses, Hostetler strode into an 
interview room in El Segundo, actually smiling all the way along the sidewalk. 
Upon arrival, he pressed his palms against a podium as comfortably as Bill 
Clinton at a Rotary luncheon and asked the mike-carriers assembled, "Ready to 
roll?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then he tried to clarify the very thing he should have clarified 24 to 48 
hours earlier, when he first heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler was a hypocrite to a degree, first angrily denouncing the reporter 
from the all-sports cable channel for not personally consulting him as to the 
truth of the matter, then conveniently absolving himself for not coming to 
Shell's defense sooner by insisting that the report "didn't deserve comment." 
</P>
<P>
 That left Shell twisting in the wind. The player could have spared his coach 
considerable aggravation had he stood firm after Sunday's game at the Coliseum 
and responded to the nationally televised allegations with the very words he 
used Tuesday. Instead, still steamed about reaction to his very public quarrel 
with Shell, Hostetler irritably shouted across the locker room, "Let it go!" 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted again the next night, when the "white quarterback" story began to 
snowball, Hostetler again declined to say point-blank that Shell never had made 
any such crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 48 hours after the fact, and after three independent sources had backed 
ESPN's report in The Times, did he became indignant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel extremely angered that Art had to go through this," Hostetler said. 
Hey, no kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 In standing beside his coach -- with less gesticulation than in Miami -- the 
quarterback also made the observation, "We're talking about a guy's livelihood 
here, a guy's life. I mean, he spent many, many years building a reputation 
that a lot of people hold up extremely high." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the exact same thing could be said, word for word, for the correspondent 
from ESPN who put his own reputation on the line, going public with such 
Raider-baiting inflammatory stuff. Remember, this was not "A Current Affair" or 
"Hard Copy" stirring up this black-and-white contretemps between the 
black-and-silver. This was good old, athlete-friendly ESPN. So either somebody 
has gotten some very bad information, or somebody is lying through his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Accountability is at stake here. 
</P>
<P>
 Where is Judge Ito when you need him? 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler said, "We've got one person who has started a blaze that I don't 
feel has . . . anything to back it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The quotation in question is not the most insulting one in recorded history, 
and only a dimwit would completely dismiss the possibility that Shell did 
indeed say it, not necessarily meaning much by it. Hostetler concedes that a 
lot of hot topics got covered in that Miami discussion, and that, "A lot of 
them I can't remember. If there was something, he was talking to me. OK? He 
wasn't talking to anybody else. It was in the heat of battle." 
</P>
<P>
 And things get said there. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired Raider player, Howie Long, pointed out that when confronted at 
practice, having his authority questioned even in the slightest, Shell has been 
known to say to Chester McGlockton, a very large and strong player, "Big boy, 
you want a piece of me?" Football players recognize this as nothing more than 
Practicespeak, stuff that gets said from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 But several unconvincing voices among the Raiders kept insisting that the 
sideline scrap between Shell and Hostetler "happens every day," while knowing 
full well that such a loud and hostile conversation is very rarely visible to 
millions during a game. At practice, sure, but not in front of everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell said some things. Hostetler said some things back. The two principals 
are willing to forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 So, unless somebody has something else to say, the rest of us can lay it to 
rest ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just talking about the little game of football. This is a guy's 
whole life, his whole reputation," Hostetler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us discuss this no more.

THERE OTTER BE A WAY TO HELP; THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATES WORKERS WHO AID ORPHANED 
SEA MAMMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 April was sleeping in a shallow pool between two rocks when a little boy 
pointed down and shouted, "Look at that fish!" 
</P>
<P>
 Another boy tried to correct him, calling April a seal. 
</P>
<P>
 April would have none of that. She shot the boys a casual glance, rolled over 
as if to show the world that she was an otter, not a fish or a seal, and went 
back to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun had finally burned through the fog, the gray mist giving way to the 
sparkling Pacific. The patio above the Great Tide Pool at the Monterey Bay 
Aquarium had become a busy place. 
</P>
<P>
 But April, curled up in a puddle, was unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sea otters often visit the waterfront exhibit at the popular aquarium on 
Cannery Row. But none seem as at home there as April, and for good reason.  
</P>
<P>
 April was raised there. "She's definitely one of our success stories," a proud 
Candice Tahara said. 
</P>
<P>
 As coordinator of the otter rescue-and-care program at the aquarium, which 
last week celebrated its 10th anniversary, Tahara works long hours behind the 
scenes. She and a small group of employees and volunteers act as surrogate 
mothers to young otters, giving stranded young pups another shot at life. 
</P>
<P>
 "With every one that comes in, we're just giving them a second chance," said 
Susan Rainville, whose responsibilities include swimming with pups and teaching 
them the ways of the wild. "We know that not all of them are going to survive, 
but we do what we can." 
</P>
<P>
 April was 5 weeks old when she became separated from her mother during a 
fierce storm that hit the Central California coast during the spring of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 She was found on the beach the next day, a quivering ball of fur crying for 
her mother. April got a new mother, or mothers, albeit human ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Stranded pups such as April -- an otter is considered a pup until it is 12 
weeks old -- begin their new lives in the aquarium nursery. It is a room with a 
waterbed inside a giant crib and a 4 x 12-foot tank, 3 1/2 feet deep and full 
of rocks, sea urchins, sea stars and other critters common in Monterey Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The surrogate mothers actually cuddle with the pups on the waterbed and feed 
them a vitamin-enriched liquid formula of clams, squid, fish oil and 
half-and-half until they are ready for the small tank, where they are 
reintroduced to their natural surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 The tank is only a few feet deep because the young otters don't yet have the 
strength to get their furry bodies to the bottom. Otters have the thickest coat 
of any mammal, with as many as a million hairs per square inch. The hairs trap 
air, which acts as insulation and helps keep the otters buoyant. 
</P>
<P>
 The orphans are eventually moved to an outside tank and monitored before being 
scheduled for swims with their surrogates beyond aquarium walls. When they go 
out, they are tagged and fitted with radio transmitters so they can be tracked 
if they venture too far. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes visitors to the aquarium can watch from the patio as the swimmer 
dives for "prey," and as the young otter tries to do the same, using all its 
might to dive deep enough to follow its "mother."  
</P>
<P>
 She will teach it to use rocks to dislodge shellfish and to rest on its chest 
so it can use its paws to grasp the prey -- usually shellfish -- and crack it 
on the rock. The surrogate mother will sometimes stay in the water with the pup 
for three hours at a time. The maternal bond with the pup in the wild is a 
strong one, and the pup requires constant attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last two years, we have really been increasing our efforts, spending 
more time out in the ocean with them, making longer swims and just trying, as 
swimmers, to increase our stamina underwater," Rainville said.  
</P>
<P>
 Staff members were especially careful with April, watching over her in the 
tide pool for 45 days and nights, like a mother would a child in a swimming 
pool, before determining she could fend for herself.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just giving her the support of a mom," said Linda Yingling, a nursery worker 
since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 And, like any grown child, April still returns for an occasional visit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Bay Aquarium is the only facility in the world with a program geared 
to rescuing and rehabilitating otter pups with the intention of returning them 
to the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 The sea otter as a species can certainly use the help. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals, which once had a worldwide population of 200,000-350,000 thriving 
along the Northern Pacific rim from Japan to Baja California, were prized for 
their fur and hunted down to about 2,000 in the 18th and 19th centuries. Sea 
otter pelts were one of the first California commodities sold outside the 
state. But by 1820, the animals had all but disappeared from our shores. 
</P>
<P>
 They were actually thought to have been exterminated until a colony of about 
50 animals was discovered by scientists near Big Sur after the turn of the 
century. The otters became exposed to the public with the opening of California 
1 in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 The sea otter is now a federally "threatened" species and has begun to come 
back. Still, the California population has not come back as well as some had 
hoped, in part because of the low survival rate for pups -- more than 40% die 
within four months of birth for a variety of reasons. There are about 2,400 
otters in the state, all of them off the Central California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our record as far as successful releases -- and by successful I mean we know 
that they were able to survive and find their own food upon release -- equals 
what occurs in the wild, which is about 50%," Tahara said. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff has rescued 103 stranded otters in the last 10 years, 34 of which 
were returned to the wild. Every year, Tahara says, the staff learns more about 
getting more back into their natural environment. 
</P>
<P>
 A key, Tahara says, is to limit their contact with humans, to develop the 
maternal bond as quickly as possible and maintain it until the animal is 
capable of striking out on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 This puts an emotional twist into the work of the surrogate mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a swimmer, there's even a stronger bond than in the nursery because they 
have the ability to go off if they want to," Rainville said. "And they do go 
off with wild otters, but then they come back to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once had an otter with a sea star (also called starfish) stuck on his 
chest, and he was far off in the bay, and he comes barreling in and he kind of 
just flipped over in front of me and, it was like he was screaming, 'Get it off 
me.' And as soon as I got it off, he just relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 That was a pup named Spanky. Spanky never did get the hang of catching his own 
food, though, and is now living at the New York Aquarium.  
</P>
<P>
 A pup named Riley would only swim with Rainville, and liked to play 
hide-and-seek with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was a game for him or what, but our swims were . . . I'd 
always lose him," Rainville recalled. "And I'd have to come back to shore and 
then we'd get in our (skiff) and we'd go out and find him, they'd dump me out 
and I'd chase him back home." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Rainville determined that Riley could make it on his own and refused 
to play the game; she didn't give chase. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stuck around the aquarium for about a month and then he just kind of 
went," Rainville said. "We never picked up his signal again." 
</P>
<P>
 Yingling said it is impossible not to become emotionally involved with a young 
animal that has the same needs a human child has with its mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, my magic moment comes when the little tiny pup crawls toward me 
instead of away from me on the waterbed," Yingling said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have adult children and I think raising them has helped me become a better 
sea otter mom because I've already sent my children to college and know they 
can survive. It's the same feeling when the otter leaves. You know it's ready 
and it can survive." 
</P>
<P>
 But survival isn't guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they started naming otters, they gave them numbers. No. 1845 came into 
the program when he was 12 weeks old and soon earned his release. Three years 
later, he was found on the beach, fatally wounded by a great white shark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sad to find out that," Tahara said. "Here was a male that we had given 
a second chance, and . . . It's nature, but kind of sad that he hadn't even 
reached sexual maturity." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of thing can be difficult to handle, Tahara said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even swim with them and I still get close to them," she said. "And it 
doesn't necessarily have to be a pup.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was one otter that came in and she was older -- we named her Hazel -- 
and she had something wrong with her back and we never did figure it out. 
(After her release) she kind of hung out in the tide pool with April and slept 
on the rocks with her. . . . And then she was found dead a while later and, I 
remember when I found out she died, I burst into tears. It was like, I don't 
know, I seem to get attached to the ones that are like underdogs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the aquarium has two pups going through the program. One is a 
playful young male named Axel, who is living in a quarantine tank on the roof 
above the facility's huge kelp-forest exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Axel seems happy enough being hand-fed and cared for by humans, which is good 
because it has been determined that he cannot forage for himself and will not 
be returned to the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent swim in the bay, Axel fled and was eventually tracked down.  
</P>
<P>
 "He had self-released prematurely and lost so much weight in the wild that we 
felt he did not have the skills to survive," Tahara said. "Being that we could 
not form that bond with him, swim him to show him the skills, we felt like we 
would send him out there and he wouldn't survive. And we felt that wasn't 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 But Axel's tank-mate, Simon, despite being much smaller than other males of 
the same age, has demonstrated remarkable skills since being picked up recently 
from the rocks at nearby Moss Landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon is wary of all but his handlers and actually seems eager to get back to 
the bay. He is scheduled for release in a few weeks and the vast emerald 
forests of kelp will be his to rediscover. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, like April, he will return to the tide pool for a visit.

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; THIS SEASON IS ONE THEY SHOULD THROW BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some anniversary celebration this has been. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest hit so far was delivered in a New Orleans bar. The most exciting 
run was a hip-hop dance. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important injury occurred on an interstate highway. The most 
interesting play was radioed to a quarterback from a concession stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Our senses overloaded by throwback uniforms and nostalgic films, we have some 
idea how the NFL wanted to commemorate 75 years of professional football. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't think this is it. 
</P>
<P>
 One coach was reported missing by his players after he left the field during 
the fourth quarter to use the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Another coach was refused free parking at his stadium's lot because the 
attendant didn't recognize him . . . and he coached the league's only 
undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
 Still another coach went for a two-point conversion despite strenuous 
objections from his staff . . . then later acknowledged that he had misread his 
strategy chart after it had been smudged in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 At the midway point of the league's 75th birthday party, it's a good thing 
George Halas isn't around to witness it. By now, he would be chewing candles. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to numerous changes in everything from rules to rosters, the 1994 
version of the NFL is far removed from the days of real men with real 
jack-o'-lantern smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no longer a football league, but a theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a pleasant Sunday diversion notable not for its lessons in courage and 
determination but for its wild rides, unusual exhibits and sideshows. 
</P>
<P>
 John Elway has been booed. Barry Switzer has been cheered. Bill Belichick has 
been, uh, embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Chargers, picked to finish fourth by many, have been splendid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, picked to advance to the Super Bowl by many, have been pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 And the once-proud Green Bay Packers have pouted, stumbled, and even been 
moved out of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 On national television, a father spanked a son. A reporter went grocery 
shopping with a linebacker. And the best coach of our era became an 
insufferable talking head. 
</P>
<P>
 The once legendary run-and-shoot offense of the Houston Oilers is being led by 
. . . Billy Joe Tolliver? 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington shoes of quarterbacks Billy Kilmer, Sonny Jurgensen, Joe 
Theismann and Doug Williams are being filled by . . . Gus Frerotte? 
</P>
<P>
 And the league's best passer is not Joe, or Danny or Boomer, but somebody 
named Drew. 
</P>
<P>
 This same Drew Bledsoe recently acknowledged accidentally lining up under a 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half of this season will contain more substance. The second half 
always does. There might even be a good game that does not involve Joe Montana 
or Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, eight Sundays down, nine Sundays remaining, it's worth taking a 
tour of the place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our first stop is the winners' exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Look, aren't those the San Francisco 49ers piling on top of one another in 
celebration? 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't that Rickey Watters promising to shut up and smile? Isn't that Ken 
Norton Jr. vowing that before the season ends, he will make at least one 
important tackle? Isn't that Steve Young making plans to run out and buy a 
comb? 
</P>
<P>
 Why, it seems they have even forgiven Deion Sanders for the season's most 
exciting run, a 93-yard interception return that became an embarrassing 
10-second boogie in front of the Atlanta Falcons' bench. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys, clearly the best team in the league for a third 
consecutive season, suddenly look beatable. Even if their potential downfall 
has nothing to do with a football. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is an injury to the best offensive lineman in football. But the 
playing field was an interstate highway, and the equipment was a Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 After celebrating a bruising victory over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, 
tackle Erik Williams suffered a possible season-ending knee injury when his 
luxury car skidded off the road in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two seasons, Williams has been the guardian angel of running back 
Emmitt Smith and quarterback Troy Aikman. Without Williams, Smith gains fewer 
yards, Aikman takes more hits, chaos ensues. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that chaos doesn't ensue there most of the time anyway, what with Switzer 
taking fourth-quarter potty breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine with the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 After struggling while their best offensive linemen wore a variety of slings 
and casts during the first half, they are thrilled that their team could be 
together again by their mid-November showdown with the Cowboys in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 11 quarters, the 49er defense has stopped bickering and the 
offense has outscored opponents, 110-33. Quarterback Young and Coach George 
Seifert, not the best of friends, have joined in the realization that if they 
don't advance to the Super Bowl this year, they might never do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Seifert will get fired and Young will be ordered to tend the guest register in 
the Joe Montana Hall of Fame. Beating the Cowboys would certainly be more fun. 
And now, it can happen. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no other true winners in the first half. Only teasers. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Chargers showed Sunday that they are neither deep nor 
experienced enough to win the sort of game in which everything goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bobby Ross, who became notable in the first half for his 
misunderstanding with a stadium parking attendant, had better get used to it. 
If he wants to park at the Super Bowl, he will also have to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Browns, who share the league's best record with the Cowboys and 
Chargers, have actually turned Belichick into a human being. Now, if somebody 
can turn Vinny Testaverde into a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leading challengers to the Cowboys and 49ers are probably the 
Minnesota Vikings and Pittsburgh Steelers, two good defensive teams with 
veteran attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But does Viking quarterback Warren Moon have enough left for a playoff run? 
And when will somebody in Pittsburgh realize that Barry Foster needs not only 
his head examined, but also his heart? 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Eagles? It's not that Coach Rich Kotite is a dunce for saying 
a rain-smudged chart affected his extra-point play calling against the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 But is Randall Cunningham, reluctant to scramble because of previous injuries, 
reluctant to be great again? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That old man standing alone in the corner? That's the centerpiece of the 
losers' exhibit, one Buddy Ryan, who began the season as the league's hottest 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 He is standing alone because that's how he stood during a timeout before his 
Cardinals' final play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 His team had a chance to tie the Cowboys with a touchdown. Yet he was five 
yards from the sideline huddle between offensive coaches and quarterback Steve 
Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Ryan not understand the modern offense, he doesn't care to 
understand it. His team has no chance to make the playoffs, and the world has 
stopped listening. 
</P>
<P>
 That weeping young man in the other corner? Poor Dave Shula, who has already 
been whipped on national television by his father, Don, when the Miami Dolphins 
defeated the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 He is crying because he is thinking of Christmas Eve in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 This has nothing to do with remembering the day he discovered there was no 
Santa Claus. After all, as long as Mike Brown does not fire him, Santa Claus is 
alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Shula is thinking of Christmas Eve as the day his team will lose to the 
Eagles and set an NFL record with 16 defeats in a season. As in 0-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy holidays from the worst team in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
 The only comparable loser to Ryan and Shula has been Wade Phillips with the 
Denver Broncos. Over two seasons, nobody has accomplished less with more. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question there is not whether owner Pat Bowlen will order the team 
torn apart and rebuilt. It is whether Elway will want to stick around to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tour of the players' exhibit begins with a recap of a recent sideline 
interview with Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 The interviewer was a Cowboy team doctor. Aikman had suffered a blow to the 
head moments before. The doctor asked Aikman the day, the date and the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman missed two of the three questions. But to no one's surprise, he knew it 
was Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody this season has been more sure of Sundays than he. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman has been the best player in the league, so far, not because of his 
numbers, but because of his nerve, his leadership and his ability to command a 
championship team that would ultimately fail without him. 
</P>
<P>
 Put it this way: He could become the first player to be voted most valuable 
player and coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Oops, look out, there goes another MVP candidate streaking through the 
exhibit. Barry Sanders of the Detroit Lions could win simply because he is 
giving the football world goose bumps again. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, OK, he doesn't wow everybody. John Randle and Henry Thomas, Viking 
defensive tackles, held Sanders to 16 yards in 12 carries in their first 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the previous week, Sanders had gained 120 yards. In the following week, 
194.  
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving the exhibit, let us not forget Ben Coates, a tight end for the 
New England Patriots who is having a better year than that fellow named Jerry 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 We will stop by the Montana statue on the way out. When you think he is 
finished -- his Kansas City Chiefs totaled six points in consecutive games -- 
Montana throws five touchdown passes in the next two games. 
</P>
<P>
 His retirement is not going to be forced by his knees, but his right arm, 
which one day will permanently lock into a raised position above his head. 
</P>
<P>
 What? You want to visit that dark area over there? You think you see some 
figures you thought had disappeared? 
</P>
<P>
 You must mean quarterback Beuerlein of the Cardinals, victim of the ultimate 
psych job by his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 And look, there's Erric Pegram, the Atlanta running back. 
</P>
<P>
 And my, isn't that Reggie Cobb, the Green Bay Packer running back and biggest 
flop of the year? 
</P>
<P>
 The next time the Pack wants a back from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, they would 
be better off tracking down Lars Tate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the rookies' wing. Don't mind that large man running around 
shouting, "I got a sack! I got a sack! Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah!" 
</P>
<P>
 That's Dan (Big Duddy) Wilkinson of the Bengals, last spring's No. 1 overall 
draft pick who has been this fall's No. 1 overall rookie bust. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally got his first sack on Sunday. Soon, perhaps, opponents will even 
have to start blocking him. 
</P>
<P>
 Other busts include Henry Ford, that Edsel of a defensive end for the Oilers. 
And how about quarterback Heath Shuler of the Redskins? 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about blowing your small-town, apple-pie image with arrogance and 
aversion to hard work! 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Trent Dilfer of the Buccaneers has been any peach. In his first NFL 
start Sunday, he passed for only 24 more yards than the team's punter. 
</P>
<P>
 No rookie has had a more difficult first half, though, than running back Mario 
Bates of the New Orleans Saints. After a splendid training camp, Bates made the 
mistake of visiting a bar with fellow running back Lorenzo Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the NFL tradition that allows veterans to force rookies into 
servitude, Neal asked the rookie for a favor. Bates refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal slugged him, breaking his jaw and forcing him to sit out six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time Mario, five words: Buy the man a drink. 
</P>
<P>
 The best rookies are easier to spot. All of them remind you of somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Faulk, running back for the Indianapolis Colts, is a clone of Thurman 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Langham, cornerback for the Browns, does everything like Deion 
Sanders, except strut. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Williams, tackle for the Eagles, is another Erik Williams. Without the 
Mercedes, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our next stop is the new-gadgets exhibit. We will see such things as the 
two-point conversion and the pregame show from Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Here comes Lonnie Lardner, so we'll hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-point conversion? No effect other than create a new final score of 
11-8. No NFL coach has used it to win a game in the final seconds yet, and none 
will until modern science comes up with a personality transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes in the kicking rules? A big hit. Kick returners have become people 
-- Qadry Ismail is suddenly more popular than his older brother Rocket -- while 
kickers have become ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed enforcement of the no-chucking rule? A big hit with fans who like 
passing yardage and big receivers who like to push off and not be penalized. 
Should be renamed, "The Ben Coates Rule."  
</P>
<P>
 Coach to quarterback radio? A resounding flop. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides huddles by hopelessly confused officials, has there been a more common 
on-field sight this year than a quarterback tapping his helmet and shrugging 
his shoulders because his radio doesn't work? 
</P>
<P>
 The league scoffed at the early report of Matt Rodgers, then quarterback for 
the Buffalo Bills, picking up an order for sausage pizza in his helmet. When 
will they realize those problems are real? 
</P>
<P>
 The new kids from Fox? Sometimes a hit, other times an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The new NFL network shines when breaking stories, or delivering the honest 
opinions of Terry Bradshaw and former coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 It fails by trying to turn the league into a teen magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 As when reporters such as Lardner ask quarterbacks such as Aikman whether a 
woman could ever stop him from playing football. 
</P>
<P>
 Or when reporters such as Lardner accompany linebackers such as the Bears' Joe 
Cain to the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last stop, our futuristic exhibit. No more throwback uniforms. Only throwback 
football: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Here are Deion Sanders and Andre Rison engaging in another Sunday afternoon 
fistfight during Week 9. Not until the police arrive do they remember that 
their teams are having byes.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Here are Reggie White and Sterling Sharpe of the Packers engaging in a 
Sunday afternoon fistfight during Weeks 10, 11 and 12. 
</P>
<P>
 White finally persuades Sharpe to begin caring more about the team than 
himself. Sharpe convinces White that he doesn't talk to the media because he 
doesn't have anything to say. Convinces him in one sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Here are the Chargers hitting rock bottom with a loss to the Raiders on 
Monday night of Week 14. The highlight of the game occurs when officials 
untangle a pile of players and discover Winston Moss shaving Stan Humphries' 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shortly after the Rams play at Tampa Bay in Week 15, the teams board a 
jumbo jet. The plane stops in St. Louis and the Rams get off. It stops again in 
Baltimore and the Buccaneers get off. It then flies to the Bahamas with John 
Shaw giggling all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dallas Cowboys defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XXIX in 
Miami. Switzer's first postgame comment is, "What happened?" He then 
congratulates the Steelers for a fine effort, "particularly that Bradshaw 
fellow." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer is voted coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 And Halas weeps.

NHL PLAYERS TO STAGE EXHIBITIONS FOR CHARITY; HOCKEY: GRETZKY MIGHT PARTICIPATE 
IN TOURNAMENT; OTHERS LOOK TO EUROPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Eager to keep players active during the lockout -- and to polish its image -- 
the NHL Players Assn. will announce today or Thursday that it has arranged a 
tournament to benefit a major charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for Wayne Gretzky, Sergei Fedorov, Doug Gilmour, Pat LaFontaine, 
Alexander Mogilny and other standouts to be invited. So far, the NHLPA has 
booked the Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Canada, on Nov. 10 and 12. At least two 
more games are likely to be staged in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't worked out all the details yet and we're still discussing 
different formats," said Steve McAllister, a spokesman for the NHLPA. 
"Obviously, there will be some game formats, but there could also be skills 
contests. There might be four teams playing against each other or perhaps (NHL 
players) against a team of players from the three junior hockey leagues in 
Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 Players are also scheduled to participate in a game Sunday in Sarnia, Canada, 
to benefit a children's charity. 
</P>
<P>
 No negotiations took place Tuesday, the 25th day of the lockout, but sources 
said talks will resume soon. NHL executives met with referees and linesmen but 
did not determine whether on-ice officials will be paid throughout the 
stoppage. Their checks are to stop after 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHLPA prepared to meet with player agents Thursday in Toronto. The session 
is meant to counteract a package of pro-management documents sent to agents by 
the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've reviewed everything and I see what they're thinking, but I still 
strongly support the union," said Ron Salcer, a prominent agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Salcer said he doesn't expect agents to take an active role in helping settle 
the dispute, as they did in the 10-day player strike in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The procession of players going to Europe shows no sign of stopping, and other 
options might soon be available to them. Swedish Elite League teams, which last 
Saturday voted to oppose signing NHL players to short-term deals during the 
lockout, are asking to reconsider the decision. About a dozen Swedish-born NHL 
players want to play in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Washington defenseman Calle Johansson signed with Kloten of 
the Swiss League, Calgary forward Mikael Nylander agreed to play for Jyvaskyla 
in Finland, Calgary's Robert Reichel and Boston's Jozef Stumpel went to 
Germany, Hartford defenseman Frank Kucera has gone to the Czech Republic and 
Whaler left wing Andrei Nikolishin arranged to play for Moscow Dynamo in his 
native Russia. New York Ranger defenseman Alexander Karpovtsev has also joined 
Moscow Dynamo, where he spent five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger forward Alexei Kovalev is touring with the Russian team Lada Togliatti, 
which is playing a series of games against International Hockey League teams. A 
group of Russian players is planning a five-game tournament in Moscow beginning 
Nov. 4 to benefit minor hockey in their country. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, San Jose Shark right wing Jeff Odgers said he will file for 
unemployment benefits this week. Mighty Duck Don McSween last week became the 
first NHL player known to take advantage of a California law that allows 
locked-out employees to apply for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Odgers, 25, made $225,000 last season and was to make the same amount this 
season. Odgers, married with one child, is eligible for a maximum of $230 per 
week for 26 weeks.

BETWEEN FRIENDS: CONE EDGES KEY IN AL; BASEBALL: ONLY 12 POINTS SEPARATE THE 
FORMER BLUE JAY TEAMMATES IN CY YOUNG AWARD VOTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Jimmy Key, the New York Yankee left-hander, led the major leagues in victories 
in 1994's strike-shortened season, but finished second to David Cone of the 
Kansas City Royals in voting for the American League's Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
 In results announced Tuesday, Cone, who was 16-5 with a 2.94 earned-run 
average, received 15 of 28 first-place votes and 108 points from a committee of 
the Baseball Writers Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Key, who was 17-4 with a 3.27 ERA, got 10 first-place votes and 96 points. He 
also received a $50,000 consolation prize, his contract bonus for finishing 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Key, 35-10 in his two seasons with the Yankees and currently recovering from 
arthroscopic shoulder surgery, said he considered games won the most important 
yardstick for a pitcher "because it's the basis on which we're paid." But he 
also said that he didn't put that much value on the Cy Young and wasn't 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy with the season I had and happy with the season the Yankees had," 
he said, noting his friendship with Cone, a Toronto Blue Jay teammate during 
the final two months of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said the shortened season blemishes the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "The writers were basically voting on the best pitcher over 112 or 113 games," 
Key said. "There were still a lot of important games to be played, a lot of 
time for people to step forward in the games that should be the basis on which 
the award is voted." 
</P>
<P>
 Cone agreed to an extent, saying he will look back with regret on the lost 
opportunity for a Kansas City team that had surged to within four games of the 
lead in the Central Division when the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be much nicer to be pitching Game 3 of the World Series in Kansas 
City tonight," he said. "I'd trade this for that in a heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate the season couldn't be completed, but I don't want to demean 
the award. I may not get the opportunity to win it again, and I feel that I 
produced a significant body of work, no matter how long the season was. I guess 
I'm a little surprised, but I feel that either one of us would have been a 
deserving winner." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the better ERA, Cone struck out 132 in 171 innings, compared to 
Key's 97 in 168; restricted opposing hitters to a .209 average compared to 
Key's .273, and had eight consecutive victories after having lost his first 
start of the year, pitching 28 consecutive scoreless innings in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone said he did it using the "much more efficient style of a Jimmy Key," 
reducing his velocity to cut down on his pitch totals so that he could stay in 
games longer and allow a strong defense to work for him. 
</P>
<P>
 He credited pitching coach Bruce Kison and recently fired manager Hal McRae. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like every time I turned around, there was (second baseman) Chico 
Lind with a smile on his face as if to say, 'Make them hit the ball to me.' The 
light bulb finally went on. I realized I didn't have to do it all myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Cone, 31 and scheduled to be married on Nov. 12, was a disappointing 11-14 in 
1993, his homecoming season with the Royals. He had signed a three-year, 
$18-million contract as a free agent in the same winter that Key signed a 
four-year, $17-million contract with the Yankees after he and Cone had helped 
pitch Toronto to a playoff victory over the Oakland A's and a World Series 
title over the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing Kauffman, the Royals' late owner, urged Cone to return to his hometown 
and, in Cone's words, "rectify the worst trade the Royals ever made." He 
referred to the 1986 deal in which they sent Cone to the New York Mets for 
catcher Ed Hearn, who appeared in 13 games with the Royals before a shoulder 
injury ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone has made 31 or more starts in every season since 1988, when his 20-3 
record with the Mets failed to deprive the Dodgers' Orel Hershiser of the Cy 
Young. Having now won it, he said, "I think this is what Mr. Kauffman 
envisioned when he urged me to come back. I just wish he was here to share it 
with me."

$450 MILLION ISN'T CHICKEN FEED, BUT THAT'S WHAT NHL FAN WANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>

<P>
 Michael Lewicki of Brantford, Canada, makes his living by running a company 
that manufactures plastic chicken cages -- the only firm in the world that 
does, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not a lawyer.But Lewicki, frustrated over the 26-day-old NHL lockout, 
drew up legal papers and on Tuesday sued Commissioner Gary Bettman and NHL 
owners for $450 million (Canadian). 
</P>
<P>
 Lewicki filed a class-action suit in Ontario Court asking for nominal damages 
of $50 million, a minimum of $150 million in actual damages, special damages of 
$100 million and exemplary damages of $150 million. He says he's not joking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious lawsuit," he said. "We take the position that they have 
no defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman and the owners, Lewicki claims, "are no longer mentally competent to 
administer the moneys entrusted to them through the De Facto contract with the 
Plaintiff." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewicki, who said he's acting on behalf of all fans and arena employees, 
contends fans are entitled to compensation for "out of pocket expenses and 
past, ongoing, and future loss of income caused by the Defendants(sic) Gross 
neglect, Misfeasance and 'Unwisdomness.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lewicki also sued the Ottawa Senators and Toronto Maple Leafs. An NHL 
spokesman said the league had received copies of the claims at its New York 
office and they are being reviewed by legal counsel. HELENE ELLIOTT

PRO SOCCER LEAGUE ON HOLD?; FIFA MEETINGS: PLAY MIGHT BE DELAYED UNTIL 1996, 
WHEN OLYMPIC TEAMS WILL BE IN THE NEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Major League Soccer, Alan Rothenberg's proposed first-division league that was 
supposed to begin operations in April, probably will be put on hold for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that the league's debut might be postponed had been voiced in 
the past, but took on added significance Tuesday when Rothenberg admitted a 
delay is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 That the U.S. Soccer Federation's president, who earned $7 million as chairman 
and chief executive officer of World Cup '94, would make such a statement at a 
time when FIFA leaders are in town, suggests MLS will not get off the ground 
April 15 as promised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the later in the game it gets, the more you have to analyze 
whether to start in 1995 or 1996," Rothenberg said, adding that there is a 
possibility the league kickoff will be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to be able to make an announcement within the next 10 days or two 
weeks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the MLS business plan provided to prospective investors, the 
anticipated 12 teams already should have been announced, should have signed 
stadium contracts and should have been actively seeking coaches, players and 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, no official announcement has been made since June 15, when charter 
franchises were awarded to Los Angeles, Boston, New York, New Jersey, San Jose, 
Washington, D.C., and Columbus, Ohio. At the time, Rothenberg said five more 
would be awarded by September or thereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 But although it has several large investors and a television contract, the 
proposed league has not been able to generate enough financial investment to 
allow it to name any more franchises. It is believed to have scaled back from 
12 teams to 10 and to be working to complete stadium contracts in those 10 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg would not discuss MLS financial affairs, saying only that legal 
documents were being circulated for signature and that an announcement would be 
forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 If MLS does delay until 1996, it would mean trying to generate interest in a 
new venture during an Olympic year, when the public's sporting attention will 
be firmly focused on the Atlanta Games. 
</P>
<P>
 That could be either a hindrance or a help. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men's and women's soccer will be a medal sport in 1996 and the U.S. teams 
will be receiving more attention than usual, so that could help MLS. But it is 
just as likely the league would have to go into hiatus during the Games or risk 
vanishing from sight altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic soccer was the main item of business for FIFA leaders on the first day 
of their scheduled three days of meetings in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic Committee of world soccer's governing body met for two hours in 
the afternoon to hear what amounted to a progress report on plans for the men's 
and women's tournaments at the Atlanta Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, key committee members had spent six days touring Atlanta and each of 
the outlying sites where soccer will be played -- the Orange Bowl in Miami; RFK 
Stadium in Washington, D.C.; the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Fla.; Legion Field in 
Birmingham, Ala., and Sanford Stadium in Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 They came away satisfied that soccer in 1996 will be as powerful a draw as it 
was in the 1984 Games, when attendance surpassed 1.4 million, the best of any 
Olympic sport. The only recommendations by FIFA were that Birmingham would have 
to replace its artificial surface with grass and that the hedges would have to 
be trimmed in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than those gardening notes, all seemed well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very far along in comparison to World Cup '94," said Sandra Cress, 
Olympic competition director for soccer. "It didn't even have its sites picked 
at this point in time, so (FIFA members) were very impressed with the local 
preparation that's already under way." 
</P>
<P>
 The men's and women's tournaments will be played as parallel competitions, 
featuring double-headers in many cases. Women's soccer, an Olympic sport for 
the first time, will be an eight-nation event. The United States, as the host, 
qualifies automatically. The seven other participants will be the top seven 
finishers in the second FIFA Women's World Championship in Sweden next June. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's tournament will feature 16 countries -- five from Europe, three from 
Africa, three from North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), 
including the United States; two from South America, two from Asia, and one to 
emerge from a playoff between Asia and Oceania. 
</P>
<P>
 The European under-21 championship tournament, now in progress and involving 
43 nations, will provide the five teams from that continent. In other regions, 
qualifying play has yet to begin, although early favorite Brazil already has 
put together its team and defeated Chile last week in Concepcion, Chile, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by FIFA's Executive Committee on Thursday, the Atlanta Games will 
be the first in which sudden death will be used to settle tied games after the 
first round. There will be no fixed overtime period and no use of penalty kicks 
as tiebreakers. Instead, the first goal scored in overtime will end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "golden goal" had been proposed by FIFA General Secretary Joseph 
(Sepp) Blatter after the Brazil-Italy World Cup final at the Rose Bowl in July 
had to be decided by penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 As for television coverage, the fact that NBC does not have a cable affiliate 
such as ABC's link with ESPN, means that soccer could suffer from little or no 
exposure, as was the case in 1984 when ABC ignored the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cress said organizers are working to make NBC programming executives more 
aware of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nationally, NBC already has got an extensive idea of what they plan to 
broadcast," she said. "They go with the big eight (sports), it's pretty 
formulaic, but we're working very hard to try to get soccer on the program and 
in their minds. Certainly, ABC's (rating) numbers from the World Cup are a big 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 Between now and 1996, Cress said, work will continue to build interest in 
soccer in the five venues, especially the smaller cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have cities like Birmingham and Athens that have never hosted an 
international soccer match," she said. "So we have to work with U.S. Soccer to 
sow some seeds and get (the cities) a little more educated in the sport and get 
their level of interest up." 
</P>
<P>
 One way will be to have the U.S. national and/or Olympic teams play games in 
the Olympic cities, Cress said.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; ST. LOUIS GROUP MAY MAKE FINAL OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former U.S. Senator Thomas Eagleton, who is heading St. Louis' efforts to land 
an NFL team, said Tuesday that he'll make one more proposal to the Rams in 
early November, and it might be the city's last offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope (this is the last proposal)," Eagleton said. "We're at the 
beginning of the fourth quarter (of negotiations), and the game ends 
Thanksgiving. I'm running out of gas. I don't know if (Ram President) John Shaw 
is, but I have other things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he was getting impatient with the Rams, who have been discussing 
relocation deals with Baltimore and St. Louis since last winter, Eagleton said, 
"No, not me personally. But you listen to the sports talk shows, and you can 
sense a degree of anxiety among people here. They want an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton has been in close contact with the Rams since their 4 1/2-hour 
meeting in Los Angeles Oct. 12. He said he and Shaw are trying to iron out the 
"many, many differences" that Eagleton said arose in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we took our basic proposal to the Rams, they had certain things they 
wanted improved," Eagleton said. "We have to see how many we can improve. Some, 
we will not be able to improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton would not discuss specific details of the proposal, but in addition 
to offering the Rams virtually all revenue from a new, 70,000-seat domed 
stadium, St. Louis officials have said they will attempt to raise $60 million 
to $90 million through a permanent-seat licensing program to cover the Rams' 
costs associated with a move. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Kerth, a spokesman for Civic Progress, a coalition of representatives from 
26 of the area's largest companies, would not confirm a report that the group 
will guarantee sales in the seat-licensing campaign.

RIORDAN, FERRARO WANT TO EXPLORE STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and City Council President John Ferraro have 
told NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue that they are ready to "jointly explore 
options with you" on providing a stadium as a permanent home for the Super Bowl 
and an NFL theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 The language in the Oct. 17 letter to Tagliabue released by Riordan's office 
was not clear as to whether Riordan and Ferraro thought a new stadium, as 
proposed Oct. 2 by Tagliabue, is feasible, or whether they hope to use a 
renovated Coliseum, with luxury boxes added, as the stadium in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan was unavailable to explain what was meant in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer said, "The mayor unambiguously feels the 
Coliseum is the crown jewel of sports. This letter written with John Ferraro is 
really to leave the door open to the NFL's interest in our city as to a place 
to come to the Super Bowl many, many times in the future. That's all this was." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro said in interviews that improving the Coliseum is more feasible than 
building a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to have a brand new stadium somewhere, but where do we get 
it?" Ferraro asked. "As tough as the revenue situation is with the city and the 
county, I don't see any money coming (available). . . . And to build a stadium 
in the city of Los Angeles, to find the necessary amount of land to do it, 
without any opposition from homeowners or others, would be very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 A close associate of Riordan, Steven L. Soboroff, president of the city's 
Recreation and Parks Commission, said he was present at a meeting at Hollywood 
Park in early summer at which Riordan told Raider owner Al Davis and R.D. 
Hubbard, chairman of Hollywood Park, that parcels adjacent to the track were 
outside the city, and the mayor did not favor a new stadium there. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro said, and other sources confirmed, that the Coliseum Commission is 
considering building perhaps 40 luxury boxes on the Coliseum rim for the 1995 
season, even if Davis does not sign a long-term contract to play in the 
facility. Boxes might also make the stadium more appealing to the NFL for a 
Super Bowl, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, for now, has shown no readiness for serious negotiations on a long-term 
contract, Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources said that at a meeting on Oct. 3 between Coliseum negotiator Don 
C. Webb and Davis, the Raider owner was unwilling to even say what he wants in 
Coliseum improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders did not return a call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Ferraro's letter to Tagliabue characterized the commissioner's 
Oct. 2 comments about putting the Super Bowl in a new stadium in the Los 
Angeles area on a rotating basis, perhaps every other year, as "very 
encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 "We share your optimism that such a commitment by the NFL could form a unique 
public-private partnership yielding an unprecedented level of innovation in the 
funding of stadium capital improvements," the two wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The manner in which the Los Angeles Coliseum was quickly restored from the 
devastation inflicted by the Northridge Earthquake demonstrates the city's 
commitment to enhancing an environment which is friendly toward sports and 
other businesses," the letter continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "But even though the Los Angeles Coliseum has undergone a transformation 
which, given the circumstances, was arguably more challenging than the 
construction of a new stadium, we agree that all options in the city should be 
objectively evaluated. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "We look forward to working with you and members of the NFL to ensure the 
development of a plan which carries the NFL and the City of Los Angeles forward 
well into the next century," Riordan and Ferraro concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Brown, a spokesman for the NFL, said Tuesday that Tagliabue sent a reply 
to the letter on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them we are continuing to assess various aspects of the stadium 
matters internally and we would be in touch with them or their staffs as we 
proceeded," Brown said.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; BAILEY'S RETURN QUESTIONED BY SUPERVISOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Bailey's 103-yard punt return for a touchdown against the Saints on 
Sunday should have been negated by a penalty because players had come off the 
sidelines onto the field, The Times-Picayune of New Orleans quoted a supervisor 
of officials as saying  
</P>
<P>
 "Both of the teams were out there illegally," Leo Miles told The 
Times-Picayune. He watched the game as the league's official observer in the 
Superdome press box. 
</P>
<P>
 League rules state that the penalty for such a double foul where there is a 
change in possession requires that the ball be returned to the point where the 
infraction occurred. Under those guidelines, Bailey's run would have ended 
somewhere near the Ram's 15-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL would not make an official statement about the play until the office 
of Miles and NFL director of officiating Jerry Seeman had a chance to review 
videotapes.

SENIOR PGA EVENT COMING TO ORANGE COUNTY; GOLF: TOURNAMENT, WHICH RECENTLY 
FOUND A SPONSOR, WILL BE HELD IN MARCH AT MESA VERDE IN COSTA MESA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Andersen's long sought-after goal of a pro golf tournament in Orange 
County seemed doomed in April when the title sponsor dropped out at the last 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 With another sponsor secured, Andersen, executive director of the Orange 
County Sports Assn., Tuesday announced the first Toshiba Classic, a Senior PGA 
event that will be held March 13-19 at Mesa Verde Country Club in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen and Ric Clarson of the Senior Tour said that five months is a 
comparatively short time, but they are confident course reconstruction now 
under way will be completed and supplemental sponsors will be signed on in 
time. And they weren't concerned about competition from two other Senior events 
in the Southland -- the Ralphs Senior Classic at Rancho Park, which concluded 
Sunday, and the FHP Seniors Classic at Ojai, which will be held two weeks 
before the new event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now at the point where it's clear Orange County is its own market when 
it comes to professional sports," Clarson, a former University of Florida 
basketball player, said Tuesday at Anaheim Stadium. "The impact on the Rancho 
Park and Ojai events is none. The title sponsors for all three events are based 
in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN will air the tournament daily. Prize money will be $800,000 in the first 
year and $1 million for 1996 and '97. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen and Senior Tour officials looked at a number of sites before settling 
on Mesa Verde, which was host to the last PGA stop in Orange County -- the 
late, great Haig Open won by Bob Dickson in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working on this for about four years," Clarson said. "We took our 
first look at this market in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
 A deal appeared done in April, but it fell through when the company that was 
lined up to sponsor the event was sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County hasn't played host to a pro golf event since the Los Coyotes 
LPGA Classic in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen said he hoped he could bring the LPGA back to the county, perhaps for 
a September date, in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the county of Orange is due for some good sports news," Andersen 
said, referring to the demise of the OCSA's Pigskin Classic college football 
game in August, the threat of the Rams' departure, the baseball strike and the 
hockey lockout.

NORTHRIDGE CUTS ITS LIST OF OPTIONS; BUDGET: DECISION ON ATHLETIC PROGRAM'S 
MAKEUP COULD COME WITHIN THREE WEEKS. DIVISION II CONSIDERED WORST-CASE 
POSSIBILITY. 
</P>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge administrators on Tuesday narrowed a list of budgetary 
options to "four or five" and have begun studying in detail the impact of 
looming cuts in the school's athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Athletic Director Bob Hiegert met Tuesday with Ron Kopita and three 
athletics administrators to reduce a list of scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita, the school's dean of students, said a decision on the makeup of the 
athletic program for 1995 and beyond could be reached over the next three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita said one proposal, "was to continue at status quo, and the rest deal 
with cuts of one type or another." Kopita and Hiegert declined to identify 
which programs were targeted for possible elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert was reassured by Kopita that the school is committed to remaining in 
Division I, the level at which the program has competed for the past five 
years. Dropping to Division II has been considered a worst-case possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kopita: "From my perspective, I'm not at all interested in (Division 
II)." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert and Kopita said they hope to meet next week with President Blenda J. 
Wilson to begin laying out funding options. Wilson is out of town this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A wild card in the scenarios is whether the department's funding from the 
University Corporation, formerly called the Foundation, will be eliminated in 
1995-96. Athletics received $439,000 from the Corporation last year and 
$282,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletics has been told it might not receive any Corporation funds next year. 
Wilson essentially controls the Corporation purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding malaise results from the defeat of an athletic referendum last 
week. Had students voted in favor of the proposal, it would have generated 
$2.25 million annually for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Students, which staged the election, discussed at its Senate 
meeting Tuesday whether the results should be declared invalid because of 
problems associated with the touch-tone voting process. Many students did not 
receive their mailed Personal Identification Numbers in time to participate in 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Cerna, a student senator who didn't receive his PIN code until two 
days after the election, didn't find many allies. Most of the senators felt 
that the 4,431 students who voted -- a school record -- was a representative 
amount. The measure failed by 199 votes. Northridge had an enrollment of 24,378 
as of Sept. 19.

CHAMINADE PLAYS FOLLOW THE LEADER; EAGLES HIRE BACA AMID HOPES HE EVENTUALLY 
WILL BE JOINED BY SEVERAL OF HIS PLAYERS FROM CHAMPION LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Chaminade High has secured the services of the man who heads the "Most Wanted 
List" in Northridge, hiring Larry Baca to coach its freshman baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca relishes the challenge, but he must fit it in among his family, his 
business and a social calendar that has been in a whirl since he piloted the 
Northridge Little League team to the national championship in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason they were after me is that a lot of kids from the Little League 
team will go to Chaminade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good ballplayers potentially will go there that could give them the strongest 
team in the area in a few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade Athletic Director Ed Croson said that Baca, 49, was hired because of 
his coaching ability, not his drawing power. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a proven winner, he can lead kids," Croson said. "Anything else . . . 
is icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Baca's three years as an American Legion coach are probably more useful than 
his having coached the nation's best band of 12-year-olds. And most of his 15 
years as a Little League coach have been spent at the 15-year-old level, the 
age of most freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not only Chaminade that wishes to capitalize on Baca's baseball 
knowledge. He has been hired as a technical adviser to teach baseball 
fundamentals to the actors in "Three Wishes," a feature film starring Patrick 
Swayze. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Baca, assistant coach George Saul and several players from the 
Northridge team, completed an instructional video titled, "The Earthquake Kids" 
that will be available for holiday shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old movers and shakers will remain in the spotlight at least 
through New Years Day, when they will ride atop the Arco float in the Rose 
Parade. As something of a warm-up, they rode in the recent Verdugo Days parade. 
</P>
<P>
 And they will be featured Saturday at the Rose Bowl during the halftime show 
of the football game between UCLA and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 High school is just around the corner for many of the Northridge players. 
</P>
<P>
 Team members Nathaniel Dunlap, Justin Gentile, Spencer Gordon, Jonathan 
Higashi and Michael Nesbit are eighth-graders at Chaminade Middle School.  
</P>
<P>
 They probably will attend Chaminade High, and others might join them now that 
Baca has been hired.

LOS ALAMITOS; ARABIANS WILL TAKE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This weekend will be one of the biggest of the year for Arabian racing at Los 
Alamitos with four stakes, among them the $190,000 Drinkers of the Wind 
Futurity, the richest Arabian race in history, on Friday night and the $142,000 
Daughters of the Desert Futurity on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the trials are any indication of how things will go in the final, the 
Daughters of the Desert Futurity will be a close race between CR Angel Kate and 
Tigress Lass, each of whom won her trial impressively. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of two trials on Oct. 13, CR Angel Kate defeated the six-horse 
field by 11 1/4 lengths. The winning time was 1:22 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "She won by more than we wanted her to," trainer Felix Payne said. "We took it 
real easy on the backside, and let her run about the last eighth of a mile. We 
felt she could win it easy, but I had to let her run so she wouldn't get any 
bad habits in the lane, like looking at the crowd, or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 CR Angel Kate hasn't had much opportunity to develop bad habits. The trial was 
only her second race. She was coupled in that event with CR Angel Jackie, who 
was also making her second start and qualified for the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the main deal for them," said Payne, who has been preparing the 
fillies for the Daughters of the Desert since May. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Payne started four fillies in the trials and qualified all four. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, I get a lot of run out of mares," Payne said. "Mares run 
good for me. I've set track records with colts, but never had a big stakes 
colt, for some reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Payne's best mares have been Sam Cherie, who holds the 1 1/16-mile 
track record at Los Alamitos, and HF Orzonna. HF Orzonna competed in the 
Daughters of the Desert last year, finishing second to Unchainedd Melody, 
eventual Darley horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne trained quarter horses for 21 years before switching to Arabians seven 
years ago, and for him, there is no comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just fell in love with these horses," he said. "The more time you spend 
with them, the more they give you back. These Arabians are just so intelligent. 
You get attached to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Tigress Lass, trained by Roger Werneth and ridden by Elaina Sheridan, won the 
second trial by five lengths in 1:22 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Like CR Angel Kate, Tigress Lass was racing for the second time, having won 
her debut by 21 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a bear," Payne said of his competition. "We've got our work cut out for 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we're shaping up to be the bridesmaid again, but it's going to 
be a nice race. The pressure is already mounting." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Yancey Carter Jr. might also be feeling a little pressure. He has 
qualified Seyvilla Tribaske for the Daughters of the Desert and BPA Cilantro 
for the Drinkers of the Wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter will be trying to win the Daughters of the Desert for the second 
consecutive time, having won last year with Unchainedd Melody. A victory would 
also put Carter back in the running for trainer of the year, an award he has 
won an unprecedented three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like our chances," Carter said. "We realize there are other outstanding 
fillies out there. Hopefully, (Seyvilla Tribaske) will put it together on the 
night it matters most." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Carter has already won the Daughters of the Desert, he has never won 
the Drinkers of the Wind. The only horse he ever started in the race was TC 
Tomahawk, who finished second. BPA Cilantro could give him his first Drinkers 
of the Wind victory this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "(BPA Cilantro) was the only maiden to qualify," Carter said. "It's a big hill 
for him to climb, trying to beat winners. But these futurities, it's an honor 
just getting in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Abigail Kawanankoa's Time For Royal Cash posted the fastest qualifying time 
for the Golden State Derby for quarter horses, winning her trial last Friday 
night by 1 1/2 lengths in 21.65 seconds. Other qualifiers for the final Nov. 5: 
Artesias Special Gal, Dream A Secret, The Money Crunch, The Royal Prince, 
Rainbow Sun, Moo Vin First, Untamed Heart, Her First Cin and Le Ritz.

COMPROMISE PROPOSED ON NCAA ELIGIBILITY; COLLEGES: KNIGHT COMMISSION WANTS TO 
RAISE REQUIREMENTS, BUT IT ALSO MAKES EXCEPTIONS. JOHN THOMPSON SAYS, "THE 
ISSUE IS POOR PEOPLE." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A commission on intercollegiate athletics endorsed a plan Tuesday that would 
raise basic academic eligibility requirements for college-bound athletes but 
would allow some exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to complaints from African-American coaches, the Knight Foundation 
Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics advocated a plan that would allow some 
students who do not meet basic scholastic requirements to receive scholarships 
and practice -- but not to play with the team -- as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Many black coaches have argued that the new academic standards are unfair, 
pointing to studies showing that students from poorer families do not perform 
as well on the standard tests used to determine whether a high school student 
is eligible for college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knight Commission is an independent group of 21 academic, business and 
athletic leaders, including 14 present or former university or college chief 
executives. The plan the panel endorsed is a compromise between NCAA standards 
adopted in the mid-1980s and new requirements scheduled to take effect in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Under existing rules, prospective college athletes must score at least 700 on 
the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 17 on the American College Test and have a 2.0 
grade-point average -- a C -- in 11 core high school courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules, approved at last year's NCAA convention, would toughen 
standards and provide a sliding scale for eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a student scoring 700 on the SAT or 17 on the ACT would need a 
high school grade-point average of 2.5 or better in 13 core courses. If test 
scores were 900 on the SAT or a 21 on the ACT, the student would need a 
grade-point average of only 2.0 in the core courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise plan, which has the support of many NCAA officials, would 
maintain the new requirements but would make exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, students who have grade-point averages of at least 2.5 but who 
did not achieve the minimum 700 SAT or 17 ACT scores could accept scholarships 
and practice with a team as freshmen. They could not play until the following 
year, however, and then only if their college grades met NCAA requirements. 
They would be permitted to participate in athletics only for three years.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which goes before the NCAA for approval in January, was offered in 
response to studies showing that the standard tests give an advantage to 
students from higher-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight Commission members defended their decision to endorse the higher 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Knight Commission has unbounded faith that all young athletes, including 
African-American athletes, will rise to meet the challenge of higher standards 
in the same way they have met challenges on the field," said Father Theodore 
Hesburgh, commission co-chairman and president emeritus of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also issued a statement stressing that it believes in the 
integrity of standard test scores, noting that there are more black 
student-athletes than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 "SAT (or ACT) test scores are more effective than high school grade-point 
averages in predicting graduation rates for student athletes," the statement 
said. "However, the best predictor for both African-American and white students 
is a combination of the two." 
</P>
<P>
 Some college coaches were disturbed by the statement, saying that the issue is 
far more complicated than simply "raising the bar" on test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "These so-called high standards have eliminated more well-qualified people 
than they are letting in," said John Thompson, basketball coach at Georgetown. 
"The issue is not black people. The issue is poor people, of which black people 
happen to be an awful lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Black Coaches Assn. executive director Rudy Washington, basketball coach at 
Drake University, had no comment on the Knight Commission's statement.

NORTHRIDGE LINEMAN RELEASED ON $100,000 BAIL; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BEAUREGARD 
PRACTICES AFTER SPENDING A WEEK IN JAIL IN RANCHO CUCAMONGA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jonathan Beauregard was released from jail early Tuesday morning after posting 
$100,000 bail, and hours later the Cal State Northridge football player 
attended a team practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old lineman had been in custody at the West Valley Detention 
Center in Rancho Cucamonga since his arraignment last Wednesday in San 
Bernardino County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, a two-year starter at offensive guard, is charged with two counts 
of attempted murder. He has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is here and in practice and still on the team," Northridge Coach Bob Burt 
said. "His status has not changed. His practice today was nothing out of the 
ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was never suspended from the football team, but he missed three 
weeks of practice and two games because of a spiral fracture he suffered in 
practice on Oct. 4. On Tuesday he practiced with the middle fingers of his 
right hand taped. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge officials allowed Beauregard to remain on the team, stating that 
students accused of criminal behavior are presumed innocent until proven 
otherwise. Beauregard originally hid his arrest from coaches and teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Beauregard had been sidelined with an injury, he hasn't lost his 
starting spot. He has plenty of time to recover, however. Northridge (3-4) is 
idle this week and next plays Southern Utah in Cedar City, Utah, on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite spending the past six days behind bars, Beauregard cruised through 
wind sprints and blocking drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in pretty good shape before," he said. "I'm all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard said he planned to spend his time after practice Tuesday catching 
up on his schoolwork. He intends to return to class today. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard is accused of shooting his former girlfriend and her male 
acquaintance outside a San Bernardino bar on Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 One provision of his bail is that he have no contact with either of the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 George Ashwoot of Greenwood Bail Bonds in San Bernardino confirmed that his 
company provided Beauregard's bond but would not give details of how it was 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I posted the bond myself, but it's confidential how he came up with the 
money," Ashwoot said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino Deputy Dist. Atty. Dwight Moore seemed surprised Tuesday 
afternoon to hear Beauregard was out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an awful lot of money for a student to come up with," Moore said. 
"It's a substantial amount, but obviously there's some money in the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard's attorney, Grover L. Porter, did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing in which attorneys may discuss a plea bargain is set for Nov. 4. At 
that time a preliminary hearing date may also be set.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CONGRESS; DORNAN CHALLENGES FOE'S CLAIMS OF SPOUSAL 
ABUSE; THE CONGRESSMAN AND HIS WIFE ARE SUING DEMOCRAT MIKE FARBER OVER 
ALLEGATIONS MADE IN CAMPAIGN MAILERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, Rep. Robert K. Dornan has eagerly attacked the moral character of 
various political adversaries, from his weakest election rivals to the 
President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, it is the pugnacious Republican's reputation that is being assailed, 
and he doesn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Farber, Dornan's Democratic opponent in central Orange County's 46th 
Congressional District, has used excerpts from old court records in campaign 
mailers that accuse the conservative incumbent of having physically attacked 
his wife, Sallie Dornan, on numerous occasions over 16 years beginning in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Dornans say Farber's allegations are lies. On Tuesday they filed a libel 
lawsuit against Farber and said they will seek a court order to prevent him 
from speaking about them or including them in campaign material. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are basically false allegations," said the Dornans' attorney, Kelly 
Woolsey. As a result of the Farber campaign mailers, "Bob Dornan is getting 
death threats. . . . It's causing a lot of embarrassment and humiliation to the 
children," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The spousal abuse charges are not new. They were long the topic of whispers in 
political circles until last year, when the Dornan family, in a series of 
interviews with The Times, offered its own explanation of the court records. 
</P>
<P>
 In a story published in June, 1993, Dornan, wife Sallie and their children all 
said there was no spousal abuse by the congressman and insisted that the 
allegations were a result of drug abuse by Sallie Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, for the first time in Dornan's 16-year congressional career, the 
domestic violence allegations have become a campaign issue as the Nov. 8 
election approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with a lilac-colored card that landed Oct. 15 in the mailboxes of 
Republican and independent voters in central Orange County, and continuing with 
another campaign mailer arriving in the district today, Farber has delivered a 
one-two punch that attempts to make Dornan's moral character the issue of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congressman Bob Dornan was jailed for beating his wife," the first mailer 
claimed. "Would you vote for a man who beats his wife?" 
</P>
<P>
 The second campaign piece alleges there were others who also were on the 
receiving end of Dornan's temper, including an unnamed "gentleman" whom Farber, 
quoting court documents, alleges suffered "severe, permanent and disabling 
injuries" after an assault by Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer also alleges that "in at least two separate incidents, an irate 
Congressman Dornan physically attacked and verbally assaulted two other members 
on the floor of the House of Representatives." 
</P>
<P>
 One widely reported incident involved Dornan grabbing the shirt and tie of 
then-Rep. Tom Downey (D-N.Y.) during a 1985 confrontation between the two, 
after Dornan called Downey "a draft-dodging wimp." The other incident involved 
a 1992 shouting match between Dornan and Rep. W.G. (Bill) Hefner (D-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan has decided not to comment further on the issue, choosing to respond 
with the lawsuit and a campaign mailer sent to voters late last week, which 
consists of a letter signed by his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan's lawsuit claims Farber took the spousal abuse charges -- which have 
since been recanted by Sallie Dornan -- and "intentionally and maliciously" 
reprinted and distributed them in his campaign mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan's lawyer said she will ask a judge today for a restraining order to 
keep Farber from using the information in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber's campaign said the lawsuit is an attempt by Dornan to hide from his 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's remarkable to me that Bob Dornan, the champion of sleaze, could be so 
thin-skinned," said Farber campaign spokesman Scott Moxley. "He does not want 
anybody to see the court records. You can't blame him, because it's a pretty 
ugly picture of his past." 
</P>
<P>
 Farber's attacks pose political peril for his own campaign because the 
statement about Dornan's alleged jailing may have gone beyond what is contained 
in court and police documents. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times review last year of court records showed that in June, 1966, a judge 
found Dornan guilty of a "violent attack" on his wife and ordered him to jail. 
But police records showed no evidence that the sentence was carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The record is quite clear: The judge issued multiple restraining orders and 
removed (child) custody from him and sentenced him to jail," Moxley said. "If 
he didn't serve (the jail sentence), why didn't he? That's something for him to 
explain." 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for all the speculation stems from the Dornan case files, which 
contain four aborted divorce suits between 1960 and 1976. Among the records are 
detailed allegations by the Garden Grove congressman's wife that he beat her, 
"dragged her about the home . . . by her hair . . . (and) exhibited a 
revolver." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Sallie Dornan admitted in an interview with The Times that she 
perjured herself in court, saying she fabricated the charges against her 
husband because she was severely addicted to Darvon and Valium, prescription 
medications. With the backing of their children, the Dornans granted The Times 
access to private medical and police records to confirm their version of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 After the story appeared, Dornan attacked it, saying he cooperated only after 
feeling "threatened" by The Times' decision to do the story. When the article 
focused on his wife, rather than him, he said, it "ceased to be a legitimate 
story, certainly not front-page news." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, ironically, Dornan is using the story to attack Farber and is offering 
copies of the Times article to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber, a San Diego businessman who moved to Santa Ana to run for the 
congressional seat, said he does not believe the Dornans' story. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference Oct. 15 to unveil his first campaign "hit" piece, 
Farber emphasized he was attacking the character of the congressman, not of his 
wife, whom he described as a domestic violence victim trying to help save her 
husband's political career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Sallie Dornan is a fine person, a good mother, and in this case, an 
excellent spouse," Farber said. That statement was repeated in the follow-up 
campaign piece mailed this week to all district voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Sallie Dornan, who has been married to the congressman for 39 years, 
doesn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used me to get Bob. That is a coward. That is a man of no integrity and no 
honor," she said during an interview Tuesday. "I am tired of turning my guts 
out and my kids' guts out." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he is employing the same aggressive campaign tactics he has 
criticized Dornan for using, the Democratic candidate replied: "This is the 
type of approach you have to have with Bob Dornan: head to head, man to man." 
</P>
<P>
 In his campaign mailings, Farber is offering voters copies of records from Los 
Angeles Superior Court, where the cases were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Dornan campaign mailer, Sallie Dornan offers a brief description of 
events that occurred more than three decades ago, which began, she said, when 
she underwent three major surgeries that led to the development of the drug 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "In poor health, my judgment impaired, I made terrible decisions and false 
accusations against my husband," the campaign mailer states. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also explains her husband's loud outbursts. "My husband makes some 
people angry because he fights passionately and forcefully for our beliefs, but 
everything his opponent says is a lie. He has never harmed me," the letter by 
Sallie Dornan claims. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Sallie Dornan said that "every woman should be so lucky" to 
have a husband who stands by his family. "There's all kinds of abuse, and I 
abused him" by making false allegations, she said.

OFFICIALS FUME OVER TAX GLITCH; GOVERNMENT: FAILURE TO PUT ASSESSMENT APPEALS 
DATA INTO COMPUTER SYSTEM WILL GET 179 PROPERTY OWNERS OFF THE HOOK FOR AT 
LEAST $1.7 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The county's bungling of property assessment appeals will get 179 homeowners 
and businesses off the hook for at least $1.7 million in taxes, and the 
financial impact could eventually be much greater, county officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider also revealed that a 
newly installed county computer system aimed at automating the appeals process 
could have prevented the bureaucratic snafu had data been put into the system. 
Instead, the computer went unused after July because the Assessment Board clerk 
said she didn't have enough staff to log the information. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this moment (we are) trying to understand the magnitude of the problem and 
suggest changes in procedure and policies that will prevent this from occurring 
in the future," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary review of the problem, he said, found that the county failed to 
review at least 179 property-tax assessment appeals before their statutory 
two-year deadline expired. As a result the county will have to accept the 
owners' estimates of the property value. Schneider said the review is 
continuing, and there may be additional cases in which the deadline has 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 179 parcels that were confirmed, the county tax assessor's value for 
all the properties was $446,304,991 compared to the property owners' value of 
$272,466,511 -- resulting in a difference of taxable property of $173,838,480 
for 1992. Using the basic 1% property tax rate, the one-year loss of revenue to 
governmental agencies is $1,738,384.  
</P>
<P>
 The county's share of that revenue would have been 6%, or $104,300. The rest 
of the lost tax money would have gone to local schools, cities, special 
districts and other governmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the property owners who will see their assessments adjusted are the 
Irvine Co., the company's head Donald Bren, Mola Development Corp. and Olen 
Properties. The amount of the adjustments varied, from as little as a few 
thousand dollars to as much as $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said that it is likely that the owners' values of their 
properties may be on the tax rolls for a couple of years, resulting in further 
revenue losses. The county's attorneys are researching how soon the county will 
be able to reassess those property values, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's board meeting, some members of the Board of Supervisors vented 
their frustrations over the situation and called for a thorough review of the 
mishap. No county official has been willing to take responsibility for the 
problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "Who is at the wheel?" asked Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. "Who is on the 
watch? . . . Clearly, there was a breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
 The foul-up came to light last week when county officials discovered they had 
lost a multimillion dollar assessment appeal on several properties owned by the 
Bank of America because the statutory two-year review deadline had expired 
before a hearing was held. County officials said as much as $3 million in taxes 
could be lost in that case alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since that discovery, the county has reviewed hundreds of cases, trying to 
determine whether the deadline has lapsed in other cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the county's tax assessor, who reviews the appeals and the clerk of 
the assessment board, who schedules the hearings, have blamed each other for 
the mishap. Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs has been out of the office and largely 
unavailable since last week. He also has directed his staff not to discuss the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen any correspondence, any writing, any communiques of any sort 
explaining anything," an angry Vasquez said about Jacobs. "I would think that 
to an elected official, accountability is one of those things that you would 
take initiative of and at least try to publicly inform people about what's been 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez also pressed Phyllis Henderson, the clerk of the assessment board, for 
answers. He said he wanted to know why nobody had been imputing information 
into an automated assessment appeal computer since it came on-line July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think accountability and responsibility is very, very important in this 
process," he said. "Some of these episodes suggest that maybe there has been a 
lack of process, a lack of accountability and perhaps a lack of 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the board approved 2.5% salary raises for both Henderson 
and Jacobs. Henderson earns $62,129 a year, and Jacobs makes $100,214. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner called for an overhaul of the appeals process so 
that there is a definite chain-of-command and "centralized authority and 
responsibility" for handling the appeal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said the issue has upset him and many of his 
constituents because property taxes hit close to home. "Everyone is talking 
about it," he said, "because everyone relates to their own property taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 When the real estate market faltered in the early 1990s, tens of thousands of 
Orange County property owners requested new assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point last year, the county faced a backlog of 68,000 appeals. The 
backlog prompted supervisors to hire more assessment workers and add a third 
appeals board. The actions made a dent in the backlog, but the county still 
must deal with 36,000 appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the appeals board said that the hearing process could be 
run more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah L. Catz, a Laguna Beach attorney who has served on one of the county's 
three assessment appeals boards since March, said she noticed a decline in the 
number of cases the board has heard over the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Fall is usually the assessment boards' busy season because the deadline for 
many assessment appeals is in September, she said. In previous years, boards 
have worked as many as 16 days in September holding appeals hearings, she said. 
This September, however, her appeals board worked less than eight full days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, September is crazy. The board works four days a week. It's booked," 
she said. "This September was very slow." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Pierce, a Huntington Beach resident and appeals board member, said the 
hearing process has been slowed because the assessor's office doesn't usually 
review the appeals until hearings are scheduled. Often, the assessor's office 
and property owners agree on parcel valuations. This means that by the time the 
hearing is held many items on the board agenda have already been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine out of 10 times, everything has been (resolved) . . . when the (board) 
gets it," he said. "We end up having very short" hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the appeals process could be quickened if county officials previewed 
the appeals before they are put on the board agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Catz and Pierce said that one factor slowing down the appeal boards' work 
is a staffing shortage at the board clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Pierce said, the clerk's office had just one staffer to compile 
agendas for all three hearing boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a cloud over the assessor's and clerk's office," Catz said. "I think 
the silver lining is that because of this, the (offices) will get more support 
staff and the citizens of the county will get their cases heard more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Mary Aileen Matheis, however, said that the hearing process has 
improved since the board increased the assessor's staff last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear which government agencies would be hurt most if the county 
is forced to refund millions of dollars in tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has collected more than $2 billion in property tax revenues this 
year, according to the county auditor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 1994-95 fiscal year, school districts will receive more than 60% of 
the tax revenue. Cities will receive 11% and the county is set to get 10%, 
according to Neil Gruber, an official in the auditor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But under a complex web of regulations, the state must make-up for any funding 
losses school suffer because of declining tax revenue, Gruber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities, however, don't enjoy such safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already had so much taken away from the state," said Seal Beach 
Councilman William J. Doane, adding that even a small reduction in property tax 
revenue could cause problems for the city. "This is a concern." Changing Values 
</P>
<P>
 More than 170 property owners whose property value assessment appeals were not 
heard by the legal deadline are due for tax breaks, county officials said 
Tuesday. Because of the missed deadline, parcels in question will be assessed 
at the value suggested by the owner. Here are the five owners who saw the 
largest value changes on a parcel: 04,19,13,13,14 County Owner Change Property

DANA PARSONS: QUESTIONING A SYSTEM THAT CAN'T FIND 12 JURORS OUT OF 300 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, I must ask myself the embarrassing question: What am I missing 
here? 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be overly dense about it, but is it really that hard to find 12 people 
who could serve honorably on a jury for the O.J. Simpson trial? In real-world 
terms, I'm confident the answer is no, but in the parallel universe in which 
the Simpson case dwells, the answer apparently is, "Omigod, yes, you have no 
idea how hard it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and defense attorneys have spoken in concert about the agonizing, 
painstaking, tortured trek they're making through jury selection. So daunting 
is their task that they're doing everything but giving Rorschach tests to 
separate the fit from the unfit. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sets of attorneys have told Judge Lance Ito they've had misgivings about 
prospective jurors' honesty in answering their questions. Prosecutor Marcia 
Clark said at one point she wanted to dismiss the entire jury pool and start 
all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 If what the lawyers are saying is true, then something is awfully amiss in the 
way we're picking jurors these days. If the system can't produce 12 decent 
jurors out of an original pool of 300 people, the logical comeback would be to 
say the system needs an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 My hunch, though, is that finding an impartial jury isn't nearly as hard as 
the lawyers are having us believe. The real problem is that both sides aren't 
trying to find exemplary jurors; they're trying to find jurors sympathetic to 
their side. In the effort to do that, it's a fair bet that potentially 
excellent jurors already have been excused. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not playing the naif here. I realize the Simpson case is not your average 
case in which jurors show up to decide the fate of a total unknown accused of a 
crime they had heard nothing about. Cases like that have an implied purity in 
that jurors start with a blank slate toward both crime and defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, that won't happen in the Simpson trial, and let's hope not. Let's 
hope they don't settle on even a single juror who has heard nothing about this 
case. Such a juror would be in such a dubious state of awareness as to render 
him or her useless during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys and the judge know that, as well, and they're not looking for 
the juror-in-the-cave. But what may be happening is that their questioning is 
tying up prospective jurors in such knots that the lawyers sense people are 
lying. The truth may be that people aren't lying, but just being wary in the 
face of questions that they know are meant to plumb their psyches. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when a prosecutor or defense attorney asks, "Do you think the 
police are usually correct when they make an arrest," potential jurors may 
honestly believe that but be hesitant to say so for fear that the answer may 
make them sound pro-prosecution and, as a result, get them kicked off the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a couple questions from the Simpson jury questionnaires: 
</P>
<P>
 1. "Have you ever been sufficiently frustrated within a domestic relationship 
that you considered violence?" 
</P>
<P>
 2. "How big a problem do you think racial discrimination against African 
Americans is in Southern California?" 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder some jurors appear to be squirming while answering. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose there's a method to the questions, but I can't help but think the 
winnowing process contributes to the problem of finding good jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 I admit to a bit of newly acquired bias about jury selection. I was called for 
jury duty earlier this year and was quickly dismissed on one of the 
prosecutor's permitted discretionary rejections. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was miniature compared to the Simpson trial, but I know for a fact I 
would have been a good juror. I'd pay attention to testimony, have no 
preconceived notions about the outcome and then say my piece during 
deliberations. If the guy did it, I'd vote guilty. If they couldn't prove it, 
I'd vote not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure the juror who took my place was fine, but it bothered me that the 
system had spit out someone who not only wanted to serve but who would take the 
public trust seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the upcoming Simpson trial, I have the growing sense that everyone, 
from the judge on down through the lawyers and media commentators, is creating 
a self-fulfilling prophecy of doom. 
</P>
<P>
 I've arrived at that by asking what seems to me a simple, common-sense 
question: Do I know people who, in spite of their vast awareness of the Simpson 
case, could be impartial jurors? Could they go into court, even if harboring a 
feeling Simpson is guilty, and acquit him based on what they heard in court? 
Or, if they now believe he didn't commit the crimes, could they be swayed by 
overwhelming evidence and vote for conviction? 
</P>
<P>
 Call me stupid, but I can easily think of a number of people who could do 
those things without thinking of a book deal afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the lawyers telling us they can't find 12 discerning and fair-minded 
citizens in Los Angeles, or are they simply asking all the wrong questions? 
</P>

CLEANING THE STREETS; GRASS-ROOTS INVOLVEMENT IN POLICING BRINGS AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Elodia Gonzalez has stared down drug dealers. She has patrolled her street 
with a flashlight and faced death threats more than once. But perhaps her 
biggest feat was talking to law-abiding neighbors.  
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez was credited Tuesday with helping to turn around a drug-riddled 
neighborhood on Sabina Street by rallying fed-up neighbors to demand more 
attention from city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the drug dealers said they were going to kill her, she said, 'I can kill 
you, too,' " said John Gaudette, a community organizer who last year watched 
Gonzalez persuade fearful neighbors to tell their stories to city officials at 
a meeting, which many say sparked the turnaround. "She's a fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, 38, was among eight local people and organizations, including 
several police departments, honored for their work in community-based policing, 
the voguish new law-enforcement approach that aims to clean up troubled 
neighborhoods through grass-roots organizing. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards were devised by the group Orange County Together as a way to 
measure and encourage community policing. The group, formed by the Orange 
County Human Relations Commission and United Way of Orange County after the Los 
Angeles riots two years ago, consists of community leaders, business people and 
representatives of local government. 
</P>
<P>
 The butter-over-guns philosophy of community policing showed strongly in the 
award-winning programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The group gave its top officer's award to a Costa Mesa bicycle officer who 
hounded city officials into scrubbing graffiti from an alley again and again 
for a month straight and organized neighborhood cleanup days. A team award went 
to Garden Grove police and a residents group that launched a newsletter and 
organized tenants and landlords to begin cleaning up crime-ridden Stuart Drive. 
A partnership award went to Santa Ana police and a group of parents so fearful 
of drug dealers that they banded together to walk their children to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find now that officers deal more with social issues than they do with 
law-enforcement issues," said Garden Grove Police Lt. Scott Hamilton, who 
shared the leadership award with Gonzalez. "Police officers have to be social 
workers if they're going to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say community policing, a concept as loosely defined as it is widely 
discussed, is more than a catch phrase. Traditional police efforts failed to 
stamp out crime in many neighborhoods and often left them with an endless cycle 
of arrests and more crime, said Hugh Foster, director of the Golden West 
College Criminal Justice Training Center, which won a training award. The new 
approach gets residents involved in everything from targeting run-down 
buildings to planting trees, Foster said, and has reduced crime in targeted 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Residents report a dramatic turnaround in Gonzalez's Anaheim neighborhood, 
where a 13-year-old friend of her daughter died in a drive-by shooting a few 
years back, and where Gonzalez was afraid to clean up her yard for fear of 
coming into contact with syringes and condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of standing up angrily to drug peddlers and vainly appealing for 
city action, Gonzalez, a mother of two, found out about a local organizing 
effort spearheaded by the Orange County Congregational Community Organization. 
Last May, the group rallied 500 residents for a showdown with city officials, 
and Gonzalez managed to get 10 of her neighbors to speak out at the meeting, 
despite their fears of gang retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The following week, police assigned a community action team to the area and 
crime plummeted. Five months later, neighbors had a block party to celebrate 
their victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said she no longer fears for her daughters on the once-menacing 
street. Gone, too, are the drug dealers who hung out in front of her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "For so long we had no help or backing from anyone -- even the police," she 
said. "We had to put together 500 people to have that much power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's quiet. Thank God." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove launched its community policing approach last year, rewriting the 
Police Department's mission statement to erase references to crime-fighting and 
instead emphasize the quality of life and making residents feel safe, Hamilton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department won a $660,000 federal grant for community policing and used 
some of the funds to expand a patrol officer's effort to improve the Stuart 
Drive neighborhood, a collection of largely low-income apartments plagued by 
frequent shootings, thefts, graffiti and gang activity, Hamilton said. Two 
officers assigned to the neighborhood work out of a donated apartment there, 
getting tenants together with landlords, helping residents launch a newsletter, 
holding job fairs and barbecues and getting the city to close off a nearby 
street that had become a popular shortcut for speeding cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said calls for officers have dropped by a third from the year before, 
and the approach has been extended to two other neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's meant a lot," said Mercedes Morales, a three-year Stuart Drive resident 
who publishes the neighborhood newsletter. "(People) feel more secure going 
out."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / ATTORNEY GENERAL; LUNGREN 'SLEAZE' IS ASSAILED; AT 
UMBERG EVENT, GRANDFATHER OF SLAIN POLLY KLAAS ALSO ATTACKS GOV. WILSON, SENATE 
HOPEFUL HUFFINGTON FOR UTILIZING GIRL'S NAME.

 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and other Republican candidates are "dancing a jig" on 
the grave of Polly Klaas to push their own agenda on crime, the young girl's 
grandfather charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Klaas lashed out at Lungren, Gov. Pete Wilson and GOP senatorial candidate 
Mike Huffington at a news conference called by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden 
Grove), Lungren's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, Wilson and Huffington -- who is co-chairman of Proposition 184, the 
so-called "three strikes" initiative -- have all used Polly's death, allegedly 
at the hands of a twice-convicted kidnaper, to push for stricter sentencing 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are dancing a jig on Polly's grave, and that is sleaze," said Joe Klaas, 
a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Klaas also is appearing in an Umberg television commercial that 
began running Tuesday. It blames Lungren for contributing to 12-year-old 
Polly's death, saying he was responsible for shutting down a statewide computer 
database that provided local law enforcement officials with information about 
convicted felons. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Joe Klaas and Umberg charged that Polly's death might have been prevented 
if the database -- which can be accessed by patrol car computers -- was 
available to officers when they briefly questioned Richard Allen Davis the 
night of the girl's abduction in October, 1993. Had the two Sonoma County 
sheriff's deputies known he was a parole violator, they would have arrested 
him, Umberg said.  
</P>
<P>
 When officers approached Davis, his car was in a ditch at the side of a road, 
and at the time the deputies did not know of the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Polly, who was taken from her Petaluma home, was found slain two months later. 
Davis has told investigators that Polly was still alive but hidden nearby when 
he talked to the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Telliano, Lungren's campaign spokesman, said the allegations made by 
Klaas and those in the advertisement are outright fabrications. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the officers who talked to Davis were unaware that there had been a 
kidnaping and did not radio to the department's dispatcher to check on his 
criminal history. Had they done so, the dispatcher would have called up a 
record replete with felonies, including two kidnaping charges, Telliano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sonoma Country sheriff has said repeatedly that the officers did not 
check the system because they didn't know there had been a kidnaping," Telliano 
said. "Had they known, had they radioed in, then they would have known about 
the kidnaping and maybe it would have been different. But it's a huge stretch 
that Umberg is making." 
</P>
<P>
 Telliano said the commercial may well backfire on Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ad may prove to be a grenade that Tom Umberg pulled the pin on, but 
forgot to let go of," he said. "It may end up doing in his own campaign. People 
are absolutely outraged by this sleaze-ball ad." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, a former federal prosecutor, charged that the database -- part of the 
Violent Crime Information Center -- could have kept operating had Lungren not 
cut the program to save $120,000. In fact, the program was restored a year 
later, after Klaas' body was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had (Davis') name been in the computer at the time, it would've made a 
difference," said Umberg. "This ad is factual. If it were not, I should not be 
attorney general of California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Klaas charged that "Lungren's lack of responsibility" contributed to his 
granddaughter's death. He appears in the Umberg commercial wearing a T-shirt 
reading "Remember Polly. Dump Lungren." 
</P>
<P>
 "For $120,000 Lungren could've let every cop on the street know they're 
dealing with a parole violator" in Davis' case, Klaas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren has denounced the commercial and the charges by Klaas and Umberg. On 
Monday, Lungren called Umberg a sleazy politician and demanded that he "pull 
the plug" on the commercial. The attorney general also suggested that Klaas was 
being used by the Umberg campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Klaas denied that he was duped and said it is he who first got in 
touch with Umberg and "volunteered to help in any way I could to defeat 
Lungren." 
</P>
<P>
 Klaas also had bitter words for Wilson and Huffington, accusing both of 
exploiting Polly's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were exploited unmercifully last December when the governor called and 
asked if he could speak at Polly's memorial service," Klaas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson appeared at the memorial service after he had rejected a family request 
to use National Guard troops to search for Polly's body when she was missing, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who is in a bitter U.S. Senate race with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 
used Polly Klaas' name without the family's consent to solicit money for the 
Proposition 184 campaign he co-chairs, Joe Klaas charged. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Huffington, as Proposition 184 co-chairman -- continued to use 
Polly's name to solicit contributions for the initiative even after the family 
requested that he stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, Wilson and Huffington "have got to take the responsibility of 
exploiting my family to push their own agenda," Klaas added. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, the governor's spokesman, said that no one in the governor's 
office or the California National Guard can recall any request from the Klaas 
family to use the guard to search for the girl. He also said that the governor 
was invited to the December memorial service by the Klaas family and has not 
exploited them. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said that it is inevitable that the death of Polly Klaas and 
Kimber Reynolds, the daughter of "three strikes" author Mike Reynolds, ignited 
the firestorm of public outrage that led to passage this year of numerous tough 
anti-crime laws. Kimber Reynolds was shot to death in 1992 by a convicted felon 
in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad that it took the death of two young ladies to call the full 
attention of the state to our terrible crime problem," Walsh said. "We now have 
tough anti-crime laws on the books, and the state owes a great deal of 
gratitude to the Klaas and Reynolds families for standing up and calling for 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spokesman Bruce Nestande denied that Huffington exploited Polly's 
death to promote the "three strikes" initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absurd. We have spoken to the issue of 'three strikes' but never 
commented on Polly's death," said Nestande.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; CANDIDATE'S CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT AT HOME

 Patrick Hanrahan, who is running for trustee of the Placentia-Yorba Linda 
Unified School District, teaches his two oldest children at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direction of a private Christian education group that provides 
curriculum and other assistance, Hanrahan and his wife instruct their 
8-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter at home.Their 6-year-old son has 
cerebral palsy and attends special-education classes at a district school in 
Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanrahan did not disclose where his children attended school in campaign 
literature nor at a recent candidate forum, but said he was not hiding the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it was important," he said. "I figured only a very small 
segment would see it as a true issue." 
</P>
<P>
 But several other school board candidates disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Karin Freeman criticized Hanrahan for his decision to run while he 
has chosen to teach his children at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his right to make that choice to home-school his children," Freeman 
said. "But I question him for wanting to govern those students in district 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Juliet Zaidi, another trustee candidate, said she would have worked to improve 
public schools instead of pulling her children out of them. "He should have 
worked through the system first," Zaidi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanrahan said his decision to pull his older children out of Bryant Ranch is 
consistent with his position that district schools are overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that I should put my money where my mouth is," Hanrahan said. "I 
believe schools are overcrowded and I need to find a place where my children's 
needs will be met." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LAGUNA HILLS; AUTHORITIES HOPE MAN'S SKETCH 
WILL BRING CLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department on Tuesday released a sketch of a man 
whose skull was found in Aliso Creek, in the hopes of identifying him. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, described as white, about 40, with blond-brown hair, a mustache and 
sideburns, had been dead about three to six months, according to reports from a 
forensic anthropologist. 
</P>
<P>
 The skull was found last March by two boys playing near the bike trail, 
between Alicia Parkway and Via Lomas. It had been partially buried by a dirt 
buildup from recent rains, according to sheriff's officials. 
</P>
<P>
 An examination of the skull by a forensic pathologist showed no obvious signs 
of trauma, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's homicide division is working on the case, but until the man is 
identified, "we are pretty much at the end of things. The investigation can't 
go anywhere until we find out who it is. We're at a dead-end," said Cullen 
Ellingburgh, supervising deputy coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellingburgh said no other bones were found in the area at the time by 
sheriff's officials. An anthropologist speculated that the remains could have 
been swept away by the creek or consumed by animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they believe the man had a large nose and a thin face. His 
teeth were in good condition and he had recently had a root canal and a 
temporary crown, according to a forensic anthropologist. His front teeth were 
long with a space between them. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some tissue still on the skull, and from it the anthropologist 
determined the man's hair color, Ellingburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the sketch is not perfect, Ellingburgh said. "This drawing is the 
artist taking an X-ray and drawing over it. A lot of it is poetic license. 
There may just be a slight resemblance to the individual." DEBBIE KONG

 George Reiger's love for Disneyland may be only skin deep -- but that's saying 
volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiger, a 40-year-old postal worker and part-time magician from Easton, Pa., 
has 303 tattoos of Disney characters or landmarks on his body. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-proclaimed No. 1 Disney fan said he plans to have 500 tattoos within 
the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that will probably be it. I'm running out of room," Reiger said Tuesday 
from his 11th-floor room at the Disneyland Hotel, where he was unpacking for 
his 54th visit to the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Tattoos might not portray a wholesome image to everyone, but Reiger doesn't 
fret. During visits to Disney theme parks here and in Orlando, Fla., Tokyo and 
Paris, visitors usually clamor to see the authentic figures gracing his flesh, 
such as Mickey Mouse, Snow White and even a Mighty Duck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't worn a short-sleeved T-shirt in 13 years," Reiger said, referring 
to the time he got his first tattoo, a Fantasia scene. His most recent tattoo 
-- a dragon from Sleeping Beauty -- was applied Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiger's devotion to Disney extends beyond his body. His house contains about 
8,000 Disney items, from bedspreads to kitchen tiles. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has spent more than $400,000 on travel, memorabilia and other 
items. Besides the 54 visits to Disneyland, Reiger said he has been to Disney 
World 75 times and to Euro Disney and Disney Tokyo twice each. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiger has been married five times. His previous four wives could not tolerate 
his zeal for Disney, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has two daughters, ages 9 and 13, who are also Disney fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my love, my life, my religion," Reiger said. "People think I'm 
crazy."JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY DELAYS ACTION ON FRIDAY CLOSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday postponed for two weeks a decision 
on a controversial work program that gives county employees every other Friday 
off and closes county offices on those days. 
</P>
<P>
 The county administrative office recommended in a report to the board that the 
program continue because it saves the county nearly $1 million a year in 
utilities, janitorial services and other operational costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, however, questioned the cost-saving findings in 
that report. County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said Stanton has 
raised some "legitimate" concerns that he needs time to address.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the work plan, nearly three dozen county facilities, which offer the 
public a range of services from welfare assistance and health care to building 
permits and tax collection, are closed every other Friday. Most of the offices 
are open longer during the week to make up for the Friday shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he doesn't oppose flexible work schedules for the employees, but 
doesn't think the public should be denied access to county offices 26 Fridays a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will consider the issue on Nov. 8.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; 3 TAKE COUNCIL POSTS IN WAKE OF RECALL VOTE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three City Council members, ousted from office in a recall election over a 
controversial utility tax they passed, stepped down from office Tuesday and 
handed over their seats to their replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Godfrey, Conrad DeWitte and Jan M. Flory were inaugurated Tuesday night, 
a week after they won office in a special recall election to fill the unexpired 
terms of Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, Councilman Don Bankhead and Councilwoman 
Molly McClanahan. 
</P>
<P>
 Flory and DeWitte face reelection on Nov. 8, because Catlin and McClanahan's 
terms would have expired then. Godfrey will remain in office until 1996, which 
is when Bankhead's term would have ended. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of community leaders, friends, business owners and city groups 
honored the recalled council members with a standing ovation and words of 
priase for their service.  
</P>
<P>
 After being sworn into office, the new council members and their colleagues, 
Julie Sa and Chris Norby, voted on a new mayor and mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 The council elected Sa as the new mayor and Norby as mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead last year approved a 2% utility-user tax, 
prompting the Fullerton Recalls Committee to form and lead a successful 
campaign to oust them. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to begin discussions regarding repealing the utility tax at 
next week's council meeting. DeWitte and Godfrey said they would vote to repeal 
the tax. Flory said she supports the tax only until it expires in September, 
1995, unless it can be repealed without causing cuts in city services. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin has said he predicts the tax will not be rescinded because it is 
expected to provide the city's general fund with $4.6 million in revenue in the 
1993-94 and 1994-95 fiscal years. It was enacted, he said, to balance the 
city's $81.2-million budget and keep the council from having to cut emergency 
services. MIMI KO

<P>
 Police are searching for a gunman who opened fire from a car, killing a man 
and wounding a teen-age boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers responding to reports of gunfire in the 1800 block of Neighbors 
Avenue late Monday found John Ernest Garcia, 25, of Anaheim sprawled near an 
apartment building, Police Sgt. Charles Chavez said Tuesday.Paramedics 
pronounced him dead at the scene of a chest wound. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old male who was shot in the hip was taken to the Anaheim Memorial 
Hospital by friends before police arrived, Chavez said. The youth, whose 
identity was not made public, was later transferred to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe Garcia and the teen-ager were standing near the curb 
when a car stopped in front of them, Chavez said. An argument ensued and 
someone in the car opened fire about 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared that (Garcia) staggered a few steps before he fell," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Descriptions of the assailant, who was last seen heading east on Neighbors 
Avenue, remained sketchy as police continued searching the neighborhood for 
witnesses. Nobody had been found who saw what happened, except the teen-ager. 
"And he's not telling much," Chavez said. "In all honesty, we're puzzled as far 
as motive." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no evidence of a gang-related crime, Chavez said. THAO HUA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; CABLE TELEVISION CHANGEOVER TO COST CITY 
'INSIGHT' INTO COUNTY CULTURE, POLITICS

<P>
 A cable television program that brought the county's cultural and political 
life to Irvine residents on Wednesday nights at 8 p.m. will go off the air 
tonight after four years of programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insight: Orange County" was one of the first shows produced by the former 
Community Cablevision, which was acquired by Dimension Cable in September, 
1992.Operations of the two companies were consolidated in May and the show has 
been reduced to re-runs in recent months, since Dimension's Newport Beach 
production offices were moved to San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 frey will remain in office until 1996, which is when Bankhead's term would 
have ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine resident Jerry Lasensky, 55, executive producer and host of "Insight: 
Orange County," is lobbying to keep his show on cable Channel 3. The show 
reaches residents in Irvine and parts of Tustin and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension has offered to loan Lasensky equipment to tape his show for 
community access programming, but Lasensky says the show's quality would suffer 
without cable company backing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension Cable public affairs manager Carol Starcevic said Lasensky's show 
does not qualify for production assistance. "His show falls into the public 
access definition," Starcevic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasensky has taken viewers inside county museums and arts institutions and 
featured interviews with county political and business leaders. RUSS LOAR

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bus driver for the Orange Unified School District has filed racial and 
sexual discrimination charges against the district with the state Department of 
Fair Employment and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Zacary Galvez, who has driven students in the district since 1991 and has been 
on unpaid leave since Sept. 18, said he was denied use of a district bus to 
take the test to renew his driver's license.His complaint states that his 
supervisor has allowed two white female employees to use district buses for 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Galvez, 24, also alleged that he was blackballed in his attempts to rent buses 
from private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a cardinal sin," said William Lokay, labor representative with the 
California School Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Employment Department has agreed to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Galvez, Lokay and Becky Mayers, president of the district chapter of CSEA, met 
Thursday with Jack Elsner, the district's human resources administrator. Elsner 
said he could not discuss personnel issues, but he believes Galvez's case can 
be resolved "in a satisfactory manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayers said the union will not be satisfied until Galvez is reinstated with 
back pay. LESLEY WRIGHT

 About 500 residents, community leaders and school personnel will celebrate the 
reopening of Neomia B. Willmore Elementary School in a ceremony tonight, a 
district spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-acre campus was closed several years ago as a result of school boundary 
changes, and leased to a court-reporting school.Earlier this year, the 
Westminster School District Board of Trustees voted unanimously to reopen the 
site in September to accommodate about 540 children who live within walking 
distance and who had been bused to other schools, said spokeswoman Audrey 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has spent $1.5 million to renovate the building and campus with 
new roofing, floors, fencing, carpeting, asphalt and irrigation systems, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration, which is open to the public, will be held at the campus, 7122 
Maple St., at 6 p.m. Festivities will include multicultural performances, 
refreshments and a tribute to Neomia Willmore, former district trustee for whom 
the school as named. JON NALICK

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; SOMETHING NEW IS BREWING 
</P>

<P>
 As Laguna Beach residents sipped their morning coffee Tuesday, a towering 
crane lowered two 18-foot-high fermenting tanks through the open skylight of a 
building that what will soon become this city's first brewery. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the vats were deposited, Laguna Beach Brewing Co.President Michael Fein 
again eyed the approximately 6-foot-wide skylight and wondered aloud how the 
bulky copper tank next in line for delivery could possibly squeeze through the 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one's going to be tight," he said. "I'm told we have about an 
inch-and-a-half clearance." 
</P>
<P>
 If the deposit of three truckloads of brewery tanks created a bit of drama in 
Laguna Beach on Tuesday, Fein said they will also be part of the show when the 
new business opens on Dec. 5. Customers can watch as barley and hops are turned 
into lager and ale. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll get to see part of the brewery from the minute you walk into the 
place," said Fein, who is restoring the historic building where the small 
brewery will operate at 422 S. Coast Highway. "All the tanks are part of the 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 The collection of vats -- including the tall stainless steel fermenting tanks 
and two copper "brew houses" rolled into town Tuesday on three 18-wheel trucks 
that had carted them from Victoria, British Columbia. The journey took four 
days, Fein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The showy serving vats with fine mirrored finishes should arrive next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment -- including tanks, plumbing and copper lines to carry the beer 
-- cost about $250,000, Fein said." LESLIE EARNEST

 Twelve "community heroes" who have contributed substantial service in the 
areas of valor, merit, heroism and humanitarianism will be honored today. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be recognized for outstanding acts of public service during the past 
year at the Public Safety Awards Luncheon at the Waterfront Hilton Beach 
Resort.

him from doing more harm to himself while waiting for the police to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Awards for Merit will be given to city Fire Department Division Chief Tom Poe, 
public works maintenance division worker Peter Raia and Police Officer Dean 
Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 Four police officers who are part of the Critical Accident Suppression 
Enforcement Team, which developed ways to reach the public in a more positive 
manner on traffic safety issues, also will get merit awards. They are officers 
Larry Braz, Jerry TerKeurst, Norm Evenson and Bert Adkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Samaritan Awards will be given to residents Clay James, Monte Rodriguez, 
Dave Froehle and Reggie Ceehorne.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A soup kitchen that feeds up to 400 people a day is becoming a bone of 
contention for at least one Ford Road property owner.  
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Adams alleges that the kitchen's presence one block away on 19th 
Street attracts suspicious characters and has led to an increase in residential 
burglaries.She suggested moving the soup kitchen to a nearby city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's move it to the edge of Newport," a soft-spoken Adams suggested during a 
public hearing. "There have been six thefts in the last five months there (near 
Ford Road)."  
</P>
<P>
 Adams, who owns a rental house and a duplex along the road, said her tenants 
have been victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The soup kitchen, located inside the United Methodist Church on West 19th 
Street, is operated by the church. Although the City Council said it will look 
into the possible upswing in crime, a police spokesman said the number of 
incidents in the neighborhood remains unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Rick Johnson, in charge of the department's patrol officers, noted that 
the soup kitchen is next to Triangle Square. "Police calls have remained 
constant, but there hasn't been any dramatic increase in residential crime 
because there aren't that many homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Moriarty, the manager of the soup kitchen, said he thinks the kitchen is 
getting a bad rap. TOM RAGAN

DRUG SELLER FACES 'THREE STRIKES' SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man found guilty Tuesday of selling $10 worth of rock cocaine faces 25 years 
to life in prison under the new "three strikes" legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Sharod, 30, was arrested in May outside an Anaheim motel after selling 
the drugs to an undercover narcotics officer, according to prosecutors.Sharod's 
criminal record dates back to 1984 and includes convictions for two robberies, 
grand theft and petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Dan Cook said he believes law enforcement officials 
charged the wrong man. Cook said Sharod was found in possession of the marked 
$10 bill used during the undercover operation but said a witness testified at 
trial that another man looking for change had given Sharod the $10 bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Superior Court jury rejected that argument, however, and 
deliberated just a few hours before convicting Sharod. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Bruce Moore said he intends to seek the toughest sentencing 
against Sharod, who is the third "three strikes" defendant convicted by jury in 
Orange County. But Cook said he does not believe such a sentence is 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a $10 rock should send someone away for life," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors were not told what sentence Sharod faced if found guilty. Sentencing is 
set for Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed in March by Gov. Pete Wilson, the "three strikes" law cracks down on 
repeat offenders. Defendants convicted of two or more serious crimes, ranging 
from burglary to murder, face 25 years to life in prison when convicted of any 
third felony.

 Jurors deliberated just two hours Tuesday before convicting a third young man 
of second-degree murder for the death of a San Clemente teen-ager who was

in gang activity during the October, 1993, attack on 17-year-old Steve Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors declined to comment after announcing their verdicts. Kathy Woods, the 
victim's mother, said she wanted to thank the jury for the speedy verdict but 
said her heart is still broken over the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased it was very fast," said Kathy Woods, who sat through much of the 
weeklong trial in Orange County Superior Court. "It doesn't bring my son back, 
but it's some kind of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Gene E. Dorney said his client threw a piece of wood at the 
victim and his friends but was acting in self defense. Dorney argued to jurors 
that his client was unfairly being held responsible for the actions of others, 
and vowed to appeal the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are bitterly disappointed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcocer faces a possible prison term of at least 15 years to life when he is 
sentenced Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woods killing gained widespread attention because of the freakish nature 
of the injuries in a beach community where gang violence was unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 The case triggered countywide outrage over crime. It also sparked concern 
among some Latino residents, who contended that racism may have played a role 
in the filing of murder charges against the Latino defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of two other young men who are accused of helping kill Woods said they 
came to the courtroom to support Alcocer, whose parents are in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expected this decision because Woods is a white boy and he (Alcocer) is 
Mexican," said Victor Villalobos, whose son, 19-year-old Arturo Villalobos, has 
pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter for his role in the attack and 
participating in gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a game. It's just a game. They're trying to clean the streets of 
Mexicans," Victor Villalobos said, adding that Alcocer is a serious young man, 
a good student, and a hard worker. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer said the charges and convictions have been 
based on the facts -- not the race of the victim or defendants. Paer noted that 
the jury reached the same verdict that a judge reached during an earlier, 
unrelated trial for two of Alcocer's co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have consistencies in the verdicts, which I think shows that our theory 
was not something that was concocted or contrived," Paer said. "It's now been 
put to the legal test twice. It's just an appropriate verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say that all of the defendants are responsible for Woods' death 
because they joined in and acted together to hurl bottles, wood chunks and 
other items at the teen-ager and his friends. Someone threw the paint roller 
that lodged in Woods' head, but prosecutors have not named a culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Penuelas, 17, and Julio Bonilla, 18, were tried as adults and convicted 
of second-degree murder, conspiracy, assault and gang involvement charges in 
the attack during a non-jury trial. Penuelas, Bonilla and Villalobos also await 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods and Alcocer were hanging out with their respective friends at Calafia 
Beach County Park when a dispute broke out between the two groups. Woods' 
friends testified they were forced to drive by the other group to get to the 
park's only exit when they were bombarded with the makeshift weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the defendants said they hurled the items in self defense because 
they believed the teen-agers were going to run them over. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the weapons bounced off the vehicles, but Woods was sitting in the 
passenger seat of a friend's car when the paint-roller crashed though the 
window and pierced through his skull. Woods was in a coma for 25 days before 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorney said Alcocer was not a gang member but did associate with gang members 
in his neighborhood. Dorney said his client is unfairly being held responsible 
for the acts of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never embraced gang belief, he just grew up in close quarters with these 
people in his neighborhood," said Dorney.

EX-OFFICER CHARGED WITH EMBEZZLING FROM POLICE ASSN.; CRIME: AUTHORITIES SAY HE 
STOLE ABOUT $36,000 FROM FOUNTAIN VALLEY ORGANIZATION, WHICH HE HEADED. HE HAD 
WON A MEDAL OF VALOR FOR ACTIONS IN CONTROVERSIAL ARREST.

 A former Fountain Valley police officer and Medal of Valor recipient was 
arrested Tuesday and charged with embezzling $36,000 from the Fountain Valley 
Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin D. Arnold, 34, of Mission Viejo pleaded not guilty to a single count of 
felony grand theft in Municipal Court here. He was released on his own 
recognizance and ordered to return Nov. 23 for a pretrial hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold's attorney, John D. Barnett, said the former officer would have no 
comment on the case beyond his plea. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Arnold will face a maximum sentence of three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold "will be treated in the same manner that anyone would who committed a 
similar offense," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew Anderson. "There will not be 
any favoritism in this case" because it involves a former police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, an informal audit by members of the association revealed the loss 
from several savings accounts, Anderson said. Arnold, an 11-year veteran of the 
force, began serving as president of the organization in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 20, when the district attorney's office announced it was beginning a 
criminal probe of the loss, Arnold was placed on paid administrative leave from 
the force. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 31, Arnold was terminated "after an internal affairs investigation 
substantiated his involvement in misconduct in this matter," said Sgt. Dann 
Bean, a department spokesman. "Our investigation was purely administrative and 
not criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's investigation revealed that between March, 1993, and 
May, 1994, about $36,000 was embezzled from the Fountain Valley Police Officers 
Assn., according to Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Police Chief Elvin Miali nor Detective Jim McNeff, the current 
association president, would comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morale is pretty good around here," Bean said. "We put it behind us, and 
everybody seems to be in good spirits. We have a job to do here and we're going 
to continue to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 For four years, until 1994, Arnold served as the department's canine officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold received the Medal of Valor in 1990 for his actions in a controversial 
shootout in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 In that incident, while serving as a reserve officer, Arnold shot a burglary 
suspect six times after a short foot chase. Arnold was shot once in the ear 
with his own gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, Michael Wayde Mohon, was charged with burglary and the attempted 
murder of Arnold, but used a smuggled gun to escape from the Orange County Jail 
in 1985 before he could be tried. He was captured by Arizona authorities eight 
days later but managed to escape a second time. After being featured on 
"America's Most Wanted" and "Unsolved Mysteries," Mohon was captured in Alabama 
in 1989 and returned to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempted murder charge against Mohon was dropped in 1991 for lack of 
evidence. Mohon then unsuccessfully sued Arnold for using excessive force, 
citing other shootings the officer had been involved in since 1983, including a 
fatal one in which a suspect was shot 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold re-enacted the shooting for a series of training films prepared by the 
Los Angeles Police Department, which were used statewide at police academies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to do anything about the video" because of Arnold's arrest, 
Bean said. "We would have no reason to pull that video."

 UNNAMED CITY OFFICIALS ACCUSED OF TELLING CHIEF TO TARGET BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former acting police chief has alleged that a year ago two City Council 
members ordered him to develop an anti-gang program targeting blacks.  
</P>
<P>
 Police Cmdr. Gary Biggerstaff said at a council meeting Monday that the 
council members, whom he did not identify, wanted a program that would "apply 
special enforcement and harassment of individuals of Afro-American ethnic 
background." 
</P>
<P>
 But all City Council members said Biggerstaff's accusations are false, and 
could be a retaliation against the council that passed him over when the city 
picked a new police chief in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sense a little sour grapes here," said Mayor Anthony R. Selvaggi. "He's 
unhappy, that's what's it all about. I'm disappointed that a member of our 
police force would make these charges, which are absolutely false." 
</P>
<P>
 Biggerstaff's allegation came as he spoke against a recently adopted city 
policy that designates management employees hired after July 1, 1993, as "at 
will" employees who may be fired by the city manager at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is not affected, Biggerstaff said the policy removes protection 
from management employees, who may not agree with some city policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggerstaff said that when he refused the "unethical and immoral" request a 
year ago, he was subjected to political harassment, forcing him to file for 
stress disability early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Robert C. Dunek said that Biggerstaff was acting police chief 
from June to December last year. In January, the council selected Michael J. 
Skogh, former police chief of Manhattan Beach, as new police chief over 
Biggerstaff, the other finalist for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Skogh then reorganized the Police Department, and assigned Biggerstaff to head 
the administration and investigation division, changing his rank to captain. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggerstaff has been out on sick leave since January and has filed a pending 
worker's compensation claim against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the time of this meeting, and the time of (my) refusal to cooperate in 
this conspiracy, I have been subjected to political and administrative 
harassment," Biggerstaff said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not say how he was harassed, but he said he is willing to testify if an 
investigation is conducted, either by the Orange County Grand Jury or the state 
attorney general's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ronald Bates, who was mayor at the time, said the meeting to which 
Biggerstaff was referring was a general discussion about the gang problem in 
Los Alamitos following a county report that some gangs may be operating in the 
city.

PROP. 187 IS DENOUNCED AT PRAYER SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES and MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holding candles and singing songs that called for unity, more than 500 people 
attended an interfaith prayer service and protest against Proposition 187 
Tuesday night that ended with a brief march to Children's Hospital of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The service began at the Chapel of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange and 
drew Catholics, Jews, Protestants, Muslims and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Lynne Austin of Aldersgate United Methodist Church in Tustin told the 
audience that Proposition 187, which would deny most social services, including 
education and health care to illegal immigrants, is antithetical to 
Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the face of God in those who are the most vulnerable," Austin said. 
"And, when you welcome the ones who are vulnerable and helpless, you are 
welcoming God. Those most vulnerable are the immigrants in our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Bernard King, from the Irvine Temple Shir Ha Ma'Alot, said that Orange 
County residents should be sensitive to California's new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we treat them is a measure of our society," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier on Tuesday, about a dozen youths, their parents and representatives of 
several human rights and ethnic organizations gathered on the steps of the old 
courthouse in Santa Ana and denounced the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 John Maldonado, a parent whose family would be affected if Proposition 187 
passes, added, "It's inhumane and racist. It will cause the separation of many 
families." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Miranda, president of the Children's Alliance, a committee recently 
formed by prominent business and community leaders to fight Proposition 187, 
said: "Schools must remain an environment of learning and understanding of our 
rich cultural heritage. Proposition 187 will institutionalize a second class of 
citizens in our schools where children of color will be questioned and 
suspected of being undocumented." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that his 12-year-old son recently was "extremely distressed" when he 
was required to take an English competency exam at his school "only because his 
name is Miranda, not Jones. This is wrong. I was born in the United States and 
so was my son. As Americans, our ethnic heritage should not be a basis for 
compromising our freedoms."

CONSERVANCY MAKES DEAL ON HEADLANDS; PROPERTY: OPTION TO BUY SEVEN ACRES HINGES 
ON PASSAGE OF TWO BALLOT MEASURES THAT WOULD ALLOW $500-MILLION DEVELOPMENT ON 
REST OF PENINSULA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A local conservancy has negotiated a three-year option to buy seven acres of 
environmentally sensitive property on the landmark Dana Point Headlands 
peninsula for $6.5 million, it was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The property, near the tip of the 121-acre promontory overlooking Dana Point 
Harbor, includes coastal sage scrub and habitat for two endangered species, the 
California gnatcatcher and the Pacific pocket mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase hinges on obtaining funding and passage of two controversial 
measures on the Nov. 8 ballot asking local voters to approve a $500-million 
development plan for the remainder of the peninsula. The plan includes a 
400-room hotel and a maximum of 370 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the measures are approved, the deal can go forward and Dana Point residents 
can retain "the most environmentally sensitive land on the entire property," 
said Derith Madden, president of the Dana Point Headlands Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased. This was the conservancy's goal all along," Madden said. 
"This is the land everyone in the city has said was the point of the Headlands, 
the city's namesake." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the option, Madden said the conservancy's board of directors has 
now endorsed the referendums, Measures C and D, on city ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 If both measures fail, the development plan dies and the purchase option is 
terminated along with it, said Dan Daniels, president of the Newport 
Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co., one of the property owners. (The property is 
co-owned by Chandis Securities Co., a firm that oversees the financial holdings 
of the Chandler family, major stockholders in Times Mirror Co., which publishes 
the Los Angeles Times.)  
</P>
<P>
 "If the measures fail, we have no plan for the land and the option 
discontinues," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes of Headlands development immediately criticized the purchase plan, 
calling it "a ploy" to sway voters to support the measures two weeks before the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole thing is very suspicious," said Jack Roberts, a member of 
Save the Headlands, a group fighting the development plan. "The landowner 
really doesn't have to do anything. I'm more inclined to say let's defeat the 
measures and take it back to square one and start all over again, especially 
this late in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The development plan for the Headlands was approved by the Dana Point City 
Council in April. The plan's foes, who successfully petitioned city voters to 
get the referendums on the ballot, say it is too dense and would destroy too 
much of the Headlands peninsula, one of the last remaining coastal properties 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 As the two measures are worded, a "yes" vote upholds the council's approval of 
the development and a "no" vote rescinds the council's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling the seven acres to the conservancy would eliminate about 20 homes 
previously designated for the property, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also give the city about 32 contiguous acres at the tip of the 
peninsula that would be designated as open or park space, Daniels said. The 
proposed plan would deed 25 acres of the bluffs and the land seaward of the 
conservancy parcel as open space, park space or property for public hiking 
trails, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madden said the conservancy has already begun to pursue federal grants to pay 
for the property. City bond measures are also a possibility, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the beginning . . . a first step," Madden said. "Our goal is to 
acquire as much Headlands land as possible."

 MEDFLY MEAL: While the helicopters are loading malathion for aerial spraying 
tonight (B1), Medfly task force members will be loading up on burritos and 
salsa at a restaurant in the flight path. . . . After learning that Camarillo's 
El Tecolote Cafe lost business in the first round of spraying, members of the 
Fruitfly Action Cooperative Taskforce decided to dine there tonight. "We're a 
group of volunteers, and people keep asking me, 'How can I help?' " spokeswoman

 CHILDREN'S CRUSADE: Just the thought of it overwhelms Oxnard school officials 
-- a mass walkout planned at all five Oxnard high schools to protest 
Proposition 187 (B5). . . . They had enough trouble containing the 200 students 
who marched out of Rio Mesa High School last week. But that's nothing compared 
to what L. A. County is facing: a protest that could involve districts 
throughout the county. The Nov. 2 event is being staged by the same group that 
mustered 70,000 protesters for a march against the initiative to bar illegal 
immigrants from public services. 
</P>
<P>
 SIGN LANGUAGE: They asked for speed bumps. The county wouldn't oblige. They 
asked for better enforcement. Still the cars kept barreling down Sylvan Drive, 
a winding country lane just outside Simi Valley. . . . So the residents took 
matters into their own hands, posting a pair of creative, yellow signs on the 
dead-end street. "There's no reason to be driving so fast on this street," 
resident Cheryl Stangeland said. 
</P>
<P>
 RELIEF AT LAST: Last year, the money bought 444,507 meals and 18,655 nights of 
lodging for Ventura County residents. But United Way officials worried that 
federal emergency food and shelter funds would dry up this year. . . . Tuesday 
they learned that the $504,629 check is in the mail, down just 1% from 1993. 
Now, organizers just have to decide how to divvy up the money. Organizations 
can submit applications until Nov. 16. For information, call 485-6288.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 186; BUSINESSES LOOK AT HEALTH INITIATIVE'S 
BOTTOM LINE; EMPLOYERS THAT WOULD SAVE MONEY TEND TO FAVOR CREATING A 
SINGLE-PAYER STATE SYSTEM, WHILE THOSE THAT WOULD PAY MORE TEND TO OPPOSE IT.

 When the head of Los Angeles-based Bell Industries balanced his current 
medical insurance costs against the new payroll taxes called for by Proposition 
186, the so-called single-payer health insurance initiative, he decided he 
would save $835,000 annually. He likes the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But when analysts at electronics giant Hewlett-Packard did the same thing at 
their company, they found that the Nov. 8 ballot initiative would cost the 
corporation an additional $46 million a year and its employees an extra $14 
million. Hewlett-Packard opposes the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Up and down California, as business executives make the same kinds of 
dollars-and-cents assessments of Proposition 186, the conclusions they draw 
will have a big effect on the outcome of the election, both sides agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the organized opposition to the initiative has come from employers, 
who pay the lion's share of health insurance premiums in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the groups opposing Proposition 186, designed to replace the private 
health insurance system with one run by the state, are the California Chamber 
of Commerce, the California Manufacturers Assn., the Health Insurance Assn. of 
America, the National Federation of Independent Business and the California 
Restaurant Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But sponsors of Proposition 186 have been making a concerted effort to obtain 
business-oriented support of their own. They claim some success, such as 
getting the support of Ted Williams, the chief executive officer of Bell 
Industries, a firm that distributes electronic components to industry and 
generates about $500 million a year in sales. Williams is among the 500 
corporate chiefs who have endorsed Proposition 186. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he has been alarmed for years about escalating health care costs 
and the problems faced by the 6 million Californians who currently lack any 
kind of health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the financing of the initiative would come from a new payroll tax on 
business. Under the measure, businesses would face an escalating tax rate, 
depending on the number of employees of each company. Firms with one to nine 
employees would be taxed an additional 4.4% of their payroll; those with 10 to 
24 full-time or equivalent workers would pay 6%; the rate for 25 to 49 
employees would be 7% and firms with 50 or more full-time employees would pay 
the top rate of 8.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Industries currently spends about 12% of its payroll providing health 
benefits to its 1,500 employees, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his company's savings would come from lower payouts as measured by 
current premiums versus the tax hike, lower workers' compensation costs based 
on the initiative's intent to fold that system into the state health plan, and 
reduced payments for internal administration of health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell executive likes the promise of immediate savings, as well as what he 
believes will be a cap on future cost increases. "Our health insurance costs 
have gone up for the past four years at double the rate of inflation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, at Hewlett-Packard, headquartered in the Bay Area, the experience has 
been quite different. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Beall, the electronics firm's government affairs manager, said that 
Hewlett-Packard has kept health insurance costs down to about 7% of its payroll 
-- 5.9% of that paid for by the company and 1 1/2% by employees -- so the 8.9% 
tax would represent a major increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax increases would help pay for a wide range of medical and mental health 
benefits, such as hospitalization, prescription drugs and some long-term care 
expenses. The precise benefits have not yet been established. They would be 
created by a state health commissioner who would be elected in a statewide 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the initiative's outline, however, Beall said the package of 
benefits promised by Proposition 186 may not equal the benefits offered by the 
plans her company provides to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not convinced the state can do as good a job managing costs as we can 
do. Over the last five years our costs have been held to increases of less than 
5% a year. At the same time we have been able to improve our benefits," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the measure consider opposition by corporations such as 
Hewlett-Packard key to defeating the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen very few measures where our membership -- both large and small 
businesses -- are as united as they are against 186," said Ray Remy, president 
of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, which represents about 2,000 
businesses. "The business community generally is concerned about a program that 
creates a very large state bureaucracy, a budget that would be under the 
control of a directly elected health commissioner, a budget which in the 
beginning would be the size of the current state budget and has the prospect of 
being twice that size. That makes people pretty uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Wiebe, a spokesman for the opposition campaign, said similarly strong 
opposition was being mounted throughout the state. "Support of business is 
critical to defeating this initiative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiebe said businesses are concerned not only about costs to their own 
companies, but also about implications for the state's economy. One study 
predicted that 300,000 jobs would be lost if the measure passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by large contributions from insurance companies and health care providers, 
businesses have contributed all of the $6 million raised so far to mount the 
campaign to defeat Proposition 186. Corporations have also distributed 1 
million brochures, bumper stickers and fact sheets to their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the opposition of the large business associations, supporters of 
the initiative have been going directly to owners of small businesses, hoping 
to split them off. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument is that with a top tax rate of 8.9%, many businesses will come 
out dollars ahead under Proposition 186. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Hopcraft, a spokesman for the "yes" campaign, said early opposition by 
big chambers of commerce shut off debate in the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made a tremendous effort to get around the chambers by going directly 
to the business people," Hopcraft said. "When we have been able to do that we 
have been very successful. If we have a fair shot with any business owner who 
is currently purchasing a health insurance policy, we get them." 
</P>
<P>
 But one vote he will not get belongs to Marvin Saul, the owner of Junior's 
Restaurant, a busy Westside deli. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul said he currently spends 3.3% of his payroll on health insurance and a 
tax increase as required under Proposition 186 might force him out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Restaurants operate on an extremely narrow profit margin," he said. "The 
government has screwed everything else up. How can it be expected to replace 
the private health insurance system?"

ROBERT LANSING; STARRED IN HIT 1960S TV SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Lansing, Broadway, film and television actor who starred in the series 
"12 O'Clock High," has died. 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-year-old actor, who lived in Manhattan, died Sunday of cancer in a New 
York City hospice. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of San Diego, Lansing made his acting debut in 1951 on Broadway in 
"Stalag 17." His craggy good looks and stentorian voice earned him continuing 
stage work. Among his Broadway credits were "The Little Foxes," "Suddenly Last 
Summer," "Cyrano de Bergerac" and "Charley's Aunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Off-Broadway, his work included "Father," the "Sea Plays" of Eugene O'Neill 
and two one-man shows, "Damian" and "The Disciple of Discontent." 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing's motion picture roles included "A Gathering of Eagles" and "Under the 
Yum Yum Tree." 
</P>
<P>
 On television, he appeared in episodes of such hits as "Star Trek," "Alfred 
Hitchcock Presents," "The Twilight Zone" and "Murder, She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lansing is probably best remembered as the authoritarian Brig. Gen. Frank 
Savage in "12 O'Clock High." The ABC drama series about World War II bomber 
pilots aired from Sept. 18, 1964, through Jan. 13, 1967. Lansing's character 
died at the beginning of the second season.

CARL SHARSMITH; NATURALIST AT YOSEMITE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carl Sharsmith, the ranger-naturalist whose nearly six decades at Yosemite 
National Park made him a national attraction in his own right, has died at his 
San Jose home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharsmith was 91 when he died Oct. 14 and was the National Park Service's 
oldest ranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharsmith's first park job was as a ranger-naturalist in Yosemite's Tuolumne 
Meadows in 1931. He became an alpine botanist who took visitors through 
Tuolumne Meadows, advising them to "look down, you might see something." 
</P>
<P>
 The park service said Sharsmith, who was interviewed by many newspaper and 
magazine writers over the years and was the subject of the book "Mountain Sage" 
by Elizabeth O'Neill, had "explored every nook and cranny of the park" during 
his lengthy career. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York, Sharsmith moved to California, where he taught school during 
the winter and began using his summer vacations to work as a ranger. He joined 
the National Park Service permanently in 1953 while teaching at Cal State San 
Jose, where he was a botany professor from 1950 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired as a permanent park employee in 1973 but continued as a seasonal 
ranger until his death.

RATE OF TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY FALLS AFTER LONG RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rate at which American teen-agers are having babies has dropped by 2%, 
marking a sudden turnaround from a skyrocketing increase that had totaled 27% 
since 1986, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it's a real change," said Stephanie Ventura, a statistician who wrote 
the report for the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics."It reverses a 
pattern where it had been going up 5, 6, 7% a year from 1986 on." 
</P>
<P>
 The center calculated the nation's birth trends by analyzing the 4.07 million 
birth certificates filed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For every 1,000 women ages 15 to 19 in 1992, the center reported 60.7 births. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news on teen-age births was somewhat shadowed by the 1992 birth 
report finding that many babies -- 7.1% -- still are born too small. 
</P>
<P>
 Babies that are born weighing less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces are at increased 
risk of death during early infancy and of developmental problems.

OXNARD COLLEGE CELEBRATES OPENING OF SPORTS COMPLEX; ATHLETICS: NEW 
$5.2-MILLION, 60,000-SQUARE-FOOT CENTER CULMINATES YEARS OF EFFORT BY EDUCATORS 
TO BRING A GYM TO CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Oxnard College center Jerome Archie remembers taking a bus across town and 
waiting for the Santa Clara High School basketball team to finish its drills so 
the Oxnard Condors could take the court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday afternoon, he was shooting hoops with Ventura County Community College 
District Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin on the hardwood in the college's new 
$5.2-million sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a new beginning," the 20-year-old business major said at the 
facility's formal dedication ceremony. "I think we'll be a lot more competitive 
this year, just because of the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of administrators, teachers and students joined a U.S. Navy honor guard 
and local elected officials at the grand opening, which culminated years of 
effort on the part of Oxnard College physical education instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 60,000-square-foot sports center boasts numerous classrooms, four 
racquetball courts, specialized weight-training equipment, a physical fitness 
center and more. Students will have first priority to use the gymnasium, 
although officials said they plan to open it to the community as often as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really can't appreciate what we've gone through in the last 20 years 
unless you were on the teaching staff or a student," said Juan Hernandez, the 
campus sports coordinator who helped oversee construction of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time, but it's here, and that's great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin told audience members at the most recent governing board meeting that he 
would trade baskets with any challengers at the gym's dedication. For a few 
minutes Tuesday, however, he was clearly outmatched by Archie in the 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have played him," the chancellor jokingly said later. "I was just 
warming up. I've seen him play before. He's tall, but he doesn't move very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin and Trustee Gregory P. Cole swapped baskets in front of the 300 or so 
people who attended the dedication. Each needed the practice, however, after 
missing their first jump shots but then hitting some layups. 
</P>
<P>
 In opening remarks, college President Elise D. Schneider said she remembered 
her first visit to the campus five years ago when she was named to her 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a lot of barren land, a lot of weeds and a sprinkling of buildings," 
she told the audience. "I thought, 'Where's the gymnasium? There must be one.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 But there was none. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we are here to celebrate a landmark in the history of Oxnard College," 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next on the drawing board for Oxnard College is a sprawling building for 
letters and science. Plans for that structure are under way now, but completion 
is still years off. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hoopla surrounding the formal dedication Tuesday, Hernandez said 
there are several things the facility needs. 
</P>
<P>
 A scoreboard is ordered and set to be delivered next month, and landscaping is 
scheduled to be completed throughout the upcoming season, Hernandez said. But 
the building will still lack a ticket booth and concession stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're selling ads on the scoreboard to fund those sorts of unmet needs," 
Hernandez said. "We could probably finish the ticket booth and concession stand 
for less than $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To help raise the money, the Oxnard College Classified Senate, a group made up 
of the campus's non-teaching staff, was selling satin-finished brass leaves to 
be hung on a custom-designed oak tree that will be displayed in the gym's foyer 
for $25 each. 
</P>
<P>
 College Vice President Irene Pinkard urged audience members at the dedication 
to spend $10 on personal messages that will be placed into a time capsule to be 
opened in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore guard Dustin Spoor, a 22-year-old physical therapy major, said the 
Condors would play with much more confidence on a home court of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more comforting having your own gym," he said. "It'll make the 
rest of the players better and motivate them to work a lot harder." 
</P>
<P>
 The Condor basketball season opens Nov. 11, but the first home game in the new 
building is set for the next day.

COURT DOUBLES JUDGES HEARING FELONY CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fearing that defendants will be freed because their cases are taking too long 
to get to court, Ventura County judicial officials said Tuesday that they will 
double the number of judges hearing felony trials. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, which would reassign judges now hearing civil cases, is designed to 
head off what local court officials say could be a potential disaster: Without 
the extra jurists, they might be forced to cut loose some criminal defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent such a scenario, the number of judges hearing criminal cases is 
being increased from five to 10, Superior Court Presiding Judge Melinda A. 
Johnson said. Under the new system, the criminal caseload should be reduced to 
a manageable level within three weeks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is sort of a crisis situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Felony cases awaiting trial in the county have reached an all-time high of 
230, officials said. Some judges have more than 50 trials scheduled for their 
courtroom, Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, criminal charges must be dismissed against defendants who are 
not given a trial within 60 days of arraignment, unless they waive their 
speedy-trial right. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they believe some defendants are refusing to accept plea 
negotiations in the hopes that charges will be dropped. But authorities would 
shut down the entire civil section of the court before allowing that to happen, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they also are worried about the enormity of the court's civil 
caseload. As of two weeks ago, 6,579 civil cases -- some dating back to July, 
1989 -- were awaiting trial in the county, Assistant Executive Officer Vincent 
Ordonez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Johnson said she does not want to give short shrift to civil cases, 
which involve disputes of $25,000 or more, she stressed that criminal cases 
must take priority.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the new system, Johnson said the five civil judges will be assigned 
criminal trials as soon as the cases are ready for jury selection. If no 
criminal cases are ready, the civil judges will stick to their normal 
assignments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to have any judge sitting around waiting for a criminal 
case," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 14 elected or appointed Superior Court judges in the county, two work 
in Juvenile Court and two in Family Court. The other 10 had been divided 
between civil and criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials disagree on the reasons for the sudden glut of criminal cases in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the tough-on-crime "three strikes" measure is one culprit. She 
also cited the passage in November of Proposition 172, which increased funding 
to police, prosecutors and other law-enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of those two factors, "We've just have a lot of cases that piled up as 
time has gone by," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, she said, two of the five Superior Court judges now hearing 
criminal case are tied up in lengthy trials and unable to help reduce the 
caseload.  
</P>
<P>
 But Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said prosecutors do not believe 
that the three-strikes law -- which calls for prison sentences of 25 years to 
life for some repeat felons -- has been a burden for the local court system. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said his office had only filed nine three-strikes cases through the end 
of September. Prosecutors had also filed about 60 two-strike cases -- which 
double some criminal sentences, McGee said. About one-third of those cases did 
not go to trial, thanks to early guilty pleas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can say that 'three strikes' has anything to do with our 
local situation," McGee said.  
</P>
<P>
 McGee attributed the increased criminal caseload in part to the county's 
growing population and the resurgence of the drug methamphetamine.  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever is behind the growth in criminal court cases, prosecutors and defense 
attorneys said the court is right to assign more judges to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court is taking prudent action in light of the fact that the (criminal) 
inventory has grown considerably," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman also lauded the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems to me that they are doing what they need to do to get the work 
done," Clayman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clayman denied that his attorneys have tried to take advantage of the 
judge shortage by advising clients against early guilty pleas in hopes of 
getting charges dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 He did say, however, that with the new tougher laws, "any conscientious lawyer 
is certainly going to ask for more trials."

SCHOOLS ASK PARENTS TO FOIL WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alerted by rumors that students are planning a mass walkout to protest 
Proposition 187, Oxnard school officials are urging parents to persuade their 
children to stay at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at the district's five high schools are reportedly planning to hold 
simultaneous demonstrations at some point before Election Day, possibly this 
week, Oxnard Union High School District Supt. Bill Studt said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 Rio Mesa High School students staged a walkout Friday to protest the 
ballot initiative, which would ban illegal immigrants from public school 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials fear that the rumored mass protest at Camarillo, Channel Islands, 
Hueneme, Oxnard and Rio Mesa high schools could lead thousands of youths to 
leave school. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing at a news conference with officers from the Oxnard Police 
Department, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and the California Highway 
Patrol, Studt said school officials know many students strongly oppose 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 But school and police officials are concerned that bands of students marching 
on busy streets could get hit by passing cars, Studt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this simply as an issue of danger to the students," Studt said. "We're 
concerned we have a tragedy in the making." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides worrying about students' safety, Studt said authorities are also 
concerned protesters may repeat the criminal actions of some youths in Friday's 
march, such as vandalizing property and throwing rocks at cars. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated that as many as two dozen Rio Mesa High students were involved in 
such crimes, but said officials were still trying to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rio Mesa walkout began about 9 a.m. Friday when hundreds of students 
remained in the school courtyard instead of moving on to their second class. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Rio Mesa officials had been forewarned about the protest, they tried 
to prevent it by urging students to hold a forum on campus to air their views 
on the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But dozens of youths began scaling the school's chain-link fence, leading 
school officials eventually to open a gate and allow hundreds of students to 
leave campus. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said most of these students returned to Rio Mesa later in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent what happened at Rio Mesa from occurring on a larger scale 
throughout the district, school officials have decided, out of desperation, to 
try something different. 
</P>
<P>
 They are requesting help from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides asking parents to urge that their children refrain from joining 
marches, school officials are also inviting adults to volunteer at schools over 
the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The more parents and other adults on the campuses, Studt said, the less likely 
it is that students will defy school officials by walking out. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials are also trying again a technique that failed at Rio Mesa: 
They are encouraging students to debate Proposition 187 during an organized 
forum at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Studt acknowledged such school forums would fail to satisfy students' desire 
to demonstrate their views to the public. But he said, "There's a more 
compelling issue than that, and that's their safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the district's efforts, Studt said some students will probably leave 
school anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 All students who participate in walkouts will be treated as truants, facing 
possible after-school detention or other punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Cmdr. Jaime C. Skeeters said officers will arrest students who 
break the law with acts of vandalism or efforts to bar traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 But if students who march remain orderly, Skeeters and other police officials 
at the news conference said they would try only to protect the youths from 
traffic and other dangers.

VENTURA COUNCILMAN UNDERBILLED ON TRASH SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura city councilman's business is one of only two commercial accounts in 
the city that has been consistently underbilled for trash service by the city's 
trash hauler, city officials have announced.  
</P>
<P>
 The billing discrepancy came to light during the summer when the City 
Council's environmental committee did its annual review of trash rates. An 
internal audit by E.J. Harrison & Sons, the city's trash hauler, found seven 
"apparent mistakes" in the 2,880 commercial accounts it services in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of those seven mistakes turned out to be clerical or categorical errors. 
The audit concluded that the other two -- a restaurant and Councilman Jim 
Monahan's business -- were clients who were paying less for their trash service 
than they should have because Harrison sent them incorrect bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's audit showed that Monahan should have paid about $1,250 for the 
trash service he received, but instead paid only about $460. Monahan and 
Harrison officials, however, have since agreed that the bin used by a company 
renting from Monahan was too large. They concurred that he should have paid 
about $860 -- the charge for a bin half the size of the one Harrison gave him 
-- and have agreed that he still owes about $400. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant that was undercharged has settled its bill, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city officials think that amount is still too low and that Monahan 
should have to pay the entire balance due on the original $1,250 sum. Because 
of that, the committee will make a recommendation today on whether Monahan 
should pay about $790 more or, as he has requested, only the smaller $400 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan said he did not deliberately underpay the trash hauler, E. J. Harrison 
& Sons. "I only paid what I was billed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan paid for his tenant to throw away two 64-gallon barrels of trash every 
week from February, 1993, through June, 1994, the trash hauler's records show.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the tenant was actually receiving a 600-gallon trash bin, according 
to the records. Monahan's tenant, a company called Total Equipment Rental, is 
next door to his firm, American Welding Co. Monahan says his tenant never 
needed anything bigger than a 300-gallon bin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle says Monahan should pay back the larger amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was me, I would've paid it all and not made an issue of it," he said. 
"We're city council members and should be held to a higher standard. I'm 
surprised he's fighting it."  
</P>
<P>
 Monahan responded that he is not requesting an unusual privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect to be treated like other businesses," he said. "I'm not asking for 
any special treatment."  
</P>
<P>
 On that count, Harrison officials agree with Monahan. It is their standard 
business practice, they say, to back charge a customer only for the service 
that customer says was needed. The hauler then monitors the amount of trash 
picked up from that customer's location for a month or two, to see if the 
customer's claim is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monahan's case, his tenant uses less than the 300-gallon trash bin that is 
now in the side yard, and might qualify for a smaller container than that, said 
Tom Chiarodit, Harrison's recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 But that, city officials say, may not be the point. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison and the city recently signed an exclusive franchise agreement, giving 
Harrison a regulated monopoly on trash pickup in Ventura. That means Harrison 
operates, in effect, as a private arm of the city government and should be held 
up to the same standards as a municipal agency, said Steve Chase, Ventura's 
environmental affairs coordinator.  
</P>
<P>
 "This may make great business sense, but we have a different obligation here," 
Chase said. "First, we've got the obligation of fairness in a public setting. 
Secondly, there's our fiduciary responsibility. No one customer should 
subsidize another customer for the services he receives." 
</P>
<P>
 Chase said he was elected to take his concerns back to the committee, rather 
than to deal with the issue himself. "I don't believe that's the kind of 
decision that should be made behind closed doors at City Hall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan said if the committee recommends today that he pay the higher bill, he 
will consult with the city attorney and appeal the matter to the full council, 
if necessary.

CHOPPERS READY FOR 2ND MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barring high winds or a surprise shower, a trio of helicopters will lift off 
from the Camarillo Airport tonight and spray pesticide over 16 square miles of 
residences, schools and orchards in the state's second assault on the 
crop-destroying Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said tonight's operation, part of a six-month campaign to eradicate 
the voracious pest, will follow the same pattern as the first spraying two 
weeks ago. Helicopters will cross into the spray zone at 9 p.m. sharp, then 
return to the airport twice to refuel and refill tanks holding a mixture of 
malathion and corn syrup bait. 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying is expected to be finished by 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're almost getting to a normal routine," county Agricultural Commissioner 
Earl McPhail said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters called for mostly clear skies and an afternoon sea breeze dying 
down after sunset. Weak sundowner winds were predicted for Santa Barbara County 
but were not expected to reach into Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of county residents calling themselves Group Against Spraying People 
said they plan to stage a small protest at the airport before the helicopters 
lift off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows what the long-term effects are?" asked GASP organizer Terri 
Gaishin. "They have no proof this isn't going to damage people in the long 
term. People are buying into the county's downplaying of the dangers and 
effectiveness of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gary Feldman, the county's public health officer, said 12 people reported 
adverse effects after the first spraying, and one Camarillo doctor turned in a 
pesticide illness report. 
</P>
<P>
 The physician said his patient suffered "asthma symptoms and a lot of 
anxiety." The doctor said, however, that based on his exam, he did not believe 
the problems resulted from exposure to the malathion mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of illnesses reported in Ventura County corresponds to the response 
in Riverside County when the city of Corona was sprayed for six months, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those reports, Feldman said he does not believe aerial spraying poses 
a threat to the general public. All the problems reported in Riverside County 
disappeared within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's been clear all along that there are individuals who have some 
special sensitivity," he said. "You do something to 35,000 people and some 
people are going to have effects." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday extended its 
declaration of a local emergency for another two weeks so the county could 
collect state or federal emergency funds if they become available. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors also praised Camarillo residents for supporting the 
eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went off with little problem two weeks ago, and I don't anticipate 
anything this time either," said Supervisor Maggie Kildee, who represents the 
Camarillo area. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the supervisors, McPhail said he was pleased with the eradication 
efforts, as well as with the response of a Japanese delegation that inspected 
the quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation had been dispatched to Ventura County to determine if Japan 
should ban fruit from the entire county or state. Japan announced Friday it 
would embargo fruit only from the quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pulled off a real coup," McPhail said. "We turned them around 180 degrees. 
They left happy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McPhail said residents should expect 10 to 12 aerial treatments over the next 
six months, depending on the weather this winter. A warmer winter would shorten 
the life cycle of the Mediterranean fruit fly and require fewer treatments if 
no new flies are found. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-three flies have been found in Ventura County, all but one on the 
property of St. John's Seminary off Lewis Road. No flies have been found since 
Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Cooperative Medfly Project said the number of calls to an 
information hot line have dropped off since the day of the spraying, when lines 
were flooded with 1,200 inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they received 82 calls Tuesday. The hot line (1-800-491-1899) 
will operate today from 7 a.m. until the operation is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "The residents have been through this once before," said Carla Agar, a 
spokeswoman for the California Department of Food and Agriculture. "They seem 
to be fairly comfortable with the operation, and I don't anticipate any 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who work and live in Camarillo were gearing up for the second spraying 
by picking up plastic car covers and organizing volunteer crews to wash down 
schools within the spray zone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Love, assistant principal at Las Colinas School, said parents planned to 
be on the elementary campus early Thursday to wipe the sticky drops from picnic 
tables, doorknobs and metal playground equipment. As a precaution, he said, 
students would be kept off the grass the day after the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of growers and packinghouse managers, called the Ventura County 
Fruitfly Action Cooperative Taskforce, also planned to pitch in with the school 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The group Tuesday was passed out plastic sheets to protect car finishes. 
Before the first spraying, lines of residents snatched up about 15,000 plastic 
sheets within a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, the demand appears to be lower, said Elisabeth Brokaw, the 
task force's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all very calm and there are no lines," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the tarps, call the task force at 642-1811. What to Do 
Aerial spraying of malathion is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 State and federal agencies report that malathion has been studied extensively, 
and there is no evidence that it causes cancer, birth defects, nerve damage, 
eye damage or cumulative injury. But residents are cautioned to avoid exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also recommend that the following precautions be taken during and 
after spraying: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remain indoors if possible while spraying is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 * If outdoors, avoid looking up at the falling droplets. 
</P>
<P>
 * If in contact with spray, wash residue from skin and clothing with soap and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not leave laundry outdoors when spraying is scheduled. If laundry is 
soiled, wash before wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put your car in a garage or carport or cover it with a plastic tarp to 
prevent paint damage when spraying is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your car is outside during spraying, wash it the next day to prevent 
paint damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse plastic skylights and awnings the day after spraying to prevent 
permanent stains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cover fish ponds before spraying and uncover shortly after to minimize water 
contamination while avoiding oxygen depletion. 
</P>
<P>
 * After an area has been sprayed, wash outdoor eating areas, playground 
equipment and objects such as toys and pet food dishes that may have been 
outside during spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dogs and cats can be taken inside for their owners' peace of mind, but they 
will not be harmed if left outside. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid harvesting home-grown fruits and vegetables for three days after 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse all fresh fruits and vegetables with water before cooking or eating 
them, just as you should with store-bought items. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional information about malathion is available by calling (800) 491-1899. 
Medfly Quarantine and Eradication Areas Three Bell helicopters are scheduled to 
leave Camarillo Airport and arrive in the Medlfy spray zone at 9 tonight. They 
will head first to the northeast end of the zone and fly south from there. 
During the three-to-four-hour operation, the helicopters will return to the 
airport twice to reload. Source: State Department of Food and Agriculture

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; POLICE NET 74 
STUDENTS IN TRUANCY SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They hit all the regular hangouts: Taco Bell, the local bowling alley, the 
streets behind the high school. 
</P>
<P>
 In a morning's work, police round up 74 students -- a few kids here, another 
dozen there, a couple more someplace else. Then they load them into patrol cars 
and take them back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem? Truancy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not new. Lots of kids have done it. So what's the big deal?  
</P>
<P>
 Usually, police say, children ditch classes to party with friends during the 
day, while their parents are working. But increasingly, residents and business 
owners have been reporting AWOL students vandalizing nearby neighborhoods 
during school hours, stealing from local businesses and spraying graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not here to baby-sit your kids," Officer Ken Knox sternly told the 
principal of Taft High School after he brought in 31 students last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox, a senior lead officer for the area around Taft, said that typically 
after a truancy sweep, crime plunges in the area around Winnetka Avenue and 
Ventura Boulevard, where the high school is located. That also means that he 
receives fewer calls from residents afraid of loitering teen-agers or from 
business owners complaining about shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's truant sweep netted students from Taft, Reseda, Birmingham, 
Granada Hills, Canoga and Grant high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And the schools were not always happy to be getting their reluctant students 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just what we needed, a major interruption," said a frustrated Jeff Halpern, 
the Reseda High School dean of students, as the truant students were shuffled 
in and out of his office for permits to get into class late. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there is a need for this, but we wish there was another way." 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I don't like is the kids' flippant attitude when they are 
brought in," Halpern said. "There is no such thing as respect anymore."  
</P>
<P>
 Halpern said school officials are often unsuccessful in attempts to contact 
parents, or fail to get a response from them. Treatment for repeat offenders is 
usually school cleanup duty or detention. "We tend to see the same kids again 
and again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police have a more determined attitude. The West Valley Division has made 
a commitment to reach the parents of the students its officers pick up, logging 
the names in a truancy book to keep track of them. Those students found to be 
habitual truants are arrested. Serious offenders can be made wards of the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest sweep, police got the usual stories -- like the boy who told 
officers that he was simply walking home from Taft to use the bathroom because 
the restrooms at school "were too dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's pure denial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't ditching," said a 16-year-old Woodland Hills girl. "We were just 
walking to the car to get something and they stopped us." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now my parents are never going to trust me," said a 16-year-old Taft junior. 
"They probably won't let me bring the car to school anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Corbin Bowl, a popular spot on Fridays with students getting an early 
start on the weekend, "There have been times when about 30 of them came in and 
bowled and then just left without paying," said Shane Ward, who works the front 
desk at the newly reopened Tarzana bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now everyone prepays." 
</P>
<P>
 But police say the amusements aren't always so innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters had to extinguish a burning tree believed to have been set afire 
by two boys playing hooky in Reseda last month. In another incident, neighbors 
complained of a group of teen-agers smoking marijuana on their lawn. And for 
the past few months, supermarket managers have complained of increased 
shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are drifting off into neighborhoods, and sometimes they break into 
cars and steal the stereos. Others go into abandoned houses and have parties," 
Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The area around Taft High School has the highest car-theft rate in the West 
Valley Division, said Knox, "and quite a bit is attributed to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make the message clear to the principal that he has to control his 
kids," said Knox.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PANEL ASKED TO PROBE ARTS PLAZA 
FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks City Council candidate Tuesday asked the Ventura County grand 
jury to investigate the financing of the new Civic Arts Plaza, claiming that 
city officials mishandled taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the grand jury, council candidate Chuck Morsa said city 
officials misused city funds to pay for the recently completed $86-million 
civic and performing arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Judy Lazar denied that the city did anything wrong 
when piecing together arts plaza funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The finances were handled appropriately, legally and above board," said 
Lazar, who is also a candidate in the Nov. 8 election. "It's his right to ask 
for an investigation, but we didn't do anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's financing of the plaza has relied heavily on debt, with bonds and 
internal loans accounting for 75% of the total budget. By borrowing internally, 
the city used funds that otherwise could have been used to pave roads, run 
libraries, build trails and maintain countless other city services. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Morsa called the financing plan "stealing from the public." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lazar, as well as Councilman Frank Schillo and Mayor Alex Fiore, have said 
internal financing will save the city money in the long run. Also, they have 
said the new civic center is worth the expense because it will serve for 
decades as a rallying point for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is a citizens' panel appointed by Superior Court judges to 
indict criminal suspects, review government performance and investigate 
government agencies accused of wrongdoing. The 19-member body issues its 
findings in an annual report released in the summer. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; STUDENT QUALIFIES AS WRITE-IN CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Simi Valley college student who last month announced plans to 
run a write-in campaign for mayor has filed enough signatures to qualify as a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Rodriguez, a political science major at Moorpark College, filed two 
dozen signatures that passed muster with election officials.Simi Valley 
requires write-in candidates to provide signatures of at least 20 registered 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 As a write-in candidate, Rodriguez's name will not appear on the ballot. 
Instead, his name will appear on a list of write-in candidates posted at 
polling places. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez faces incumbent Mayor Greg Stratton, who is running otherwise 
unopposed for a fifth term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this race as a way of testing the waters," Rodriguez said. "I'm 
learning all the ins and outs of running a campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who works two part-time jobs as a bank teller and security guard, 
said he expects to spend about $200 of his own money on the campaign to pay for 
flyers and signs. 
</P>
<P>
 A former center for the Royal High School football team, Rodriguez has 
attended several games to pass out flyers and drum up support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting a lot of positive reaction," Rodriguez said. "People are really 
happy to see that there's more than one person to vote for for mayor." SARA

 Seven-year-old Monique Porsandeh quietly stood behind her classmates at 
University School on Tuesday, waiting to tie her bright red ribbon to the 
elementary school's chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to tie them to the gate to show we are drug-free," she said. "We 
don't want the school to have drugs or alcohol, or children to have drugs or 
alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 Symbolic gestures such as Monique's ribbon tying are taking place not only at 
the Thousand Oaks campus but at schools around the state this week as part of 
Red Ribbon Week -- five days of activities aimed at teaching children the 
dangers of substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to do our part to explain what drugs are and (explain) the 
consequences of drugs," University Principal Alan Friedenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the ribbon-tying ceremony, some teachers at University are 
showing videos on drug prevention and encouraging class discussions, 
Friedenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is doing something a little different," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Cerritos Intermediate School in Thousand Oaks, students tied ribbons to 
trees, fences, buildings -- even the flagpole -- in recognition of Red Ribbon 
Week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it didn't move, we put a ribbon on it," Principal Jo-Ann Yoos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, students at Medea Creek Middle School in Oak Park will spell out 
drug-free messages by standing in formations on the athletic field, while a 
cameraman flies overhead in a helicopter to record their phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 And tonight in Simi Valley, a community rally will begin at 6:30 p.m. at the 
Simi Valley High School athletic stadium to celebrate the anti-drug week. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and students participating in University's informal ribbon-tying 
ceremony Tuesday said the various activities held this week reinforce the 
message to say "No" to drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (children) aren't aware, it is easy to fall into the trap and succumb to 
peer pressure," parent Twila Cook said. "I think if you try to reach them at a 
young age, they will know that the answer is 'No.' " TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; OFFICIALS WARN OF ILLEGAL MEAT SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about reports that door-to-door solicitors are selling meat, poultry 
and fish illegally in Camarillo, Ventura County officials have warned that such 
products may be substandard and cost more than regular market prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Korth, director of the county's Weights and Measures Division, said 
street sales of meat are in violation of local and state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attempts to sell meat, fish and poultry by the box or serving are illegal," 
Korth said.  
</P>
<P>
 "California law states that these items can only be sold by net weight. If 
they are selling in the Camarillo area, you can be sure they are active in all 
areas of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Korth said that county residents are being advised not to confront the sellers 
but to report them to county officials, local police departments or city 
business license divisions.  
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COLLEGE STUDENT ARRESTED IN FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard police arrested a Ventura College student Tuesday on suspicion of 
murder, then held a news conference to ask gang members to prevent the slaying 
from escalating into warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Charles Dunham said a "love triangle" was the motive for the south Oxnard 
shooting on Monday that killed Jerome Hurst, 25, of Oxnard and critically 
wounded Vernon Hunter, 27, also of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing to indicate that this is gang-related," Assistant Chief James 
A. Latimer said. But police said they had information that gang members were 
plotting to retaliate against the arrested man, Zolly Terry Jr., 21, and had 
been lurking around his residence shortly after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rival gangs are of sufficient size and the intelligence is sufficiently 
good that we really need to appeal to them not to take any action," Latimer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police brought along police chaplain Lonnie G. McCowan to help make their 
point. "I don't think that any gang members need to feel that they need to 
retaliate," McCowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover Oxnard police followed Terry's relatives from his home, where the 
family picked up his clothes, to a motel near Los Angeles International 
Airport, authorities said. Terry emerged from the motel and was arrested about 
2 p.m. at a fast-food restaurant near the airport, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went down very smooth," Dunham said. He said the Los Angeles police and 
airport police assisted in the arrest, and that Terry was transferred back to 
the Oxnard Police Station, where he was booked and held for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Details on the motive for the shooting were sketchy Tuesday afternoon. Police 
said the matter was still under investigation, but said Hunter had been 
romantically involved with Terry's sister, who is pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter was living with a second woman. Dunham said Hunter had asked Hurst to 
be in his apartment to help protect Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry and Hunter were known to Oxnard police as members of two different 
gangs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 2 p.m. Monday, Terry fired more than six shots from a .380 
automatic pistol in the living room of Hunter's apartment in the 1400 block of 
Friedrich Lane, police said. Police said the shots hit Hurst and Hunter several 
times each. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they had not recovered the weapon as of Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter managed to stagger out of the apartment and tell authorities what 
happened before he was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurst's co-workers at Furr's Cafeteria in Oxnard fondly remembered him 
Tuesday. "He was a very nice, well-mannered young man. The customers loved 
him," said cafeteria manager Al Madle. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry was a league champion sprinter at Hueneme High School in 1991. IRA E.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; DESIGN COURSE SEEKS LIGHTING INSTRUCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mission College is seeking an instructor to teach a new interior design course 
on lighting during the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 The course will meet from 7 to 10 p.m. on Tuesdays, beginning Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Silvers, director of the college's interior design discipline begun last 
year, said the ideal candidate would have an industry background in lighting 
and possess an associate degree in interior design or related field. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission College has the only complete interior design program in the Los 
Angeles Community College District. Programs offered include a one-year 
certificate program in interior design and an associate in arts degree program, 
which transfers to four-year colleges.  
</P>
<P>
 Interior design courses at the college formerly were offered through the 
family and consumer studies discipline.  
</P>
<P>
 The new design course offerings have been in high demand, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to be attracting people from Palmdale and as far away as Long Beach," 
Silvers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in applying to teach the course on lighting can call (818) 
364-7693. 
</P>
<P>
 Silvers noted that the college recently opened a new student chapter of the 
American Society of Interior Designers: "Our students can go out and earn a 
very nice living with just a two-year degree in interior design. Students can 
also transfer, but in this industry, it's not really necessary."TIM MAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; RESIDENTS CHALLENGE ANTI-SMOKING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anti-smoking ordinances can be hazardous to the health of bingo fund-raisers, 
a Ventura citizens committee charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of about 10 Ventura residents, many of them dedicated smokers, 
gathered Tuesday on the steps of City Hall to propose loosening the city's 
anti-smoking ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-appointed group declared that scientific research shows good 
ventilation systems can minimize the effects of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has presented its recommendations to the council's committee on 
smoking. Councilman Jim Monahan, a committee member and supporter of the 
group's recommendations, joined them at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that the city ordinance is needlessly restrictive, the advisory 
group is calling for the city to allow smoking in all restaurants, hotels and 
recreational centers that have separate ventilation systems for designated 
smoking areas, committee spokesman Patrick Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also recommends that private clubs be exempt from the ordinance 
except when they host public events, such as bingo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology of today is sufficient to take care of secondhand smoke," 
Hughes said between puffs on a thin cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing city law bans smoking in all public places including offices, 
banks, malls and restaurants, except for bar and outdoor seating areas. It also 
prohibits smoking at bingo parlors. 
</P>
<P>
 One result of the anti-smoking ordinance is that the Knights of Columbus of 
Ventura will not hold its annual Thanksgiving dinner for the needy this year, 
because its bingo games raised so little money, bingo chairman Chuck Ivie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie, who is not a smoker, said attendance at the club's twice-weekly bingo 
games dropped from 200 to 40 after the city ordinance took effect in January. 
The club previously raised about $10,000 per month from the games, he said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA, OXNARD; 3 KILLED, 1 INJURED IN SEPARATE 
ACCIDENTS

<P>
 Three men were killed and another was injured in two car accidents that took 
place in Ventura and Oxnard, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ventura crash, which occurred about 11:30 p.m. Monday, 22-year-old 
Eduardo Juevara Carbajal of Ojai died at the scene after the vehicle in which 
he was riding smashed into a tree, said Claude Ball, an officer with the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 A second passenger died early Tuesday at Ventura County Medical Center, Ball 
said. As of late Tuesday, the coroner's office had not released the name of the 
second victim because they had been unable to notify his family.  
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, 21-year-old Juan C. Garcia of Ojai, suffered minor 
injuries and was taken to Ventura County Medical Center, where he was in fair 
condition.  
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, two CHP officers spotted Garcia driving 65 to 70 
m.p.h. north on Ventura Avenue north of Dakota Street and just outside Ventura 
city limits, Ball said.  
</P>
<P>
 When the officers, who were driving south on Ventura Avenue, turned to follow 
Garcia's car, they saw the vehicle strike a palm tree and bounce back to the 
road, Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oxnard accident, 71-year-old Calvin Kittleson died after his car was 
hit broadside by a pickup truck that ran a red light at the intersection of 
Vineyard Avenue and Ventura Road, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kittleson, a Virginia resident who was visiting his son and daughter-in-law in 
Ventura, was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at St. John's Regional 
Medical Center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the pickup truck, 18-year-old Michael Calderwood of Oxnard, did 
not suffer any injuries. He was arrested on suspicion of vehicular 
manslaughter, police said. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; RESIDENTS OF MOBILE HOMES PROTEST TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 700 mobile-home residents in Santa Paula received a surprise from 
the Ventura County tax collector this week: a bill for $25 to help fund the 
Blanchard Community Library. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, hundreds of residents deluged the tax collector's office with 
telephone calls, complaining that they are not obligated to pay the tax because 
they do not own the land on which their trailers sit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard the first phone call, I knew exactly what had happened," said 
Cynthia Simmons, public service manager in tax collector Harold S. Pittman's 
office. "I was here nine years ago when it happened then." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, voters approved a measure that assessed landowners inside the 
Blanchard Community Library District a $25 annual tax to help pay increasing 
operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons said that a list of the district's tax rolls was forwarded to 
Blanchard Library Director Daniel Robles and that it inadvertently included 
mobile-home park residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, when the library district was established, those same residents 
received a $5 bill sent to them by mistake, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know anything about it until the tax bills came out on Monday," 
Robles said. "But if they don't own the land, they're not liable for the tax." 
</P>
<P>
 New letters advising mobile-home park residents not to pay the tax will be 
mailed this week, Simmons said.  
</P>
<P>
 Refunds will be made to those who already paid. JEFF McDONALD

BOARD OF SUPERVISORS GIVES AHMANSON PROJECT 3-YEAR EXTENSION; DEVELOPMENT: 
APPROVAL COMES DESPITE OPPONENTS' THREATS OF ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS. INVOLVED IN 
THE DEAL ARE THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF POTENTIAL PARKLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ignoring threats of lawsuits, Ventura County supervisors Tuesday granted 
Ahmanson Land Co. three more years to turn 10,000 acres into public parkland as 
part of its deal to build a mini-city in the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision was immediately criticized by Calabasas city officials, 
who vowed to sue the county over the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us endless opportunities for litigation," Calabasas Councilwoman 
Lesley Devine said, adding that the board's action offers "a shopping mall" of 
legal possibilities to hogtie the project for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, Calabasas and eight other plaintiffs have stalled the massive 
project planned for a ranch along the Los Angeles County line, arguing that it 
would clog streets and freeways with traffic and increase air pollution in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays caused by those lawsuits, which are now on appeal, prompted 
Ahmanson to request the extension to live up to its part of the deal. Ahmanson 
won the first round in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The original agreement called for Ahmanson to acquire entertainer Bob Hope's 
Jordan Ranch, Runkle Ranch, Corral Canyon and Liberty Canyon properties by 
December, 1995, and sign over 10,000 acres to state and federal park agencies. 
So far, only two of the parcels are in the hands of parks officials, and those 
as a result of a complicated side deal. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Irwindale-based developer fails to deliver all of the parkland, the 
county would automatically remove its permit to build 3,050 dwellings, a town 
center, two golf courses and a 300-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, architect of the original deal, stressed that the 
three-year extension does not alter the agreement in any significant way. 
"Without all of this open space," she said, "there is no project." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, adopted 4 to 1 Tuesday, restates the supervisors' position 
that Ahmanson would have to start over and conduct another lengthy 
environmental review should it renege on its promise. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision also overturned a Planning Commission rejection last month. 
Commissioners said Ahmanson knew lawsuits were inevitable when it agreed to the 
original 1995 deadline. But Assistant County Counsel Andrew Gustafson said 
Tuesday that developers did not "expect the tenacity and ingenuity of 
(opponents') litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan Lacey cast the lone dissenting vote, saying she believed that 
the county could protect more open space by "just saying no" to the Ahmanson 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The board decision followed a two-hour public hearing that featured 16 
speakers, most of them opposed to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two notable exceptions were a spokesman for the Sierra Club and Joseph T. 
Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. They 
said they could support the extension provided that the supervisors held 
Ahmanson to its commitment for public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston's agency could end up controlling about half of the parkland in the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas city officials voiced the most vociferous objections, threatening to 
do whatever is needed to block Ahmanson's proposed 8,600-resident community 
from swamping Calabasas with traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the extension is granted, a new round of lawsuits may be filed," Calabasas 
Mayor Karyn Foley told the supervisors. "The litigation will continue long into 
the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson has not yet settled on a purchase price for the 4,700 acres of Runkle 
Ranch and Corral Canyon, officials said, despite Hope's 1991 pledge to sell all 
four ranches for $29.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Some opponents told the supervisors that they fear that Hope will demand such 
a high price that Ahmanson will ultimately return to county officials saying it 
cannot afford the deal without government help. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson officials declined to respond directly to concerns about purchasing 
Hope's land, saying they first need to overcome court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we've been working on the project for two years, much of the time 
has been spent on litigation," said Donald Brackenbush, president of Ahmanson 
Land. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his staff has also made progress in refining the design of the project 
to cut in half the tons of earth needed to be moved and trees uprooted. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and other Ahmanson officials said they cannot proceed with the deal 
until lawsuits are resolved and they are sure they can build the project.

ELECTIONS / COUNTY SUPERVISORS; MONTGOMERY CHALLENGES MIKELS TO MAKE PUBLIC 
STAND ON PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Declaring Proposition 187 a defining issue in the race for Ventura County 
supervisor, Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery on Tuesday criticized his 
rival Judy Mikels for not taking a public stand on the ballot measure that 
would bar most public services to illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the public has a right to know where she stands before they vote for 
her, whether they agree with her or not," Montgomery said. "What has she got to 
hide?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said Montgomery, a staunch supporter of the controversial statewide 
ballot initiative, is desperate and is using scare tactics in an effort to 
salvage his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a countywide issue," the Simi Valley councilwoman said. "It's a 
state and federal issue. What he's doing is acting in desperation." 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery maintained that voters have a right to know where the 
candidates stand on all issues. He pointed out, for example, that he has not 
been afraid to make public his anti-abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think candidates should divulge how they feel about every issue," he said. 
"I've tried to do that. . . . I don't ant to have any hidden agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels, however, said Montgomery was exploiting the illegal immigration issue 
to boost his candidacy for a countywide post that has little say over the 
issue. The two candidates are running for a seat being vacated by Supervisor 
Vicky Howard, whose 4th District includes Simi Valley, Moorpark and the Santa 
Rosa Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't shown me that he's been supporting this all along," Mikels said. 
"He just sees that it's popular in the (public opinion polls). He's trying to 
ride on the coattails of 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she believes illegal immigration is a major problem facing the 
state and that more needs to be done to beef up border patrols and enforce laws 
against employers who hire people who are here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're not doing is enforcing the laws we have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a debate Tuesday night sponsored by the Simi Valley Women's Club Federated, 
the two candidates were asked their views on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Montgomery said he would support transferring illegal immigrants 
incarcerated in the Ventura County Jail to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for elected officials at all levels to address this 
issue," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery also called for county officials to support a constitutional 
amendment proposed by Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) that would deny 
automatic citizenship to children born to illegal immigrants in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels agreed with Montgomery in supporting Gallegly's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said the county needs to lobby state and federal officials to come up 
with a program to transfer illegal immigrants incarcerated in county jails back 
to their country of origin with the guarantee that they would be jailed there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just sending them back on a free bus trip is not the answer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a surprise move Tuesday, Barbara Williamson, Mikels' council 
colleague and chief rival in the June primary, announced that she was endorsing 
Mikels in the supervisor's race. Williamson had previously said she would 
remain neutral in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, who has occasionally clashed with Mikels over fiscal issues, said 
she believed Mikels' experience as a Simi Valley council member has better 
prepared her for the job of county supervisor than Montgomery's experience on 
the Moorpark council. She pointed outthat Mikels has worked with a city budget 
twice the size of Moorpark's. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the best-qualified candidate," Williamson said. "I just think she has a 
real handle on budgetary items. And that's exactly what this county is going to 
need." 
</P>
<P>
 As for her past criticism of Mikels, Williamson said, "We don't agree on 
everything. But I think that sometimes is healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Moorpark Councilman Bernardo Perez announced his support of Mikels, 
saying Montgomery had distributed a mailer in favor of Proposition 187 that he 
found offensive to Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Montgomery flyer, mailed to 12,000 absentee voters, featured a picture of 
illegal immigrants on the cover and the words: "This isn't 'immigration.' This 
is an invasion. And you're paying for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Mikels, Perez said Montgomery was trying to take advantage of the 
emotionally charged illegal immigration issue to appeal to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery denied Perez's accusations, saying he believed there are some 
things the county could do to reduce the cost of illegal immigration.  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Frank, who is coordinating the Ventura County campaign in support of 
Proposition 187 and who provided advice on Montgomery's mailer, said it is 
important that each supervisorial candidate take a stand on the immigration 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank said the county is spending a great deal of money on health, education 
and welfare benefits for illegal immigrants and that voters should know where 
the candidates stand on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a county issue," he said. "This is not something that someone running 
for an elected office can hide from. That's what being a political leader is 
all about, taking a position on the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank said it was of no consequence that the current Board of Supervisors 
voted 4-to-0 to oppose Proposition 187. Supervisor Vicky Howard, who has 
endorsed Mikels in the race, abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't vote on the current board, but we can vote for one of the candidates 
in this race," he said. "And there is certainly a clear-cut difference."

FATHER WILL NOT FACE CHARGES IN BABY'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 No charges will be filed against John Don, a Canoga Park man who was arrested 
on suspicion of murdering his infant daughter, prosecutors announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Don, 25, who was arrested Friday at his Sherman Way apartment, was released 
Monday evening after Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen reviewed the case and 
concluded that there was "insufficient evidence for a conviction beyond a 
reasonable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than having the opportunity, which others also could have had, there is 
just not enough evidence," Cohen said. "There are also a lot of inconsistencies 
in the witnesses' statements. I don't think there is enough there for a murder 
conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 Child-abuse unit detectives on the case were not available Tuesday for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Don also could not be reached for comment. However, the family's minister, 
Tony Jackson, assistant pastor at the evangelical Neighborhood Church in 
Woodland Hills, said the family was excited that Don was released. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one regard, I'm not surprised because I've said all along that their 
intention was to get a confession from him," said Jackson, who described Don as 
a born-again Christian and a recovering alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
 "John is excited to be home, but he's still concerned that the case has not 
been closed," Jackson said. "John has never veered from his contention that he 
is innocent. He is very hurt that the investigation has gone as far as it has. 
It has not been handled very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Kryistal Marie Don was 4 months old when she was pronounced dead on St. 
Patrick's Day this year after being found unresponsive by her 11-year-old 
baby-sitter. She was initially believed to have died from Sudden Infant Death 
Syndrome, but a coroner's report later concluded that the death was caused by 
cerebral trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has been frustrating for police. There were signs of prior abuse on 
the baby before she died, including alleged bite marks on the baby's buttocks 
and bruises on her scalp. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parents -- whose other children, ages 3 and 4, remain in their custody -- 
took lie detector tests. Don passed, but his wife, Jackie Ramsey, failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he believes Don remained the police's main suspect because of his 
history of domestic violence. Don had been jailed twice for beating Ramsey, but 
she has said she believes he is innocent.

CHARTING HIS LIFE; COLLECTOR NAVIGATES THROUGH THE WORLD OF ANTIQUE MAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Robert Ross began collecting antique maps as a hobby 15 years ago, he 
never suspected he was charting a new career. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross discovered these fragile, exquisitely detailed items in 1979, when his 
wife gave him a map she had purchased at a small shop in Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
 "You paid $10 for this old piece of paper?" said Ross of the hand-colored, 
8-by-10-inch travel map, which was neatly folded inside a wallet-sized pouch. 
</P>
<P>
 He later learned that the map, depicting southern Italy, was made between 1720 
and 1740. Its appraised value today? $300. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never sell it," said Ross, a retired Calabasas high school principal, 
who studied history and geography at UCLA. He added that such maps are very 
rare. "I've never seen another like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since that first acquisition, Ross' collection has grown enormously. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 2,000 for sale, he claims to be one of the largest antique map 
dealers on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Collecting maps is like collecting other antiques, old books, coins and 
stamps," said Ross, who operates Antiquarian Maps, Prints and Related Books 
from his Woodland Hills home. "Maps are uniquely beautiful objects."  
</P>
<P>
 His maps date from 1553 to 1890. He buys some at local auctions and travels to 
Europe in pursuit of others. He buys 19th Century material from New England. He 
also purchases maps by mail from a dealer in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 He buys based on scarcity, rarity and subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross is especially fond of pre-1820 maps printed on handmade rag paper, 
ensuring longevity. He likes their beautiful engravings of ships, sea monsters 
and elaborately costumed figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The most expensive piece Ross has for sale is an $8,000, double-hemisphere map 
entitled Orbis Terrarum Nova Et Accuratissima Tabula -- Latin for A New and 
Accurate Map of the Whole World. It was published in Amsterdam in 1666 by a man 
named Pieter Goos. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross explained that the piece's value is based on its fine details, some 
etched in real gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The map depicts both sides of the globe, painted on a backdrop of blue sky, 
with a large, elaborate sun casting golden rays throughout the background. Head 
winds are painted on all four corners, while colorful, human figures at the 
bottom depict the four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Although buyers have made offers, Ross said he has yet to find anyone willing 
to pay the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest map in his collection was an oval Italian world map made in 1528. 
It sold for $1,700. More recent maps include a 1925 version of Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties, and a 1932 California Highway Patrol survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross also carries "manuscript maps," which, unlike mass-printed versions, are 
one-of-a-kind. 
</P>
<P>
 An artisan would draw a manuscript map by hand, and an engraver would then 
copy the work to wood, copper, steel or stone, which would become the printing 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are fine works of geography and art," said Ross. "They are original 
pieces -- centuries old, hand-drawn and colored." 
</P>
<P>
 While Ross is often tempted to keep rather than sell his maps, he finds 
satisfaction in selling them to people who are enticed to the art of map 
collecting. 
</P>
<P>
 The lure for collectors, he said, is in owning something made by individual 
craftsmen and artisans, who often produced them from drawings by famous 
explorers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said ancient maps of North America or the Western Hemisphere are in great 
demand because they depict the "most notorious geographical misconception of 
all time" -- that California was an island. 
</P>
<P>
 Many old American maps showing Pony Express and mail routes, Native American 
paths and early turnpikes also contain geographic inaccuracies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can depict areas now lost in history," said Ross. "They often show 
curious inaccuracies -- the result of myth and explorers' fabrications." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross' advice to new map collectors is to first read a general cartographic 
reference book and visit a reputable dealer in antiquarian maps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try to determine some idea as to what types of maps you wish to collect based 
on what appeals to you," said Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes the majority of collectors are attracted to the decorative quality 
of early maps, while other collectors concentrate on a particular area, such as 
one's country, state, region or city of birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a matter of personal taste, preference and how much one wishes to 
spend," said Ross. "It's a fascinating hobby."

GIVE VALLEY A NEW POLICE DIVISION, ALARCON URGES; LAPD: COUNCILMAN WILL 
INTRODUCE MOTION TO REDRAW BOUNDARIES TO CREATE SIXTH TERRITORY IN EAST CENTRAL 
AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon said Tuesday he will introduce 
legislation today to create a new LAPD division with headquarters in a 
high-crime area of the central San Fernando Valley, hoping President Clinton's 
crime law can help pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said Tuesday his motion will ask the Los Angeles Police Department to 
analyze the creation of what he named the "Mid-Valley East Division" by 
redrawing the boundaries of three of the Valley's five police divisions to add 
a sixth.  
</P>
<P>
 The department's analysis would be sent to the Public Safety Commission to 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 The new division would cover the communities of North Hills east of the San 
Diego Freeway, all of Panorama City, Mission Hills west of the Golden State 
Freeway, and Arleta west of the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area historically has a high rate of crime," said Alarcon, who 
represents portions of the area the division would cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for us to see if some of the (new, federal) crime bill 
can cover some of the cost of making this transition to a new station." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Alarcon did not specify where exactly the new station would be 
located, the Mid-Valley East Division would be created by redrawing the 
boundaries of the Foothill, Devonshire and Van Nuys divisions. There are 
currently 18 police divisions in the LAPD, including the five in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD is already considering the addition of a new division at an 
unspecified location in the Valley, as part of its plan to realign existing 
police divisions more along community boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD plan, which police said could go into effect Jan. 1, would also 
increase the number of patrol cars in the Valley, according to Capt. Bruce 
Hagerty, a department spokesman. The Van Nuys Division would get three more 
cars, while the Foothill, North Hollywood and West Valley divisions would get 
one more car each, Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon said the realignment proposal does too little to fight crime in 
the communities that would be served by his Mid-Valley East Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "These communities are serviced on the borders of Foothill Division, 
Devonshire Division and Van Nuys Division," Alarcon said. "I believe they could 
be better served if it was more of a centralized area." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon's move was hailed Tuesday by the commander of the Van Nuys Division, 
Capt. James McMurray, and at least one neighborhood association. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (a sixth division) would improve the service in those areas," 
McMurray said. "As traffic and density have increased, so have our response 
times to some of those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 According to McMurray, a sixth division would be created by reassigning patrol 
officers from the existing divisions to the same geographic area in the new 
division. Service to residents in the existing divisions would not be affected, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a new division takes up one-fifth of Van Nuys, then they would take 
one-fifth of the officers in our division," said McMurray. "I'd lose 
corresponding workload, as well as people." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the relocation of patrol officers from an existing division to a new 
one would cost nothing, McMurray said the LAPD would have to pay the cost of 
building a new station and staffing it with clerks, watch commanders and other 
support personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon hopes some of those funds can come from the crime bill signed into law 
by Clinton last month. The anti-crime package sets aside $8.8 billion for 
hiring new police -- as many as 100,000 new officers during the next six years, 
the bill's supporters have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County already received $4.8 million earlier this month to hire 52 
new officers in the first wave of grants under the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Alarcon, the two communities who most exemplify the need for a 
new police station are North Hills west of the San Diego Freeway and Blythe 
Street, a notorious strip of gang activity in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is North Hills and Blythe Street are lumped into two divisions," 
Alarcon said. "It really doesn't put the proper statistics on the number of 
crimes in those areas. When you lump North Hills into the rest of Devonshire 
Division, you make it appear that there isn't a big problem there. In Van Nuys 
Division, the same concept applies in Blythe Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Coleman, president of the North Hills Community Coordinating Council, 
agreed. Calls for help from North Hills now go to the Devonshire Division 
station in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could get a police division that was concentrated near the blighted 
areas of North Hills, Panorama City and Van Nuys, it would solve a lot of 
problems," Coleman said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; CHINESE VISITORS GET TASTE OF U.S. SHOPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Ice cream. Snapple. Toothpaste. Salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 This slice of American culture was served up to a 75-member envoy of Chinese 
exchange students during a field trip Tuesday from Hale Middle School in 
Woodland Hills to a shopping center down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese students, who range in age from 11 to 14, make up the youngest and 
largest exchange group from mainland China ever to come to the United States. 
Next year, there are plans to send students from the Los Angeles Unified School 
District to China. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping excursion's purpose was to allow the students a chance to do a 
little personal shopping and practice their English vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a $2 spending limit, there was not much they could buy. Chagrined 
that she could not buy some lipstick, "Ellen" Fan, 12, sniffed, "No money." 
</P>
<P>
 The students' ability to get to their money has been restricted because Hale 
administrators have discovered the Chinese students often take large amounts of 
money to campus. 
</P>
<P>
 One girl tried to buy lunch at the cafeteria with a $100 bill, according to 
school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Escorted by their English as a Second Language teacher, Mandarin-speaking 
teacher's aides and some American students from the school, the entourage 
walked en masse to Platt Village shopping center to browse through the goods at 
a Pavilions supermarket, Thrifty drugstore and House of Fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 At the supermarket, they sounded out the names of products ranging from 
American-made chow mein mix to cranberry-apple juice cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get to walk around and identify items," said Jenny Kuo, a junior at Cal 
State Northridge who has been working this semester as a translator at Hale. 
</P>
<P>
 To improve communication between the Chinese and Hale students, William Chang, 
the ESL teacher, assigned American names to all 75 children to improve 
communication between them and the Hale students. 
</P>

 "It's easier to pronounce these names. People were having trouble because they 
weren't responding," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with their new names, the Chinese students have adopted a slightly more 
casual, and more American, wardrobe of denim and flannel and attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're coming along well with their shyness and speaking in class," Kuo said 
of the Chinese children in the month they have spent in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in front of the rack of egg cartons, Kuo asked a group of the Chinese 
students in English, "Where are the eggs?" 
</P>
<P>
 They emphatically point to the rows of milk in the dairy section.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; SCHOOLS LAUNCH TOLERANCE PROGRAMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Agoura Hills High School senior Cristin Dorgelo vividly recalls the disturbing 
surprises that awaited her and other students on several mornings last year 
when they opened their lockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside were pamphlets apparently distributed by white supremacist groups that 
contained inflammatory diatribes against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was incredibly angry because our school is our home, five days a week, and 
nobody likes criminals to come into our homes," Cristin said. "Our school has 
always been a place of security." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials, teachers and students quickly denounced the 
literature and those responsible for it and vowed to make a concerted effort to 
fight racism on campuses, said Albert D. Marley, superintendent of the Las 
Virgenes Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our district is home to over 50 languages," he said in a statement. "Our 
population is changing and we as educators must do everything we can to promote 
understanding and better relationships between the cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the district this year launched a program in which 10th-graders 
at Agoura Hills and Calabasas high schools participate in classroom study and 
visit the Museum of Tolerance in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 60,000 students from various schools visited the museum, which 
depicts the horrors of racism and genocide, said Gerald Margolis, director of 
the museum.  
</P>
<P>
 The interactive exhibits, he said, are designed to make people examine their 
own attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the first signs you see when you come in, says, "The potential for 
violence is within all of us,' " said Margolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exhibits challenge you, they are in your face, and the kids like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Marley said the district plans to foot the cost of transporting 794 students 
to the museum, but hopes eventually to find a corporate sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our school has always been one that encourages tolerance and acceptance of 
everyone," Cristin said. FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 5TH DISTRICT MAY SEEK INTERIM REPLACEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley community and business leaders will meet next week to 
discuss what support they can lend to a proposal to appoint an interim member 
to replace departing Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky until a replacement is elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will try to gauge how strongly residents and business people feel 
about the issue, and may lobby the Los Angeles City Council to appoint someone 
to fill Yaroslavsky's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be Tuesday at the law offices of Reznick & Reznick in Sherman 
Oaks. The idea has been promulgated by Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders want the City Council to take the unusual step because, they 
say, they want to make sure someone is looking out for the interests of 
Yaroslavsky's 5th District and all of the Valley districts, during this 
critical earthquake-recovery period.  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky will leave office Dec. 4 to become a Los Angeles county 
supervisor, creating a council vacancy that will most likely last until July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's usual practice in such cases is to name the city's chief 
legislative analyst to run the vacant council office. But Ron Deaton, the 
legislative analyst, would not have a vote on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a critical time -- we are setting up a CRA (Community Redevelopment 
Area) and getting funding for rebuilding and loan programs," said Richard 
Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "A caretaker has no 
clout, no voting ability. (He will be) just a clerical person." 
</P>
<P>
 Without a council representative, community activists fear that other council 
members will strip their district of resources. Recently, for example, 
central-city council members voted to shift millions of housing-rehabilitation 
money away from the Valley when several of their Valley colleagues were absent. 
The decision was later reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attending the meeting also will discuss what type of person they would 
like as an interim council member, said Wendy Brogin, chairwoman of the local 
issues subcommittee of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 Some observers have said that a person with longtime City Hall experience but 
no long-term political ambitions would be ideal for the temporary post.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the names that have been bandied about are retiring Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, former state Sen. Alan Sieroty and state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 Brogin, who is organizing the meeting, said those invited include 
representatives from VICA, the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce, Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn., Studio City Residents Assn., United Chambers of Commerce, Top 
of the Canyon homeowner association and the Sherman Oaks Town Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is terrific," said Alisa Katz, Yaroslavsky's chief of staff. 
"The community needs to let the City Council know that they support the idea of 
an interim council member." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5th District includes Sherman Oaks, Bel-Air, Century City, Fairfax, 
Westwood and portions of Studio City, Van Nuys and North Hollywood. On Oct. 15, 
community and business leaders from the Westside and other areas met at a 
Westside home to discuss "how we might proceed" on the appointed replacement 
issue, according to Alan Kishbaugh, president of the Hillside Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the activists may be fighting an uphill battle. Council President John 
Ferraro has opposed the idea, saying that having the chief legislative 
analyst's office run the district has worked fine in the past. The council has 
dealt with vacancies this way for the past 28 years. KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; JUDICIAL CANDIDATES OUTLINE DIFFERENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The six candidates for Glendale municipal judge disagree on many things: who 
among them is most qualified for the job, who is most compassionate, who will 
work hardest. They even disagree on the value of high-profile endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates were cordial with each other at the fifth public forum of the 
campaign Monday night at Descanso Gardens in La Canada.  
</P>
<P>
 But James Simpson -- whom some local pundits consider the favorite in the race 
-- received a few verbal jabs for touting his long list of endorsements from 
the Glendale City Council, the city's police chief, federal and state 
representatives and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before making their endorsements, did these people speak with each and every 
one of the candidates?" said Stephen Lubell, a trial attorney and candidate. 
"You'll find that is not the case, and I think that's a very important thing to 
keep in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, a deputy Los Angeles County district attorney for 29 years, also 
emphasized his professional experience, his education and involvement in the 
Boy Scouts and other community organizations. He said he was proud of his 
endorsements, including one from Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, 
who is presiding over the O. J. Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are (endorsements) important? These people care about this community. 
They want the very best candidate for judge, and I am the best candidate," 
Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates -- who also include Glendale Municipal Court Commissioner Donna 
Bracke and local attorneys Harvey Goldhammer, L. Edmund Kellogg and Robert 
Yanez -- are running for the seat vacated by former Judge James Rogan. Rogan 
was elected to the state Assembly in a special election in May to fill out the 
term of Republican Pat Nolan, who left office after pleading guilty to a 
corruption charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner in the Nov. 3 election will be elected to a six-year term and will 
preside over misdemeanor criminal trials and felony hearings, as well as civil 
cases and traffic matters. On a rotating basis, Glendale's three judges also 
serve as presiding judge of the courthouse, which also has two commissioners.  
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale judicial district includes La Crescenta, La Canada, Montrose and 
Sunland, as well as Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Bracke, a deputy district attorney for nine years and a commissioner for four, 
contended that she, too, has prominent endorsements, including the Glendale 
Police Officers Assn., sitting Glendale Municipal Judges Barbara Lee Burke and 
Joseph DeVanon and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Ouderkirk, who 
presided over the Reginald Denny beating case. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Ouderkirk) told me his endorsement probably doesn't mean anything since no 
one remembers who Reginald Denny is anymore," Bracke quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates were each asked to answer a series of questions ranging from 
why they want the job to what they think judges can do to reduce crime to how 
they would cut costs in the courthouse and how they would prevent frivolous 
lawsuits.  
</P>
<P>
 All said that, if elected, they would bring a unique style of justice to the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg, a full-time practicing attorney who also teaches criminal justice 
classes at three community colleges, described himself as a self-financed 
outsider candidate who would root out corruption in the courts.  
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg and Yanez, a foster parent, said they would work to help steer 
troubled youths away from crime. Yanez pledged to serve the full six years if 
elected, but said ultimately he would like to work in the juvenile court 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldhammer, meanwhile, stressed his "educational excellence" and his 
experience as an arbitrator, judge pro tem and trial attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "When was the last time (the other candidates) tried a case? I try cases. You 
need that experience," Goldhammer said. STEVE RYFLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COUNCIL TO UNVEIL PLAN FOR DOWNTOWN 
</P>

<P>
 A plan for the renewal of Brand Boulevard and the rest of downtown Glendale 
over the next 10 to 20 years will be unveiled Thursday night during a special 
meeting of the Glendale City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greater Glendale Downtown Strategic Plan, as it is known, is a 
multifaceted program to encourage the development of new retail shopping areas, 
a civic auditorium, public parks and possibly even an outdoor amphitheater in 
the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of options for the future of the business district was developed by 
Alex Cooper, a New York architect and urban planner, earlier this year under 
the direction of the city and Glendale Partners, a group of prominent business 
people who helped pay for the study. A city-appointed committee has been 
weighing the options and will present its recommendations at Thursday's 
meeting, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A major public/private "town center" in the area bounded by Central Avenue 
and Colorado, Harvard and Louise streets. This could incorporate the existing 
Central Library with a new civic auditorium, public park or gathering area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion of the Glendale Galleria shopping mall onto Brand Boulevard with a 
pedestrian-friendly entrance. A 200- to 300-room hotel or low-rise office 
building could also be built nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 * Decrease of traffic on Brand by as much as 30% by rerouting cars onto side 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's meeting is at 7 p.m. in the City Council chambers at City Hall, 613 
E. Broadway. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; FUTURE UNCERTAIN FOR AGENCY'S EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Resume-writing classes began Tuesday morning at Keeping the World at Peace 
Inc. as employees of the nonprofit agency prepared to look for other work in 
the face of the agency's financial and managerial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra J. Santos, executive director of the agency, told her 10 employees 
Friday that she could no longer pay them because funding from CTSI Corp., the 
company that administers a water conservation program for the city of Los 
Angeles, has been cut back.  
</P>
<P>
 But Santos' employees showed up for work this week anyway, vowing to continue 
working as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not closed yet," Santos said, though the agency is helping workers 
prepare for potential job searches. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, which opened last year, may soon shut down its water conservation 
program, which distributes free ultra low-flush toilets in exchange for old, 
high consumption models. The older toilets are collected for recycling. But a 
computer-training and services program offered by the agency will continue to 
operate -- out of someone's home, if necessary, Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos and other employees will discuss the agency's future at noon Thursday 
at the Pacoima Coordinating Council's meeting at the Boys & Girls Club of San 
Fernando Valley, 11251 Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the World at Peace and other community groups in the Los Angeles area 
receive a $25 rebate for each old toilet replaced by a new low-flush model. But 
CTSI Corp., the Orange County-based company that manages the program for the 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Metropolitan Water District, 
began reducing the amount of payments to the agency several weeks ago, Santos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 CTSI Corp. has denied any responsibility for the agency's problems. A company 
spokesman contended the agency's production has fallen off recently, citing 
that as the reason for the funding reduction.  
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they were never able to make a go of it," said Rick Ruiz, program 
manager for CTSI. "They had problems from the beginning. It's unfortunate their 
incompetence may hurt the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz said the toilet exchange program would continue operating even if Santos' 
organization closes. "We are asking people who want low-flush toilets to call 
1-800-660-8028. We'll tell them where they can get them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos accused CTSI of "squeezing us out of business" to cover up 
mismanagement of the conservation program.  
</P>
<P>
 Both sides accuse the other of refusing to communicate.  
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District has refused to get involved in the dispute, 
saying it is up to the two organizations to work out their differences. TIM MAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; IMMIGRANTS WITH DEGREES ASSISTED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many experienced professionals, with master's degrees and good educations they 
obtained in other countries, are working at low-paying jobs in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 But help is available through programs such as the Bilingual Professional 
Expressway at Mission College in Sylmar, said Renee Baez, the project director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people from all over the world, mostly from Latin America," said 
Baez, who is from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was started five years ago when the college learned that a large 
percentage of illegal immigrants who had received amnesty had professional 
degrees. Baez said one of the students in the program had been working in 
menial jobs, not realizing that his degree in engineering could be valid here. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which until two years ago was funded by a federal grant, helps 
immigrants learn English and gives them guidance in finishing the necessary 
course work or certification to perform in their professions in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The enrollment fee is $13 a unit and financial aid is available. A Saturday 
program in which students can enroll at any time is also available. For more

ELECTION '94; 39TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), 44, was first elected to the Assembly in 
1980. A former print shop owner, he is married. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican challenger Nicholas Fitzgerald, 32, is a computer technician at 
Warner Bros. studios in Burbank who also ran against Katz in 1992. The Panorama 
City resident is married and has two children. 
</P>
<P>
 With term limits, Katz is facing his final term representing this sure-fire 
Democratic district. And that has launched a spate of speculation about what 
paths the versatile Katz may take after reelection (which seems beyond doubt), 
including recurring talk that he may be in line for some high government 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Just rumor, Katz has replied. But there is no doubt Katz has entertained 
bigger political ambitions. Soon after winning reelection in 1992, Katz 
launched his campaign for Los Angeles mayor, an ill-starred endeavor in which 
Katz placed fourth - behind two candidates (now-mayor Richard Riordan and Los 
Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs) who supported the popular Valley cry to 
break up the Los Angeles school district. Within months, Katz switched sides 
himself and joined the school breakup forces. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past two years, Katz has been his usual active self. He engineered 
a compromise that overcame initial federal Environmental Protection Agency 
concerns and largely kept intact California's system of gas station operated 
smog-inspection outlets, and he won approval for a $1 million plan to put metal 
detectors in schools to screen for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Katz secured adoption of a law to sharply curtail the ability of 
violent felons to win early release from prison by chalking up so-called good 
time credits. This measure, Katz later groused, was such a fine piece of a 
tough-on-crime legislation that Gov. Pete Wilson tried to hijack it as his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Katz' challenger, Fitzgerald, says the incumbent is weak on crime. 
Fitzgerald wants parents prosecuted as accessories if their minor children 
commit crimes. "Anyone who lives in my neighborhood and is not angry about 
crimes and taxes is not engaged," said Fitzgerald who has been endorsed by the 
Christian Coalition and the National Rifle Assn.

VENTURA COUNTY SUPERVISORS GIVE AHMANSON PROJECT 3-YEAR EXTENSION; DEVELOPMENT: 
OK COMES DESPITE THREATS OF ADDED LAWSUITS BY CITY OF CALABASAS AND OTHER 
OPPONENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ignoring threats of lawsuits, Ventura County supervisors Tuesday granted 
Ahmanson Land Co. three more years to turn 10,000 acres into public parkland as 
part of its deal to build a mini-city in the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision was immediately criticized by Calabasas city officials, 
who vowed to sue the county over the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us endless opportunities for litigation," Calabasas Councilwoman 
Lesley Devine said, adding that the board's action offers "a shopping mall" of 
legal possibilities to hogtie the project for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, Calabasas and eight other plaintiffs have stalled the massive 
project planned for a ranch along the Los Angeles County line, arguing that it 
would clog streets and freeways with traffic and increase air pollution in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays caused by those lawsuits, which are now on appeal, prompted 
Ahmanson to request the extension to live up to its part of the deal. Ahmanson 
won the first round in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The original agreement called for Ahmanson to acquire entertainer Bob Hope's 
Jordan Ranch, Runkle Ranch, Corral Canyon and Liberty Canyon properties by 
December, 1995, and sign over 10,000 acres to state and federal park agencies. 
So far, only two of the parcels are in the hands of parks officials, and those 
as a result of a complicated side deal. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Irwindale-based developer fails to deliver all of the parkland, the 
county would automatically remove its permit to build 3,050 dwellings, a town 
center, two golf courses and a 300-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, architect of the original deal, stressed that the 
three-year extension does not alter the agreement in any significant way. 
"Without all of this open space," she said, "there is no project." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, adopted 4 to 1 Tuesday, restates the supervisors' position 
that Ahmanson would have to start over and conduct another lengthy 
environmental review should it renege on its promise. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision also overturned a Planning Commission rejection last month. 
Commissioners said Ahmanson knew lawsuits were inevitable when it agreed to the 
original 1995 deadline. But Assistant County Counsel Andrew Gustafson said 
Tuesday that developers did not "expect the tenacity and ingenuity of 
(opponents') litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan Lacey cast the lone dissenting vote, saying she believed that 
the county could protect more open space by "just saying no" to the Ahmanson 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The board decision followed a two-hour public hearing that featured 16 
speakers, most of them opposed to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Two notable exceptions were a spokesman for the Sierra Club and Joseph T. 
Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. They 
said they could support the extension provided that the supervisors held 
Ahmanson to its commitment for public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston's agency could end up controlling about half of the parkland in the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas city officials voiced the most vociferous objections, threatening to 
do whatever is needed to block Ahmanson's proposed 8,600-resident community 
from swamping Calabasas with traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the extension is granted, a new round of lawsuits may be filed," Calabasas 
Mayor Karyn Foley told the supervisors. "The litigation will continue long into 
the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson has not yet settled on a purchase price for the 4,700 acres of Runkle 
Ranch and Corral Canyon, officials said, despite Hope's 1991 pledge to sell all 
four ranches for $29.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Some opponents told the supervisors that they fear that Hope will demand such 
a high price that Ahmanson will ultimately return to county officials saying it 
cannot afford the deal without government help. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson officials declined to respond directly to concerns about purchasing 
Hope's land, saying they first need to overcome court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we've been working on the project for two years, much of the time 
has been spent on litigation," said Donald Brackenbush, president of Ahmanson 
Land. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his staff has also made progress in refining the design of the project 
to cut in half the tons of earth needed to be moved and trees uprooted. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and other Ahmanson officials said they cannot proceed with the deal 
until lawsuits are resolved and they are sure they can build the project. 
</P>
<P>
 That could take some time, Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not quitters," she said. "We're scrappers."

COUNTY CELEBRATES COST-CUTTING, BUT SOME QUESTION ITS FIGURES; FINANCES: 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY SAVED TAXPAYERS $253 MILLION IN YEAR. BUT THEY ADMIT 
SUBMITTED ESTIMATES WERE ACCEPTED AT FACE VALUE. 
</P>

<P>
 Under the glare of popping flashbulbs Tuesday, Los Angeles County officials 
beamed for the cameras, claiming to have saved taxpayers a whopping $253 
million in cost-cutting programs during the last fiscal year, more than four 
times what was saved the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the county's Productivity and Quality Commission sponsored the 
brief celebration at the Hall of Administration to mark a banner year cutting 
government waste and encouraging innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt some of the programs -- such as consolidating courts in Santa Monica 
-- have improved public services and reduced costs from last year's 
$13.7-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But on closer examination, some of the touted savings may not be what 
taxpayers had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 * The county Department of Health Services estimates that it earned an extra 
$10 million in revenues through more efficient Medi-Cal billing at Harbor / 
UCLA Medical Center. But the commission failed to note that the department lost 
another $24 million at some of its other hospitals because of delays in 
Medi-Cal billing caused by the collapse of an expensive computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Department of Public Works estimated that 451 homeowners in Malibu and 
the San Gabriel Valley will save $50 million over the next three to four storm 
seasons if they heed the department's advice and take steps to reduce erosion 
of fire-ravaged hillsides. While the "Post-burn Mudflow Protective Advice 
Program" may indeed reduce property damage and prevent the loss of lives, "I 
wondered myself about whether it is really a direct cost savings to the 
county," said Virginia Bortin, the commission's executive director. 
Nonetheless, the $50 million was added to the county's tally of savings. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county Department of Community and Senior Citizens Services helped land 
a $20-million federal grant for homeless programs that the commission counted 
as part of the county's total savings. But not only is the money to be shared 
with the city of Los Angeles, the county would probably not have spent that 
much on such programs had the grant been denied. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials acknowledged that some of the savings may be questionable. 
The commission accepted at face value the estimates submitted by 184 program 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably should have proved those numbers first," said Robert M. 
Hertzberg, an attorney who sits on the 17-member commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the county only saved half of the $253 million estimated by the 
commission, that's still more than twice as much as the year before, county 
officials said. The commission's annual effort to recognize programs that cut 
costs and improve services is still worthwhile, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It has spin-off value," said County Administrative Officer Sally R. Reed, 
who, since she was hired a year ago, has urged the county to be more fiscally 
responsible. "The more positive attention you give to those kinds of efforts, 
the more county departments are going to be that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Health Services Director Robert C. Gates said: "If you always balance the 
gains against the losses and say no one deserves recognition, you've eliminated 
the incentive for people to make improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 Massive state budget cutbacks have forced the county to save more during the 
last fiscal year than in each of the past seven years since the commission has 
kept track of such data, Bortin said. "Departments were under the knife," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Gloria Molina, a frequent critic of the county's fiscal 
policies, suggested that much more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are good things that go on; you can't dismiss those things," she said. 
"But whether we're more efficient now; I don't know whether that's a claim we 
get to make yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The steps the county took to save taxpayers money or improve public services 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Installing better computer systems, including one in the Department of 
Mental Health that reduced the county's costs by $1.4 million and another in 
the Administratively Unified Courts that saved $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consolidating the Santa Monica Municipal and Superior courts, avoiding the 
need for a new $56-million courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Using volunteer attorneys in Glendale Superior Court to resolve civil cases. 
The program saved about $1.9 million in court costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reducing illness or injury claims in several departments -- including the 
County Administrative Office, where a wellness program was projected to save 
more than $2 million annually, and in the public works department, where a 
safety program saved $4.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing a county team to investigate financial abuse of the elderly. 
Counting the Savings Los Angeles County officials praise cost-cutting programs 
that have saved taxpayers $253 million for the 1993-94 fiscal year. Closer 
examination raises some questions about county arithmetic. * 
</P>
<P>
 The Good Department: Courts Program: Consolidate Santa Monica municipal and 
superior courts. Estimated savings / revenue: $48 million Explanation: Avoids 
need for new $56-million courthouse * 
</P>
<P>
 Department: Public Works Program: Improve worker safety Estimated savings / 
revenue: $4.3 million Explanation: Reduces illness and injury claims through 
improved training and inspections * 
</P>
<P>
 Department: Beaches and Harbors Program: Surf hotline Estimated savings / 
revenue: $13,000 Explanation: Six-month revenues rom county-run 900 phone line 
giving surf and weather conditions. * 
</P>
<P>
 The Questionable Department: Health Services Program: More efficient Medi-Cal 
billing Explanation: Estimated savings / revenue: $10 million Department lost 
another $24 million in billing snafus at other hospitals. * 
</P>
<P>
 Department: Public Works Program: Mudflow protection Estimated savings / 
revenue: $50 million over four years Explanation: Workers visited burn areas to 
teach residents how to protect against mudslides. Savings based on assumption 
that 451 homes would be damaged in mudslides. *

 Department: Community and Senior Citizens Services Program: Homeless Estimated 
savings / revenue: $20 million Explanation: Received federal grant; no county 
money saved Source: Los Angeles County Productivity and Quality Commission

PART OF INTERCHANGE TO REOPEN THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquake-shattered interchange between the southbound Antelope Valley 
Freeway and the northbound Golden State Freeway is scheduled to reopen 
Thursday, leaving just one reconstruction project at the same site to be 
completed before the region's freeway system returns to full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The final project -- the transition from the southbound Golden State to the 
northbound Antelope Valley -- should be completed in early November, Caltrans 
spokesman Jim Drago said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two connectors were part of the same work contract, Drago said 
the state Department of Transportation wanted to make the first interchange 
available to motorists as soon as repair was done. Since the Jan. 17 
earthquake, commuters accustomed to using those connectors have had to navigate 
surface streets to reach their destination freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The other transitions at the junction -- north to north and south to south on 
the two freeways -- were reopened in July. Caltrans focused its initial 
rebuilding efforts on those two interchanges because they are more heavily used 
than the ones due to open Thursday and next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Completion of the remaining project will mark the end of Caltrans' 
$300-million post-quake reconstruction effort, although retrofitting of bridges 
will continue. The downed Santa Monica Freeway was restored in April; the 
Golden State Freeway above Gavin Canyon came on line in May, and the Simi 
Valley Freeway was fully reopened in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica and Golden State projects netted hefty bonuses for the 
contractors opening them earlier than scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 F. C. I. Constructors of San Diego, the contractor for the current project at 
the Golden State-Antelope Valley junction, can earn an extra $20,000 for each 
day it opens the final interchange in advance of the scheduled Nov. 6 
completion date. An equal amount would be deducted from the firm's 
$13.2-million contract for each day it exceeds the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Work at the interchange has been precarious because of the height of the 
bridges, which tower more than 100 feet in some spots. The canyon terrain also 
makes access difficult for supply trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the state Legislature renamed the entire interchange in memory of 
Clarence Wayne Dean, the Los Angeles police officer who was killed there 
shortly after the quake when his motorcycle went off the collapsed freeway in 
the pre-dawn darkness.

MOTHER PUT ON PROBATION IN CHILD-ENDANGERMENT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood woman whose 2-year-old son knocked her idling car into gear, 
causing it to run over five children in the driveway, pleaded guilty Tuesday to 
a misdemeanor child-endangerment charge and was sentenced to 24 months 
probation and 150 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Estela Lopez, 33, entered her plea in Van Nuys Municipal Court as part of a 
plea agreement with prosecutors.She had been charged with two 
child-endangerment counts in connection with the July 30 accident, and, if 
convicted, faced a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing will be held Dec. 6 to determine how much restitution she should pay 
to the families of the injured children, according to Deputy City Atty. Kjehl 
Johansen. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five children, ages 5 to 10, were hospitalized in serious or 
critical condition after the car struck a sofa they were playing on in the 
driveway, forcing it into a wall. They were briefly hospitalized and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and some witnesses said that Lopez left her child in the car with the 
engine running while she ran into the house to get her purse. Lopez, a mother 
of three, had maintained that her son somehow opened the car door and climbed 
in on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the incident, the district attorney's office declined to 
file charges saying that, while the injuries were a terrible tragedy, the 
accident did not merit criminal action. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office later decided to file misdemeanor charges, 
questioning Lopez's version of what happened and saying that the children's 
injuries were serious.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COUNTY GIVES DUMP OK TO DESIGN RAMP; WASTE: 
TRASH FIRM GETS GO-AHEAD TO DRAW UP PLANS FOR LINK TO ELSMERE CANYON LANDFILL 
THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN APPROVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors on Tuesday gave a waste-disposal firm permission to start 
designing a freeway ramp for a controversial Santa Clarita Valley dump the 
board has yet to approve. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-1 vote outraged opponents of the proposed Elsmere Canyon landfill, who 
argued that it is premature to allow BKK Corp. to draw up blueprints for a ramp 
linking the proposed dump to the Antelope Valley Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like putting the cart before the horse," said Dave Vannatta, 
Antonovich's planning deputy. "You could create a situation where the county 
has taken the company so far down the road that there would be no way to turn 
down (the application to build) the landfill." 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials said that the action does not obligate the board to 
approve the 190-million-ton landfill when it comes up for a vote in 1995 or 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they acknowledged that by getting a head start on the design work, 
BKK could be in a position to start construction of the off ramp immediately, 
if the board approves the landfill. It could take at least 18 months to 
complete the design, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Works said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for BKK called the approval routine and refused to comment 
further.  
</P>
<P>
 The board had to take action before the design work could begin because BKK 
needs county engineers to act as intermediaries between it and the California 
Department of Transportation. The firm will reimburse the county for the 
engineers' expenses, estimated at about $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not yet clear who would pay for construction of the freeway ramp if it 
is built, the company or state or county government, but it may well be BKK, 
because the ramp is needed only for the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich urged the supervisors to wait at least six months before allowing 
BKK to begin the design work. The city of Santa Clarita, which opposes the 
landfill on its eastern flank, requested the delay to hold public hearings on 
the issue, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "An action today would indicate that some people would like to fast-track this 
landfill," Antonovich said. "It's better to go forward after you have public 
hearings about whether Elsmere Canyon is a suitable site for a landfill."  
</P>
<P>
 But the other four supervisors refused to postpone the matter.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY ASKED TO SHUN VIOLENT SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents here are being asked to avoid violent entertainment on Thursday as 
part of "Turn Off the Violence Day" sponsored by the city's Anti-Gang Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers want residents to shun violent music, movies and television for one 
day.The theme is supported by the Crime Prevention Coalition in Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't much (entertainment) out there that's not violent in some way," 
said Cecilia Burda, who heads the task force. "We need to see what impact this 
(exposure to violence) has upon us." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita task force members have distributed more than 30,000 handouts 
advocating nonviolence on local school campuses. On Thursday they will hang 
"Turn Off the Violence" banners at the city's junior and senior high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The banners will be signed by students and later presented to television 
stations to encourage nonviolent programming, Burda said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; THIEVES TAKE $3 MILLION IN AIRCRAFT PARTS FROM 
COMPANY; CRIME: THE HEIST IS THE LARGEST IN A SERIES AT THE VALENCIA INDUSTRIAL 
PARK DURING RECENT MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than $3 million worth of aluminum castings and other items used to make 
cargo planes was stolen from two storage trailers in the Valencia Industrial 
Center, apparently by burglars looking to sell it as scrap metal, authorities 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglary is by far the largest in a series of about 10 similar heists at 
the aircraft supply company and other businesses in the industrial center 
during recent months, according to sheriff's officials. Thefts of aluminum 
window pieces, electric wire on large spools and other metallic equipment has 
ranged in value from $150 to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely some type of organized effort," said Deputy John Mundell of 
the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six weeks burglars have hit several warehouses in the industrial 
center at least five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators have leads in the burglaries, but no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other burglaries have occurred since mid-May at Jay-Dee Aircraft Supply 
Co., the firm broken into over the weekend, said General Manager Rusty Werth. 
He said little was stolen during the first three break-ins, but the 
multimillion-dollar heist that occurred over the weekend will be hard to 
absorb. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't replace it all right now," he said. "There's no way. We're a 
small company." 
</P>
<P>
 He said employees arriving about 7 a.m. Monday found a gate open and the 
padlocks cut off two 40-foot storage trailers behind the building. About half 
the castings, braces and other items inside the trailers were stolen. The firm 
sells aircraft parts to small manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 The toolings were used to make much of the framing for Convair 580 airplanes, 
an older cargo plane used mostly by foreign countries, Werth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about little toolings that could fit in a shoe box," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two pickup trucks or one medium-size commercial flatbed truck would be needed 
to haul off the 3,000 pounds of metal, Werth said. While the company estimates 
the items are worth more than $3.2 million, sheriff's officials estimate a 
scrap dealer would only pay about 92 cents a pound for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Stolen parts are usually cut up so they cannot be recognized and sold to scrap 
dealers in the Los Angeles area, said Carl McCraven, a commercial theft 
investigator for the Sheriff's Department. He said dozens of similar thefts 
occur at businesses each year, but only one or two as large as that at Jay-Dee 
Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller thefts earlier this year at the aircraft factory may have been a 
scouting mission for the larger theft, McCraven added.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SCHOOL AUTHORITIES URGE ALTERNATIVES TO 
SUSPENDING STUDENTS; EDUCATION: LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SUPPORT THE PLAN, 
WHICH MAY EVEN REQUIRE PARENTS OF TROUBLEMAKERS TO SPEND A DAY ON CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For some students who are suspended from school, the time spent outside of 
class is like a free day off, said local authorities who will soon begin 
revamping policies with an eye toward getting tough on campus troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both school and law enforcement officials are aiming to create a new 
supervised suspension program that may even call on parents of suspended youths 
to do time alongside their child. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current policies, a parent or guardian is required to be at home with a 
suspended student, but many times the adults are at work or just don't care, 
said Newhall School District Supt. J. Michael McGrath. It is not uncommon for 
youths to return to class with an elevated status among their peers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, students are suspended for one or more days for offenses such as 
hitting another student or verbally abusing a teacher. Expulsions are reserved 
for the most serious offenses, such as bringing a weapon or drugs to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some kids a suspension is a terrible shock," McGrath said. "For others 
it's, 'Ho-hum,' and it's 'Ho-hum' for their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 As juvenile and gang problems in the area have increased over the past several 
years, officials have felt a need to review the suspension policy, said Cecilia 
Burda, head of the volunteer Santa Clarita Valley Anti-Gang Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've finally gotten to the point where we have a lot of kids on the street 
because they've been suspended," she said. "They're at the park, they're at the 
convenience store, they're at the mall. Sending them home is not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Several officials said, however, that the number of suspensions is holding 
steady or even declining at some schools. At William S. Hart High School, for 
example, there were 262 suspensions during the 1992-93 school year, a 9% 
decrease from the previous year, said Principal Laurence Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, concerned officials have formed a volunteer committee headed by 
McGrath, who hopes the panel will devise new policy recommendations by next 
fall. Leaders hope the plan will be adopted by all five Santa Clarita Valley 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials want suspensions to carry some type of learning experience or 
punitive action. One suggestion calls for making students pick up trash on 
campus or at city parks. Another idea would create a program similar to traffic 
schools, where students would watch and listen to anti-gang lectures and 
videos. 
</P>
<P>
 And some have even suggested that the youths' parents be required to attend 
the classroom sessions, or the student will face expulsion. McGrath said the 
embarrassment factor of parental involvement has already proven effective in 
his district, where parents can sometimes spend a day at school instead of 
having their child suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you something, boy, it changes the kid's behavior," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some educators question whether such policies would effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it working without a lot of supervision, which is a lot of 
money," said Jon Curwen, principal of Sierra Vista Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
 A supervised suspension policy might help students who abuse the current 
system, but there is no foolproof way to determine who those youths are, 
Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a great deal of research or investigation that goes 
into 'What did you do during those two days?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forcing a student to listen to lectures or watch instructional movies might 
help in the short-term, but won't necessarily solve the long-term problems that 
caused the student's misbehavior, Strauss added. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Jereann Bowman High School, a continuation school for students who 
have gotten into trouble at regular high schools, voiced mixed reactions to the 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Ortolano, 16, who was suspended several times while attending Verdugo 
Hills High School, said trash pickup would probably be an effective deterrent. 
He said he would attend supervised lectures and movies, but probably wouldn't 
pay much attention to them. 
</P>
<P>
 And he certainly doesn't want his parents to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wouldn't go," he said. "It's sort of embarrassing to begin with, and I 
just wouldn't want them there." 
</P>
<P>
 Darrel Johnson, 17, said he objects to making parents participate because 
"they've got jobs, and if they come here they can't go to work to get the money 
needed to live." 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials said there are similar programs in other districts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the 152 schools in the San Diego Unified School District have an 
in-school suspension program for students who commit minor offenses, said Bob 
Hampel, who handles the district's disciplinary hearings. The program started 
up four years ago in response to concerns about rising suspension rates. 
</P>
<P>
 One high school in the district also requires parents of vandals who are 
suspended to show up with their child for evening or weekend cleanup, Hampel 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a punishment in making the parents aware of the problem," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: REDONDO BEACH; CANADIAN 
IS CHARGED IN CONDO RENTAL SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Canadian man has been charged with grand theft in connection with a scam in 
which prospective condominium renters were bilked of nearly $10,000 by a man 
posing as a building manager, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Charles Reid, 36, also was charged with carjacking and assault with a 
deadly weapon after he stole a car to escape police and tried to run down an 
officer, said Detective Mark Sturgeon.The officer fired a shot at Reid and 
missed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid, also known as Paul Clarkson, is suspected of taking at least 10 deposits 
for three luxury condominiums in Redondo Beach, Sturgeon said. Police had been 
investigating Reid since August. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Reid identified condominiums for sale, then advertised them for 
rent in a local newspaper. When prospective tenants arrived, Reid took rental 
deposits, then disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 When he noticed officers near his Rancho Palos Verdes apartment Oct. 12, he 
fled on foot and then told a woman in an idling Mercury that he needed to use 
her car, Sturgeon said. She screamed and jumped out of the car, and he sped 
away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers followed Reid but lost sight of him in the area's winding residential 
streets. After a four-hour search, a police canine sniffed out Reid hiding in 
thick brush in an undeveloped canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Reid is suspected of committing similar crimes in San Diego and 
Canada. He is being held in Los Angeles County Jail on $300,000 bail.

VALLEY BRIEFING: VALLEY RAIL; SUBWAY OR ELEVATED RAIL? MTA MAY DECIDE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a decade of rancorous debate, a voter referendum, and 
decisions made and reversed, the San Fernando Valley rail project comes before 
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority today for a crucial vote on where to 
locate the proposed mass transit line -- down the Ventura Freeway or along 
Burbank and Chandler boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, a precursor to the 
MTA, adopted the Burbank-Chandler subway route. But a Valley advisory vote that 
same year showed widespread support for a monorail above the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, the commission reversed itself and tapped the freeway as 
the preferred alignment -- but then effectively voided that decision later by 
voting to complete studies on both routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Once regarded by far the most cost-effective option, the elevated railway's 
financial edge has diminished considerably, to where only $19 million -- less 
than 1% of the cost of either project -- separates an aerial rail line from a 
mostly underground system. 
</P>
<P>
 * VENTURA FREEWAY ALIGNMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Advantages: 
</P>
<P>
 * High visibility along the freeway could encourage motorists to use mass 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
 * An elevated railway would be at least $19 million cheaper than a subway 
system; an at-grade railway in the freeway median would cost even less than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 * The rail line could be extended west to Ventura County and north to connect 
with Metrolink stations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elevated line, sometimes called a monorail, would have 15 stations, as 
opposed to 10 for a subway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disadvantages: 
</P>
<P>
 * Passengers would have to change trains to the Metro Red Line subway to 
continue to Hollywood and Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the freeway collapses in an earthquake or other natural disaster, the 
rail line in the median would also be knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Freeway congestion from construction could increase. BURBANK-CHANDLER 
ALIGNMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Advantages: 
</P>
<P>
 * Passengers would have a seamless ride on the Metro Red Line from Canoga Park 
to Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 * The route would serve more heavily populated areas, such as Pierce and 
Valley colleges and the Van Nuys government center. 
</P>
<P>
 * The alignment would provide a backup transportation corridor if the freeway 
were damaged in an earthquake or other natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * MTA has already spent $159 million to acquire the right-of-way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disadvantages: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tunneling can be problematic, as experience beneath Hollywood Boulevard 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * To cut costs, some stations may be open-air. 
</P>
<P>
 * Subway construction could incur large cost overruns, as has happened with 
the first two segments of Red Line construction through Downtown and Hollywood.

KEY TUNNEL SUPERVISORS NOT LICENSED IN STATE; SUBWAY: ENGINEERING OFFICIALS 
APPROVED USE OF WOOD WEDGES. MTA SAYS IT WAS UNAWARE OF CREDENTIAL STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two engineering officials who approved the controversial substitution of 
wood wedges for steel bracing in 12 miles of Los Angeles subway tunnels are not 
licensed to practice in California, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 And eight out of 10 of the "resident engineers" who have directly overseen 
work on the multibillion-dollar subway are not licensed as engineers by the 
state, according to records in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent analysis prepared last week for the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority concluded that the substitution of the wedges was "inappropriate." 
Earlier engineering studies have found that the failure of the wedges 
contributed to surface sinkages along Hollywood Boulevard two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The two officials who approved the substitution have worked on behalf of the 
transit authority, under the employ of separate consulting firms. 
</P>
<P>
 One is Timothy P. Smirnoff, manager of tunnel engineering for the authority 
and employed by the project's lead design firm, Parsons Brinckerhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is Stephen J. Navin, who until early this year was classified as a 
resident engineer for the MTA's construction management firm, 
Parsons-Dillingham. 
</P>
<P>
 Navin, who is working on a Parsons Corp. project in the San Diego area, is in 
Europe this week and unavailable, according to a receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Parsons-Dillingham, Ron Wildermuth, said Navin participated in 
the approval process for the substitution but deferred to Smirnoff's firm for 
"the engineering decision itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Wildermuth said the resident engineers on the subway "are not authorized to 
perform the duties of a licensed state engineer. . . . Therefore (resident 
engineers) working on this project are not required to be licensed engineers in 
the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnoff, who did not return calls Tuesday, has declined to be interviewed 
regarding his approval of the substitution of the 32-inch-long wood wedges. 
Smirnoff approved the substitution Sept. 11, 1992, at the request of the tunnel 
contractor, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny. The wedges were placed in the initial tunnel 
shell, between segments of precast concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnoff told The Times in an interview 13 months ago that, although he does 
not hold a license to practice civil engineering in California, he is licensed 
in New York. Records kept by New York officials confirm that Smirnoff has been 
licensed there, in good standing, since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 At the MTA, Deputy Chief Executive Officer L.A. (Kim) Kimball said Tuesday 
that the licensing status of the two engineering officials was not known to top 
agency executives. As for the other subway engineers who are not licensed, 
Kimball said: 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be preferable from our point of view that they be licensed 
engineers. But I'm not sure that would be a requirement for their giving sound 
engineering advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Transit Administrator Gordon J. Linton on Oct. 5 froze $1.6 billion of 
future funding for the Los Angeles subway. Clinton Administration officials 
have said that the funding will be restored when the MTA demonstrates that it 
can competently manage construction of the subway, the most expensive per mile 
in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at stake in the controversy over the sinkages in Hollywood is the extent 
to which contractors -- or taxpayers -- will have to pay for perhaps tens of 
millions of dollars needed to repair the tunnels, damaged streets and 
buildings, and to compensate businesses for lost revenues. Franklin E. White, 
the MTA's chief executive officer, said last month that he would review the 
decision to approve the substitution of the wood wedges for steel bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 Licensing in another state does not qualify a person to practice civil 
engineering in California, according to officials in Sacramento. They also said 
all circumstances must be considered when assessing whether an engineer is 
performing services that require a license. 
</P>
<P>
 Navin, whom Parsons-Dillingham transferred off the Los Angeles project nine 
months ago, has construction experience in the United States and Canada. Navin 
had worked on the Los Angeles subway since the late 1980s and was the resident 
engineer for the tunneling in Hollywood and along Vermont Avenue when 
excavation began in mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Navin and Smirnoff have played prominent roles in the construction. 
Navin, as resident engineer, ordered Shea-Kiewit-Kenny one year ago to perform 
a special grouting procedure "to arrest this continued settlement" after 
sinkages along Vermont had reached four inches, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 And the MTA's subway project manager has said he relied on advice from 
Smirnoff in deciding not to order grouting procedures in Hollywood, after 
sinkages of four inches occurred in late July. When tunneling continued without 
the grouting, the sinkages grew to up to nine inches. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA project manager, Joel J. Sandberg, was reassigned last week to a less 
senior position. 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnoff prepared an MTA Tunnel Review Board report, issued Sept. 1, which 
attributed the surface sinkages in part to the failure of the wood wedges and 
an "indetectable difference" in soils. Smirnoff signed the report, identifying 
himself as a "P.E.", short for "professional engineer." 
</P>
<P>
 California law prohibits people unlicensed in the state "to in any manner use 
the title 'professional engineer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The work extending through Hollywood -- the largest tunneling contract in the 
brief history of the Los Angeles subway -- is mired in disputes over the 
sinkages and other difficulties encountered underground. Before tunneling was 
halted in Hollywood on Aug. 18, the contract, awarded originally at $163 
million, was nine months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 California requires anyone practicing civil engineering to be licensed by the 
state, according to officials with the California Board of Registration for 
Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Smirnoff's or Navin's approval of the wood bracing met the state's 
definition of civil engineering would have to depend on a review of "all the 
facts," said Peggy A. Pigeon, an enforcement analyst with the board in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must be registered in the state of California in order to practice civil 
engineering on a California project," Pigeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law defines civil engineering in part as, "the use and design of 
materials of construction and the determination of their physical qualities." 
The law also says: "In order to safeguard life, health, property and public 
welfare, no person shall practice civil, electrical or mechanical engineering 
unless appropriately" licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the substitution of the wood wedges for metal struts, which had 
been specified for placement in the Hollywood and Vermont tunnels, Smirnoff and 
Navin accepted the contractor's contention that the wood could withstand 1,556 
pounds per square inch of pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent engineering firm retained by the MTA rejected the substitution 
in a report issued last week. The firm, Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates Inc., 
said that even the strongest oak wedges cannot be assumed to have a strength 
greater than 885 pounds per square inch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Substitution of the wood wedges for the specified metal struts was 
inappropriate," Wiss, Janney concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 20, workers were evacuated from one of the twin tunnels on Hollywood 
Boulevard because the contractor feared the structure could collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the California engineering board also said that, even if someone 
is registered as an engineer in another state, he is required to obtain a 
license from Sacramento to practice civil, mechanical or electrical engineering 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 A licensee from another state must pass a five-hour written exam encompassing 
"seismic principles and engineering survey" to practice civil engineering in 
California, said Pat Canterbury, assistant executive officer with the state 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the lack of licensing for Smirnoff and Navin is not unusual on 
the Los Angeles subway project, according to state engineering board records 
checked by The Times: 
</P>
<P>
 The records show that eight of the 10 officials assigned by Parsons-Dillingham 
as "resident engineers" on stations and tunnels under construction from 
Wilshire Boulevard to Hollywood Boulevard do not hold California engineering 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons-Dillingham, controlled by the Pasadena-based Parsons Corp., has 
received upward of $260 million for its work. Parsons Brinckerhoff, a New 
York-based firm that is unrelated, has received more than $300 million, along 
with its affiliated design-engineering firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Metro Rail official James Pott said a dearth of licensed engineers "is 
one of the indicators of a lousy management structure for a project of this 
scope." Pott, a licensed civil engineer, served from 1990 to 1992 on the board 
of the agency's subsidiary, the Rail Construction Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the multimillion-dollar disputes that have erupted because of disputed 
underground conditions -- from soil hardness Downtown to the sinkages in 
Hollywood -- Pott said the "hands-on" expertise of licensed engineers is 
needed. The MTA should insist, Pott said, that all the resident engineers are 
"licensed and in the ground -- in a dirty shirt and boots." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation requires that each of its 
"resident engineers" who oversee the building of freeways, roads and bridges be 
licensed by the state. Jim Drago, a spokesman for Caltrans, said that the 
department's resident engineers oversee each project, ensure that the work is 
built according to plans, schedule all payments to the contractors and must 
approve any request for a variation from the specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "On our projects, the key person is the resident engineer," Drago said. "The 
resident engineer is always licensed. They're running the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of Parsons-Dillingham's contract with the MTA, the firm provides 
resident engineers who serve as "the focal point for on-site Construction 
Management activities." The contract also says the resident engineers are 
responsible for "reviewing for content (and) processing submittals from 
contractors," in consultation with the MTA's design engineering group, headed 
by Parsons Brinckerhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to win back the federal funding, the MTA has submitted a reorganization 
proposal to the government. The proposal seeks to shift directly to the MTA 
many of the construction management functions now performed by 
Parsons-Dillingham. It does not address the qualifications of engineers working 
on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the proposal are to be discussed today at a meeting of the MTA board 
of directors.

TOLL OF FIRESTORMS STILL FELT AFTER YEAR OF HEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one year ago today that the first of 17 firestorms swept through 
Southern California's bone-dry forests and foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the frightening specter of the rampaging flames was the fact that 
the worst of the blazes -- in Malibu and Laguna -- were ignited by arsonists.In 
all, the flames claimed three lives, more than 200,000 acres and caused untold 
millions of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying those numbing statistics are hundreds of stories of adversity and 
resiliency. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the story of Tony Duquette, who watched a lifetime's worth of art 
treasures perish in the flames that engulfed his Thousand Oaks ranch. And Ron 
Mass, who was caught in a wall of flames while fleeing his Topanga Canyon home 
and has spent the last year undergoing painful treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 There are upbeat tales as well, such as that of Laguna Beach residents Lynn 
and Michael Lindsey, who are struggling, along with their neighbors, to 
reinvent the funk of their fire-besieged, artistic enclave of Canyon Acres. Or 
O. P. and Rosemary Reed, who have watched with hope and sorrow as the walls of 
their Malibu home rise from the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing weaves each of these stories together: a singular will to survive in 
the face of terrifying loss. Please see A18-A19.

CLINTON BEGINS MIDEAST MISSION; DIPLOMACY: PRESIDENT UNDERLINES SUPPORT FOR 
PEACE WITH VISIT TO CAIRO TOMB OF SLAIN LEADER ANWAR SADAT. TODAY HE WILL 
ATTEND SIGNING OF ISRAEL-JORDAN TREATY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton opened a four-day diplomatic mission to the Middle East with 
a visit early this morning to the tomb of Anwar Sadat, the former Egyptian 
president whose dramatic trip to Jerusalem in 1977 eventually cost him his life 
but planted seeds of peace that now have borne fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in the White House Rose Garden before leaving Washington, Clinton 
underlined the message he hopes his visit will deliver: "The United States 
stands by those who, in the words of the Psalms, 'seek peace and pursue it.' 
And we stand up to those who threaten to destroy the dream that has brought us 
to this historic moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Half a day later, in the wee hours of the morning here, Clinton stood at 
attention accompanied by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak -- who assumed office 
after Sadat's assassination in October, 1981 -- in front of a massive pyramid 
that Sadat built to honor the soldiers who died in the October, 1973, war with 
Israel. Clinton walked forward and, with head bowed, placed a wreath in front 
of the black stone marker that commemorates Sadat. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said Clinton wanted to visit Sadat's memorial to 
underline U.S. support for those who are willing to defy the odds and pursue 
peace, a theme that will be at the heart of the President's travels here, 
starting with his first formal meeting -- a session today with Mubarak and 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, noting that Mubarak has played an important role as an 
intermediary between the Administration and the PLO leader, say they hope to 
use the meeting to influence what both the U.S. and Israeli administrations see 
as a key strategic decision that Arafat must make in the next several weeks: 
whether to side decisively with Israel in the battle against the Hamas 
extremist movement or to back away from such moves for fear of deepening the 
splits in the Palestinian community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat is dealing with enormous political forces at work in his own 
movement," said State Department spokesman Mike McCurry. Clinton, McCurry 
added, will compliment the PLO leader on what he has done so far to combat 
terrorists based in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank but also plans to ask him 
to consider "what more he can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The President, McCurry said, hopes to deliver "a very firm message" that 
"there needs to be a concerted effort on the part of the international 
community to thwart and throttle" groups that seek to derail the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton himself noted in his departure remarks how the stakes have increased 
as the peace process has moved forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all the progress toward peace -- indeed, because of that progress -- we 
have witnessed a new wave of terrorism and violence," he said. "No step on this 
long journey requires more patience, more discipline, more courage, than the 
steps ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, for his part, told reporters as he arrived in Cairo a few hours before 
Clinton that he had "many issues to discuss" with the President. At the "top of 
things," he said, were the PLO's objections to what the Palestinians see as 
Israeli delays in implementing parts of the Israeli-PLO Declaration of 
Principles that the two sides signed in Washington just over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the declaration, the Palestinians gained limited autonomy 
in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, and elections were supposed to have 
taken place in July. But talks between the two sides on how to carry out the 
balloting have stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and Palestinian negotiators completed another round of talks Tuesday 
without agreement. Israel has been pushing for rules that would exclude Hamas 
and other groups opposed to peace from putting forth candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat also objected to parts of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty, to be signed 
today, that give Jordan a role in administering Muslim holy places in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Palestine, whether they like it or 
not," Arafat said in a speech to students at Al Azhar University in Gaza. ". . 
. I say to them that Jerusalem is not for sale." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say they understand Arafat's concerns, but they insist that the 
agreement between Jordan and Israel should not directly interfere with the 
PLO's rights under last year's peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, officials say, Clinton also wants to press Arafat to move 
more rapidly to establish true political institutions in the territories now 
under the control of his Palestinian Authority -- a subject repeatedly raised 
by Administration officials in meetings with Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have been concerned about the slow pace of converting the PLO 
from a movement into an entity capable of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher "sometimes sounds like an accountant" in 
meetings with Arafat, McCurry joked. "He'll say: 'Where's your business plan? 
How do you plan to spend your money?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings with Arafat and Mubarak are the opening moves in a grueling trip 
that will take Clinton through six nations -- Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Israel, 
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- before he returns to Washington on Saturday. The 
trip is the most extensive to the region by an American President since Richard 
Nixon traveled here in the summer of 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to witnessing today's treaty signing, Clinton also plans speeches 
to both the Israeli and Jordanian parliaments, a visit to Israel's Yad Vashem 
Holocaust memorial, a session with American troops in Kuwait and a meeting with 
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd. The diplomatic highlight of the trip is expected to 
be a meeting Thursday with Syria's President Hafez Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials deliberately have downplayed expectations of any 
dramatic breakthrough coming out of the Assad meeting, but at the same time 
they say the Syrian leader is key to the final step in building peace between 
Israel and its Arab neighbors. President Clinton's Itinerary 
</P>
<P>
 Today: Meets in Cairo with President Hosni Mubarak and Palestine Liberation 
Organization chief Yasser Arafat. Flies to Aqabah on the Israel-Jordan border 
for the signing of a peace treaty between those two countries. Travels to 
Amman, the Jordanian capital, to address the Jordanian parliament and spend the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday: Flies to Damascus, Syria to meet with President Hafez Assad. Then 
goes to Israel to meet with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, hold a joint news 
conference and address the Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: Flies to Kuwait to address American troops. Concludes trip in Saudi 
Arabia, where he meets with King Fahd.

VERDICTS BRING BIEHL FAMILY SENSE OF RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine hours after the first television news crew woke him at 3:30 a.m. Tuesday, 
Peter Biehl finally cried. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of Fulbright scholar Amy Biehl, who was stoned and stabbed to death 
by a mob in South Africa last year, nearly succeeded in keeping his composure 
as he spoke to a string of reporters about the three guilty verdicts handed 
down Tuesday half a world away. 
</P>
<P>
 But after laughing at stories of his daughter's life in college, reliving the 
family's experiences in South Africa and breathing relief over the sense of 
closure brought by the murder convictions, Peter Biehl and his 28-year-old 
daughter, Kimberly, became subdued. Both said the verdicts will never erase the 
image of Amy Biehl's bloody death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't deal with the violence, the violence that happened to her," 
Kimberly Biehl said. "I can't read about it. I can't think about it. It 
destroys me for the rest of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Biehl, nestled in the corner of a brown couch, took a deep sigh and 
wiped away tears behind his eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to the site of her death was difficult," he said. "The other thing is 
the certain knowledge we'll never see Amy again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing for a parent is losing a child -- and the fact that she 
died so far away. If only we'd been there, just to hold her." 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Biehl, who was in Guguletu township outside Cape Town helping to develop a 
voter registration program, was stoned and stabbed to death while driving 
friends home on Aug. 25, 1993. The killing -- one of the first among slayings 
of foreigners during pre-election violence in South Africa -- occurred only 
days before she was to return home to pursue a doctoral degree. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police accounts, Amy Biehl was driving her Mazda when a brick 
smashed through its windshield. Screaming, "One settler, one bullet!" a group 
of youths pulled her from the car and beat her. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongezi Manquina, 22, Mzikhona Nofemela, 19, and Vusumzi Ntamo, 21, members of 
the militant Pan Africanist Student Organization, were among a group of seven 
young men arrested in the days following Biehl's death. Charges against three 
of the youths were dropped when a witness refused to testify. A fourth 
defendant, a juvenile, still awaits trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor in the case immediately sought the death penalty after Judge 
Gerald Friedman handed down the guilty verdicts Tuesday. But a defense lawyer 
asked for leniency because of the young men's living conditions under apartheid 
and the highly charged political climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Biehl's family believes her attackers should not be given the death 
penalty when they are sentenced, possibly today. Linda Biehl said her daughter 
was opposed to capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel in this case more death is going to help anything," Linda Biehl 
said. "Yet I did not sense remorse in (the convicted killers) at all. I would 
hope they would eventually feel some . . . " she paused, choosing her words 
carefully, "understanding and guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Zachary Biehl, Amy's 17-year-old brother, added: "I think they should 
definitely be put away for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 People "can't blame three individuals for the huge problems they've had there" 
in South Africa, Zachary Biehl said. "Apartheid and inequity built up a lot of 
the anger. You have to consider that." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the slaying, the Biehls have learned more about South Africa and its 
people than they previously understood from headlines about elections and 
apartheid. Photos in a thick album on their coffee table show Zachary and 
daughters Kimberly and Molly, 24, surrounded by local children at squatters' 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Biehl recalled the moment when she first stood at the site where her 
daughter was stoned and stabbed. "A strong woman grabbed me and said: 'Mama! 
Mama Biehl!' " she remembered. "She just grabbed me with a passion and emotion 
and needed to recite her grief to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never even knew her name, and she was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Biehls have established the Amy Biehl Fund to help finance grass-roots 
projects, mostly in South Africa, such as those in which their daughter 
participated before her death. In the future, they hope to hold more 
fund-raising events for the foundation. Proceeds from a possible film or book 
about Amy Biehl's life would go to the fund, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said they hoped the trial would offer South Africa an 
opportunity to show the world and its own citizens that its justice system can 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, this is a small milestone for South Africa," Peter Biehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't like to think it's just a verdict for Amy," Linda Biehl added, 
"but for all the others who've lost their lives working toward democracy there. 
This group of people that did this to Amy, this group was not the soul of South 
Africa."

UCI WINS STATUS AS DESIGNATED CANCER CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine has been named a cancer center by the National Cancer Institute, a 
prestigious designation -- shared by only a handful of other institutions in 
California -- that is specifically intended to bring the fruits of basic 
research to patients' bedsides. 
</P>
<P>
 The designation, which UCI has been working toward for five years, was the 
only one given by NCI this fiscal year and a coup for the relatively young 
university, which is bucking to become a top-level research institution. It 
comes with a three-year grant of about $3 million and is the first step in 
obtaining even more coveted status as a "comprehensive cancer center" such as 
UCLA or USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the most important thing to happen for the cancer program in 
the last 15 years," said UCI Cancer Center Director Frank L. Meyskens Jr., of 
UCI's new status. "On a national level, it's of enormous importance." 
</P>
<P>
 The designation "is a validation of the excellent cancer-related research and 
treatment-related activities that take place at UCI (and) it puts us in the 
major leagues along with other university-based cancer centers around the 
nation," said cancer virologist Hung Fan, co-director of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-four institutions in the United States are NCI-designated cancer 
centers, seven in California. UCI is the first in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The designation is important not so much for grant money as for how it brings 
together a variety of disciplines and researchers in a common effort against a 
complex disease, said NCI and UCI officials. Much of the money will be spent on 
shared resources -- such as a biostatistics, molecular biology and 
tissue-storage facilities -- that individual research grants often do not 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Institutions that receive the NCI designation already receive the majority of 
their funding from other sources in the National Institutes of Health, for 
example, or from the American Cancer Society. UCI's center already had a base 
of more than $18 million in ongoing grants and contracts, said spokeswoman Fran 
Tardiff. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCI, more than 100 faculty members and seven research programs will be 
involved in the center's projects -- from the basic research program looking at 
how cancer cells grow to the clinical oncology program, which conducts patient 
studies. The NCI award is "sort of the glue that holds a . . . much larger 
research base together," said Margaret Holmes, chief of NCI's Cancer Centers 
Branch. It is "a support grant allowing (researchers) to coalesce into a 
synergistic group" that NCI hopes will provide new insights into cancer and new 
applications in the clinical setting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For patients in this region, that may mean inclusion in studies offering 
access to new medications and innovative treatments not widely available 
previously in Orange County. Next year, for example, UCI will embark on a bone 
marrow transplantation program and stem-cell therapy, which involves a new way 
of harvesting marrow. UCI's cancer center already enters more than 150 people 
annually in clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients also will benefit from the multidisciplinary approach to management 
of cancer and the fact that UCI is becoming more active in a national network 
of prominent research institutions, Meyskens said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not, however, always a short hop from basic research to clinical 
applications, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the applications are right around the corner, but other applications 
may take years before we can bring them to treatment of patients," Fan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the very act of preparing for the NCI designation has helped to 
close the traditional gap between basic scientists and clinical researchers, 
and has already stimulated an important dialogue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, he said, the two sets of researchers tended to be "a little bit 
parochial" in their approaches, "interested in their own problems." The 
division was reinforced by geography: Basic science researchers, by and large, 
were based at the main UCI campus in Irvine, whereas the clinical group was 
headquartered at the medical center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we could even think about starting this application (for the NCI 
designation), all of the cancer researchers . . . had to get together and 
understand the entire cancer picture at UCI," Fan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyskens, known for his laboratory and clinical research on melanoma and 
chemical prevention of cancer, was the "driving force" bringing the two sides 
closer together, said Fan, a basic researcher who studies mouse leukemia. 
Meyskens was recruited five years ago from the University of Arizona 
specifically to create an NCI-class cancer center. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCI designation brings greater visibility to a cancer center already known 
for its clinical accomplishments in gynecological oncology, melanoma, 
urological cancers and head and neck cancers, Meyskens said. UCI also is known 
for cancer prevention research and basic research into the origins of cancer 
cells, growth factors, virology and molecular biology. In general, NCI'S Holmes 
said, the increased visibility can be expected to attract more high-quality 
investigators and a greater level of interest and investment from inside and 
outside a center. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyskens said it will strengthen UCI's cancer services across the board and 
provide an overall boost to the institution. "UCI always was known for its 
basic research," he said. "Where we were behind was in the clinical research 
areas." Cancer Center Components

its receiving a cancer center designation from the National Cancer Institute.

DEBATE GREETS STANDARDS FOR HISTORY CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first national standards proposed for teaching history in America's public 
schools will be unveiled today amid complaints from conservatives that 
political correctness prompted the slighting of familiar historical figures 
such as Ulysses S. Grant and the Wright brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Authors of the proposed standards, which are meant to invigorate history 
lessons as part of a bipartisan drive to improve American schools, said the 
critics have misintepreted their work, which has received broad support from 
education, business and other leaders who helped decide what to include. 
</P>
<P>
 The document, a 271-page curriculum guide to be released by the UCLA-based 
National Center for History in the Schools, lays out the breadth and depth of 
history that American students should master in grades five through 12. It 
presents history in 10 major eras, from pre-colonial societies to post-1968 
contemporary America, and urges greater awareness of the roles of minorities, 
women and immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 An educated person, the standards recommend, should develop a "comprehensive 
understanding of the world, and of the many cultures and ways of life different 
from their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Before they become official, the standards require approval from the 
yet-to-be-appointed National Education Standards and Improvement Council. Like 
national standards announced in math, arts and geography, the history 
guidelines are voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 But the notion of even voluntary national standards has met resistance, in 
part because of the long history of leaving most key public education decisions 
in the hands of states and local school boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed history standards came under attack recently as drafts were 
circulated widely. In an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal last week, 
Lynne V. Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities during 
the Reagan and Bush administrations, denounced the document as "politically 
correct." 
</P>
<P>
 She said it emphasized minority cultures and contributions at the expense of 
such white men as Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein. Harriet Tubman, the 
African American who helped rescue slaves through the Underground Railroad, is 
mentioned six times in the document while her Civil War-era contemporary Grant 
is mentioned once and Robert E. Lee not at all, Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheney's piece, which has rallied conservative criticism of the standards, 
also argued that the guidelines put too much emphasis on negative episodes, 
such McCarthyism and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, while underplaying the 
historical significance of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary B. Nash, co-director of the UCLA center, said the critics are wrong about 
the contents. There was no attempt to include the name of every important 
historical figure in the guidelines, he said, and omission from the standards 
does not mean that Lee should be dropped from history books. Names were only 
used in examples of what students should learn, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a textbook but a curriculum guide," said Nash, adding that 
decisions about whom to feature in history lessons will still be made by 
textbook publishers and local educators. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed standards represent a "broad consensus" among educators and 
historians on de-emphasizing memorization of names, dates and places, and 
getting students to think about the significance of events and be able to apply 
the lessons of history to their lives, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
 The standards recommend, for example, that students be able to "demonstrate 
understanding of the principles articulated in the Declaration of 
Independence." Among other achievements, students in fifth and sixth grade 
should be able to define such terms as "all men," "created equal," "just 
powers" and "consent of the governed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth- through 12th-graders should be able to compare the principles of the 
Declaration of Independence with those of philosopher John Locke and to compare 
the American document with the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and 
Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rebuttal to the Cheney article, Nash said the Constitution is given 
thorough treatment in the standards and should be an integral part of every 
American's grasp of history. "The business of the Constitution being slighted 
is truly nonsense," Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the national standards began during the Bush Administration and was 
expanded upon by the Clinton Administration as part of its "Goals 2000" program 
to improve schools and help the nation compete in a global economy. Proposed 
standards for teaching history in kindergarten through fourth grade are 
scheduled to be released Nov. 4.

DEFENSE ASKS ITO TO BAR TV FROM DNA HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson's lawyers have asked that television cameras be excluded from a 
crucial hearing on the admissibility of DNA evidence so jurors in the case will 
not be exposed to potentially prejudicial information, according to a letter 
sent to Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the courtroom camera is eliminated during the (DNA) hearing, it will 
reduce the extent of media saturation while the jury panel is at risk," Simpson 
attorney Peter J. Neufeld said in an Oct. 18 letter to Ito that was made public 
this week. In addition, Neufeld suggested that the lawyers for both sides avoid 
any discussion of the DNA test results during the hearing, which is not 
scheduled to begin until after a jury has been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA evidence is expected to play a key role in the prosecution case against 
Simpson, who has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 killings of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Neufeld warns that if prosecutors call their full complement of 
what they term "potential" witnesses, and defense attorneys summon a like 
number, the DNA hearing could last as long as five weeks, far longer than 
previously estimated. He asked Ito to limit the number of witnesses that each 
side is allowed to call, but if Ito declines and Neufeld's estimate proves 
correct, it could be well into December before opening statements in the trial 
are delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before that hearing begins, the trial is proceeding more slowly than 
anticipated because jury selection is moving at a crawl. Candidate after 
candidate has been dismissed after admitting to the slightest hint of exposure 
to publicity in the wake of Ito's admonition directing them to avoid all 
television, radio, newspapers and magazines -- and even to refrain from 
entering bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief hiatus Tuesday morning, jury selection resumed in the afternoon. 
Ito and the attorneys painstakingly questioned the first prospective juror, a 
60-year-old merchandise buyer from Bell Gardens who said she had witnessed a 
murder in Oregon in 1972. The judge and lawyers probed her reaction to that 
experience and questioned her about her impressions of Simpson and her 
reactions to media coverage of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Simpson, the woman acknowledged that she had a generally favorable 
impression, but added: "I also believe in justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she had conscientiously abided by Ito's order to avoid all 
media, a direction that he gave to prospective jurors after a splashy new book 
was released. She said her only exposure to information about the case had come 
during a news snippet that appeared on a videotape that she had made of soap 
operas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fast-forwarded past it," she said of the news report, adding that she has 
fastidiously avoided a television at her workplace despite the teasing of 
colleagues. "There's no Mafia watching," she recalled one colleague saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito responded: "You'd be amazed by how many people will contact the court 
about what jurors are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge asked the woman to return Nov. 2 for further questioning, but he 
dismissed another potential juror who at first said she had few opinions about 
the case. Under pointed questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, the 
woman eventually acknowledged that she doubted the story that police gave when 
they said they jumped the wall to Simpson's estate hours after the slayings 
partly because they were concerned that someone might be injured inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt the police were looking for Mr. Simpson rather than being concerned 
that he was hurt," said the prospective juror, who also called Nicole Simpson a 
"party girl" and said she may have been killed by someone she met socially. She 
expressed other doubts about the prosecution theory of the case as well but 
insisted that she could be fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting outside the prospective jurors' earshot, prosecutors asked that she be 
excused because of her views. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've expressed some opinions that cause me concern," Ito told the woman. 
"You seem to have formed opinions that are skeptical of the prosecution's 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way I feel right now," she responded. "Of course, if the evidence 
is different, I'll change my beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge did not accept that explanation, excusing her instead. Afterward, 
Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro angrily disputed that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "My blood is boiling," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 That woman will not return, but those who are cleared for service from the 
first panel have been directed to come back Nov. 2. Then, prosecutors and 
defense attorneys can exercise their right to make use of their peremptory 
challenges, excusing prospective jurors with whom they feel uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 44 prospective jurors who have undergone extensive questioning about their 
exposure to news media reports, 25 are still in contention for a place on the 
jury and 19 have been excused. At the close of Tuesday's session, one potential 
juror -- a 66-year-old retired bookseller from Alhambra -- was in the middle of 
questioning and was told to come back today. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a jury is picked, Ito has said he hopes to break the trial for a day or 
two and then commence the so-called Kelly hearing to assess the DNA evidence in 
the case and determine whether it should be admitted. While that hearing is 
under way, Ito has said he expects jurors to return home with a warning that 
they are not to pay any attention to the case or publicity surrounding it. 
</P>
<P>
 That hearing could last as long as a month, however, and prosecutors in 
particular have worried that jurors might be exposed to the debate even if they 
try to avoid it. Neufeld's suggestions about barring the television camera from 
the proceeding and limiting the discussion of the evidence are intended to 
prevent that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
 But they offer yet another possible flare-up in the debate between news 
organizations and Ito over the public's right to observe the Simpson case as it 
unfolds. Media lawyers were reviewing Neufeld's letter Tuesday and considering 
whether it warranted a response. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Ito has scheduled a hearing for Nov. 7 to weigh the possibility of 
pulling the television camera from the courtroom for the duration of the trial. 
In the meantime, the camera is not in use because court rules prohibit 
televising jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld's letter also offers the most comprehensive preview to date of the 
witnesses and the parameters of the DNA hearing. In it, Neufeld writes that 
prosecutors list nine potential witnesses who might be called and predicts that 
they may add at least two more -- one each from the LAPD laboratory and the 
state Department of Justice laboratory, where tests are being performed.

 Neufeld did not say whom the defense might call, but listed a number of 
scientists and statistical experts who he said appeared on the prosecution list 
of possible witnesses. Ito has previously indicated that he may call witnesses 
of his own, but has said that he will not make a final decision on that until 
after he reviews the witness lists prepared by both sides.

 Prosecutors have said they expect each expert witness to take about a day to 
question, including cross-examination.

LEAK IN SIBERIAN OIL FIELD TURNS INTO MASSIVE SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian officials confirmed Tuesday that a massive oil leak, possibly 
outstripping the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska, spread recently across 
northern Siberian bog land after aging pipelines ruptured and dikes holding 
back the escaped oil gave way under torrents of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuel and Energy Ministry spokesmen claimed that the 24-square-mile spill in 
the Komi region was well under control and largely cleaned up, but top ecology 
officials flew off from Moscow to inspect the remote tundra, and Russian media 
accused the oil company involved, Komineft, of a giant cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere between 14,000 and 60,000 tons of oil were spilled," Ecology 
Ministry spokesman Alexander Shuvalov estimated. "While I wouldn't term the 
accident a disaster at this point, I would certainly call this extraordinary 
and an emergency situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum Russian estimate of 60,000 tons would mean that about 18 million 
gallons of oil -- far more than the 11 million released in the Exxon Valdez 
spill in 1989 -- leaked into a similarly fragile environment. Villagers are 
reporting films of oil coating parts of nearby swamps and rivers, but the 
region is so remote and the difficulty of measuring the leaked oil so great 
that no exact figure on its volume has yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Komineft claimed the total spill was less than 15,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Energy Department officials said they were formally notified by 
Russian leaders Tuesday afternoon that the spill amounted to about 13,700 tons 
of crude oil -- about 40% of the Exxon Valdez spill -- and would probably 
require U.S. emergency assistance. Deputy Energy Secretary Bill White told 
reporters that an unnamed U.S. company working in the area had estimated the 
spill at 20 times that size, or about 274,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a significant spill . . . , whether it's 100,000 barrels or 2 million," 
said White, who characterized the result as a "disaster" for an environmentally 
fragile region and for a Russian industry increasingly plagued by shoddy 
standards and unmet needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. firm working in the region told U.S. officials that the spill 
appeared to be six to seven miles long, about 13 yards wide and a yard deep. A 
film provided to the U.S. Energy Department by Russian sources indicates that 
at some point earlier this year, someone on the scene set fire to the spill. In 
the film, thick black clouds of smoke can be seen billowing from a solid lake 
of crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Moscow newspaper Izvestia, the U.S. oil company Conoco, which 
works in an area nearby, sounded the alarm and Vice President Al Gore offered 
emergency ecological aid for the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the impression that Russian agencies responsible for protecting the 
environment care more about their reputation in the eyes of the civilized world 
than the ecological safety of our territory," Izvestia complained. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Russians may have been slow to react because such spills are 
extremely common in oil-rich regions of Siberia. Russian officials have 
estimated that 10% of Siberia's oil production may be lost to spills and leaks, 
amounting to millions of tons a year of Russia's best export. 
</P>
<P>
 White said that Washington on Tuesday offered to dispatch a U.S. team to 
Russia, including experts from the Environmental Protection Agency, Coast 
Guard, Interior Department and private firms specializing in the cleanup of oil 
spills. He said that Moscow had not yet responded to the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically a giant swamp the size of Western Europe, the Siberian oil region is 
as crucial to Earth's ecology as the rain forests of the Amazon, ecologists 
say. Russian oil extraction remains environmentally shoddy, from the rusting 
pipelines that carry the oil to the careless workers who often overfill pools 
of waste near oil wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists contended that the Siberian spill could have been as great 
as 200,000 tons; Greenpeace activist Ivan Blokov said that the leak near the 
Komi town of Usinsk "is unique because it is the first of such scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Blokov said that oil had been leaking through 23 holes in a 30-mile stretch of 
old pipeline from late August until early September. Other reports said serious 
leaks began as far back as February. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers built tall dikes to contain the escaped oil, Russian officials said, 
but the dikes were swept away by torrential rains Oct. 1. Millions of gallons 
of oil were released into two rivers that flow north into the Pechora River, 
which runs into the Barents Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emergency Ministry claimed that a major containment and cleanup operation 
kept the Pechora from being badly affected by the spill, although spokeswoman 
Marina Ryklina said it did carry scattered spots of oil a yard or less in 
diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two Pechora tributaries most damaged, the Kolva and Usa, carried a 
three-inch-thick film of oil on their surfaces, the Itar-Tass news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 White emphasized that a cleanup operation in Arctic conditions would probably 
be extremely difficult and virtually without precedent. The Pechora is expected 
to freeze solid within two weeks, at which point the oil could migrate slowly 
beneath the ice and into the Barents Sea. Temperatures fall below 50 degrees 
below zero, halting outdoor work. And the kinds of equipment needed for the 
task do not exist in the remote Arctic region. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the polluted rivers have no villages on their banks, but 
Greenpeace reported that an oil slick between one and five yards wide runs near 
the village of Ust-Usa. Siberia's oil-rich regions are home to many native 
peoples who survive by hunting and fishing. When a river dies, they must move 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 The salmon and shorebirds that use the Arctic Ocean's sprawling network of 
wetlands, however, will have more difficulty moving out of the spill's way. 
Those form the base of the food chain for the larger beasts that inhabit and 
migrate through the Arctic and its waters, according to the Washington-based 
Center for Marine Conservation, an environmental watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Exxon Valdez disaster, the worst oil spill in U.S. history, the tanker 
ran aground and spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials estimated the damage of the Usinsk spill at about $100 
million.

SOUTHLAND PRIMPS FOR VISIT BY PRINCE CHARLES; ROYALTY: MARKET IN INGLEWOOD, 
MECHANICS TRAINING CENTER ON ITINERARY. 'IT'S LIKE A DREAM,' SAYS ONE WORKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At Crenshaw High School, the python stays, the iguana goes. At Brookes 
Restoration Co., the bronze bust of Queen Elizabeth retains its high perch on a 
shelf, but the Wedgwood cup adorned with cameos of Prince Charles -- and his 
estranged wife, Diana -- gets whisked away. And at the Vons supermarket in 
Inglewood, exit Coca-Cola display, enter Schweppes tonic, Carr's crackers and 
Colman's mustard. 
</P>
<P>
 From South-Central to West Hollywood to Cerritos, no detail is too small for 
Angelenos preparing to greet Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, 
who arrives in the Southland on Monday for a five-day visit. Though he will 
spend a night or two hobnobbing with entertainment industry folk, much of this 
trip takes him to learning centers and after-school youth programs in parts of 
Los Angeles seldom trod by royal feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked that he's coming to a supermarket, of all places," said assistant 
produce manager Michael Parker, arranging oranges at the Vons on Manchester 
Boulevard in Inglewood, which will get a royal visit Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles is stopping at this Vons to promote British foods. He is also meeting 
members of the Urban Retailing and Development Program that the supermarket 
chain has instituted. The program trains lower-income people in the community 
to work in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a dream come true," said Lillie Robinson, 40, who went through the 
program and now works in the meat service area. She sets up the meats and fish 
and kills the live catfish that the store sells. "Ever since Mike (Courtis, the 
store supervisor) called me into the office and told me I was chosen to meet 
the prince, I've just been smiling to myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she won't be meeting him, shopper Bess Aubert said she understands 
why the prince put this part of town on the royal itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's curious about South-Central," said Aubert, 57, pushing a cart of 
groceries Thursday afternoon. "He's like everybody else. He wants to see for 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles Urban League Automotive Training Center on Crenshaw 
Boulevard -- where the prince will visit a class in brakes and suspension -- 
some student mechanics are indifferent, others intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get to meet somebody important," said Jose Moreno, 20. For Moreno, Charles 
is exotic. "He's from another part of the world. The President we know about. 
We see him on television and in the papers. But we don't know anything about 
the prince." Moreno paused. "He's the prince of England, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 But if some are stunned Charles chose to visit them, others are convinced they 
were destined for a royal appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 When the students who run Crenshaw High School's highly praised Food From the 
'Hood salad dressing venture heard he was coming to L.A., they figured their 
project was just the kind of inner-city success story that interested him. So 
they wrote to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are they getting a visit, they have been chosen to host a lunch. For 
weeks, they've been planning with a precision worthy of, well, Buckingham 
Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch will be held in their quarter-acre garden behind the school. They 
sodded, landscaped -- and agonized over the 100 person guest list, finally 
paring it down to community activists, their own supporters, a few actors 
(Edward James Olmos, for one), film director John Singleton and their reliable 
Federal Express delivery man, a Crenshaw High graduate himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles' tour at Crenshaw will take him past the school's resident reptiles. 
The glass-caged python was no problem. But the usually free-roaming iguana will 
be confined to quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 They've hired a caterer -- Greg Dulan of the nearby Dulan's restaurant. The 
menu: smothered pork chops, corn-bread dressing, cranberry sauce, fresh collard 
greens -- also baked chicken and a vegetarian entree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing where collard greens and black-eyed peas will take you," said 
Dulan with a chuckle, surveying the part of the garden where he will serve 
royalty. "South-Central L.A. gets a lot of negative publicity," he mused. "I 
would like him to know he can come here and have a nice lunch and not see a 
drive-by shooting." He glanced toward the street. "I hope that won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Melinda McMullen, a full-time business adviser to Food From the 'Hood since it 
started, reassured Dulan. "It'll be the safest place in town that day," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps for Charles the most welcoming. The 45-year-old prince leaves 
behind a native land obsessed with the latest foibles of the royals -- 
including a couple of recent tell-all books. One offers a scandalized account 
of the 33-year-old Princess of Wales frolicking with her riding instructor; the 
other, with Charles' blessing, contends that the Prince of Wales was goaded 
into a loveless marriage by his father. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is L.A., haven for fallen angels and eccentrics of every stripe. The 
prince will find the people he has chosen to visit mostly curious, excited and 
grateful for the attention. And though the itinerary does not say, "Revamp 
Public Image: Oct. 31-Nov. 4," Charles would, no doubt, be just as grateful if 
Angelenos saw him less as a caricature of the tabloids and more as a world 
figure with the clout to call business leaders to conference tables, the star 
status to get Aaron Spelling to donate his house for a fund-raiser, and a 
longstanding interest in the revitalization of inner cities everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been 17 years since Charles visited L.A., and in those years both city 
and prince have dramatically changed. Riots, earthquakes and a changing of the 
mayoral guard from the long-sitting Tom Bradley (who greeted the prince on his 
last visit) to the political neophyte Richard Riordan (who will be at the 
airport this time) have irrevocably altered Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The prince, for his part, has weathered a rocky marriage, a highly publicized 
separation and the usurping of his limelight by his charismatic wife. And the 
job he's spent a lifetime training for is still not available. 
</P>
<P>
 When British aides made advance trips to Los Angeles this past summer to plan 
the prince's visit, the stuff of scandal was taboo. The talk was of the 
prince's interest in seeing how Los Angeles had rebuilt itself since the 1992 
riots, and how the prince -- who has involved himself in training and 
employment programs, among other urban projects in London -- could get a sense 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home, the Prince commands an array of charities, business groups and 
community organizations known as the Prince's Trusts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes to see people doing things," said British Consul General Merrick 
Baker-Bates, the ranking British diplomat in Los Angeles, "and he likes to see 
young people." 
</P>
<P>
 It took two years to find time on his schedule, but the prince is finally 
taking advantage of a 1992 invitation from then-Mayor Bradley and then-chairman 
of the county Board of Supervisors Deane Dana. Charles' trip also coincides 
with the two-month-long, citywide British arts celebration known as the UK/LA 
Festival. And the visit is logistically convenient -- when he leaves L.A., he 
jets off to Hong Kong for an environmental conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The prince and his entourage of 13 will be ensconced in the lush environs of 
the Bel-Air Hotel. "It's obviously a great honor," said Frank Bowling, the 
British-born vice president and general manager of the hotel, who declined to 
give any details of the arrangements. "They've asked me to keep it very low key 
-- which is the keynote of this hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrives on a British Airways flight, the prince will be met by Riordan 
and any Los Angeles City Council members who choose to come. 
</P>
<P>
 After that he speeds off to the British consul general's Hancock Park 
residence for a reception for 150, including community activists and members of 
the City Council and Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Charles will do the requisite glittery things: He will attend the 
premiere of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (directed by his countryman Kenneth 
Branagh -- who will attend with his wife, Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson) 
at the Cineplex Odeon in Century City. Then he will go over to the Century 
Plaza for an after-theater fund-raising dinner for 1,200 who paid at least $250 
a ticket to benefit various local charities and UK/LA. 
</P>
<P>
 And Charles will don a tuxedo for one black-tie dinner -- a $2,500-a-ticket 
fund-raiser, also for UK/LA and local charities, hosted by Arco Chairman 
Lodwrick M. Cook and MCA-Universal Chairman Lew Wasserman at the home of 
television producer Aaron Spelling. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no shortage of people who want to meet the prince. At the Cerritos 
Center for the Performing Arts alone, he will attend three receptions. 
Somewhere in there, he will get to see the Royal Shakespeare Company's 
performance of "Henry VI: The Battle for the Throne." 
</P>
<P>
 Other stops include the Foshay Learning Center in South-Central; the Sheriff's 
Department's Lennox Youth Activity Center; the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art; the Quantel Co. in Beverly Hills, a British film and TV special effects 
company; the Huntington Library in San Marino and the PUENTE Learning Center in 
Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was delighted," said Sister Jennie Lechtenberg, the founder and executive 
director of the PUENTE center, which offers about 1,400 students a variety of 
classes ranging from job training to adult education and language skills. "When 
our students are allowed to see or hear international figures, it's so good for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not bad for fund raising either. "This kind of visit is always good 
for a nonprofit organization because of the publicity it brings," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles also is squeezing in a visit to the West Hollywood workshop of Frank 
Brookes, a British-born master potter who restores broken ceramics and glass. 
Brookes, painfully aware of the disintegration of the Royal Relationship, has 
already removed from his shelf the Wedgwood cup commemorating the 1981 marriage 
of Charles and Diana. "I didn't want to cause any embarrassment," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles finishes off the week with a speech at the Downtown public library to 
a group of local business leaders at a conference organized by the prince's 
international Business Leaders Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he gets on a plane for Hong Kong, Lillie Robinson will be back to 
serving up catfish at the Vons fish counter, and the Crenshaw High School 
iguana will be free to amble where it pleases.

TRANSMITTED DISEASES ARE FLOURISHING AMONG THE YOUNG. EXPERTS BLAME IGNORANCE, 
DOUBLE STANDARDS AND A LACK OF HONEST DISCUSSION.

 Carrie knew all about safe sex. And she was cautious. When her friends began 
having sex in high school, she steadfastly refused. 
</P>
<P>
 But, at 18, she fell in love and decided it was OK because this boyfriend 
seemed so nice, so safe. They didn't even discuss condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, as the relationship faltered and Carrie learned more about her 
boyfriend's past, she decided to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases. 
After the exam, a clinic counselor told the tearful adolescent that she had 
chlamydia, the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the country, 
which often produces no symptoms in women but can cause sterility if left 
untreated. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my first partner. He supposedly loved and cared about me. I guess I 
thought love would protect me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 What's disconcerting to health experts is that, even in the age of AIDS, there 
apparently are so many young Americans like Carrie: naive about the hazards of 
sex in the '90s -- and greatly at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, are flourishing in the United States. 
Several are thought to be at their highest rates ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But what alarms health officials most is that teen-agers and young adults are 
now the primary victims of STDs. And STD infections, in turn, boost the risk of 
contracting the human immunodeficiency virus, becoming infertile or giving 
birth to babies with health problems. (Most HIV-infected people contract the 
virus in their late teens and early 20s, according to statistics.) 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age girls in particular have become more promiscuous in the last two 
decades, experts say. The problem stems in part, they say, from a dearth of 
educational materials and treatment programs for teen-agers and a reluctance by 
parents and doctors to deal honestly with young people regarding the do's and 
don'ts of sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The infection rates -- from age-old gonorrhea to newer scourges such as 
chlamydia and human papilloma virus -- are highest among Americans ages 15 to 
25, and show little signs of abating. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 12 million new STD infections each year, two-thirds occur among people 
under 25. 
</P>
<P>
 And since young people are generally more promiscuous, less likely to use 
condoms, less likely to see a doctor and, among females, more biologically 
prone to STDs, they are the generation of Americans who stand to suffer the 
greatest consequences, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly puzzling is that this is happening when AIDS and safe sex are 
universal discussion topics for all ages. But the message clearly is not 
getting through, particularly to teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a predicament so disturbing to health officials that many are pleading 
for a restructuring of the nation's approach to controlling STDs to focus more 
on young people and sex education in addition to a consistent public-health 
effort to prevent disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts note that, historically, when the federal government has pumped money 
into syphilis and gonorrhea prevention, infection rates have dropped. But when 
the funds are reduced, they rage back. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal funds have mainly targeted these two diseases, which largely affect 
adults, while STDs that affect younger people have received little attention 
from the government. According to experts, new tactics are long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The AIDS epidemic is as bad as it is because we, as a culture, have not been 
good at dealing with sexuality," says Peggy Clarke, president of the American 
Social Health Assn., the only non-government organization devoted to fighting 
STDs. "Our rate of STDs is a national embarrassment. We are the only 
industrialized country in the world with so big a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The inadequate response can be traced to every sector, from the government to 
health professionals to educators to parents, according to a 1993 report from 
The Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit corporation for research in policy 
specializing in reproductive health. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can this be happening in the age of AIDS?" asks Patricia Donovan, a 
senior associate at Guttmacher who wrote the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts point to several factors that include: 
</P>
<P>
 * An increasingly promiscuous society in which people begin having unprotected 
sex younger and have more partners during their "unattached" period -- often 10 
to 20 years -- before they commit to one monogamous relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 * Americans' inability to talk about sexuality and provide factual sex 
education in the home, schools and health care settings, even though the 
culture is highly sexualized. 
</P>
<P>
 * An antiquated approach to STDs by governments, health organizations and 
schools, which makes it difficult for youths to get treatment, screening -- or 
even basic information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid . . . that people are not aware of the problem or don't believe it 
will happen to them," Donovan says. "Teens, who are a particularly strong risk 
group, often make the judgment that their partner is clean even though they 
have no way in the world of knowing that." 
</P>
<P>
 A look at statistics shows high infection rates for young people in every STD 
category. For the first time, teen-age girls have the highest gonorrhea rates 
in the nation; teen-age boys rank second. The rate in adolescent girls is 20 
times higher than in women over 30, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. At least 10% of sexually active teen-age girls have had 
gonorrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 "That teen-age girls are now the harbingers of this disease is amazing," says 
Deborah Howard, program coordinator of the STD/HIV Prevention Training Center 
in Long Beach, a joint federal, state and city program to educate health 
professionals about STDs. This is particularly scary, she says, because many 
girls in the 15 to 19 age bracket do not come in for treatment -- meaning the 
incidence is probably greatly underreported. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolescent rates for chlamydia, which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease 
as well as infertility, range from 15% to 37% in females and are around 10% in 
males. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in several studies, 32% to 46% of sexually active teen-age girls were 
found to be infected with human papilloma virus, most of them carrying a strain 
that can cause cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, one in four sexually active adolescents will become infected with 
an STD by age 19, says Dr. Adele Dellenbaugh Hofmann, a professor of adolescent 
medicine at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Human papilloma virus, which is difficult to treat and can become chronic, is 
not a disease that must be reported in the United States, and the federal 
government has no program to deal with it. Health officials in some states have 
only recently been asked to report chlamydia cases, but there are few programs 
to control the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a large number of youths who are sexually active, and we still have a 
large percentage of youths who are not using condoms. I don't see this problem 
as diminishing significantly," Hofmann says. 
</P>
<P>
 One in five adult Americans carries some type of viral STD, such as herpes, 
which are not curable, according to the Guttmacher report. When the curable, 
bacterial STDs -- such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia -- are included, 
Americans have at least a one in four lifetime chance of contracting an STD. 
</P>
<P>
 But the price of sexual freedom is more profound for 15- to 19-year-olds than 
for their parents because of the widening pool of infections in that age group. 
</P>
<P>
 About one in five reported AIDS cases is diagnosed among people in their 20s. 
But since the virus has a long incubation period -- about 10 years -- most were 
adolescents when they were infected, according to the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
 That fact is particularly alarming because many STDs act in synergy with HIV 
to enhance the transmission of both, experts say. Having an STD, such as 
gonorrhea, increases by as much as 100 times the chance of contracting HIV from 
an infected partner, according to some estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "As time goes on, we're seeing more and more of a connection between HIV and 
syphilis and gonorrhea," says Sylvia Drew Ivie, director of T.H.E. Clinic, in 
Los Angeles, which treats underserved families and has a large teen-age 
clientele. "I think the fact that (syphilis and gonorrhea rates) are high is 
not only alarming by itself but by their connection to hidden HIV infection. 
One of the indicators of HIV are these other diseases." 
</P>
<P>
 Although HIV has helped raise awareness about all STDs, there is a common 
misperception that, other than HIV, the diseases are easily cured and cause no 
lasting harm. That is not true, Donovan says. As infections slink through the 
population they lay a minefield of future reproductive problems, such as 
infertility, ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people understand how common some of these serious consequences 
are, particularly infertility," Donovan says. "That has a major impact on the 
lives of millions of women who would like to have children." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, STDs often attack women silently, without symptoms. But this 
crucial bit of information rarely reaches young people. For example, one 1990 
study of college students in Canada found almost half didn't know STDs can be 
asymptomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventy-five per cent of women with chlamydia don't have any symptoms," 
Donovan says. "They don't know until five years later, when they have serious 
pelvic pain, or 10 years later, when they can't get pregnant, that they had 
this STD that would have been easily curable." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers are sexually active younger and have more partners than did 
previous generations. According to a new national poll of more than 11,000 high 
school-aged youths, 54% said they were sexually active, compared to 29% in 
1970. The portion of 15-year-olds having sex has risen from 4.6% in 1970 to 
26%. Almost one-fifth of the sexually active teens say they have had four or 
more partners. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being less likely to use condoms, young people are more likely 
to use drugs and alcohol, which often leads to unwise decisions about sex. 
</P>
<P>
 In the national study, published in July's American Journal of Public Health, 
over half of the sexually active teens said that they had not used a condom 
when they last had intercourse. Among students who used illicit drugs, 
one-third said that they had multiple partners and did not use condoms when 
they last had sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sexual behavior is putting a sizable portion of high school students at 
risk," says Dr. Richard Lowry, a CDC adolescent health expert and lead author 
of the report. Having several partners is especially dangerous for teen-age 
girls because, studies show, they often have an immature cervix which may be 
more easily infected. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest problem among young people -- male or female -- may be that 
they don't perceive themselves at risk for STDs -- until it happens, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread efforts to promote safe sex because of the HIV threat have helped 
reach some, but far from all, young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've used HIV as the 'great bad outcome' to encourage people to undertake 
precautions," says Dr. Stuart Berman, of the CDC's Division of STD/HIV 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando, now 20, started having sex years ago but didn't bother to use 
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Then his aunt died of AIDS. "That changed me," he says, sitting in a clinic 
where he works part-time as a peer counselor to youths seeking treatment for an 
STD. "I used to think if a girl looks clean she was probably clean. I didn't 
know there were so many diseases." Armando himself was treated for an STD and 
says he now always uses condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the HIV threat may be convincing some high school and college 
students to practice safe sex, says UCI's Hofmann, "There is no evidence that 
the HIV threat or anything else has affected the behavior of the alienated 
youth population, such as the kids who drop out of school." 
</P>
<P>
 And the HIV threat message may miss some adolescents who simply don't think 
about sex or its repercussions until it's too late. When adolescents were asked 
in one study why they do not use protection, 65% said it was because sex was 
unexpected. Youths may avoid using condoms because it indicates they "planned" 
to have sex, Hofmann says. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people, adult or adolescent, understand that having sex with one person 
may mean being exposed to the diseases of many others, says Laura Brannon, an 
Ohio State University researcher who has studied what she calls "the phantom 
sex partner." 
</P>
<P>
 This fact may be especially true for teen-agers, among whom STD rates are 
extremely high and condom use low. For example, one study in Atlanta found that 
24% of teen-aged women with only one sexual partner had chlamydia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia, a 20-year-old from the Westside, learned that lesson the hard way. She 
recently contracted gonorrhea from her longtime boyfriend after he returned 
from a six-month military tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so upsetting because I had always used protection when I was dating 
other people," Tricia says. "This was the one person that, for three years, I 
had never questioned. When you get something from someone you care about, just 
think what you could get from strangers who will tell you anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Condoms are very effective in preventing disease if used correctly every time, 
Donovan says. "But just giving people condoms is not enough. You have to 
educate people on their risks. I think one of the real shortcomings (of the 
nation's attempt to control STDs) is the refusal of television networks to air 
condom ads." 
</P>
<P>
 Many sex educators criticize what they say is a deadly double standard: Sex 
education for children and teen-agers is restrained at the same time that young 
people are bombarded by sexuality on TV and in movies and song lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Guilt, shame and fear that their parents will discover their sexual activity 
prevents many adolescents from seeking health care when they do suspect they 
have an STD, Hofmann says. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, children 12 and older can seek STD treatment on their own. But, 
she says: "These kids still don't know where to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Few school-based health clinics offer such services, experts say. As for 
government-sponsored STD clinics, many are clearly marked units in urban health 
departments where adults line up for appointments early in the morning and wait 
for hours, noted one expert, who added: "Teen-agers wouldn't be caught dead 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 And it would take a gutsy child to raise the issue of sex with a pediatrician 
or the family doctor. In one report on college freshmen published in the 
journal Pediatrics, 79% said they had never been counseled about STDs by a 
physician. Only one-third of sexually active females ages 15 to 19 are screened 
for an STD each year, according to another study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either the doctors themselves have no idea of the prevalence of STDs or they 
don't want to offend their patients by suggesting they may have one of these 
diseases," Donovan says. 
</P>
<P>
 That is beginning to change. The American Medical Assn. in 1992 issued a 
report on adolescent health advising doctors to regularly counsel their teen 
patients about responsible sexual behavior and to make condoms and 
contraceptives available. The report also called for routine STD screening for 
sexually active youths. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent STDs in young people, experts say, more sex education has to occur 
in doctors' offices, family planning clinics, health centers, schools and 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We educate our young children early not to get in a car with a stranger. I 
don't see how we cannot educate our kids in regard to sexual decision-making," 
Hofmann says. "Sure, it would be a lot easier if kids weren't sexually active, 
but that ain't the fact. If we are going to have a permissive society, we have 
to equip our kids for it. We can't just say, 'Just say no.' " The Teen Factor 
</P>
<P>
 About 55% of U.S. adolescents are sexually active. Members of this group have 
higher rates of sexually transmitted disease than any other age group, 
according to health experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the percentages of sexually active teen-agers infected with: 
03,23,05,07 Men Women Gonorrhea 6% 10% Chiamydia 10% 22% Trichomoniasis* - 21% 
Human papilloma virus 15% 39% * Does not usually appear in men 
</P>
<P>
 Note: These averages represent ranges of infection as reported by several 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms to Know 
</P>
<P>
 Gonorrhea and syphilis have been around for ages, but several other sexually 
transmitted diseases have been identified only in the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlamydia: Bacterial. Often produces no symptoms in women. Men may experience 
discharge and burning sensation. Curable. 
</P>
<P>
 Genital Herpes: Viral. Symptoms are often mild but can include itching or 
burning sensation and pain in legs or genital area. Blisters or painful sores 
may appear and recur any time. Incurable, but a drug is available to reduce 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonorrhea: Bacterial. Symptoms often absent but can include discharge, burning 
sensation and itching. Curable. 
</P>
<P>
 Hepatitis B: Viral. No symptoms present in one-third of all cases but can 
cause fever, headache, muscle ache, vomiting and diarrhea. Infections often 
clear up themselves, but some people become chronically infected. A vaccine is 
available to prevent infection. 
</P>
<P>
 HIV: Viral. Often asymptomatic for many years. Later symptoms include immune 
system deterioration. Symptoms can be treated but infection is otherwise 
incurable. 
</P>
<P>
 Human Papilloma Virus: Viral. Produces painless fleshy warts. Warts can be 
removed but infection often reappears. 
</P>
<P>
 Syphilis: Bacterial. Produces painless sores in early stages. Curable. 
</P>
<P>
 Trichomoniasis: Parasitic infection. Women may have vaginal discharge and 
odor. Curable.

MAYOR MAKES U-TURN, BACKS VALLEY SUBWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just hours before a crucial vote today on mass transit in the San Fernando 
Valley, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan weighed in Tuesday on the side of a 
mid-Valley subway line, dealing what could be a decisive blow to supporters of 
an elevated train above the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan made the announcement through his press office late Tuesday afternoon, 
less than 24 hours before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is expected 
to decide the issue, the subject of years of bitter debate over the best way to 
link the West Valley to the Metro Rail system running from the East Valley to 
Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 With his backing, supporters of a mostly underground line paralleling Burbank 
and Chandler boulevards now have at least four votes lined up on the 13-member 
MTA board, which meets this afternoon. In addition to Riordan, the proposal has 
won the blessing of Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman -- the underground 
route's most outspoken advocate -- and two of Riordan's three appointees to the 
MTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a positive step," Edelman said of Riordan's endorsement. "It will aid 
immeasurably in the final outcome, so I thank the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 But fellow county Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the most ardent champion of the 
Ventura Freeway route, blasted the decision as a "slap in the face" to Valley 
voters, who favored a monorail above the freeway in a non-binding 1990 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to have the mayor on board, but we'll prevail," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of an aerial system above the Ventura Freeway median -- often referred 
to as a monorail although no specific type of train has been decided on -- have 
suffered repeated setbacks in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 These included an independent cost comparison that severely diminished the 
formidable financial advantage the freeway proposal enjoyed in earlier 
estimates. The study showed that an elevated railway would be only $19 million 
cheaper -- less than 1% of the cost of either project -- than a subway line if 
some subway stops did not include enclosed stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrowed cost differential has led some transit officials to rethink the 
position adopted in 1992 by the MTA's precursor, the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission, in favor of the Ventura Freeway option. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan himself, in embracing the subway proposal Tuesday, reversed his 
endorsement of the freeway elevated rail option in his election campaign last 
year. At the time, Riordan contended that the freeway choice would be far less 
expensive for the cash-starved MTA than a mostly underground line. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor switched sides for several reasons, Deputy Mayor Rae James said 
Tuesday. Riordan took into account the reduced financial advantages of the 
freeway line, consulted extensively with Valley residents and elected 
officials, and considered the pro-subway stands taken by the city's own 
transportation department and the City Council, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation department last week recommended approval of the 
Burbank-Chandler alignment as a better way of connecting with local bus 
services and easing congestion along the Ventura Freeway corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 James said the mayor was also influenced strongly by the argument that the 
underground line through the middle of the Valley would provide a backup 
transit corridor if the Ventura Freeway across the southern rim of the Valley 
were damaged in a natural disaster. Also, passengers on the subway would have 
an uninterrupted ride on the Metro Red Line all the way into Downtown Los 
Angeles, without having to change trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Riordan is interested in finding ways to further economize on subway 
construction, said his press secretary, Noelia Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said the mayor wants the MTA to explore the idea of postponing some 
station openings in the West Valley, where ridership is expected to be lower, 
and to look into "cut-and-cover" construction techniques, which would put the 
line in a covered trench that would not be as far underground as a traditional, 
and more expensive, deep-bore subway system. 
</P>
<P>
 James said her boss rejected arguments that an at-grade system along the 
Ventura Freeway median -- another alternative recently introduced by the 
route's supporters -- could be the cheapest option of all, possibly by $600 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some officials have called for further study of the idea, James said 
the time to make a final decision is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can second-guess this thing into the next century. We've been 
second-guessing it through the last decade," she said. "It's time to decide 
this now." 
</P>
<P>
 She added that the city transportation department does not believe an at-grade 
system would save as much money as its proponents claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Riordan's support for the subway system came as a blow, Antonovich's 
camp is hoping to win over undecided MTA directors, such as Huntington Park 
City Councilman Raul Perez, for whom economics remains the key. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly going to lean toward whoever offers the greatest savings," 
Perez said. "We don't have money to spare anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 MTA board member John Fasana, who is also leaning toward the freeway route, 
said the MTA should reduce underground construction in light of the recent 
spate of subway tunneling problems beneath Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Riordan's three appointees to the MTA board, Northridge real estate agent 
Mel Wilson and Los Angeles attorney Stan Sanders have lined up in support of 
the mayor's position. 
</P>
<P>
 The third, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, has not publicly 
taken a stand, but Deputy Mayor James said Riordan has spoken with Alatorre and 
that the two have reached "an understanding," although she declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor feels that the city needs to vote as a block on this one," James 
said.

HEMET SCHOOLS SUED OVER SEX CURRICULUM; EDUCATION: PROGRAMS URGE PREMARITAL 
ABSTINENCE. CRITICS SAY THEY IGNORE CONTRACEPTION AND PROMOTE A SKEWED 
CONSERVATIVE AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Hemet Unified School District was sued Tuesday for using three sex 
education programs that promote premarital abstinence. Critics say they violate 
state curriculum guidelines and are inaccurate, biased and distorted. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit on behalf of a group of Hemet parents is believed to be the first 
in California targeting the use of the controversial sex education programs 
known as Sex Respect, Teen-Aid and Choosing the Best. 
</P>
<P>
 The three programs are growing in popularity among conservative school boards 
nationwide because they preach that abstinence from premarital sex is the best 
way to avoid unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit charges that the texts harm students because they do not include a 
discussion of contraception, are gender-biased and promote a skewed, 
conservative moral agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, one text preaches that "premarital sex, especially with more than 
one person, has been linked to the development of emotional illness." Another 
handbook concludes that "one of the saddest things about today is so many men 
don't want to be real fathers." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the 
civil liberties advocacy organization People for the American Way. An attorney 
for the plaintiffs said she did not expect the suit to go to trial for at least 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hemet students are the latest pawns in a battle being fought nationwide to 
replace real sexuality education with pre-censored educational materials that 
rely on fear, shame, religious indoctrination and blatant misinformation," said 
Jean M. Hessburg, director of People for the American Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Salo, executive director of Planned Parenthood of San Diego and Riverside 
Counties, charged the Hemet school board with using the district "as a 
playground to perpetuate its own selfish, rigid and narrow doctrine." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging the value of teaching that abstinence is a completely 
effective means of preventing pregnancy, he said that "vows of abstinence break 
more often than condoms do." 
</P>
<P>
 "These curricula withhold information that can save lives and is vital in the 
preparation of adulthood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Hemet school district adopted Sex Respect for use in 
seventh-grade classes. Last month, the board of education, over the objections 
of a curriculum advisory committee of teachers and parents, the district's 
attorney and the superintendent, voted 5 to 2 to use the three programs this 
year in grades six, seven and nine. 
</P>
<P>
 The state sets guidelines for sex education as a component of health classes 
but does not approve specific texts or endorse particular curricula. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemet Associate Supt. William Wong said the district would not comment on the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But board of education member and seventh-grade teacher Bonnie Parks, who uses 
Sex Respect in her classroom, said the district will address the state-mandated 
subjects of contraception, HIV and AIDS with supplemental materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're accused of not teaching kids about contraceptives, and that's a lie," 
she said. "We use Sex Respect and Teen-Aid to emphasize abstinence, but we use 
statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and other recognized 
authorities, as the law requires, to talk about the success and failure rates 
of contraceptives, including condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my classroom, we hear about condoms on almost a daily basis. We say that 
condoms are not 100% effective but if someone chooses to disregard responsible 
sex in the only true safe way -- abstinence -- then condoms do reduce the risk 
and you'd be foolish not to use them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit's plaintiffs said Tuesday that they were unaware that Hemet 
teachers planned to supplement the three abstinence-based programs with other 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the critics said, just presenting the contents of the three programs 
to students does them a disservice. 
</P>
<P>
 Other school districts that have adopted Sex Respect and similar programs have 
been threatened with lawsuits, but this is the first such suit filed in 
California, the program's publisher and attorneys familiar with the programs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU threatened to file such a lawsuit against the Vista Unified School 
District in San Diego County but backed off after the district rewrote some 
controversial statements in the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks said she questioned the motives of Planned Parenthood in filing the 
lawsuit. "I think they're in it for their own profit and benefit because their 
big push is for contraceptives and abortions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks said that 250 California school districts use Sex Respect but that fear 
of legal action keeps others from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to stand up for what we think is right and best for the kids," Parks 
said. "I think these programs are even more in keeping with California law than 
other comprehensive curricula, because the law says abstinence should be 
emphasized and the other programs lay it out like it's just one choice on the 
smorgasbord."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN CRITICIZES WILSON FOR MADONNA JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You knew it had to happen, some time in this weird, roller coaster of a 
governor's race. Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown have clashed over all manner of 
things, from crime to immigration to welfare to education to government 
spending. And now the bickering has centered on an unlikely subject: Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that Madonna, the bellybutton-piercing, body part-baring singer in the 
sexual vanguard of American culture, who found herself Tuesday plunged into the 
increasingly testy back-and-forth between the two major candidates for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 It began when Wilson, speaking at the Long Beach convention of the League of 
California Cities, renewed his attacks on Brown for what he terms her failure 
to campaign for 1993's Proposition 172. That proposition extended a half-cent 
state sales tax and earmarked the money for local police and public safety 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has often used that effort as a symbol of what he says is Brown's 
history of sitting on the sidelines during tough battles. This time, however, 
he added a zinger: 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were campaigning for Proposition 172, to put more cops on the streets 
in cities and unincorporated areas, to ensure that you had the resources 
necessary to protect public safety, Kathleen Brown was harder to find than a 
nun at a Madonna concert," he said. "Come to think of it, she was even harder 
to find than Madonna at a nunnery." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience, several hundred mayors and city council members, laughed. Brown 
most certainly did not. Instead, she issued a heated statement through a 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a woman and as a Catholic, I'm deeply offended by Pete Wilson's latest 
smear," Brown said. "I ask him to retract his statement immediately and to 
apologize to California women and Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson is a 27-year career politician but apparently he hasn't learned 
that making off-color remarks about gender or religion during a political 
campaign is totally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 After his initial response to Brown's remarks -- "Huh?" -- Wilson spokesman 
Dan Schnur said that the governor had no plans to retract his statement as 
Brown had requested. 
</P>
<P>
 "No offense was intended to either Madonna or nuns," he added, barely 
swallowing a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had no response to -- or was not aware of -- the governor's other punch 
line of the day, when he compared Brown's campaign to the venerable Queen Mary, 
docked within view of the convention center in which he was speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Both, he said, are "firmly anchored -- and not goin' anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 All joking aside, Wilson continued Tuesday to cast Brown as essentially a 
newcomer to the rough-and-tumble world of gubernatorial-level decision-making. 
He cast himself as the key figure in the trenches, who had worked with the 
Democrat-controlled state Legislature to help yank California from its 
recessionary days back toward an upcoming "California Renaissance." 
</P>
<P>
 "We not only got through tough times, we produced change, real and important 
change," said Wilson, a former league member when he was mayor of San Diego. 
"We broke partisan gridlock, we junked the job-killing machine, and we created 
reforms sufficient to turn California instead into a job-creating machine. In 
just the past 18 months, we've added 150,000 new jobs, and they are good, 
high-paying jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 He castigated Brown for supporting compulsory binding arbitration on contracts 
with municipal employees, a position that he said could destroy the finances of 
many cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," he added acidly, "she has never had to balance a budget, as you 
have, as I have. I balanced 11 as mayor and four as governor of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has argued throughout the campaign that Wilson has in fact botched the 
state budget in the past four years, spending more than was coming in and 
seizing revenues that formerly went to the cities.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; INDIANS GIVE LARGE SUMS TO DEMOCRATS; TRIBES SEEKING TO 
EXPAND THEIR CASINO BUSINESSES SUPPORT BROWN AND UMBERG BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOUND 
REPUBLICANS UNRECEPTIVE TO THEIR INTERESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After a midsummer meeting with Kathleen Brown to discuss gambling on Indian 
reservations, several California tribes proposed raising more than $1.5 million 
for the state Democratic Party to help Brown and other Democrats win statewide 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal leaders say they have turned to the Democrats out of frustration with 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who has refused to negotiate an agreement that 
would allow tribal casinos to offer slot machine-like electronic games and 
certain Las Vegas-style card games where the house acts as banker. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, Indian tribes have contributed $500,000 to the California Democratic 
Party, in some cases earmarking their contributions to aid Brown's campaign to 
unseat Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also targeting funds for Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), who 
is trying to defeat Republican state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. Like Wilson, 
Lungren has been fighting expansion of Indian gambling in California, arguing 
that it will eventually lead to Las Vegas-style gambling throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In entering the political arena for the first time in such a forceful way, the 
tribes say they are just doing what other special interests have long been 
doing in California -- using their money to build support for politicians who 
are more to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign spokesman Steven Glazer said that there was nothing unusual 
about large contributions to candidates from special interests. He noted 
several examples of Wilson taking substantial sums from groups interested in 
legislation that would require the governor's signature. Among Wilson's largest 
contributors are groups with an interest in gambling issues -- including card 
rooms and Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Glazer said Brown had never taken a specific position on the Indian proposal 
to expand gambling, which could be included in a formal compact negotiated 
between the tribes and the governor's office. "She believes it should be a 
negotiated settlement under federal law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur acknowledged that the governor has 
accepted more than $150,000 from horse racing interests, but he said that horse 
racing is a "very strictly regulated industry that's already in existence." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Wilson does not accept contributions from the Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's appropriate to take money from interests who are 
advocating such a wide-scale expansion of gambling," Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wilson and Brown are raising huge sums of money to run for governor -- 
$41 million between them through the end of September. The amounts contributed 
by the Indian tribes place them in an elite group of big-money givers. In 1990, 
the state prison guards' union -- the California Correctional Peace Officers 
Assn. -- became a force to be reckoned with in statewide politics by spending 
almost $1 million to help elect Wilson. Altogether, organized labor has 
contributed about $2.5 million to Brown over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 After representatives of several tribes met with Brown, Mark Nichols, chief 
executive officer of the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, sent a letter to more 
than a dozen tribal leaders enthusiastically supporting Brown and enlisting 
support to raise $1.1 million for her and $550,000 for Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 At the summer meeting, Brown "expressed her unqualified support of California 
tribal governments as sovereigns," Nichols wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview Tuesday, Nichols reiterated that the tribes were angry 
with Wilson's refusal to negotiate. He and other Indian leaders say that 
Wilson's intransigence follows a series of court opinions that favored the 
tribes and opened the way for adding new games that would give tribal casinos 
an atmosphere more like casinos in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Wilson, Brown was "absolutely receptive," Nichols said. "I've heard her 
on many occasions say that what the governor is doing is not productive for the 
state, that tribes have these rights and the governor should get about the 
business of obeying federal law." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nichols noted that Brown stopped short of committing herself to a specific 
negotiating position. He said, "I want to be very clear in the context of any 
discussion, she always shied away from any kind of negotiation on any 
particular point." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols said that the tribes have discussed the possibility of sharing their 
gambling profits with state government as part of reaching a settlement on 
expanded Indian gaming. And that could mean added state revenue of $500 million 
a year or more. "This has got to be a win-win situation for the citizens of 
California and for California Indian tribes." 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated that the Cabazon group has contributed $300,000 to various state 
and federal candidates this year, including more than $100,000 to the 
Democratic Party on behalf of Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian leaders say that gambling has given tribes a new economic independence, 
freeing many from federal support for the first time in more than a century.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 188; TOBACCO INDUSTRY DROPS LOW PROFILE AND 
AIRS TV AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scrapping their low-profile strategy, tobacco industry backers of Proposition 
188 are airing television ads, opening with a public school educator touting 
the measure as the best way to stop children from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The television ads open with the face of Nancy Frick, vice principal at a 
middle school in the Kern County town of Lamont, and switches to a blackboard, 
on which is written some of the initiative's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Frick describes Proposition 188 as the "best way to keep cigarettes away from 
kids" -- even though health experts, physicians and the California PTA are 
opposed to the initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot, and say the state already has 
tougher laws to keep children away from cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working with kids for 24 years," Frick says in the ad, which aired 
in Los Angeles Monday and was to appear in all California television markets 
Tuesday. "I know what motivates them, and I understand the way they think. I 
want to stop kids from smoking. Proposition 188 will help do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents decried the ad. Betty DeFea, on the board of the California PTA, 
which urges a "no" vote on the initiative, called it "unconscionable" that an 
educator appears on a pro-Proposition 188 advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pretty sneaky of the tobacco people," DeFea said. "It is totally 
appalling that anyone involved in the schools is coming out on the side of 
tobacco. It is a terrible message to pass along to children." 
</P>
<P>
 Frick's voice also is on radio ads, speaking from a longer script, as a school 
bell rings in the background. A key component of the Yes-on-188 campaign 
involves provisions dealing with minors' access to cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted at Mountain View Middle School in Lamont, Frick said she decided to 
appear in the ads, even though she knew that Gov. Pete Wilson recently signed 
into law a bill aimed at combatting smoking among children. State health 
officials say the new law is stronger than the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Frick broke off a telephone interview, saying that she needed to supervise 
children on the playground. She could not be reached again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Stitzenberger, strategist for the Yes-on-188 campaign, said Frick has not 
been paid for her efforts. "She may well take some criticism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lamont, Frick's action was approved by John Chavez, superintendent of the 
2,600-student school district. Chavez told The Times that Frick called to ask 
if she could appear in the radio and television ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her that as an individual you can do whatever you want," Chavez said. 
"I think we have to take a risk if we believe in things." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez said he was generally unfamiliar with 188, but thought that it would be 
"one step in the right direction" toward limiting children's access to 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez added that he did not know who was financially backing the measure. 
When he was told that tobacco companies were funding it, he paused and asked: 
"Why would they cut their own throats?" 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris U.S.A., the nation's largest cigarette maker, has spent $5 
million on Proposition 188 so far. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, the nation's 
second-largest cigarette maker, has spent $1.6 million on Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, which led narrowly among likely voters in a recent Los Angeles 
Times poll, would repeal all local smoking bans in California and block a 
statewide ban on smoking in most indoor workplaces from taking effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 188 becomes law, business owners could set up smoking sections 
and no longer be forced to ban smoking outright as they must, for example, in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would repeal 150 local ordinances that restrict cigarette 
vending machines, and prohibit local governments from passing new smoking 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also would increase penalties to a maximum of $2,000 for selling 
tobacco to minors, and says cigarette vending machines could not be placed in 
areas accessible to minors unless they are equipped with electronic locking 
devices controlled by business operators. 
</P>
<P>
 But the initiative also might force repeal of the new, tougher anti-smoking 
law aimed at minors. The law, set to go into effect in January, increases fines 
for selling tobacco to minors to $6,000, and seeks to give the state Department 
of Health Services some authority over enforcing laws barring tobacco sales to 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the campaign, Stitzenberger said he did not plan to air broadcast 
spots, and would focus instead on direct-mail appeals aimed at "educating" 
voters about the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 He changed tactics after two major health foundations put $2 million into an 
unusual broadcast and newspaper ad campaign aimed at presenting both sides of 
the debate over Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 Stitzenberger calls the nonpartisan effort outrageous, contending that 
tax-exempt institutions should not be involved in a campaign. He charges that 
the ads, while designed to be nonpartisan, take a stand against 188 by 
reporting that the measure is "supported by tobacco companies, and opposed by 
health groups." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are going to do is not let the airwaves be dominated by this 
organization," Stitzenberger said, explaining the change in strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Media Center, a nonprofit group in San Francisco, received the 
$2-million grant from the Wellness Foundation and Alliance Health Systems 
Foundation to design the voter-education campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually believe in the intelligence of the California voter," said Gary 
Yates, interim president of Wellness. "We want to make sure people know who was 
making the arguments, who the key spokes-people were and who the key supporters 
were."

LACK OF DIVERSITY IN FIRE, POLICE FORCES CITED; DEMOGRAPHICS: WOMEN AND 
MINORITIES ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN SOUTHLAND DEPARTMENTS, ACLU STUDY FINDS. 
AREA OFFICIALS SAY PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Despite some improvements, fire and police departments in Southern California 
remain overwhelmingly segregated by race and sex and are largely the domain of 
white males, according to a study conducted by the American Civil Liberties 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, released today, found large disparities between the racial and 
gender makeup of departments and the populations they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was even worse than I thought it would be," said Allan Parachini, who 
oversaw the study as director of public affairs for the ACLU of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which surveyed 107 police departments and 80 fire departments in 
eight Southern California counties, concluded that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although some fire and police departments have made modest gains in 
recruiting African Americans, they have for the most part failed to keep pace 
with ethnic changes that are reshaping the region. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women are "woefully underrepresented" on forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although police departments have very poor rates of sex and race 
integration, fire departments are substantially worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Command structures of police and fire departments are more segregated than 
the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a measure of integration common in research, the ACLU ranked departments 
on how well their composition reflected that of their communities. Thus, a 
diverse force such as Compton's -- which is 59% African American -- is still 
considered segregated by that standard because there are significantly fewer 
Latinos and women in the Police Department than in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In four cities -- Burbank, Compton, San Gabriel and Indio -- both the fire and 
police departments appeared on the ACLU's "most-segregated" list. Both the fire 
and police departments in Pasadena and Los Angeles, on the other hand, made the 
best-integrated list. The Santa Monica and Laguna Beach police departments also 
ranked high. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the police forces surveyed, 33 had no Asians or Pacific Islanders on the 
force, 24 had no African Americans, six had no women and three had no Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Antony Pate, director of research for the nonprofit Police Foundation in 
Washington, D.C., said the regional portrait of predominantly white male police 
forces is "not unlike what we and others are finding around the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos and women in particular are underrepresented, Pate noted. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Pate pointed out that many forces are far more diverse than 
they used to be. "If you look where they started from 20 or 30 years ago, many 
departments have made notable progress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to happen as a matter of course," Pate continued. "The 
departments that have made the most significant progress are the departments 
that have made the most concerted efforts to recruit women and minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials say it will take time for their departments to adjust to the 
massive demographic shifts of the 1980s, and argued that the ACLU study does 
not accurately reflect the efforts they are making to keep pace. Many 
departments say many of their white male personnel were hired more than 20 
years ago, when their communities looked different. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't throw out all the police department you have now and hire all 
Mexicans," said William F. Reed, chief of the Huntington Park Police 
Department, which has seen its community evolve from a white, middle-class 
suburban enclave in the 1950s to a largely Latino city that is frequently the 
first stop for newly arrived immigrants from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Reed said the ACLU would probably file a suit against his department 
if it simply laid off its veterans because they are white. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ACLU's time would be better spent targeting agencies they know have 
discriminatory hiring practices, rather than just issuing broad statistical 
statements," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the new sworn officers hired by the South Gate Police Department since 
1990 have been Latino, said South Gate Chief Ron George, who lamented that the 
ACLU used the term "segregated" to describe the departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it sound like it's being done on purpose and it's part of a plan," 
George said. "We're all trying the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that small departments are at a competitive disadvantage when 
recruiting highly sought-after minority and women applicants. Larger 
departments, he said, can offer more money, better benefits and hiring 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 George said many of the non-sworn police personnel, from desk assistants to 
the entire Explorer squad, are Latino. "That's what we see as our officers of 
the future. As the older officers retire they're being replaced with younger 
Latinos," he said. "People just need to be patient and see what our progress 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Paules, city manager of San Gabriel, said budgetary pressures coupled 
with low turnover have virtually frozen the composition of his city's fire and 
police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to diversify when you're not hiring," Paules said, adding that 
three Asian American police officers and two Latino firefighters had just been 
hired. He said that the chief of police has spent time recruiting outside a 
shopping center popular with Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Tom Lazar of the Costa Mesa Police Department faulted the ACLU numbers, 
naming three Japanese American officers on a force that the ACLU study says has 
no Asians or Pacific Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying he had never before heard a complaint about the department makeup, 
Lazar added, "Obviously, when it comes down to the actual hiring process, those 
individuals who score highest, regardless of sex or color, are the ones we 
hire." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa officers are hired through the city's personnel department. "I'm 
black, and I'm the personnel manager," said Howard Perkins, "and we have two 
recruiters who are Japanese, so this is not an area that we take lightly." 
Police Demographics 
</P>
<P>
 An ACLU study of fire and police departments in eight Southern California 
counties found that many are segregated by race and sex. While some police 
departments in L.A. County, such as Pasadena and the LAPD, were praised, 
others--including Burbank, San Gabriel and Whittier--were found not to reflect 
their communities' changing demographics. 07,16,08,10,09,10,09,09 % Male %

ON CALIFORNIA: A ROLL CALL OF SECOND OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So these two out-to-pasture immigration officials and an Orange County 
businessman with a grudge got together and agreed it would be swell to run all 
undocumented people out of California. They drafted a ballot proposition that 
would require schools and hospitals to report any suspected "illegal." 
Kindergartners. Pregnant mothers. No matter. No papers, boom, out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone loved the idea, at first. Not only was it perfectly mean, and thus in 
keeping with the times. It also gave Californians someone else to blame for 
their statewide slump. The governor was the most enthusiastic supporter. He 
seemed convinced that this Proposition 187 could reelect him. He would pretend 
that California was Alabama, circa 1960, that his name was Wallace, not Wilson 
-- and ride anger to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 As Election Day drew closer, though, opponents began to emerge, as if from 
caves. They ranged from the President of the United States to police officers, 
from preachers to farmers to schoolteachers to doctors to Chamber of Commerce 
directors to editorial writers -- a wide and deep coalition of the sort of 
people traditionally trusted by Californians to provide political guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 These opinion leaders disagreed on why they disliked Proposition 187. Some 
thought it bad politics, others bad policy. Some worried about the loss of 
billions of tax dollars, others warned of disease or unpicked crops. What they 
agreed on was this: If illegal immigration was a disease, Proposition 187 was 
the wrong medicine. Listen to just a few of them: 
</P>
<P>
 * "I don't think as a matter of practice," said President Clinton, "it's a 
good thing to condition an election referendum, much less other elections in 
California, on a measure that even the supporters say is unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
 * "I won't be mincing words on this one," said the Rev. Richard C. Kennedy, an 
Orange County priest ". . . Proposition 187 is immoral. This thing is 
completely godless." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Profoundly anti-conservative," wrote Jack Kemp and William Bennett, two of 
the tallest trees in the GOP forest. "It relies on a Big Brother approach and 
imposes expensive regulatory burdens. It is also a mandate for ethnic 
discrimination. Does anyone seriously doubt that Latino children named 
Rodriguez would be more likely to appear to be illegal than Anglo children 
named, say, Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Proposition 187 tax bill," said Mel Katz, a director of the Greater San 
Diego Chamber of Commerce, "is like an arrow aimed right at the heart of 
California's business climate." 
</P>
<P>
 * "An ill-conceived and punitive measure," said Dr. Matt Harris, president of 
the California Academy of Family Physicians, "that could significantly add to, 
not reduce, the cost of caring for undocumented persons by denying needed 
preventive and primary care services." 
</P>
<P>
 * "This nativist abomination," thundered William Safire of the New York Times, 
arguably the nation's most influential conservative columnist, "would deny 
education to children of illegals and turn teachers into government informers, 
and for what -- to put hard-working immigrants in costly jails." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The proponents claim they drafted Proposition 187 to test education 
requirements before the Supreme Court," stated Pete Mehas, a Fresno County 
educator. "I say we don't deserve to be part of some grand legal experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 * "This initiative," said Max Turchen of the Congress of California Seniors, 
"requires Americans to report to the authorities people they 'suspect' of being 
illegal aliens. But what are the criteria? The color of your skin? The way you 
talk? Your last name?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be in trouble," said Ray Lopez, a Fowler raisin packer. "If 
you removed every illegal from this state tomorrow, you'd see the businesses -- 
and not just the agricultural businesses -- start to crumble." 
</P>
<P>
 * "A bandage approach to a major problem," said Ernie Gustafson, who for 
decades ran INS operations in Southern California, "dreamed up by politicians 
and wanna-bes. . . . It will solve nothing. It will take the innocence of 
children and make them the scapegoats of a failed policy." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Imagine," argued a Wall Street Journal editorial, "telling hundreds of 
thousands of teachers, nurses and bureaucrats that they now must report 
nationality suspects. Maybe California could hire former East German and Soviet 
neighborhood spies to demonstrate how to perfect such a hearsay reporting 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 * "A fraud," said L.A. County Sheriff Sherman Block, "and a hoax." 
</P>
<P>
 And so on. This week the testimonials at last seem to have broken through the 
anti-immigrant hysteria. Polls are finding Proposition 187's support in sharp 
decline -- along with its aura of inevitability. The measure drafters, 
meanwhile, have been busy explaining away reported links to a white supremacy 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Gov. Wilson, who once perched himself so eagerly on the 
Proposition 187 limb as king of the immigrant-bashers? Well, perhaps he's heard 
the sound of sawing. A new TV ad of his opens with warm, fuzzy shots of the 
Statue of Liberty.

FIRE, POLICE FORCES FAULTED ON DIVERSITY; DEMOGRAPHICS: WOMEN AND MINORITIES 
ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN SOUTHLAND DEPARTMENTS, ACLU STUDY SAYS. LAGUNA BEACH 
POLICE DEPARTMENT, HOWEVER, IS ONE OF THE 'MOST WELL-INTEGRATED.'

 Despite some improvements, fire and police departments in Southern California 
remain overwhelmingly segregated by race and sex and are largely the domain of 
white males, according to a study conducted by the American Civil Liberties 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, released today, found large disparities between the racial and 
gender makeup of departments and the populations they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was even worse than I thought it would be," said Allan Parachini, who 
oversaw the study as director of public affairs for the ACLU of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which surveyed 107 police departments and 80 fire departments in 
eight Southern California counties, concluded that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although some fire and police departments have made modest gains in 
recruiting African Americans, they have for the most part failed to keep pace 
with ethnic changes that are reshaping the region. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women are "woefully underrepresented" on forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although police departments have very poor rates of sex and race 
integration, fire departments are substantially worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Command structures of police and fire departments are more segregated than 
the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a measure of integration common in research, the ACLU ranked departments 
on how well their composition reflected that of their communities. Thus, a 
diverse force such as Compton's -- which is 59% African American -- is still 
considered segregated by that standard because there are significantly fewer 
Latinos and women in the Police Department than in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the Brea, Costa Mesa and Los Alamitos police departments 
appeared on the ACLU's top 20 "most segregated" list. The Laguna Beach Police 
Department, however, was recognized as one of the "most well-integrated." 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach department is 84% white in a community that is 90.6% white. 
The department's percentage of African Americans and Latinos is twice that of 
the community's, and the percentage of Asian American officers equals that of 
Asian Americans in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Laguna Beach Fire Department was among the 15 most 
segregated, the report said. All 38 firefighters are white males. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Fire Chief Richard Dewberry said, "The bottom line is the people most 
qualified are the ones we've hired. And we hire without regard toward color or 
sex. In recent years, we've had no females apply, though the hiring process is 
done through the city. It looks like we're racist and that's just not the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire departments in La Habra, Orange and San Clemente, which recently 
dismantled its department, also were on the ACLU's list of 15 most segregated. 
</P>
<P>
 Antony Pate, director of research for the nonprofit Police Foundation in 
Washington, said the regional portrait of predominantly white male police 
forces is "not unlike what we and others are finding around the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos and women in particular are underrepresented, Pate noted. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Pate pointed out that many forces are far more diverse than 
they used to be. "If you look where they started from 20 or 30 years ago, many 
departments have made notable progress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to happen as a matter of course," Pate continued. "The 
departments that have made the most significant progress are the departments 
that have made the most concerted efforts to recruit women and minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials say it will take time for their departments to adjust to the 
massive demographic shifts of the 1980s, and argued that the ACLU study does 
not accurately reflect the efforts they are making to keep pace. Many 
departments say many of their white male personnel were hired more than 20 
years ago, when their communities looked different. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't throw out all the police department you have now and hire all 
Mexicans," said William F. Reed, chief of the Huntington Park Police 
Department, which has seen its community evolve from a white, middle-class 
suburban enclave in the 1950s to a largely Latino city that is frequently the 
first stop for newly arrived immigrants from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Reed said the ACLU would probably file a suit against his department 
if it simply laid off its veterans because they are white. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ACLU's time would be better spent targeting agencies they know have 
discriminatory hiring practices, rather than just issuing broad statistical 
statements," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Tom Lazar of the Costa Mesa Police Department faulted the ACLU study, 
naming three Japanese American officers on a force that the ACLU study says has 
no Asians or Pacific Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying he had never before heard a complaint about the department makeup, 
Lazar added: "Obviously, when it comes down to the actual hiring process, those 
individuals who score highest, regardless of sex or color, are the ones we 
hire." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa officers are hired through the city's personnel department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm black, and I'm the personnel manager," said Howard Perkins, "and we have 
two recruiters who are Japanese, so this is not an area that we take lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate Chief Ron George lamented that the ACLU used the term "segregated" 
to describe the departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it sound like it's being done on purpose and it's part of a plan," 
George said. "We're all trying the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that small departments are at a competitive disadvantage when 
recruiting highly sought-after minority and women applicants. Larger 
departments, he said, can offer more money, better benefits and hiring 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 George said half of the sworn officers hired since 1990 are Latino, as are 
many of the non-sworn police personnel, from desk assistants to the entire 
Explorer squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we see as our officers of the future. As the older officers 
retire they're being replaced with younger Latinos," he said. "People just need 
to be patient and see what our progress is." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Paules, city manager of San Gabriel, said budgetary pressures coupled 
with low turnover have virtually frozen the composition of his city's fire and 
police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to diversify when you're not hiring," Paules said, adding that 
three Asian American police officers and two Latino firefighters had just been 
hired. He said that the chief of police has spent time recruiting outside a 
shopping center popular with Asian Americans.

A YANK CALLED MACARONI SYMBOLIZES U.S. IN HAITI; CARIBBEAN: STAFF SGT. SAM 
MAKANANI AND HIS SPECIAL FORCES COLLEAGUES HAVE NOT ONLY VANQUISHED THE 
MILITARY BUT HELPED RESTORE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The music is Caribbean rap, the dance a fast shuffle, the words a hymn to the 
man the Haitian kids in this shabby southern seaside town call Sgt. Macaroni, 
the man who gets the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Macaroni doesn't mess around," the kids sing, "Macaroni's a good guy. 
Macaroni got them good." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Macaroni is U.S. Army Special Forces Staff Sgt. Sam Makanani, a 
35-year-old career soldier from Hawaii who has come to personify the American 
troops who have freed Jacmel from the repressive Haitian military, returned 
democratic government and fixed the city's electrical plant. 
</P>
<P>
 One of about 50 Special Forces troops who arrived in this city of about 60,000 
people on Sept. 23, Makanani has made a name for himself by his aggressiveness 
in running down remnants of the former military regime and working to restore a 
democratic, civilian government. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the massive presence of U.S. troops in the capital, Port-au-Prince, 
and a smaller group in the northern city of Cap Haitien, small Special Forces 
units are the sole representatives of the American army in most of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Billing themselves as "the Peace Corps with guns," these units, some as small 
as 12 members, patrol towns, search for suspected agents of the former Haitian 
army, seek out hidden arms and try to establish as peaceful and normal an 
atmosphere as can exist in a country known worldwide for political violence. 
</P>
<P>
 All the troops are long-serving Army veterans, all speak at least one foreign 
language, most appear energized to the point of hyperactivity and all are 
confident that they can, in a phrase originated when the Special Forces were 
formed by order of President John F. Kennedy, "win the hearts and minds" of the 
local population. 
</P>
<P>
 The Special Forces don't use that phrase anymore, at least not in Haiti, 
preferring instead to say, in the words of local American commander Maj. Tony 
Schwaln, "We can break things and kill people, or we can fix their power 
plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Repairing Jacmel's generator and giving the city electricity for the first 
time in more than a year seem to have won the town over. "There are fewer than 
50 of us in a town of 60,000," Schwaln said. "If they didn't love us, we'd be 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwaln, a 31-year-old former tank commander from Macon, Ga., said that 
Makanani, or "Sgt. Sam," as he called him, " is Special Forces. He is just 
great. He's got a tremendous sense of humor, a tremendous feel for people." 
</P>
<P>
 Makanani, who favors wraparound sunglasses, a spike crew cut and a wide smile, 
is the stuff of local legend because of his role in capturing the area's most 
notorious military thug, Cpl. Hugh Seraphin, who had dubbed himself Achade, a 
Creole slang word meaning "criminal, 10 times over." 
</P>
<P>
 "He really took him out," said a Jacmel resident of the Sept. 23 capture of 
Achade, who had been known for several years as the army's primary killer in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Achade) had been standing on the balcony of his home telling people that 
'I'm here; I'm the real chief. I'm going to kill all the Americans. I'm Acha- 
vingt (or "criminal 20 times over"),' " the resident said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then Makanani pulled up in his Humvee, kicked down the door, had Achade on 
the floor, his wrists handcuffed, blindfolded and gagged. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the kids in town were watching," the resident said, when Makanani, his 
M-16 assault rifle shoved into the back of the prone Haitian, looked at his 
commanding officer and said with a smile Achade couldn't see, "Hey, major, can 
I shoot him, can I shoot him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Schwaln said no, but later said of the Haitian soldier, "Yeah, now he's 
Acha-zero." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the Special Forces troops here seem to have an affinity for the 
children who virtually swamp them when they appear in the streets. Makanani 
draws ever larger crowds because he often carries a guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Haitians like the theme from 'Chico and the Man,' " the sergeant said. 
"They also like it when I learn a Haitian song." 
</P>
<P>
 He reeled off the words to a profane Creole ditty that praises restored 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and defames ousted army Commander in Chief Lt. 
Gen. Raoul Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a particularly devoted group of young boys who hang around the 
abandoned marina club used by the Americans as their headquarters and barracks. 
One, 12-year-old Pierre Massin, has been "adopted" by the troops, who have 
purchased his school uniform and his books for him and have put up his tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierre responded by writing the song that Makanani "got them good." 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of relief and gratitude is nearly palpable in Jacmel, a town used by 
the Haitian military and their civilian business associates as a center for 
smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Duplan, 27, assistant director of a trade school here, said the 
Americans have made life safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the streets are cleaner. The old military regime had prevented 
refuse pickups by the residents because civilian groups were banned, so any 
attempt to organize cleanups by citizens organizations was broken up. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Schwaln, the people are cooperating with the Americans. Even the 
few Haitian army troops left behind "do what we tell them to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, to my knowledge, there has not been one act of political violence," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're proud of what we've done here. When we turned on the lights we were 
nearly as happy as the Haitians."

DEMOCRATS SPOT RAYS OF ELECTORAL HOPE; CAMPAIGNS: RECENT ECONOMIC, FOREIGN 
POLICY GAINS BY CLINTON BRIGHTEN A DISMAL ELECTION OUTLOOK. BUT THE PARTY'S 
NEGATIVES REMAIN FORMIDABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Suddenly, Democrats can see a few glimmers of hope on the otherwise bleak 
horizon of the 1994 midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 For perhaps the first time, the Clinton presidency -- which until now has been 
one of the governing party's biggest burdens -- is providing at least the 
opportunity for Democrats to gain political ground. These are some of the 
developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * On the economic front, comprising the bundle of issues which more than any 
other helped Bill Clinton defeat George Bush, the President this week was able 
to announce favorable news about deficit reduction while a new poll showed that 
an increasing number of Americans believe the nation's economy is on the 
upswing. 
</P>
<P>
 * In foreign affairs, which until recently had been regarded as Clinton's 
weakest suit, Clinton's success in dealing with crises in the Persian Gulf and 
Haiti has already boosted his stock in the polls. More political rewards are 
anticipated from this week's trip to the Middle East, where the President is to 
witness the signing of the peace agreement between Israel and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stunning decision by New York City Republican Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani 
to endorse hard-pressed New York Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in his bid for 
reelection transforms into an asset what had been another political handicap -- 
the party's longtime commitment to the nation's cities. That is true not only 
in Cuomo's own campaign against Republican George E. Pataki, but also, 
according to Democrats, in other states trying to contend with the problems of 
huge urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the role of chief Administration political spokesman while Clinton is 
overseas, Vice President Al Gore sought Tuesday to make the most of the 
improved political environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a luncheon speech to the Center for National Policy, a Democratic think 
tank, he noted that the previous conventional wisdom that Clinton is "somehow 
wanting" in foreign affairs is no longer operative. And Gore cited the 
President's trip to the Middle East at the invitation of Israel and Jordan as 
evidence that "America is on the rise again. America is strong again. America 
is respected again." 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing Clinton's accomplishments on the economic front, which he said 
had been made despite intense partisan opposition from the GOP in Congress, 
Gore declared: "I believe the tide is turning -- that in these next two weeks 
voters will increasingly decide to reject those who put party first." 
</P>
<P>
 But most independent analysts viewed that judgment as premature, contending 
that it would take far more to reverse the fundamental negative factors working 
against the Democrats -- the traditional tendency of the party in power to lose 
ground in off-year elections, the greater number of House and Senate seats and 
governorships that Democrats have at stake compared to the opposition party and 
the continuing relatively low approval rating for the President -- despite a 
recent upswing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has had a couple of good weeks and that's better than for him to have 
two weeks of utter disasters," said Merle Black, a political analyst at Emory 
University in Atlanta. But Black said that he doubts Democratic candidates will 
change their strategy, which for the most part involves keeping their distance 
from the President and stressing local concerns and their own individual 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does he expect recent developments to cause Republican candidates to 
relent in their attacks on Clinton's performance. "They are still going to tell 
voters he is a liberal, that he wants to expand government, that he's going to 
make you pay too much for stuff you didn't want in the first place," Black 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Black conceded that in states where Clinton ran strongly in 1992, the 
progress on the economic front and the success abroad could be used as talking 
points by Democratic candidates. "And at the least, it will make the President 
less of a drag" for his party's candidates, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Republicans, they wasted little time in trying to minimize Clinton's 
accomplishments and pressed their latest attack -- focusing on a recently 
disclosed memorandum by Alice Rivlin, director of the White House Office of 
Management and Budget. The document discusses possible cuts in entitlement 
benefits and increases in taxes to help cut the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the White House had ruled out most of the entitlement cuts 
mentioned in the memo, GOP strategist William Kristol, in a memorandum 
distributed to party leaders, said: "What is striking is the failure of the 
President to rule out any of the tax increases." 
</P>
<P>
 "This Administration has already raised taxes once," Kristol said. "Our 
suspicions that they would like to do so again are confirmed by the Rivlin 
memo." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the moment, Democrats preferred to accentuate other, positive news 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Healy, a Washington lobbyist and fund-raiser for Democratic 
congressional candidates, cited a new Washington Post-ABC News poll which 
showed approval of Clinton's job performance climbing to 49% with 48% 
disapproving, compared to 44% approval and 51% disapproval last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has to be a boost for Democratic candidates if only because the last two 
or three months have been so damn dismal," he said. "So when you get a boost, 
it takes on an extra dimension."

2 EX-GOP OFFICIALS FAVOR ROBB OVER NORTH

 Two former Republican Administration officials spoke in favor of Democratic 
Sen. Charles S. Robb on Tuesday, saying Oliver L. North's conduct during the 
Iran-Contra affair makes him unworthy to be senator. 
</P>
<P>
 The election is "clearly one in which the Constitution is being challenged by 
a candidate who violated that law, admitted he violated those laws and then 
admitted that he lied to cover it up," said William E. Colby, CIA director 
under President Gerald R. Ford from 1973 to 1976. "That to me discredits him as 
a candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-Atty. Gen. Elliott L. Richardson said accountability of public officials 
was the sin in both Iran-Contra and Watergate. Richardson was attorney general 
in 1973 under President Richard Nixon.

POLITICS; RACES WITH GOP INCUMBENTS WILL TEST WINDS OF VOTER ANGER; DELAWARE 
SENATE CONTEST IS A CASE IN POINT. IF DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER WINS, IT MAY HINT 
THAT BALLOT BASHING IS AGAINST LONG-TERMERS MORE THAN PARTY IN POWER.

<P>
 Striving to unseat this state's long-entrenched senior senator in the November 
elections, an aggressive challenger is vowing to "send a wake-up call to 
Washington" and pledging not to seek more than two terms on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Much the same strategy is being used by Republican candidates around the 
country as they seek to capitalize on the public's distaste for incumbents. The 
difference here in Delaware is that the challenger is a Democrat, state Atty. 
Gen. Charlie Oberly, and the incumbent is four-term Republican William V. Roth 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the campaigns in Delaware and two other states where Democrats 
have a reasonable chance to unseat incumbent Republican senators will help to 
illuminate the prospects for the 1996 election by testing the conflicting 
explanations of the national mood offered by the two political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the Democrats right in contending that voters are generally sore at all 
members of Congress, most of whom just happen to be Democrats? Or are the 
Republicans correct in claiming that voter resentment is a specific reaction to 
Democratic control of both Congress and the White House? 
</P>
<P>
 An upset victory here would provide great comfort to Democrats nationally as 
they struggle to maintain their hold on the Senate. Needing a net gain of seven 
seats to oust the Democratic majority, Republicans are hoping not only to win 
seats left open by Democratic retirements but also to unseat Democratic 
incumbents, more than half a dozen of whom are in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Democrats privately concede they have a plausible chance of 
turning out only three Republican incumbent senators -- Roth, Conrad Burns in 
Montana and Slade Gorton in Washington. Some consider the Delaware lawmaker 
their best target simply because he has been around so long, ranking 10th among 
all senators in seniority and sixth in his own party. 
</P>
<P>
 Oberly has made Roth's tenure the central theme of his campaign, arguing that 
the senator has lost touch with voters. It's a tactic that has led Roth's staff 
to cry foul. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attorney general is running a campaign based on age discrimination," said 
Jo Anne Barnhart, Roth's campaign manager. She specifically cites an Oberly 
television commercial that alters the speed of taped footage to show the 
73-year-old Roth trudging along the campaign trail in slow motion. "It's a real 
distortion." 
</P>
<P>
 Oberly, 47, argues that Roth "has made age an issue by failing to show up for 
joint appearances" and complains that the senator refuses to debate him on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 The two campaigns also squabble about the length of Roth's lead. Oberly's 
aides contend that their candidate, who started out 30 percentage points 
behind, now trails by only a single-digit margin. Aides to Roth insist that he 
still holds a comfortable advantage.

 Delaware seems an unlikely place to exploit anti-incumbent fever. Roth's 
Democratic colleague in the Senate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., is serving his fourth 
term. John Williams, the Republican whom Roth succeeded in 1970, served four 
full terms before retiring. No incumbent running statewide has been defeated in 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Delaware incumbents have long careers because voters are 
practical enough to realize that as citizens of the state with the 
sixth-smallest population, their interests benefit from the extra prerogatives 
that come with Capitol Hill seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about people staying in office too long," said Roth supporter 
Benjamin Perona, a retired businessman who showed up at the local Veterans of 
Foreign Wars post last week to watch Roth get that group's endorsement. "They 
get to be chairmen of big committees and they stay there and hold power." 
</P>
<P>
 As Roth likes to point out, he is the ranking Republican member of the Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs, a forum that allowed him some years back to 
expose such examples of government waste as the Navy's $640 toilet seat. He 
also ranks third in seniority among Republicans on the Finance Committee, and 
in the late 1970s, he joined with then-Rep. Jack Kemp of New York in promoting 
sharp cuts in income tax rates. That idea became the foundation of President 
Ronald Reagan's supply-side economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth sought to stress the benefits of his incumbency at a rare joint 
appearance with Oberly last week before members of Wilmington Women in 
Business, claiming that he is in a strong position to push for tax proposals to 
help small business as well as expansion of individual retirement accounts. 
Delaware, he claimed, needs his "power and experience to have a strong voice in 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Oberly made a highly personal pitch, recalling how under his 
joint-custody arrangement with his ex-wife, he had taken over much of the 
burden of rearing their young children while she concentrated on finishing 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't be your gender," he told the women in attendance, "but I can 
understand your concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Oberly tries to make an asset of his divorce -- a far cry from the days when 
the breakup of a marriage was considered near fatal for politicians. He 
stresses his friendship with his ex-wife, who has assumed much of the 
responsibility of parenting while he runs for office, and adds that her second 
husband is now his dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason, besides status and power, for the long tenure of Delaware 
officeholders is that their relative intimacy with the citizenry seems to breed 
affection rather than contempt. "We know our politicians very well," said 
University of Delaware political scientist James Soler. "Charlie (Oberly) is 
Charlie and Bill (Roth) is Bill." 
</P>
<P>
 "Delaware is a small state, and we go everywhere," Roth said. "Frankly I have 
never had a warmer reaction than during this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 But even in this cozy enclave, discontent has reared its head. "Politicians 
aren't really in there for the good of the country, they're in there for the 
power," Gloria Keiper, a secretary at Du Pont & Co., told a reporter after 
shaking hands with Oberly one noon hour last week. A Roth voter in 1988, she 
said she has decided to vote for Oberly next month because "if somebody has 
been there too long, better get him out." 
</P>
<P>
 Giving added bite to the issue of anti-incumbency in this normally placid 
state, analysts say, is concern over Roth's age that stems, in part, from 
arguments Roth himself has made. Soon after he entered the Senate, he proposed 
a constitutional amendment banning senators from running after they turn 70, a 
favorite idea of Williams, his predecessor and mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 Oberly's campaign has reminded the voters of this in a television commercial 
accusing Roth of bending his principles to serve his political ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth attributes the amendment to "the folly of my youth" and argues that any 
such dictum would now be considered age discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Oberly's chances for success depend far more on his argument that the state 
needs fresher leadership than on significant issue differences with Roth. 
"Economically, there is not a whole lot of difference between us," Oberly, who 
prides himself on his fiscal restraint, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he claims to be more interested than Roth in supporting social 
programs such as Head Start and day care, Oberly says he does not know how he 
would raise the money to expand such efforts. "The deficit is strangling us. 
But we can't raise taxes on middle-class Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are Democratic prospects in the two other states where they have the most 
hope of overturning GOP incumbents: 
</P>
<P>
 * Montana: Democrat Jack Mudd, an attorney and champion of the environmental 
movement, has been trying to depict Burns as a tool of special interests 
because of the one-term Republican's trips to such events as the Orange Bowl 
and the Kentucky Derby as the guest of lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns contends that his travels have been intended to boost the Montana 
economy by promoting tourism and trade, and he points to his better than 99% 
voting attendance record in the Senate. A poll taken late last month for 
Montana's Lee newspapers showed Burns with a 15% lead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Washington. Democrats have long viewed Republican incumbent Gorton as a 
likely target. He won election in 1988 by only two percentage points in a state 
that President Clinton carried handily in 1992. Democrats believe his cerebral 
style has not endeared him to the Washington electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the Sept. 20 primary involving candidates from both parties, Gorton 
got a bigger share of the vote than all four Democratic candidates combined, 
including Ron Sims, who emerged as the party's nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say that Sims, a member of the King County (Seattle) Council and 
the first black Senate nominee in the state's history, may be hurt by his 
liberal image. A poll taken for the Spokane Spokesman-Review newspaper and two 
television stations in mid-October showed Gorton with a 20-point lead, with 16% 
of voters undecided.

MONARCH VIEWS PEACE AS HIS GREATEST LEGACY; JORDAN: KING HUSSEIN IS REPORTED TO 
BE THINKING ABOUT MORTALITY. BUT ADVISERS SAY NO DECISION HAS LEFT HIM AS 
CONFIDENT AS THE TREATY WITH ISRAEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 King Hussein calls the peace treaty to be ceremoniously signed with Israel 
today his gift to the Jordanian people, the greatest legacy of his more than 
four decades on the throne. 
</P>
<P>
 Although voices of opposition from both the left and the right are getting 
loud enough here that the king felt compelled to urge restraint Monday in a 
televised speech to the army, his advisers say the monarch has never projected 
more certainty and confidence about a political decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The king is thinking about his own mortality, and about what will happen to 
Jordan after he is gone," said a senior official at the royal court, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. "He wants to leave Jordan stable and with a chance 
for a good future." 
</P>
<P>
 As thousands of dignitaries and reporters descended on Jordan for the signing 
ceremony, Hussein appeared to be reveling in the moment. In every public 
appearance, the king seemed relaxed, even ebullient. Only on Monday did the 
carping of Arab leaders that he made an agreement too soon, and the criticism 
from some of his own subjects that he did not wrest enough concessions from 
Israel, provoke a response. 
</P>
<P>
 "A minority among the people has attacked it (the treaty)," Hussein told a 
gathering of army officers, "and part of our democratic life and our respect 
for the people's rights is to allow them to express their views. But I would 
like to remind them of the . . . need for the minority to respect the views of 
the majority." 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein intends to make the most of President Clinton's one-day stay here, the 
first presidential visit since Richard Nixon came in 1974. After Clinton 
attends the signing ceremony in southern Jordan, Hussein will accompany him on 
a tour of Petra, an ancient city carved in red rock. The two then will fly to 
Amman, where Clinton will address Parliament and be feted at a state banquet in 
the king's hilltop palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein was particularly eager for Clinton to address the 80-member 
Parliament, Western diplomats said, because it is the symbol of his efforts to 
build institutions that will outlive him. But the king was said to be 
distressed by the announced intention of 16 militant Islamic legislators to 
boycott the President's speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Islamic Action Front said they will walk out to protest the 
peace treaty and U.S. policy in the region. Some leftist parliamentarians have 
also threatened to disrupt the President's speech to voice their opposition to 
the treaty and the U.S. role in brokering it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is anxiety at the palace that the parliamentarians will hurt the king's 
credibility," said one senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parliament's rambunctiousness is an embarrassment to Hussein, not a 
threat, analysts here agree. His decision to sign a peace treaty with Israel 
without waiting for Syria to go first startled some Jordanians and angered 
others, but it has not aroused any significant opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a sense of realism, a sense that somehow the Arab-Israeli 
conflict must come to an end," said Mustafa Hamarneh, director of the 
University of Jordan's Center for Strategic Studies. The king remains 
enormously popular with the vast majority of Jordanians, said Hamarneh, who 
regularly conducts public opinion polls on the peace process. Hussein is 
counting on that personal popularity to win at least grudging acceptance of 
peace with Israel from most Jordanians, Hamarneh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is based on the king's popularity," said the bearded 
professor, who said he supports signing a peace treaty with Israel. "In our 
subconscious, we know that we lost, that the Zionists won. So there is nothing 
joyous about (the signing ceremony). For me and my peers, it was a noble cause, 
fighting for Jerusalem and for Palestine. And so there will be sadness 
tomorrow, because it is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamarneh agreed with those who said that Hussein's thoughts of his mortality 
helped push him toward making peace with Israel. More than two years ago, the 
king, now 58, was found to have cancer of the ureter. He was treated in the 
United States and has since been declared cancer-free. But in his addresses to 
the nation since then, he has seemed preoccupied with the prospect that he will 
soon pass from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 If the experience of surviving a life-threatening illness gave Hussein a new 
sense of urgency about the negotiations that began with Israel in October, 
1991, political developments surrounding the talks soon combined with a 
deteriorating economic situation inside Jordan to convince the king that the 
time had come to act. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization 
revealed that they had secretly negotiated a framework for Palestinian 
self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, outside the formal talks 
going on in Washington among Israel, the Arab states and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of quietly cooperating with successive Israeli governments to keep 
Palestinian nationalist aspirations in check, the king suddenly saw the PLO 
replacing him as Israel's partner, and doing it in the open. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 14, 1993 -- one day after the Israelis and the PLO signed their 
agreement on the White House lawn granting limited self-rule to the 
Palestinians of the territories -- Jordan and Israel signed an agenda that 
served as the basis of today's treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, most Jordanians believed a formal peace treaty with Israel was 
probably still years away. Hussein had said repeatedly that Jordan would not 
sign a separate agreement but would wait for a "comprehensive" settlement of 
the Arab-Israeli conflict. In essence, that meant that Jordan would wait until 
Syria -- its much more powerful northern neighbor -- was ready to sign a 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 But Western diplomats and Jordanians say that Hussein decided in June, after 
talks with Clinton, that the time had come to sign a treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask, 'Why now?' My immediate response is, why not now?" said Jordanian 
Information Minister Jawad Anani. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to see a new, proactive Jordan from now on," said Marwan 
Mouasher, spokesman for the Jordanian negotiating team. "Jordan has always been 
a moderate state politically and has always had a market economy, but it has 
not been able to make use of this fact in a turbulent region. This is a new 
era, where Jordan can finally take decisions that are based on Jordan's 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Mouasher and other officials emphasized, however, the importance of the 
international community -- led by the United States -- responding to the peace 
treaty by offering Jordan desperately needed aid. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of Clinton's arrival here, Jordanian Information Minister Jawad 
Anani said flatly that he hopes the President will announce more U.S. aid for 
Jordan during his stay. So far, Washington has agreed to write off Jordan's 
$700-million debt over a three-year period and to increase military 
cooperation.

ONCE-HOSTILE FORCES WORK SHOULDER TO SHOULDER AT TREATY SIGNING SITE; SECURITY: 
COOPERATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND JORDAN ILLUSTRATES NEW MOOD IN REGION. EFFORTS 
ALSO REFLECT FEARS OF TERRORIST DISRUPTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Military engineers from the once-hostile armies of Israel and Jordan worked 
around the clock Tuesday to ready a former desert minefield for the signing 
here of a treaty that will bring their countries peace. 
</P>
<P>
 In an operation that reflected a new era of cooperation, even a kinship, 
soldiers from the two countries battled a sandstorm, 98-degree heat, then a 
sudden rain to prepare the new border station for today's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to recall that for two generations we have been enemies," an 
Israeli colonel said as he chatted with a Jordanian counterpart about the 
routes that VIP traffic will follow. "This all seems, well, just so normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Presenting the treaty to Israel's Parliament in Jerusalem for approval 
Tuesday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin spoke movingly of an era of peace, 
friendship, open borders and the growing acceptance of the Jewish state by its 
Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normalization means an Israeli bus leaving the central bus station in 
Jerusalem for Amman . . . and planes of the Jordanian airline crossing the 
skies of Israel on their way to Europe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucks, he added, "will leave Haifa carrying cargo for Amman; businessmen will 
fly off in the morning to close a deal (in neighboring Arab countries) and 
return in the evening to Jerusalem, and families will go off on trips to Jordan 
and Petra, three hours' traveling time from Tel Aviv." 
</P>
<P>
 The peace treaty with Jordan will be a major step toward Arab acceptance of 
Israel's place in the Middle East, Rabin said, and will bring "a fundamental 
and substantial change in our very existence." 
</P>
<P>
 For people who have lived for many years in the sights of snipers from the 
other side, this is quite a change, Rabin reminded the Knesset, Israel's 
Parliament. The Knesset agreed and ratified the treaty, 105 votes to three with 
six abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the very preparations for the signing ceremony on their frontier today, 
there were sharp reminders of the old era in the fears of further terrorist 
attacks by Palestinian radicals opposed to Arab-Israeli peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They intend to carry out an attack, and we are taking all necessary steps to 
prevent them from being successful," Israeli police commissioner Assaf Hefetz 
warned. While Israeli intelligence had no specific information on targets, 
Hefetz said police are afraid of an attempt to upset the celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 A massive security operation was under way here to protect Rabin, King Hussein 
of Jordan and the 5,000 dignitaries, President Clinton among them, who will 
attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unique operation, Israeli and Jordanian security forces surrounded this 
border crossing and, working with the U.S. Secret Service, created one of the 
most tightly protected environments ever for such a major international 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "You set foot in the wrong place and you will have agents from three security 
services ready to shoot you," Uri Dromi, director of the Israeli Government 
Press Office, told photographers preparing to cover the ceremony. "These 
security guys are very, very serious, and they have to be with so many leaders 
and top officials from so many countries in just 200 square meters." 
</P>
<P>
 Roads in and out of the area, itself in the middle of an active minefield, 
have been closed, with thousands of troops patrolling both sides of the border. 
More than 1,000 security personnel will protect the site and the guests. 
</P>
<P>
 An even bigger security operation is under way in Jerusalem in preparation for 
Clinton's visit there Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel is deploying more than half of its 21,000 police to protect Clinton. 
Jerusalem, which normally has about 6,000 police, is getting more than 4,000 
additional personnel for the President's short stay, and more than 1,200 are 
being deployed along the highway from Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel 
Aviv to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has airlifted hundreds of security people and planeloads of 
equipment into the Middle East to protect the President in the wake of recent 
terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans want to close the whole country," police spokesman Eric 
Bar-Chen said when asked about plans to close the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway, 
one of Israel's busiest. 
</P>
<P>
 Police warned Jerusalem residents that trips around the city by Clinton's 
100-vehicle motorcade on Thursday and Friday will halt almost all normal 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't need to be in Jerusalem that day, leave, and if you must be here 
but can stay at home, do so," a police commander advised Israelis. "If you must 
travel, allow an hour for a 10-minute drive. . . . People will need a year's 
worth of patience during these two days." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest danger, security officials say, will come if Clinton tours 
Jerusalem's walled Old City late Thursday night, as planned. Although police 
have flooded into the city this week, security officials fear that a Clinton 
Old City walk will bring out stone-throwing Palestinian youths who know the 
roofs far better than they do. 
</P>
<P>
 But that planned walking tour has stirred controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 To underscore the American position that Jerusalem's status is an unresolved 
question, the White House said it did not want Mayor Ehud Olmert to accompany 
the President when he visits the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Al Aqsa mosque 
and the Western Wall of the old Jewish temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin is committed to the concept of a "united Jerusalem (as) the eternal 
capital of the Jewish people and State of Israel," but he is loath to offend a 
President who is friendlier to Israel than any in decades. "We'll find a way," 
a Rabin aide said. "The President will get his midnight walk through the Old 
City, but maybe with a priest, a rabbi and an imam rather than a mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, proud of the treaty he reached in negotiations with Hussein, accepted 
that it alone will not end terrorism but called it a major step toward that 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lived with terrorism for a long time," he told the Knesset. "There 
are those who ask what is the point of peace if terrorism still exists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only promise that at the end of the road we will defeat it," he said. 
"Peace is the only way to isolate terrorism. Peace will show the nations of the 
region that there is an alternative."

SRI LANKAN'S WIDOW GETS PARTY NOD; ASIA: THE WIFE OF THE SLAIN OPPOSITION 
FIGURE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN HIS PLACE, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The wife of assassinated Sri Lankan presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake 
was appointed her party's new standard-bearer Tuesday, sources said, setting up 
a political battle of the widows with the country's prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was reportedly a protracted and argumentative meeting of the United 
National Party's Working Committee, Sirima Dissanayake emerged victorious over 
a former prime minister as well as another political widow, party sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination, which has yet to be made public, indicated that the UNP, which 
lost its 17-year grip on power in parliamentary elections in August, intends to 
capitalize on the sentiments of horror and sympathy sparked by Dissanayake's 
murder in a suicide bombing this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The slain man's wife, who is a lawyer and a member of one of Sri Lanka's 
provincial councils, will challenge Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga, whose 
father and husband both fell to political assassins, in the Nov. 9 presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Sri Lanka's most senior legislators, opposition leader Gamini 
Dissanayake was killed early Monday when the suicide bomber sprayed a campaign 
rally in the capital, Colombo, with deadly shrapnel a few minutes past 
midnight. According to the latest figures, 57 other people died, as well as the 
bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 The severed head of a woman was found about 100 feet away on a rooftop far 
from other bodies. Investigators say they suspect she was the killer, since she 
sustained the full impact of the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was widely blamed on Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels, who have been 
fighting for 11 years for a separate homeland, but the rebels denied 
involvement. Police on Tuesday picked up 75 Tamils from lodging houses in 
central Colombo near the blast site, and arrested 25 of them, a senior officer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief investigator Lionel Gunatilleke said the suspects had arrived recently 
in Colombo from the rebel stronghold of Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, police said a man on crutches who died in the bombing might have 
been responsible. But a senior investigator said Tuesday that the man had been 
identified, and "he was not behind the blast." 
</P>
<P>
 Reprisals for the blood bath against members of the Tamil minority had been 
feared, and additional police were deployed in Colombo and its suburbs to 
prevent violence. But the capital appeared so calm that a curfew imposed after 
the bomb attack was allowed to lapse at 4 a.m. Tuesday. The government said it 
would renew the curfew Tuesday night as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 A state of emergency was still in force, and beefed-up military patrols were 
stopping and checking cars. But schools, offices and markets opened during the 
morning and functioned normally. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wealthy district of Colombo where Dissanayake lived, Buddhist monks in 
their saffron robes, police officers in uniform and thousands of other mourners 
formed a line a mile long to pay their last respects to the 52-year-old 
politician. His remains will be taken to Parliament today, and he will be given 
a state funeral Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Dissanayake's murder, Kumaratunga's government broke off 
negotiations with the Tamil rebels, and said they will not resume until the 
bombing has been thoroughly investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 It was her fledgling government that resumed talks this month with the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam separatists after four years without any such 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamini Dissanayake was selected at a marathon meeting of the UNP Working 
Committee, which reportedly struck a compromise that would capitalize on her 
name recognition but limit her influence in the party. 
</P>
<P>
 She was selected over ex-Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and Hema 
Premadasa, widow of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was blown up by a 
suicide bomber on a bicycle in May, 1993.

INDIA PLAGUE EPIDEMIC CALLED 'LIMITED OUTBREAK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The epidemic of plague that terrified Indians, generated scary headlines and 
stampeded some nations into weaving a cordon sanitaire around this country last 
month was, in fact, a "limited outbreak," U.S. and Russian public health 
experts reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 10-day investigation, members of the two-nation fact-finding group 
said they couldn't cite a single case of transmission of the dread disease from 
its epicenter in western India to New Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras or any of 
India's other major cities, which they said can be considered "plague-free." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the conclusions of the specialists sent here by World Health 
Organization Director General Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, the U.N. health agency 
called for an end to air and sea travel and trade restrictions against India 
that are still being enforced by some countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are telling the world the same thing we are telling you: that plague has 
been controlled in India and it is safe to travel here," a New Delhi-based WHO 
executive said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts, stressing that their conclusions are tentative because of the 
brevity of their inquiry, depicted a public health situation in the wretched, 
crowded, working-class areas of the city of Surat that was potentially 
catastrophic but was brought under control rather fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feelings were, the (pneumonic plague) outbreak was probably fairly 
limited, with most cases occurring in the first week to 10 days, and most of 
what was seen after that time was indeed not plague but some of the other 
diseases that occur there: tuberculosis, malaria, dengue fever, typhoid, 
enteric fever," said Dr. David Dennis of the Centers for Disease Control 
laboratory in Fort Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 The conclusions of the WHO-sponsored team will be welcome news in India, where 
Prakash H. Mathani, acting president of the Federation of Indian Export 
Organizations, has claimed that losses in foreign sales of textiles, foodstuffs 
and other products because of embargoes and canceled orders linked to the 
plague will top $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian media and some politicians have blasted local and national authorities 
for not doing enough to stem the spread of disease through the slums of Surat. 
Panicked at the plague outbreak in the diamond-cutting and 
artificial-silk-weaving center near the Arabian Sea, an estimated 300,000 to 
400,000 fled the city. Dennis said that, in general, the actions of 
authorities, including widespread distribution of antibiotics that are 
effective against plague, prevented an "explosive situation" from turning into 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it hadn't been identified and if the public health machinery hadn't moved 
into place as rapidly as it did, there could have been many more fatalities," 
Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within three days of the identification of the culprit virus, Yersinia pestis 
, among some of Surat's residents, 95% of those remaining in the city were 
taking the antibiotic tetracycline, Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four Americans and two Russians, assisted by WHO personnel, examined blood 
samples and tissue specimens, scanned hospital records and autopsy reports and 
interrogated people who had experienced plague-like symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Viktor V. Maleev, deputy director of the Central Scientific Research 
Institute of Epidemiology in Moscow and a clinical specialist in the effects of 
plague on the human organism, said "as few as 15, 20 people in Surat may have 
died of plague" rather than the officially reported 52. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it from the documents that Indian doctors gave me," Maleev explained. 
"For example, I have a paper here where the cause of death is recorded as 
'suspected plague,' and the diagnosis is marked 'not available.' Or they died 
on the way to the hospital, and no one conducted an autopsy. Can you say they 
died of plague? That's hard to say." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as two weeks ago, Indian authorities spoke of more than 2,700 
suspected cases, but Dennis said many of them proved not to be plague carriers. 
Only one person stricken with the disease reached a major city, New Delhi, the 
American official said. But as far as could be determined he gave no one else 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis' remarks meant that the exodus from the city of more than 2 million had 
not spread the disease throughout the country, as had been feared. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact cause of what Maleev termed "one of the largest outbreaks in recent 
years of primary pneumonic plague" remained a mystery. The team was only able 
to find a "circumstantial link" between the happenings in Surat in Gujarat 
state and a resurgence in August of another form of plague, the bubonic, in the 
Beed district of neighboring Maharashtra state 240 miles to the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis cautioned that because of the methods he and his colleagues used and 
the short time they were at work, their conclusions "may not be set in stone." 
He said follow-up studies are necessary, which could take months.

AMID 'SLEAZE' CHARGES, MAJOR FIRES 2ND MINISTER; BRITAIN: THE TORY LEADER ALSO 
TELLS PARLIAMENT HE WAS APPROACHED BY AN 'INTERMEDIARY' FROM A KEY FIGURE IN 
ETHICS SCANDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to dispel widespread charges of "sleaze" in his Conservative 
government, Prime Minister John Major fired a second minister Tuesday for 
unspecified "allegations" concerning his ethical conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Major publicly fired Member of Parliament Neil Hamilton, a colorful Trade 
Department minister, in a statement to the House of Commons after Hamilton had 
refused to resign when accused of unethically assisting Mohammed Al Fayed, head 
of the famous London department store Harrods. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton's ouster follows that last week of another minister, Tim Smith, after 
Smith was accused of accepting money to raise questions in the House of Commons 
on behalf of Al Fayed's successful takeover of the department store's corporate 
body, the House of Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Commons speech Tuesday, the prime minister also said that he had been 
approached recently by an Al Fayed "intermediary" who wanted to discuss the 
House of Fraser takeover fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Major said he rejected the overture, but neither he nor his aides at the prime 
minister's office would identify the "intermediary." 
</P>
<P>
 Following Major's speech, Conservative Member of Parliament Peter Tapsell 
asked in the Commons if Major was being subjected to possible "blackmail," and 
the prime minister said the matter was being referred to the director of public 
prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Fayed quickly denied any suggestion he was involved in trying to blackmail 
the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 In one side of an exchange of letters released late Tuesday, Hamilton charged 
that he was a victim of "foully motivated rumor" and a "media witch hunt," and 
he vowed to clear his name. In reply, Major said he was concerned about the 
"general perception" of his government and that the Hamilton episode was a 
"damaging distraction." 
</P>
<P>
 In delivering the dramatic announcements in Parliament, Major said that 
Hamilton had been cleared by Cabinet Secretary Robin Butler of "cash for 
questions" but that other "unconnected allegations" had arisen recently. He did 
not specify what those allegations were. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Parliament can submit written questions that lead to formal answers 
by relevant government departments that can be embarrassing to corporations -- 
in this case, the conglomerate Lonrho, which controlled Harrods and was 
fighting the Al Fayed takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, two back-bench Conservative members of Parliament were 
accused of accepting funds from a leading lobbying firm to ask questions in 
Parliament on behalf of Al Fayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sleaze issue has been seized upon by the opposition Labor and Liberal 
parties, which have accused Tory members of Parliament of signing on to 
lobbyists' payrolls as "consultants," sometimes without declaring their 
interest, as required by parliamentary rules. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Home Secretary Michael Howard confirmed that he too had been 
investigated by Cabinet Secretary Butler during the cash-for-questions inquiry, 
but he said he had "never been guilty of any impropriety in the conduct of any 
of my responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Fayed, a big contributor to the Conservative Party under the leadership of 
Margaret Thatcher, has made threats to reveal that various government ministers 
accepted money or favors from him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Egyptian-born Al Fayed sought support in his takeover bid for the House of 
Fraser and withdrawal of an unfavorable Trade Department report on his 
activities and business background. 
</P>
<P>
 Major also announced Tuesday that he is setting up a blue-ribbon commission 
headed by a senior judge to launch a broad, unprecedented investigation into 
the rules and standards governing the conduct of British public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar over "sleaze" comes at an especially sensitive time for the prime 
minister, who is perceived finally to have a firm grasp on his party and enjoys 
credit for making long strides toward peace in Northern Ireland.

THE SOUTHLAND FIRESTORM: ONE YEAR LATER; SCULPTOR'S PHOENIX STRUGGLES TO 
REBIRTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Twice, sculptor Tony Duquette watched fire devour his life's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice, he gathered himself up, shoveled away the ash and carried on, finding 
the strength to work in a searing image that drove him. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, a toppled heater ignited a blaze that burned the San Francisco 
pavilion-studio shared by Duquette and his wife and fellow artist, Elizabeth. 
It consumed priceless artworks and objets d'art that they had created and 
collected, including Duquette's ornate sculpture series for the Los Angeles 
bicentennial celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago Thursday, the massive Green Meadow fire in Ventura County swept 
through Duquette's lush, 135-acre ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains south of 
Thousand Oaks. It wiped out all but fragments of the phoenix sculptures he had 
begun building to answer the first fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The second fire stopped Duquette, a workaholic, dead in his tracks for a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, a year after the fire, the 80-year-old artist is planning to mount a 
new exhibition of towering, delicate sculptures that will be called "The 
Phoenix Rising From His Flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the memory of the fire brings pain to the Tony Award-winning set 
designer, interior decorator and world-renowned artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by his fragile-looking new work, Duquette rests in the jungly 
garden of his Beverly Hills house and describes it for a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was able to stand and watch it all disappear, and it made a beautiful 
sight," Duquette recalls. "The pagodas and buildings all in lights against the 
black sky made a dazzling end of what had been a life's work." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony and Elizabeth Duquette had named their Ventura County spread Sortilegium 
-- Latin for "Land of Enchantment." 
</P>
<P>
 "The house in town and the other houses were just houses," Duquette says 
sadly. "But this was in a sense a kind of artistic fulfillment." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire took it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were the baroque pavilions packed with art treasures from Asia and 
Europe, the sculptures and paintings and tapestries he and his wife had 
acquired and created in the 38 years they were there. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were the lovingly crafted artifacts of an imaginary civilization that 
they had stored in hillside caves, the remnants of a society they called the 
ChuChinChowMash. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were all the molds and 29 fiberglass-and-steel sculptures he had already 
built in the "Phoenix" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone, too, was the stuff of his art -- the salvaged hardware, found objects 
and raw material he made into sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 Six iron columns and a spiral staircase were left jutting from the ruined 
foundation of the main house. Splinters of polychrome glass and shards of 
pottery, new and ancient, glinted in the ash. 
</P>
<P>
 Around it stood half a dozen wrecked pavilions, their iron frames hung with 
charred antlers from the grounds of Hearst Castle, their contents reduced to 
cinders. 
</P>
<P>
 Duquette could barely stand to look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I could face it, I supervised the cleanup," he said. "But it was a 
heartbreaking experience." 
</P>
<P>
 At his age, he wondered how he could go on. His wife and artistic partner of 
45 years, stricken with Parkinson's disease, was growing sicker. A lifetime's 
worth of her paintings also perished in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a catalogue of photos of the paintings and looks at them all the 
time, crying," Duquette said. Yet the disease hampers her ability to verbalize 
the loss, he said. "It's the most total torture for two people that are one." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of rebuilding the huge environmental artwork of Sortilegium late 
in life daunted him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton Wilkinson -- Duquette's neighbor, business manager and longtime friend 
-- said the artist has never cried publicly over his loss. But the fire was an 
enormous shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd never put money in the bank. He'd put money into things, so it was like 
the fire wiped out his bank account," Wilkinson recalled. "I said: 'Tony, it 
was just a lot of stuff,' and he said, 'But it was my materials, it was what I 
worked with.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, the two friends flew to Bali and Indonesia with cases full of 
sharks' teeth, seashells, gems, silver and gold, Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a month of therapeutic work and touring, Duquette flew home again with 
30 pieces of finished jewelry, and eventually created 121 more. 
</P>
<P>
 He made stabs at cleaning up the ranch. But they were painful, he said, and he 
stuck mostly to the Beverly Hills house, redecorating, gardening and wading 
through the insurance papers. 
</P>
<P>
 And for more than six months after the fire, Duquette said, he suffered an 
agonizing artistic "blackout" of his creative drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet slowly, deliberately, Duquette pushed himself to work again on the 
"Phoenix" project, rebuilding molds from memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the San Francisco fire, he had based the sculptures on the image of 
the phoenix bird itself. Now the central image became an egg, symbol of the 
Garuda, a mythical Indonesian bird said to hatch full-grown. He created a dozen 
totemic sculptures, a lustrous fiberglass egg floating in a corona of stylized 
flame and wings at the center of each. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is still gaining steam. 
</P>
<P>
 Three museums -- Duquette will not say which -- are bidding to show his new 
work. And Ferragamo in Beverly Hills will show 25 of his jewelry creations at a 
charity benefit Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Duquette said he often ponders rebuilding Sortilegium, although his wife's 
health and a platoon of Ventura County officials -- who opposed it in the first 
place because it violated zoning laws -- make it a difficult decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But he sounds delighted to have found the way to his visions again in the myth 
of a creature reborn from ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the power of denying death, and it is enormously important to these 
civilizations as something to hold onto in disasters," Duquette says, glancing 
at the flames that top the largest sculpture, 38 feet in the air. "The legend 
of the phoenix has always been." More on the Wildfires

THE SOUTHLAND FIRESTORM: ONE YEAR LATER; NEW HOME CAN'T SHUT OUT THE PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 O.P. and Rosemary Reed's new home rises on a Malibu hillside, a virtual 
replica of the house they lost in last year's firestorm -- except that it has a 
basement, a bathtub for two and the latest defenses against flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the 30-year-old, all-cedar structure it replaced, the new house is all 
state-of-the-art technology. It features cement and faux-wood siding and 
concrete decks overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Windows are double-paned, 
tempered glass with metal frames. White plastic sprinkler heads dot the 
wood-paneled ceilings every few feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would seem cause for celebration. Indeed, the Reeds are thinking 
about throwing a "shower" on Thanksgiving, when the new home is scheduled to be 
finished. But the trauma of losing the first house, and the trials of building 
another, have cast a pall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my past and I lost my future," said O.P. Reed, 73, a writer, editor 
and art collector. "I don't know how to get it back. I am like a man without a 
shadow. . . . I was writing three novels and they all burned. This whole wall 
used to be lined with thousands of books and they all burned . . . and 
paintings . . . all works done by friends, and most of them are dead." 
</P>
<P>
 As the flames sped toward the Reeds' house from Topanga in the east and across 
the hills of Malibu to the west on Nov. 2, all that the Reeds could see was a 
sky eerily blackened with smoke and a flame-colored sun above the Pacific. By 4 
p.m., the Reeds had evacuated their house in two cars stuffed with possessions 
that included two paintings, two photo albums and important files. By midnight, 
their house had burned. It was the last one in the neighborhood to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the Reeds returned to face the rubble that remained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost had a nervous breakdown," said O.P. Reed. "I am still stunned. It 
was just a pile of junk." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reeds' house is one of only a few of the 268 homes that burned in last 
year's fire to be rebuilt. The only completely rebuilt home, also in the La 
Costa neighborhood in east Malibu, was rebuilt in a record 10 months. As of 
last week, 29 building permits had been approved in Malibu and 60 more 
residents had submitted applications. 
</P>
<P>
 While some homeowners burned out by the firestorm have spent the better part 
of a year haggling with their insurance companies, the Reeds received their 
insurance money within two months of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an insurance plan that covers homeowners in high-risk areas, they 
received $300,000 for their house and $20,000 for its contents. The Reeds' 
architect said that in 1960 he paid $10 a square foot to build the original 
home, compared to about $120 a square foot for the new house. 
</P>
<P>
 They also received $98,000 from a Lloyd's of London policy that covered his 
art collection. "I lost a lot of artwork," said Reed, an expert on German 
Expressionist art who opened one of the first modern-art galleries on La 
Cienega Boulevard in the 1950s. "So that paid for a lot of it. I saved a 
Picasso and a Goya." 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor expediting the reconstruction was a quick geological survey 
that showed that the Reeds' property was not in an active landslide area, 
eliminating the need for subsurface exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were lucky," said Rosemary Reed. "A lot of these people live in the slide 
zones, so they have to do about $15,000 worth of subsurface exploration. That 
cost is really what is holding them up." 
</P>
<P>
 Tenacity also helped account for the Reeds' relatively quick recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to go down to City Hall and camp 30 minutes ahead of time so we could 
be first in line," said Rosemary Reed, a weaver. "And once we'd get all our 
stuff in order, there'd be only one geologist and he was only there four hours 
a day, two days a week. It was just a task that took up my life. . . . No time 
for frivolity." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting plans through the city bureaucracy was no small task, either. The 
Malibu building department went from processing an average of 15 building 
permits a year to 175 in the 10 months after the fire, a surge that prompted 
the city to hire a second geologist and two more city planners. Despite the 
additional staff, the process moved at a glacial pace for most residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's good-faith attempt to keep pace did little to diminish the 
post-disaster stress that has gripped the Reeds and others who lost their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A neighbor said that if somehow you could record the fights that have 
happened over all of this, there would be such a scream coming from Malibu," 
said O.P. Reed. "People have separated over this. Couples fight a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
 For their new house, the Reeds turned to a contractor who had remodeled their 
kitchen before the fire. Their architect, John Reed, O.P. Reed's brother, 
designed the new home based on the original house's 1960 plans, which were 
drawn in the modern-organic style of Frank Lloyd Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reeds' plans were approved in April and construction began the same month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here just about every day since the rebuilding started," Rosemary 
Reed said during a recent visit to the construction site, scanning the new 
home's dove-gray concrete walls. "I just haunted the place, walking around the 
neighborhood to just get the feel of it. I took pictures of every stage. I just 
never lost contact with it. It was kind of gruesome to see the whole 
neighborhood wiped out, but somehow it made me feel better (to be there)." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Reeds say they still do not know most of their neighbors, they 
attended some meetings of the La Costa Neighborhood Assn., which was formed 
after the fire. The group is the first neighborhood association created since 
La Costa was established in the mid-1920s, but the couple say they expect such 
community-spirited efforts to subside. 
</P>
<P>
 "People move out here to be isolated, no matter what they say about this being 
a bedroom community," said O.P. Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 As their house nears completion, the Reeds say they feel a mixture of hope and 
sorrow. O.P. Reed bought himself a new computer and his wife a new loom in 
hopes that immersing themselves in their work will help them forget. 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, will be difficult. The new house, however similar to the 
original, will be a constant reminder of all that the fire consumed: the 
artworks of friends, hundreds of photographs of three children growing up, the 
old home's interior -- the backdrop to innumerable family birthday parties, 
Christmases and Thanksgivings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really rebuild it the same way. It's different because we're in a 
different stage of life . . . our age, no kids, no furniture," said Rosemary 
Reed, who saved only one of her weavings from the fire. "But it's kind of a 
nice place. It's where we have lived for 30 years and a part of where our 
family history happened."

THE SOUTHLAND FIRESTORM: ONE YEAR LATER; ECLECTIC ENCLAVE WILL AGAIN BE 
ECLECTIC, BUT NOT THE SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 18 years, Michael and Lynn Lindsey cherished their lives in Canyon Acres, 
a tiny, cockeyed community known for its rustic old houses, breezy ambience and 
laid-back residents, many of them artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Their days were brightened by simple pleasures and gentle surprises: a peacock 
napping on a chicken coop, chickens roosting in the apricot tree and neighbors 
chatting around a fire pit after sundown. To many, this jerry-built enclave was 
"old Laguna," a haven for free spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a year after a firestorm incinerated their beloved home and most of their 
eclectic neighborhood, the Lindseys have learned that it's not easy to reinvent 
funk. 
</P>
<P>
 Their new house, now outlined by stakes rising from their property, will be a 
compromise of sorts -- an effort to create both the home of their dreams and a 
dwelling to suit the offbeat community. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most who have filed permits to rebuild in the year since last October's 
fire damaged or destroyed 441 homes in and around the city, the Lindseys are 
building bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,100-square-foot house they say should be under construction by Christmas 
will be about 50% larger than the one that burned. 
</P>
<P>
 But by rebuilding the home in an unusual, elongated shape, incorporating the 
use of river rock, weathered redwood and barnyard beams, and capping it all 
with a staggered roof line, Michael Lindsey thinks the new house will project 
the rustic patchwork quality of the community they loved so much. 
</P>
<P>
 And he trusts that his neighbors' creative inclinations will help keep the 
rebuilt Canyon Acres from becoming a community of cookie-cutter houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to have some real unusual and diverse architecture," he 
said. "It's going to be interesting to see how the overall neighborhood comes 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite two new structures that have popped up on Canyon Acres Drive -- 
incongruent visions of fire-resistant stucco and tile -- John Harwood, the 
architect who designed Lindsey's home, agrees that the new Canyon Acres won't 
be mistaken for one of Orange County's beige, planned communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's going to look like Irvine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Lindsey, a sixth-grade teacher in the Capistrano Unified School District, 
was smitten with Canyon Acres from the day in 1976 when she drove into the 
neighborhood and spotted a dog snoozing in the street -- a sign, she figured, 
of a tranquil lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's sons, Krisean and Seneca, both now teen-agers, grew up climbing 
hills, playing in a nearby creek, picking fruit and selling plums and lemonade 
in their front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt safe with the kids there," said Michael Lindsey, a landscape 
architect whose family is now renting a furnished house elsewhere in Laguna 
Beach. "They'd be at your house for a while and then they'd vanish and be off 
in the hills or at a neighbor's house. You didn't worry." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lynn Lindsey, the realization that her life had changed forever did not 
sink in until a month after the fire. She was in a motel room, where the family 
had temporarily taken refuge, when "a very surrealistic feeling" enveloped her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a giant hand had picked me up out of my life and put me somewhere 
else," she said, her voice choking with emotion. "And you couldn't go back. 
There was no way." 
</P>
<P>
 Krisean Lindsey recalled the October day the disaster changed his way of life. 
He was at Laguna Beach High School when someone yelled, "The canyon's on fire." 
He darted home to save what he could. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grabbed my snake, my iguana, my comics and some other little things and 
took off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Krisean left, his father watched as a wall of flames rose from the 
canyon's sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was when it really sunk in that the house wouldn't be there when we got 
back," Michael Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, much of Canyon Acres still lies in ruins. And it is too early to tell 
how the post-fire Canyon Acres will evolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 60 of the community's 90 homes burned, only 11 rebuilding permits 
have been issued. Residents blame stalled insurance settlements, bureaucratic 
difficulties and unexpected geological concerns for the delays. (The other 
burned neighborhoods in Laguna Beach are rebuilding at a faster clip.) 
</P>
<P>
 "All this has really worn people down," said Gabrielle Harwood, John Harwood's 
wife. "Most people are really frustrated and feeling it's never ever going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Harwoods also lost a new home they were building in Canyon Acres when the 
fire struck. They have since scrapped the plans for that more rustic dwelling 
and will rebuild with concrete and metal, Gabrielle Harwood said. She had 
always wanted a modern-style home, but -- until the fire -- felt it would be 
inappropriate for the countrified community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we were going to build in a canyon style to make it more old and 
funky, and now we're going to go more modern," she said. "Now that everything's 
coming up new, there didn't seem much point in us building old." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the setbacks, Michael Lindsay said he remains optimistic about the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighborhood's going to be a different kind of neighborhood when it gets 
built back," he said. "It's going to be new houses with new looks. (But) I 
still think the old neighborhood sense of community will be there."

THE SOUTHLAND FIRESTORM: ONE YEAR LATER; NEW START STALLED BY BUREAUCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mudslide that dragged Steve Young and his truck down Pasadena Glen did not 
drive him from his home. Neither did the firestorm that incinerated his house 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Catastrophes are part of life in this rustic enclave in the San Gabriel 
foothills north of Pasadena, where nature often reminds residents that they 
remain at her mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has its disasters around here, but you go with the flow," Young said with 
a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 Adversity of a man-made kind is a different matter, though. The avalanche of 
bureaucracy involved in rebuilding and the seemingly endless fight to win an 
insurance claim have been some of the biggest challenges that the tight-knit 
Young clan has faced in the year since fire rushed through the tree-shaded 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Young nor his father Don Young, who also lost his house in the fire, 
has begun rebuilding. Indeed, like most fire victims they do not even have 
building permits, much less insurance settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one big battle," Steve Young said. "This whole canyon is trying to jump 
up on these insurance companies and City Hall to get these things taken care 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze began Oct. 27 after a homeless man started a campfire to warm 
himself. Twenty-eight homes in the Pasadena Glen -- 126 in the entire Altadena 
area -- were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 As the blaze spread early that morning, Young and his neighbors worked 
relentlessly in the upper glen, brushing off red-hot embers as they doused his 
parents' house and others nearby in a fight against the advancing fire. 
</P>
<P>
 When the flames ignited the house next door, Young decided it was time to 
escape. But when he sprinted down the road to his own home, he found the pines 
next door ablaze. The fire had depleted so much of the oxygen in the atmosphere 
that his truck would scarcely start. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young's home burned to the ground, as did his father's. The fire 
destroyed 100 trees that used to shade Don Young's yard and provided oranges, 
lemons, limes and macadamia nuts. After shoveling out heaps of smoldering ash 
from the ruins, the Youngs, like other shellshocked fire victims, learned that 
their problems were just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 They found out that their insurance coverage fell far short of the actual 
amount they would need to rebuild. Their policy is with California Fair Plan, 
an insurance pool for homeowners in high-risk areas and a source of frequent 
complaints from homeowners burned out in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Some policyholders say California Fair Plan rejected their requests to 
purchase more coverage and neglected to tell them that they could buy "code 
upgrade" policies, which would pay for the costs of stringent new building 
requirements. Fair Plan spokesman Mike Harris, however, said that information 
was mailed out to policyholders, who were responsible for making sure their 
coverage was adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five of 126 homes destroyed by the Altadena firestorm have been rebuilt. 
In Pasadena Glen, where nearly half the homes burned, only one has been 
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason why people can't move ahead is because the insurance companies are 
not operating in good faith," said Linda Williams, president of the Pasadena 
Glen Improvement Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to insurance problems, the soil testing and seismic testing 
required for building permits have stalled the progress of some homeowners. 
Although Steve Young's home was on relatively flat land, his father's abutted a 
steep slope. And they can't even begin planning a home until the soil test is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to determine how close we can build so we can determine how to 
build," Don Young said. "We have an architect ready to start drawing as soon as 
we know what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they maintain, the wait is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no place else you can live in the heartland of Los Angeles and still 
be in the foothills and have the deer and the wildlife," Steve Young said. 
"It's a natural love." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Pasadena, Young moved to the glen in 1967 with his parents and 
brother. He remembers riding bikes, climbing trees and "playing with snakes and 
spiders." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, a storm dumped rain on the glen for a week. When the flood broke, 
Young said, "we could hear the rumbling, and we could see cars rolling down 
like surfboards." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven years later another flood hit on Feb. 14, a furious Valentine's Day 
greeting. Young was returning from a party at 2 a.m., and, hearing a menacing 
rumble, rushed up the road to warn his family and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 He reached them in time, but as he turned to leave, the crashing mud overtook 
him, tossing his truck over and throwing him out the back window. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very first thing I said when (the truck) rolled me over, was, 'This is 
finally it, I'm dead,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors fished him out as he neared the bottom of the canyon. His clothes, 
except for a belt, were ripped entirely off, as was the skin on his knees. His 
teeth were chipped and his head was gashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was house-sitting in Sierra Madre when mudslides struck in 
February, he returned to videotape the raging creek from the spot where he was 
swept away 14 years earlier. Then in the spring he came back to stay, camping 
in a tent at first and then moving into a trailer, unperturbed by the spring 
rains that threatened further floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get us out of here," Steve Young said. "We'll fight tooth and nail. 
You've got to accept the bad with the good."

THE SOUTHLAND FIRESTORM: ONE YEAR LATER; PAIN AND HOPE FILL SURVIVOR'S DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Mass' appearance lays bare what he has endured. 
</P>
<P>
 The skin on his face is smoother now, no longer the charcoal black it was 
before the grafts or the blotchy red that followed. His arms are a donors' 
medley of white, pink and brown. And from a distance the bandage over his chest 
looks like a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nov. 2 brush fire that raged through Topanga Canyon seared 90% of his 
body. Since then, Mass has undergone a grueling medical regimen that first 
saved his life and now, step by agonizing step, is repairing the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew things took this long to heal but they obviously do," he said, 
describing the last year as a pendulum of torture and sleep, bitterness and 
exhilaration, progress and setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 His pain is almost constant, though its intensity varies, and he still suffers 
from a low-grade staph infection that opens tender flesh into seeping new 
wounds. Each day, a nurse comes over and helps him bathe and change his 
dressings, a four-hour procedure that requires painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
 He is well enough to eat out, go to the movies, drive, shop and cook for 
himself. He even rides his bike in the rugged hills surrounding his home. Yet 
in coming months he expects to be completely immobilized by a series of 
reconstructive surgeries on his hands -- 10 to 15 on each, including a whole 
new set of joints for one. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass, 41, says he looks forward to working again as a carpenter and getting a 
contractor's license, but dreads the pain the hand surgery and more grafting 
will bring. 
</P>
<P>
 One measure of what he has suffered are the root canals he recently had done 
because gritting his teeth in the hospital wore down their enamel and caused 
nerve damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd think I'd be desensitized to pain but I'm not, I'm scared to death of 
pain," he said. "It will be hard to get me back on an operating table, I'm so 
fearful of it." 
</P>
<P>
 His release from the burn unit at Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center last 
April actually came sooner than doctors had planned, Mass said, because, after 
33 skin grafts, he could not face another operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was losing my mind," he said. "They wanted to do more grafts but I was 
crying all the time and everything hurt. If you looked at me, I'd cry." 
</P>
<P>
 So the summer and fall have been spent at rest -- watching videos and 
puttering around the sunny guest house he had built on the 12-acre ranch. It 
was the only structure on the property that survived the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A tenant of Deer Creek Ranch for the last six years, Mass regards his 
landlords as family and had no qualms about returning to live at the site of 
the fire. With his double-wide trailer and their Santa Fe-style home destroyed, 
they now share the guest house that had been rented by screenwriter Duncan 
Gibbins, who was caught in the blaze with Mass but did not live. 
</P>
<P>
 Months of intensive psychotherapy have enabled Mass to talk about what 
happened. Every day he spent at the burn center, he met with a psychiatrist who 
forced him to describe the fire in as much detail as he could muster. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Nov. 2, Mass had returned home for a forgotten saw when he 
smelled smoke; as it happened, Deer Creek Ranch is almost directly across from 
where the brush fire began, beneath two water towers off Old Topanga Canyon 
Road at the edge of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbins was writing in the guest house as he always did, and the two of them 
began watering down the edge of the ranch. Since the fire was still across Old 
Topanga Canyon Road, they decided to check on their pets. 
</P>
<P>
 But in less than five minutes, Mass recalled, the fire jumped the winding, 
two-lane road and the hills surrounding them were aflame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Duncan was trying to get a script he was working on. I said, 'Forget about 
it. We need to go right now,' " Mass recalled. "I saw the fire on the roadway 
and I said, 'It will be tough, but we gotta leave.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They started up the long driveway -- Mass in his Jeep, Gibbins in his Miata -- 
confronted by a series of enormous flames. Mass made it through the first wall 
of fire and he saw Gibbins in his rearview mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 After making it through a second wall of fire, he noticed Gibbins was gone. 
Then he came to a third wall "and it was a big monster," Mass said. "I wasn't 
sure if I should go forward or reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 He drove forward, figuring that help would be closer there. Encapsuled in the 
enormous mass of flame, he heard his Jeep's tires explode and the engine cut 
off. Then it was eerily quiet and Mass, realizing he was on fire, ran toward 
his rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, emergency crews found the barely alive Gibbins floating in the 
swimming pool. Mass said it's not survivors guilt that he feels so much as that 
"it was a waste that he died." 
</P>
<P>
 Two others -- 88-year-old Donn Yarrow and his wife, Amy, 67, who were trapped 
in their truck in Carbon Canyon -- died in the blaze, which consumed thousands 
of acres of brush and caused millions of dollars in structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass' medical bills were $1.5 million when he left the burn center after six 
months of treatment. Luckily, an insurance policy an employer urged him to 
enroll in took effect two days before the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the miracles of this whole tragedy," said Mass, who lives on a 
$600-a-month disability check and donations from a fund that was set up for him 
after the fire. He spends $130 a week alone on prescription ointments that 
insurance will not cover. 
</P>
<P>
 He tries not to dwell on how the alleged arson fire was ignited or the fact 
that no one has been charged, concentrating instead on his healing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easier said than done. He avoids mirrors, flinches at strangers' stares 
and has moments of depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, with the shape I'm in, I get depressed and wish I hadn't made it," 
he admitted. "I think that maybe they shouldn't have tried so hard because the 
pain I went through in the hospital and what's ahead of me -- I think no one 
should have to go through." 
</P>
<P>
 But then the pendulum swings and Mass perseveres, sometimes even bristling 
with optimism. Stepping outside his home and looking toward the sun, he 
marveled at the greening of charred hills, still damp from a recent rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said confidently. "No brush fires this year."

DEFENSE FIRM TO PAY FOR ROCK CONCERTS BILLED TO GOVERNMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense contractor Martin Marietta Corp. says it will pay for concerts by 
Smokey Robinson, the Beach Boys and others that it had billed to the government 
for "employee morale." 
</P>
<P>
 The payments could total at least $940,000, according to figures obtained 
Tuesday from the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Pentagon auditors who 
monitor billings by contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta was among a group of defense and environmental contractors 
that "inappropriately" charged the government for items such as concerts, 
tennis lessons, golf balls, softball and volleyball officials and a performer 
in a Santa Claus suit, auditors said.

LIBERIA ORPHAN RESCUE BLOCKED 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations suspended the evacuation of 500 Liberian orphans Tuesday 
after thousands of other refugees angry at being left behind blocked relief 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The orphans are among 50,000 refugees in Totota, a town 75 miles northwest of 
Monrovia, the capital.The territory is on the front line of Liberia's civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials have evacuated only 30 of the children to an orphanage in 
Monrovia. They said it would be at least four days before helicopters could 
resume flights into the area. First, they said, rescuers must calm the tens of 
thousands of refugees not slated for the special relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberia's war has killed at least 150,000 people and made refugees of more 
than half the country's 2.3 million people.

UNIFORMED GUNMEN KILL 54 RWANDANS IN BURUNDI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunmen in uniform slaughtered 54 Rwandan refugees in northern Burundi near the 
border with Rwanda, indiscriminately gunning down women, men and children, aid 
workers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They said 16 refugees were wounded -- including a nine-month pregnant woman 
shot in the stomach -- in the attack early Monday on a cluster of makeshift 
huts in Gittwa village. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's unborn baby was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got there, dead people -- men, women and children -- were everywhere 
as if they were indiscriminately machine-gunned," said Joelle Dubois, 
coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in the northern province of Ngozi. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wounded said people in uniform came and began shooting indiscriminately 
into their huts. Fifty were dead, and as we were picking up wounded two more 
died," she said by telephone from Ngozi. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid workers said 18 wounded were transferred to hospitals by the humanitarian 
medical group and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. They 
said two out of eight badly wounded taken to Ngozi hospital died of their 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded told aid workers that they believed the attackers were members of 
the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, which seized power in Rwanda in 
July after three months of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the Gittwa refugees are members of Rwanda's Hutu majority who fled 
across the border to the village in July. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no independent confirmation that the gunmen were RPF soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information we have leads us to believe to the best of our knowledge the 
attackers were people who crossed the border with Rwanda, that this was an 
incursion," according to one relief worker.

SIMPSON'S FAME MORE OF A BOON, ATTORNEY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While criticizing pretrial publicity, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of O.J. 
Simpson's defense attorneys, acknowledged Tuesday that his client's fame from 
football and TV commercials is more advantageous than harmful to him in his 
murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "On balance he has been helped by his celebrity reputation," Cochran said at a 
conference of magazine publishers Tuesday at the Ritz-Carlton hotel. "We have 
jurors regarding him as O.J." the public figure, not as an ordinary murder 
defendant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After his appearance in a panel discussion, Cochran said in an interview that 
polls of potential jurors reveal that most "have a favorable image of (Simpson) 
going in and that is unusual" for a defendant facing murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran, however, complained that the media emphasize the First Amendment 
right to free speech over other constitutional protections, particularly the 
right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our Constitution there is more than the First Amendment," he said. He 
contended that the extraordinary amount of media attention in the O.J. Simpson 
case is "debilitating to our ability to get a fair trial." Simpson has pleaded 
not guilty to killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald 
Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran complained about the flood of publicity involving an old 911 tape of 
Nicole Simpson calling for help as a man identified as O.J. Simpson rages in 
the background. The attorney also criticized KNBC for televising a report that 
blood on Simpson's socks was a DNA match with his ex-wife's blood, when DNA 
tests had not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cochran said he has "no faith in the tabloids" and complained about the 
"spin" of other written news reports, he said he would lean toward wanting 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito to continue to allow cameras in the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the panel discussion -- titled "Are Magazines Going Too Far or Not 
Far Enough?" -- also criticized the press for what they called a lack of 
professional responsibility.

MICHIGAN SHORE SEARCHED FOR BODY OF BOY MISSING SINCE 1984 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials are searching for a grave on the shore of Lake 
Michigan that might hold the body of Kevin Collins, who was 10 years old when 
he disappeared from a San Francisco bus stop in 1984, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The anonymous call that touched off the search in Saugatuck, Mich., came from 
a man who claimed to be a priest, said the victim's father, David Collins. The 
caller said he took a deathbed confession from a San Quentin inmate who 
professed to have killed a boy named Kevin Collins in the early 1980s and 
buried him in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller then described an area that police narrowed down to Saugatuck, a 
popular vacation spot on the lake.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; FEINSTEIN CALLS NEW HUFFINGTON AD 
'DISTORTION'; THE COMMERCIAL ACCUSES SENATOR OF VOTING ON EDUCATION BILLS THAT 
BENEFIT HUSBAND'S INVESTMENTS. SHE TRUMPETS BACKING OF ANOTHER LAW OFFICER 
GROUP.

 U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday trumpeted the endorsement of another 
police officers organization while outlining her support for various 
tough-on-crime measures to an attentive high school classroom in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic incumbent also took aim at her Republican opponent, Mike 
Huffington, for his latest -- and most controversial -- campaign commercial to 
date. The ad, which began running statewide Monday night, accuses Feinstein of 
improperly voting on education bills that benefited a company whose largest 
shareholder is a firm owned by her husband, investor Richard Blum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only is he trying to buy his way into the Senate, but he is going to lie 
his way into the Senate too," Feinstein said at an appearance at James Monroe 
High School in North Hills. "And this is just one more lie and distortion in a 
long chain of lies and distortions." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, in a teleconference hours later, could not hide his outrage at 
the ad and at Huffington, a freshman Santa Barbara congressman who is spending 
a record amount in trying to unseat Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can think of is this is a kid who with his daddy's money . . . is 
arrogant and has always gotten his own way by putting dollars on the table and 
that is what he is trying to do here," Blum told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign spokeswoman, Jennifer Grossman, responded: "Obviously 
Mr. Blum is upset that we have exposed this cozy little deal. But the fact of 
the matter is that it is the truth. And sometimes the truth hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huffington commercial illustrates the bruising nature of the Senate race, 
which at more than $27 million is already the costliest in U.S. history with 
two weeks before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ad, Huffington says that Feinstein voted for bills that provided more 
than $100 million to National Education Corp., the Irvine-based corporation in 
which her husband is a shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein said that she voted for the two appropriations bills that 
included more than $2 billion for federal student loans. "There was nothing . . 
. that in any way, shape or form referred directly or indirectly to NEC. The 
money goes to students," she told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington fiercely defended the commercial at a Sacramento news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . Mr. Blum can invest his money wherever he wants. It is Mrs. Feinstein's 
vote that I am concerned about," the congressman said. "She knows that she has 
an interest in that. She receives income from NEC. It is just plain wrong to 
vote for funding, federal funding, and all she had to do was recuse herself 
from those votes." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington again complained that Feinstein ran an attack ad that said 
Huffington's company "stiffed taxpayers for millions" and that he refuses to 
release his tax returns. Although Huffington has declined to release those 
records, the supposed millions of dollars owed to taxpayers were part of a 
lawsuit filed by the state Franchise Tax Board against a Huffington subsidiary. 
That lawsuit was dismissed by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last month, Mrs. Feinstein has been saying that I owe taxes. She's 
lying," Huffington told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, guess what?" he said later, "Her ad . . . says we owe it today in the 
present tense. We do not owe a penny of taxes. We pay all of our taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 But his remark touched off a brief exchange with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do we know that if you won't release your tax (returns)?" a reporter 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because you have to trust somebody. Obviously, I hope you trust me. I will 
tell you something, . . ." Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me," a reporter interrupted, "but why should we trust you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, because I'll tell you what. The American people trust me," Huffington 
said, predicting California voters will elect him Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Feinstein added to her list of endorsements from law enforcement 
groups -- and labor unions representing peace officers -- when she was 
supported by the 10,000-member California Assn. of Highway Patrolmen. 
</P>

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / ATTORNEY GENERAL; GRANDFATHER OF SLAIN GIRL LASHES OUT 
AT LUNGREN; IN BACKING DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER TOM UMBERG, JOE KLAAS SAYS GOP 
CANDIDATES ARE EXPLOITING THE MURDER OF POLLY KLAAS IN PUSHING FOR TOUGHER 
SENTENCING LAWS.

 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and other Republican candidates are "dancing a jig" on 
the grave of Polly Klaas to push their own agenda on crime, the murdered girl's 
grandfather charged Tuesday at a campaign event for Democratic challenger Tom 
Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Klaas lashed out at Lungren, Gov. Pete Wilson and GOP senatorial candidate 
Mike Huffington and is appearing in an Umberg television commercial that blames 
Lungren for contributing to 12-year-old Polly's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, Wilson and Huffington -- who is co-chairman of Proposition 184, the 
so-called "three strikes" initiative -- have all used Polly's death to push for 
stricter sentencing laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are dancing a jig on Polly's grave, and that is sleaze," said Joe Klaas, 
a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg joined Klaas in charging that the girl's death might have been 
prevented if Lungren had maintained funding for a statewide computer database 
designed to give officers quick access to criminal records. Umberg and Klaas 
contend that if the system had been operational, Polly's alleged killer, 
Richard Allen Davis, could have been apprehended before she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Telliano, Lungren's campaign spokesman, said officers who talked to 
Davis were unaware that there had been a kidnaping and did not call the 
department's dispatcher to check on his criminal history. Had they done so, the 
dispatcher could have called up a record replete with felonies, including two 
kidnaping charges, Telliano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sonoma County sheriff has said repeatedly that the officers did not check 
the system because they didn't know there had been a kidnaping," Telliano said. 
"Had they known, had they radioed in, then they would have known about the 
kidnaping and maybe it would have been different. But it's a huge stretch that 
Umberg is making." 
</P>
<P>
 Telliano said the commercial may well backfire on Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ad may prove to be a grenade that Tom Umberg pulled the pin on but 
forgot to let go of," he said. "It may end up doing in his own campaign. People 
are absolutely outraged by this sleaze-ball ad." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, an assemblyman from Orange County and a former federal prosecutor, 
charged that the database -- part of the Violent Crime Information Center -- 
could have been maintained with $120,000 in funding and that the officers could 
have checked on Davis by computer from their vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren says funding was pending at the time of the crime.

BLACKS TAKE TO STREETS AFTER POLICE KILLING

<P>
 Hundreds of blacks roamed the city's downtown Tuesday, damaging police cars 
and throwing rocks at whites after a white police officer fatally shot a 
teen-ager in a predominantly black neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people, including at least one police officer, were injured, 
authorities said, but none of the injuries were believed serious.Police said a 
handful of people were treated at hospitals and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Before night fell and calm was restored, as many as 500 people took to the 
streets of downtown and the city's near east side, where the trouble began. 
</P>
<P>
 By dark, most people had left downtown, where police in riot gear were called 
out to protect government and court buildings. Substantial numbers of people 
remained on the streets of black neighborhoods, however, some throwing objects 
at passing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said trouble started after a white officer accidentally shot to death 
Antonio Orlando Sullivan, a black 18-year-old, as the young man was being 
arrested at a home. The shooting was being investigated.

MISSING STINGER MISSILES ARE JUST A MATH PROBLEM, PENTAGON SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Army can't account for 40 Stinger missiles, one of three types that are 
vulnerable to theft because of lax security and record-keeping, a congressional 
report said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon insists that none are missing and says the problem is all in the 
bookkeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), who released the General Accounting Office report, 
says it raises questions about U.S. ability to keep sophisticated weapons out 
of the hands of terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 GAO auditors visited arsenals, looked at inventory, checked paperwork and 
concluded that 40 of the 6,373 Stingers shipped to the Persian Gulf in 1991 
"were not returned to the depot, other Army locations or the other services." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also included anecdotes about lax security that might have let 
missiles fall into the wrong hands had a terrorist been in the right place at 
the right time. Some missiles were transported around the Gulf region on 
unguarded trucks driven by foreigners, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help quickly move troops home after the war, units were allowed to turn in 
equipment, ammunition and weapons without documentation. And enemy weapons and 
other unauthorized weapons were deposited in so-called amnesty boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items found in those boxes: Stinger missiles. And an undisclosed 
number of Stingers were found unguarded on the side of the road, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department responded that "there have been no confirmed thefts or 
unexplained losses of Category I missiles." And it said it is trying to fix its 
bad bookkeeping. "A 100% worldwide inventory of the assets by serial number 
will be accomplished by December, 1994," promised James Klugh, Defense 
Department deputy undersecretary for logistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Stingers and Redeyes are accurate enough and strong enough to knock a plane 
out of the sky, yet small enough to be fired from the shoulder of a single 
soldier; and Dragons are designed to pierce the armor of a tank. 
</P>
<P>
 GAO auditors counted 36,216 Stingers in U.S. depots worldwide; military 
records said there should have been 28,484. GAO counted 40,359 Dragons; records 
showed 50,103. Auditors inventoried 7,983 Redeyes, 5,230 more than the records 
said were there.

KENNEDY DEBATE WITH ROMNEY TURNS HEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Edward M. Kennedy offered a spirited defense of liberalism and his 
32-year Senate record in a debate Tuesday with GOP challenger Mitt Romney that 
erupted into a shouting match within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the toughest race of his career, Kennedy found himself under attack as an 
advocate of an outdated liberal philosophy Romney said had failed to answer an 
explosion in out-of-wedlock births, illegal immigration and violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again, Kennedy tried to turn the tables by saying those problems had 
worsened under 12 years of Republican presidents and had begun to improve 
thanks to his Senate leadership alongside President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 And Kennedy got indignant when Romney suggested he had gotten a sweetheart 
deal in a Washington real estate investment, turning to his challenger and 
declaring: "Mr. Romney, the Kennedys are not in public service to make money. 
We have paid too high a price." 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates debate again Thursday in Holyoke.

OFFICIAL WASHINGTON ABUZZ OVER MYSTERY OF LEAKED BUDGET MEMO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the question all of political Washington has been asking this week: Who 
leaked Alice Rivlin's top secret memo to the Republicans? 
</P>
<P>
 The inside-the-Beltway mystery has not been solved but some clues are now 
surfacing and they have left red faces at the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft of the memo by Rivlin, director of the White House Office of 
Management and Budget, was leaked to Republican operative William Kristol -- 
who in turn leaked it to the Washington Post, which ran a story about the memo 
Sunday. (The Times ran the Post story in its Sunday editions.) The leaked copy 
had been sent to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, Rivlin summarized a wide range of potential budget options, 
including broad-based tax increases and politically unpopular cuts in Social 
Security and Medicare. President Clinton quickly disavowed that the 
Administration was considering such politically dangerous steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristol, chairman of the Project for the Republican Future, now insists that 
he does not know who sent the document to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, he told the Washington Post that it was a "public-spirited senior 
Administration official." But he said in an interview Tuesday that "it came in 
over the transom and I really don't know who did it." 
</P>
<P>
 The copy of the 11-page memo leaked to Kristol bears the handwritten initials, 
"ESK." Edward S. Knight is general counsel of the Treasury Department and 
presumably a man smart enough not to leak a memo bearing his initials. At the 
time the Oct. 3 memo was circulated, Knight was also serving as Treasury's 
executive secretary and was in charge of all paperwork flowing to Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury officials confirmed that Knight's initials are on that copy because 
it had been sent to Bentsen. Knight denied in an interview that he leaked the 
document and other Treasury officials supported him. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury officials said that Bentsen was traveling when he received the memo 
by fax over "secure channels." They said they did not believe the copy was 
given to Kristol until after Bentsen returned. They said that they do not know 
who was responsible.

JAMES FLANIGAN: MAJOR LEAGUE PROBLEMS; FRANCHISE VALUES TAKE A HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is baseball a past-tense national pastime or a low-priced growth stock with a 
promising recovery in its future? Baseball team owners and players are losing 
more than revenues and bonuses from cancellation of the World Series -- which 
would have been played this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Team values have fallen 20% because of the strike, which is more than 2 months 
old, says Paul J. Much, an evaluator of sports franchises for the Los Angeles 
investment banking firm Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin. 
</P>
<P>
 But strike losses only continue a pattern that has seen values of most major 
league teams decline 20% to 35% since 1991. Baseball's revenue from network 
television has been cut 50% as broadcasters and advertisers have backed away -- 
even as TV has showered more money on football, basketball and hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, the term national pastime seems like an exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, five investor groups (from Phoenix, Orlando, Tampa-St.Petersburg and 
two from the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington) will be bidding for 
expansion franchises Tuesday in Chicago. "All sports move in cycles," says 
Jerry Colangelo, owner of basketball's Phoenix Suns and leader of that city's 
bid for a baseball franchise. With baseball in a crisis, "a baseball team could 
be a good buy if a new economic system emerges in the aftermath of Armageddon," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo is referring to the hope that a new climate of cooperation will 
characterize player relations after the strike and that a formula will be found 
for revenue sharing in baseball so that teams in less-than-giant markets, such 
as Phoenix, won't operate at a disadvantage to teams in the largest markets. 
</P>
<P>
 With local TV revenues of almost $50 million, the New York Yankees can better 
afford a high payroll than can teams in smaller markets. Local TV, and larger 
gate receipts, also give teams in Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston 
(which has the New England market) and Baltimore (the Washington market) the 
ability to operate on a grander scale than teams in Milwaukee, Pittsburgh or 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Size doesn't guarantee pennant winners, but it sets up a disparity in baseball 
-- where eight of 28 teams lost money last year. Football and basketball have 
alleviated such disparities with revenue sharing, reckoning that a balanced 
league makes a better attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 And the marketplace agrees. Even though basketball's Indiana Pacers and 
football's Detroit Lions lose money, the values of their franchises have 
increased in recent years -- to $67 million for the Pacers and $138 million for 
the Lions -- according to annual rankings in Financial World magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But in baseball, where gate and concession receipts have been flat in recent 
years for most teams, the cut in TV revenues made tough situations worse. 
Player costs, even if they didn't rise rapidly, creamed off much of what 
revenue growth there was -- rising to an average 56% of operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teams took drastic, if counterproductive, action. The San Diego Padres 
fell into the red in 1992. So the owners cut payroll by trading or selling star 
players. They turned an operating profit in '93 but fielded a sub-par team. The 
fans were the losers. 
</P>
<P>
 And not only in San Diego, says Paul Much. With some exceptions, baseball 
owners and players don't accommodate fans the way other sports do, he says. 
"They say they're reaching out to young fans but don't schedule early-evening 
games on school nights," he says. And "the players charge for autographs." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that when -- and if -- major league baseball comes back next 
season, it will have to hustle to win back fans angered by the rich men on both 
sides of the bargaining table who canceled the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sport is at a crossroads," says Steven Matt, who evaluates sports 
franchises for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm. But the new direction also 
could be a high road, he adds. With revenue sharing and a new arrangement in 
player costs, baseball could thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth remembering that fans haven't turned away from the game of 
baseball. Minor league teams all over the country are offering customers a 
pleasant, entertaining night out and doing well. In the major leagues, the 
Dodgers and Angels, Minnesota Twins, Chicago White Sox and Cubs and some others 
haven't forgotten how to make fans welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball is already a major sport in Latin America and Asia, so the game has 
great prospects internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 And here in the United States, the business has turned around in cities with 
new stadiums. Jacobs Field in Cleveland opened this year, attracted fans who 
cheered an improved team, and the Indians' franchise value rose to $100 million 
from $75 million just three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis of new stadiums is "intimacy," a smaller park encouraging fan 
involvement, says Phoenix's Colangelo. He has a commitment from Maricopa County 
for a quarter-cent sales tax increase to build a $253-million stadium if major 
league owners award Phoenix a franchise next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The price could be steep. The Phoenix bidders, and those from Florida and 
Virginia, will be asked to pay more than $100 million as a franchise fee, 
compared to $85 million in fees paid a few years ago by the Florida Marlins and 
Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently major league owners think baseball is a sport with a growing future. 
They're probably right, but given their record in running a business, you don't 
want to put that one in the books just yet. Past Its Time? 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the strike, the value of most major league baseball franchises had 
been declining in recent years -- although some got a boost from new stadiums 
or consistent winning. Percentage decline or rise in value from 1991 to 1994 
for a sampling of franchises: 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Dodgers: -31.0% 
</P>
<P>
 New York Yankees: -26.2% 
</P>

 Consumers say the quality of goods and services available in the United States 
is merely satisfactory, according to a new consumer satisfaction survey 
released Tuesday by the American Society for Quality Control. 
</P>

 The overall average rating in the survey is not high enough to protect U.S. 
industry from foreign competition, the Milwaukee-based organization said.

 The 48-year-old society, developed by the National Quality Research Center at 
the University of Michigan, created a new consumer satisfaction index for the 
survey, which asked consumers to rate goods and services using a 100-point 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The society said it interprets the overall 74.5 rating -- resulting from the 
way some 46,000 consumers scored 200 products and services -- as consumers' 
opinion that overall performance is merely acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings is that services, which represents the fastest-growing 
segment of the economy, is not performing as well as manufacturing, the 
survey's designers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, chocolate candies and canned goods give us the greatest 
satisfaction, followed closely by milk and soft drinks, according to the 
results. We are least satisfied with the quality of service we receive from the 
U.S. Postal Service and police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Claes Fornell, a University of Michigan professor who designed the index used 
in the survey, expressed hope that industry will accept the American Customer 
Satisfaction Index as an important economic indicator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that the health of the nation's economy is now heavily 
dependent on customer satisfaction. It has everything to do with our quality of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Jack West, society chairman, puts it: "Quality is what the customer 
says it is. It's not what the quality professional says it is. It's not what 
the engineer says it is. It's what the customer says it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Taken in that light, U.S. service industries may have reason to be nervous. 
Service industries scored just below the overall average, with a rating of 
74.4. The lowest scoring sector was public services, according to the survey. 
Not surprisingly, the IRS came in at the bottom of all organizations and 
companies rated, with a paltry 55 satisfaction points. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, according to Fornell, American consumers report greater satisfaction 
across the board than consumers in Germany, Sweden and Taiwan -- countries that 
employ almost-identical consumer satisfaction indexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggressive competition within industries seems to bring greater customer 
satisfaction than when industries are protected from competition, according to 
Fornell. 
</P>
<P>
 The quasi-public U.S. Postal Service received one of the lowest scores on the 
index, a 60, for its basic mail services. But overnight mail service, in which 
the Postal Service competes with private companies such as Federal Express, 
United Parcel Service and others, earned one of the highest scores, at 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance telephone companies also scored particularly well, coming in at 
82. 
</P>
<P>
 The creators of the consumer satisfaction index hope their quality index will 
become as important an economic indicator as the consumer price index and other 
macroeconomic indicators. 
</P>
<P>
 Fornell explained: "If accounting were to incorporate customer satisfaction as 
an asset on the balance sheet, we would have a better understanding of the 
relationship between enterprise's current condition and its future capacity to 
produce wealth." What They Think 
</P>
<P>
 Americans think the overall quality of goods and services produced by U.S. 
industries is only fair. A 100-point scale was used to rate consumers' opinions 
of a variety of specific goods and services. A 75 indicates adequate quality. A 
sampling:

DOCTORS LINKED TO NME SUE EX-PATIENTS; COURTS: DALLAS PSYCHIATRISTS WHO WORKED 
AT NATIONAL MEDICAL'S MOST NOTORIOUS HOSPITAL ARE CHARGING DEFAMATION, SLANDER 
AND LIBEL. 
</P>

<P>
 Largely absent from the hundreds of lawsuits and government investigations 
initiated against National Medical Enterprises -- accused of orchestrating the 
nation's biggest health care fraud ever -- are the doctors and other health 
care professionals who oversaw care at the firm's hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a highly unusual action, some of those doctors are suing former 
patients whose complaints of kidnapings and billion-dollar insurance rip-offs 
were key to the legal actions taken against Santa Monica-based National Medical 
over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 A prominent group of Dallas doctors that worked at National Medical's most 
notorious psychiatric hospital has sued former patients Banning Lyon and Mark 
Rotella and their lawyer for defamation, slander and libel. In a Texas state 
court lawsuit, the psychiatrists claim the defendants' disturbing stories of 
false imprisonment, abuse and fraud are not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Said William A. Smith, a Dallas lawyer representing Dallas Psychiatric 
Associates: "These lies are harmful and injurious to these doctors who provided 
what we believe to be very fine medical care." 
</P>
<P>
 The psychiatrists' lawsuit is extraordinary, legal experts said. Physicians 
occasionally sue their patients for defamation, but such actions are rare. 
Doctors and lawyers who represent them generally conclude that they stand to 
lose more than they gain when they challenge patients' accusations in medical 
malpractice cases, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rarely do we have professionals suing their patients," said Marc Franklin, a 
Stanford University law professor who specializes in tort law. "That's partly 
because patients rarely go public with such extreme levels of dissatisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 But the 10 physicians who make up Dallas Psychiatric Associates are in a legal 
pressure cooker of their own. The Justice Department has targeted them in an 
ongoing probe of possible wrongdoing in the National Medical case, according to 
knowledgeable legal sources. No federal charges have been filed against Dallas 
Psychiatric, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors' suit is also problematic for National Medical, which during the 
past year has moved quickly to settle legal claims. In its most significant 
move, the Santa Monica firm four months ago resolved all federal criminal fraud 
charges against the company by agreeing to pay $379 million in fines and 
pleading guilty to six counts of paying illegal kickbacks for patient 
referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, federal prosecutors said their investigation would continue into 
possible criminal activities by individuals -- doctors, former or current 
National Medical employees and others -- for their role in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pursuing a number of cases related to NME," said U.S. Atty. Paul 
Coggins in Dallas. Coggins declined to comment on whether Dallas Psychiatric 
Associates is a target of the federal criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason the Dallas group has become a government target, sources say, lies 
in the case of Peter Alexis. Alexis, a former regional vice president for 
National Medical's psychiatric hospital division who pleaded guilty in June to 
federal criminal charges and admitted paying more than $20 million in bribes to 
psychiatrists, psychologists and others for patient referrals to National 
Medical facilities in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexis, who is cooperating with federal prosecutors, admitted to entering into 
a contract in March, 1990, "with a professional association of psychiatrists" 
in which the doctors would be paid a yearly sum for referring patients to 
Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion. The Alexis plea does not name Dallas 
Psychiatric Associates, but the doctors' attorney said the psychiatrists did 
have a contract with Brookhaven in early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we weren't identified by name (in the Alexis plea agreement), to the 
extent that Alexis was making reference to (Dallas Psychiatric), the 
allegations are categorically untrue," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert F. Andrews, a Ft. Worth attorney who is named in the psychiatrists' 
suit, likens the doctors to "a bunch of deer that are caught in the headlights. 
They have struck out at the only people who they perceive to be weaker than 
them, which is their former patients." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews represented 66 former psychiatric patients, including Lyon, who 
settled fraud claims against National Medical for more than $15 million a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said the Dallas Psychiatric Associates suit "calls into question the 
entire settlement we had with NME last November." He claims the doctors' suit 
breaches a key condition of the out-of-court settlement he struck with National 
Medical, which prohibited the company, hospital or doctors from suing any of 
the former patients for actions that took place prior to the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although National Medical is not named in the psychiatrists' suit, legal 
observers said indictments of doctors and other medical professionals could 
prompt a new spate of patient lawsuits against the hospital chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers and investigators familiar with various lawsuits against National 
Medical said many patients were children or adolescents when they were 
hospitalized and may be waiting until they are no longer minors to sue. Also, 
one lawyer said some patients who have been "holding on to some trust" for 
doctors who treated them during a difficult period of their lives may be 
prompted to sue once they learn that those doctors have been charged with 
criminal wrongdoing. "They will come out in droves," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the new suits is inopportune for National Medical, which is 
trying to complete a $3.3-billion merger with American Medical Holdings, a 
Dallas-based hospital chain, as well as mend its reputation with investors, 
insurers and the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas J. Sabatino, American Medical's general counsel, said, "We are aware of 
these cases, but we don't feel they'll have any impact on the transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the new lawsuits threaten to drag National Medical back into a sticky 
legal quagmire and the kind of public relations problems it has been trying to 
avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical spokeswoman Diana Takvim said the firm believes most major 
litigation is behind it and has put aside funds to handle any future claims. 
The abuses took place under the company's former management, she said, and the 
firm has sold or closed most of its psychiatric hospitals, including all of its 
Texas facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Psychiatric suit, which seeks unspecified monetary damages, claims 
that Lyon defamed and libeled the psychiatrists in statements published in 
Business Week magazine in October, 1993, and in a personal essay by Lyon that 
appeared the same month in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Business Week article, Lyon described how, as a teen-ager, he spent 345 
days at Brookhaven and was held against his will until his parents' insurance 
policy ran dry. Lyon said he was subjected to seven months of "chair therapy" 
-- a treatment in which he was forced to sit in a hard chair facing a wall for 
up to 12 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The psychiatrists' charges against Andrews involve his role in arranging for 
another former Brookhaven patient, John Deaton, to testify in July before a 
congressional subcommittee on crime and criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotella is accused in the suit of slandering the doctors when he allegedly 
told an acquaintance that the "doctors which treated him received a $10,000 
bonus for each bed filled over the Christmas holiday."

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; 3 BABY BELLS, CAA 
PLANNING JOINT VENTURE; MEDIA: HOLLYWOOD AGENCY AND THE PHONE FIRMS WILL 
DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY AND PROGRAMMING FOR VIDEO NETWORKS, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major challenge to the cable television industry, three regional phone 
companies and Hollywood's powerful Creative Artists Agency plan next week to 
unveil a joint venture to develop technology and programming for a new 
generation of video networks they are building. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture, which will be equally owned by phone operators Bell Atlantic, 
Nynex and Pacific Telesis, will buy and produce programming in addition to 
offering services such as movies-on-demand and home shopping systems, 
knowledgeable sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 CAA, which is barred from owning major stakes in programming because of 
Hollywood guild agreements, is serving as a strategic consultant to the 
partners. It will advise them in areas such as programming and the development 
of a "navigation" system that will help users sort through myriad program 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture -- two years in development but still unnamed -- appears to be the 
biggest gambit yet among the regional phone companies to help spur the 
development of the so-called information highway that is expected to offer 
countless entertainment and information services over telephone and cable TV 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are just beginning to see the kind of relationships needed to get these 
(interactive) services to consumers," said Jerry Held, senior vice president of 
interactive multimedia at the software firm Oracle in Northern California, 
pointing to the high cost of developing content for the new interactive 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plans could still be stymied by regulatory hurdles and a lack of 
technical standards among the partners. Moreover, widespread distribution of 
the service will depend on how fast the Baby Bells can upgrade their telephone 
lines to fiber-optic, a process that will take them well into the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial capital outlay is expected to be modest. The three Baby Bells will 
spend $450 million over the next three years developing and rolling out the 
system, which is expected to reach about 30 million customers. The final total 
investment, however, could be considerably higher. Eventually the Baby Bells 
may try to sell the service to other phone companies outside their service 
areas, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to clear certain regulatory hurdles, as well as to promote 
industrywide standards, the partners are establishing two separate entities -- 
a media company to develop and produce programming, and a technical company to 
integrate the technology and develop the computer software necessary to power 
the system. The media venture will be based in Los Angeles and New York, and 
the technical company will have offices in San Francisco and Reston, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture brings together three Baby Bells covering six of the top 10 
markets in the country -- New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, San 
Francisco and Washington-Baltimore. The biggest market not covered by the 
partners is Chicago, where Ameritech is based. Ameritech is said to be pursuing 
its own discussions for a video/information service with Walt Disney Co., 
although sources did not rule out its eventually joining the other Baby Bells. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, the service would eventually provide regional as well as 
national programming. It would begin rolling out in some markets in late 1995 
most other markets by 1996, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of a media company appears to be an effort to work around 
regulations that prohibit Bell companies from offering programming over their 
networks. Under the proposed arrangement, the joint venture will finance the 
cost of creating new programming services in anticipation of those regulations' 
being eased. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic, the only Baby Bell currently cleared by the courts to offer 
video programming, already has programming trials under way in northern 
Virgina. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the media company, the consortium will establish a company to 
work on common standards for delivering programs and billing customers. The 
goal of the company is to share the high cost of development and drive down 
expenses. Analysts estimate the current cost of delivering video-on-demand as 
high as $3,000 a customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic has 300 employees in Reston working on video technology. The 
company also has a navigation program called Stargazer. It is unclear whether 
those operations and software will be merged into the new technology company. 
</P>
<P>
 One mandate of the technology company will be to develop a Stargazer-like 
navigator that will help customers make their way through the various program 
offerings to find the movie or shopping service they want. CAA will advise the 
technology company on the look and feel of the navigator -- a crucial element 
in helping perplexed viewers scroll through the assortment of programming and 
information options.

 Dole Food to Take Full Control of Castle & Cooke: The company said it will pay 
about $81 million, or $15.75 a share in cash, for the 17.2% of Castle & Cooke 
Homes it does not already own. Westlake Village-based Dole Food Co. said the 
deal has won unanimous approval from a Castle & Cooke committee that was 
appointed in August to study Dole's original offer of $14 a share. Castle & 
Cooke Homes, which has home-building operations in Hawaii, California and 
Arizona, was a wholly owned Dole subsidiary until late 1992.

BREWERS ARE ASKED TO PUT SKELETONS BACK IN CLOSET; CONSUMERS: CHILDREN'S GROUPS 
SAY HALLOWEEN IMAGERY TURNS THE HOLIDAY INTO A DRINKERS' DAY. TRADE 
ORGANIZATION DISAGREES.

<P>
 A coalition of children's health groups demanded Tuesday that America's beer 
sellers, which are using ghosts and goblins to promote their brews, stop trying 
to turn Halloween into a drinkers' holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hands off Halloween," said Andrew McGuire, executive director of the Trauma 
Foundation, one of a dozen health, children's and religious groups urging beer 
makers to stop using Halloween symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 Budweiser, Coors and Miller are among the brands using skeletons, ghosts, 
black cats, jack-o'-lanterns and monster masks in their advertising. Some beer 
bottles sport Halloween-theme labels at this time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The advocacy groups say the advertising seems designed to appeal to little 
children as well as to teen-agers under the legal drinking age. As part of 
their argument, they cite an alarming number of drunk-driving incidents on 
Halloween, when many children are out in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beer Institute, a major trade organization, responded that Halloween is 
not exclusively a children's holiday and that there is nothing inappropriate 
about their use of seasonal imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adults have celebrated Halloween long before beer companies began special 
promotions for the holiday," institute President Raymond McGrath said in a 
statement. "There is no evidence -- whatsoever -- that alcohol misuse increases 
on Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
 The Beer Institute's own marketing code frowns on advertising aimed at youth. 
For instance, brewers do not use Santa Claus to sell beer. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire and other advocates, speaking at a Washington news conference, said 
the Halloween stickers, pennants, masks and glow-in-the-dark labels seem 
child-oriented and not in keeping with the voluntary marketing code. He asked 
the brewers to shun those images voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is not contemplating a call for a boycott at this point, he said, 
but it will consider trying to persuade the Federal Trade Commission or another 
government agency to act if the voluntary appeals fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco foes have sought government help to fight cigarette sales images, 
notably the Joe Camel cartoon character, that they say appeal to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Brown, president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said Halloween has 
joined New Year's Eve and Super Bowl Sunday as a major drinking day. More than 
200 people died last Halloween weekend in alcohol-related traffic accidents, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the driver who killed her son Marc 15 years ago was arrested on 
suspicion of drunk driving last Halloween and that he had a 3-year-old in the 
car.

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE FALTERS FOR 4TH MONTH; ECONOMY: FINDINGS COME AMID A 
BACKDROP OF CONCERNS OVER JOBS AND A STEADY RISE IN INTEREST RATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jumble of disconcerting economic news emerged Tuesday, marked by faltering 
consumer confidence, weak wage growth, more cracks in the fragile dollar and 
evidence that higher loan rates are beginning to cause pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the news suggests that the American economy, which had been 
thought to be growing at the healthiest clip since the 1990-91 recession, is 
not necessarily as robust as forecasters had reckoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshest signals on the economy's direction came from the Conference 
Board, which reported that consumer confidence dropped in October for the 
fourth straight month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole mosaic of unsettling things out there, so it's not surprising 
to me that consumer confidence is weakening," said David Bostian, an economist 
at Herzog Heine Geduld, a New York investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conference Board attributed the drop largely to rising anxiety over 
employment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second straight month, consumers also cut back on plans to purchase 
homes, and they are reducing spending on cars and appliances. The index based 
on Conference Board survey results fell to 87.6 in October from 89.5 in 
September, hitting its lowest level since March. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The results come against a backdrop of anxiety over jobs and a steady rise in 
interest rates -- the cost of borrowing money. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest-rate increases began early this year when the Federal Reserve, 
reversing a five-year pattern of lower rates, started raising them. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports also offer evidence that ordinary Americans are not necessarily 
seeing benefits in the more prosperous economy. The Labor Department reported 
that compensation costs, including wages and fringe benefits, rose at an annual 
rate of 3.2% in the July-September quarter. That is among the smallest 
increases on record. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was viewed as a positive sign in the financial markets because it 
means there is not necessarily an inflation hazard with higher production costs 
for goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 But many forecasters said they believe that it is inevitable that the Federal 
Reserve will push rates still higher because there is still a perceived threat 
of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of inflation and higher mortgage rates was offered as an explanation 
Tuesday for a seemingly incongruous rise in home resales last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the housing market benefited from the continuing economic 
recovery, which appeared to be neutralizing the effect of rising interest rates 
on sales, said Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president of research and economics 
for the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Home resales in the state were up 0.7% for September, rising for the second 
consecutive month, the trade group reported. The September sales pace declined 
1.8% from the September, 1993, annualized rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the robust economy also offset rising mortgage rates and helped 
boost home resales 1% in September, according to the National Assn. of 
Realtors. Consumer Confidence

among 50 other "good" cities.

 Hong Kong was on top in part because it adjoins China, the world's

 Carolco Gets $18.5 Million in Cash: The struggling producer used several 
methods to raise the money, including, as expected, selling its interest in the 
film "Showgirls" to an affiliate of the French media concern Chargeurs.In 
addition, Japan's Pioneer prepaid some money due under licenses for Carolco's 
"Cliffhanger" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" films. Carolco said it is 
continuing to work to obtain a $63-million production loan for the film 
"Cutthroat Island." Carolco reiterated that if it fails to get the loan and 
cannot arrange alternative financing, it will be forced to halt production on 
"Cutthroat Island."

GM WILL ALLOW TRANSFERS FROM JOBS AT SATURN

 General Motors Corp., acting on a desire to integrate the Saturn small-car 
unit with the rest of the company, said Tuesday it will give Saturn employees 
the choice of returning to work at conventional GM plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturn executives said the one-time offer, made possible through a special 
agreement with the United Auto Workers union, will allow employees to quit 
Saturn and return to other GM plants without losing pension benefits. They said 
the option, open to all of Saturn's 6,550 hourly workers, will expire Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a number of years, Saturn and the UAW have recognized that some team 
members, for a variety of personal reasons, wanted to relocate to other GM 
locations," Saturn spokesman Bill Betts said. "Over this period of time, the 
UAW in particular sought a method of doing that, and we've achieved that with 
this special agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Betts said he did not know how many Saturn employees would take advantage of 
the offer. He said the company could replace them by shifting employees 
internally or hiring new workers at the Spring Hill, Tenn., Saturn plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to take it on a case-by-case basis and decide, under the 
circumstances, what's the right thing to do for any specific vacancy," Betts 
said. "If an offer is made to somebody and they accept it, you would work out 
the time for their departure, and the team involved at Saturn would work out 
the replacement procedure." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to allow transfers between Saturn and other GM operations comes 
as GM seeks to strengthen its relationship with the union. Two strikes in the 
last quarter cost GM $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor experts said the decision to allow the transfers is the latest of 
several moves toward making Saturn less independent. "The ability for people to 
leave Saturn and go back to GM tends to integrate Saturn more closely into GM," 
said Harley Shaiken, a University of California labor expert. "It makes it 
another plant, rather than a completely separate entity." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturn workers have been separate from other GM employees, and most of them 
were hired by Saturn. At first, most Saturn employees enjoyed the independence, 
but over time, some workers have expressed concerns about Saturn's rotating 
shift assignments and extensive overtime.

 Thrift Fund Called Threatened: The fund that insures savings and loan deposits 
could be depleted in five years, given "moderately pessimistic" assumptions 
about future thrift failure rates, the Congressional Budget Office said. Under 
a scenario that assumes the Savings Assn. Insurance Fund will have to cover 
failure losses of $1.5 billion a year, the fund will be insolvent by 1999, the 
agency said in an Oct. 14 memo sent to the House Banking Committee.

 General Signal Chief Holds to Reliance Bid: Edmund Carpenter, chairman of 
General Signal Corp., said his company has no plans to raise its offer to buy 
Reliance Electric Co. for $1.4 billion in stock, despite Rockwell International 
Corp.'s rival bid of $1.5 billion cash. General Signal's proposed tax-free 
stock swap and the lack of antitrust considerations make its merger with 
Reliance more attractive, Carpenter said in an interview. Seal Beach-based 
Rockwell is seeking Reliance's industrial motors business to complement its 
industrial-automation systems.

 Hughes Aircraft Wins F-15 Radar Contract: Hughes' Radar Systems group in El 
Segundo received the $152-million award from McDonnell Douglas Corp. to develop 
an upgraded radar for Air Force F-15 fighter jets. Hughes said more than 350 
Air Force jets are candidates for the radar, as are an additional 350 F-15s 
used by Israel, Japan and Saudi Arabia. Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., 
said if all of these aircraft eventually get the upgraded radar, the program's 
value to Hughes could reach $2 billion and help protect 1,500 jobs at Hughes 
and its subcontractors on the program.

 SEC Probes Conversion Companies: Beta Well Service Inc. said the Securities 
and Exchange Commission has launched the informal investigation into it, its 
former parent Conversion Industries of Pasadena and related companies. Beta 
Well said it learned of the probe in an SEC letter dated Friday.The letter says 
the investigation is part of the commission's routine program of enforcing 
securities laws and that Beta Well shouldn't construe that any violations have 
occurred. The SEC asked Beta Well to hand over documents related to the sale of 
its securities, its overseas activities, information regarding reserves it set 
aside for uncollectible accounts, data valuing its assets and other matters. 
The American Stock Exchange recently began proceedings to delist Beta Well and 
Conversion shares because of unspecified disclosure problems.

Post story that as many as 15,000 jobs would be cut.That story, briefed in 
Tuesday's editions of The Times, said the oil company planned to cut as many as 
15,000 staff support jobs in a move to eliminate hundreds of millions of 
dollars in overhead costs. "Mobil has a total of 14,500 employees involved 
worldwide in staff functions," the company said. "While a significant reduction 
in total staff head count worldwide is expected by the end of the year, the 
number has not yet been determined."

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: INVESTORS IN BOND FUNDS SHOULD BE ASKING: WHAT IF? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you haven't looked at your bond mutual fund's share price lately, doing so 
now may cause sudden nausea. As bonds' devastating bear market moves into its 
second year, investors' principal losses are mounting again. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest surge in interest rates has driven new bond yields to 2 1/2-year 
highs, further depressing the value of older, lower-yielding bonds stuck in 
fund portfolios. Share prices of longer-term bond funds have dropped as much as 
2% just since Sept. 30, after plunging as much as 10% to 15% over the prior 12 
months, as interest rates have crept up almost nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond fund owners are still earning interest, of course, but those earnings may 
not come close to making up for the loss in share value this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if the question is how much more pain bond fund owners can take, the 
answer evidently is plenty. Despite the renewed pummeling the bond market is 
taking, many mutual fund companies say there has been little or no acceleration 
of shareholder redemptions from bond funds in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 At Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston, for example, a spokesman says 
the firm's government and corporate bond funds (total assets: $8 billion) have 
seen $59 million flow out so far this month from redemptions. That is down from 
a $70 million net cash outflow in September. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boston-based Scudder Funds also is losing less this month in bond fund 
outflows than in September, says spokesman Gavin Quill. And the Vanguard Group 
in Valley Forge, Pa., says its bond fund redemptions haven't changed 
significantly compared to September. 
</P>
<P>
 The October numbers are a continuation of the trend the fund industry has 
lived with since early summer. After suffering a massive $7.7-billion net cash 
outflow in March as interest rates rocketed, bond funds overall lost a net $2.2 
billion in May, $1.7 billion in June, $2.9 billion in July and $2.8 billion in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, money has been slowly trickling out -- not pouring out. Total 
assets of bond funds stood at $728 billion at the end of August, the latest 
figure available. Which means most investors are sitting tight in the face of 
deep principal losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Scudder's Quill says the rate at which bond fund shareholders are 
selling out of the funds isn't dramatically different this year compared to the 
last few years. "Things have been very much within the three- to four-year 
historical norm" for redemptions, he says. The difference this year is that 
people have stopped pumping new money into the funds, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of bond fund investors' willingness to stay put in the funds 
-- amid one of the worst bond bear markets in history -- raises some 
interesting questions. Do people understand how much they've lost in principal 
value? Is it that they don't care, because they own bonds solely for the income 
they produce? 
</P>
<P>
 Or do most bond fund owners view themselves as long-term investors, and expect 
to make up 1994's losses when interest rates decline again? 
</P>
<P>
 While long-term investing has proven merit, the danger is that fund owners who 
say they're in for the long haul today just haven't been clawed badly enough by 
this bear market. If market interest rates continue to rise for the next six to 
12 months -- driving bond fund share prices ever lower -- the possibility 
remains that the relative trickle out of the funds will turn into a torrent. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, few Wall Streeters believe interest rates can go much higher. With 
the 30-year Treasury bond yield now at 8.04%, compared to 5.79% at its low a 
year ago, most investment pros will argue that we're closer to the end of 
rates' rise than to the beginning of a new upward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 But bond fund owners, especially those in funds that own long-term issues, 
should be asking a big "What if?" today: What if the experts are wrong -- as 
they have been all year -- and interest rates jump again in 1995, as the world 
economy grows at a robust pace? How much more of a paper loss are you willing 
to endure? Is it worth the risk of staying in a long-term bond fund that 
yields, say, 7.5% when you can now earn 6.2% virtually risk-free in a one-year 
Treasury bill? 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting tight in a losing but otherwise solid investment can be a winning 
strategy if you can truly stick with it and wait for the next bull market. The 
problem is that most people panic and sell when the pain finally becomes too 
great. That threshold apparently hasn't yet been reached for most bond fund 
investors, but that doesn't mean the day won't come. Eroding Again

 Bond yields stayed at 2 1/2-year highs Tuesday after Monday's surge, while the 
dollar slid again and stocks finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield, which closed above 8% on Monday for the first 
time since May, 1992, remained at Monday's 8.04% mark after trading in a narrow 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 Any rally attempt in the bond market was undercut by the weak dollar, which 
set a fresh post-World War II low against the Japanese yen and a new two-year 
low against the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow industrial average eased 4.71 points to 3,850.59, 
after being down more than 20 points earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Some broader stock indexes closed marginally higher thanks to a rally in oil 
issues, but losers still outnumbered winners by 14 to 8 on the New York Stock 
Exchange in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just that fear of (interest) rates," said Jack Regan, analyst at 
Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields had leaped Monday as traders focused on this Friday's expected 
government report on third-quarter economic growth. The bond market fears that 
growth remains so strong that the Federal Reserve Board will have to raise 
short-term rates for a sixth time this year to slow business activity and 
restrain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Wall Streeters now worry that they have badly underestimated how high 
interest rates may rise in this economic cycle, even if inflation stays low. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that they've broken through (8% on the T-bond yield) and held 
through it Tuesday just worries people a little more," said Marshall Acuff, 
portfolio strategist at Smith Barney in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, the Treasury sold $17.3 billion in new two-year notes at an 
average yield of 6.88%, the highest in more than three years and slightly above 
the 6.87% yield that many traders anticipated. Today the Treasury sells new 
five-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's continuing woes weighed on bonds Tuesday. A sinking dollar makes 
foreign investors less likely to invest in U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell to 96.35 Japanese yen early in New York trading, tumbling 
through the previous postwar low of 96.55 yen set Friday. The dollar closed at 
96.70 yen, down from 97.13 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the German mark, the dollar hit a new two-year low of 1.486 marks 
during trading, then closed at 1.494, unchanged from Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, traders said the stock market held up reasonably well, 
considering the bond and dollar action. But fears are rising that any 
additional jump in interest rates could slam stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Profit takers hit many industrial issues that had surged recently on 
optimism about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers included Bethlehem Steel, off 1 1/8 to 18 1/8; International Paper, off 
1 5/8 to 75 1/4; 3M, down 1 1/4 to 54 1/8; Georgia-Pacific, off 2 1/4 to 73, 
and USX-U.S. Steel, which fell 2 3/8 to 36 3/8 after reporting 
lower-than-expected earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Food stocks, on the other hand, were a bright spot. Wrigley jumped 2 3/8 to 
43 7/8 after reporting strong earnings. Quaker Oats rose 2 1/8 to 75 on 
recurring takeover rumors, this time involving Coca-Cola, which gained 7/8 to 
50 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stocks surged on news that Mobil plans further cost-cutting efforts. 
Mobil jumped 3 to 83 1/4, Exxon added 7/8 to 60 3/8, Arco leaped 2 1/8 to 104, 
Phillips rose 1 to 34 7/8 and Unocal was up 3/4 to 28 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some U.S.-traded Mexican stocks tumbled after Mexican phone monopoly Telmex 
reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings, dragging the Mexican market 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index slid 55.24 points, or 2.1%, to 2,578.38, 
though it recovered from a stunning midday loss of 126 points. 
</P>
<P>
 On the NYSE, Telmex lost 3 1/8 to 57 3/8, Grupo Tribasa dropped 1 5/8 to 33 
7/8 and Coca-Cola Femsa gave up 7/8 to 32 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In other foreign markets, Frankfurt's DAX index plummeted 50.75 points, or 
2.5%, to 1,974.63 as German bond yields surged to six-week highs on inflation 
jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE 100 index sank 28.2 points to 3,000.9. Tokyo's Nikkei 
index lost 120.22 points to 19,732.15.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; Q & A; MAXIS' BRAUN SAYS 
EASE OF USE WILL MAKE OR BREAK MULTIMEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINA SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Gina Smith is a technology writer and 
co-host of The Personal Computing Show, a television program on CNBC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to play Mayor? Or how about God? Catering to modest fantasies such as 
these has made Orinda, Calif.-based Maxis Inc. -- developer of best-selling 
simulation games such as "SimAnt," "SimFarm" and "SimCity" -- one of the 
hottest little companies in the burgeoning multimedia entertainment industry. 
And Maxis' chairman and founder, Jeff Braun, is now making a name for himself 
as one of the industry's most outspoken critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun and software designer Will Wright founded Maxis in 1987 to create a 
different type of computer game -- one where you don't win, lose or die in the 
end. The first result, "SimCity," now has some 3 million people playing it on 
personal computers, Macintoshes and Nintendo systems around the world. The 
update to "SimCity," "SimCity 2000," has been a mainstay on software 
best-seller lists since its release last year. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the Maxis titles let you play the heady role of omniscient creator. 
Whether you're tilling the fields in "SimFarm," kissing up to the Queen in 
"SimAnt" or creating bizarre new life forms in "SimLife," you're the one at the 
controls. Your city, farm, ant colony or environment succeeds or fails as a 
result of the decisions you make over time. Just like in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun is well-known in the industry for his off-the-cuff commentary on trends 
and products. We caught up with him last week and asked him his views on Apple, 
Microsoft and the harsh realities of the consumer software market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been around as long, if not longer, than anyone else in the 
multimedia industry. What do you think is the biggest problem facing it today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Definitely, definitely ease of use. We keep on saying that the PC is a 
consumer machine, but when these people get it home, they can't use it! PCs are 
so hard to use, we're losing our credibility as an industry. We have to work on 
how to make this like a commodity consumer industry item like VCRs or video 
game machines. The PC just isn't there yet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So how does the industry go about doing that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: For one thing, you hope Apple succeeds! It really takes that Apple 
(Macintosh) type of an interface. We have very few problems with Apple products 
in our tech support, and we have an amazing amount of problems with Microsoft 
Windows on a PC. I think as Windows becomes more like a Mac -- which is what I 
hear (the next version of Windows) does -- that should pretty much take care of 
it. But only if they start releasing new hardware that is literally 
plug-and-play, if they release stuff that anyone can plug in and make work. 
People buy these PCs expecting something from the promises, but then they get 
it home and can't even get it to work. Think of how frustrating that is for 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As a software maker developing for several platforms, which one do you see 
winning? At the turn of the century, will desktop computers like PCs and Macs 
be dominant, or will the main multimedia machines be descendants of today's 
Sega and Nintendo game systems? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think right now the stable platform you can count on for the next few 
years is the IBM PC. I think that will remain stable for a while. Beyond that, 
I don't know. But for now, we can continue our PC business without any 
interruption. We're still trying to see what happens with the Sony PSX 
(multimedia game system). Or what to do if the Sega or the 3DO (multimedia 
games system) take off. We need to stay light-footed and not commit (ourselves) 
to any one platform, but to try to develop products that can take advantage of 
the strengths of all these platforms. Like 3-D. We're putting three-dimensional 
graphics in our new titles, across all platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: OK, but how about some soothsaying? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You want me to soothsay? OK then, it's the year 2000 and Motorola owns it 
all. Here's the play: Motorola buys Apple, they get the Mac, they drop the 
price, turn it into a commodity thing for consumers and go head-to-head against 
Microsoft in a big, fat way. With large, large merchandising and large, large 
dollars. And then they come up with a strategy of low-end (computer) consoles, 
like the Nintendo machine, and (hand-held computers) and notebook-type 
computers. The idea is to create a whole line -- so it goes all the way from 
consoles to (hand-held computers) to laptops and to video game machines -- and 
it's all compatible, they're all using the same files, all products will work 
on any of them. And if there's one company that can really pull it all off, 
it's Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Then what happens to the Intel platform and Microsoft Windows? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I hope it dies. Because as I said, unless we do something to make it easy 
and make it seamless for customers, we're going to lose a whole base of the 
customer. Because they're just not going to want to be involved. But if you can 
put them on this cross-platform strategy, you can bring them in. If anyone can 
do it, it's Motorola. Because if we're stuck with Bill Gates and Intel, I think 
it's going to be a total nightmare. I do not have any faith in Chicago or 
Windows 95 (the new version of Windows slated for release next year) or 
whatever they call it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why not? Lots of other software makers sing its praises. 
</P>
<P>
 A: The thing I think is most depressing is that the base configuration they've 
announced is 8 megabytes of memory. And if that's the base, you're talking more 
like 12 megs to run applications and games on it. So every machine for 
consumers is going to cost $2,000? That is not a consumer machine. And most 
computers today only have 4 megabytes. So are they all going to have to upgrade 
just for Windows 95? I just think that's insane. That alone just drives me 
nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of computer do you own? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Um, I have a 486 clone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A PC with Windows? Come on! 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, as much as I hate it. I also have a Mac, but honestly I use mostly 
Windows because I have to do all the business things. And all the business 
things are on Windows, although I hate it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Excepting your own, what are your favorite multimedia titles? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, right at the top is one called "Rock, Rap 'n' Roll." My parents are 
afraid they might break the computer. But this one, I set it up and told my 
parents they could hit any key, make any kind of music happen, and they just 
went crazy. They loved it. It's easy. And I'm just saying, now that's a 
product. Then, I would have to say "Myst." It's the mood -- the sounds, effects 
and the mood they create, it's wonderful. It really provokes the emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Beyond games like "SimCity" and multimillion-dollar fighter pilot training, 
what are simulations good for in the real world? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Any kind of training. PizzaHut is putting together a simulation where the 
employees in their off hours get off from work and play "Sim PizzaHut." You can 
literally simulate anything. You can take a problem, like traffic, and you can 
set up sims that ask: What if we rearrange the light pattern? What if we make 
them one-way streets? 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, simulations can help people learn about any situation in a 
non-linear fashion. It's very important for education and training. And very 
interesting for entertainment. And politics. You can simulate the health care 
system, like we did with "SimHealth," and help people make decisions about 
policy. You can simulate the national deficit. And you could say what's the 
largest part, what if we cut out defense? What if we got rid of the CIA? You 
could just say what if? And it's like a spreadsheet, where you can rework it 
until you get an output you find satisfactory. It's very educational. Jeff

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; TAKE TIME TO PICK FASTER MODEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the age of the information highway, that most humble of computer 
accessories -- the modem -- is suddenly assuming a very big role.  
</P>
<P>
 It's the modem that provides the essential link between the personal computer 
and the wonderful world of cyberspace: An inadequate one can render the 
fanciest PC no more useful than a machine half its price. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, when it comes to modems, I set aside my general view that it 
isn't necessary to buy state-of-the-art hardware. A faster modem can save you a 
lot of time and money, and reliability is essential. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important characteristic of any modem is its speed. Measured in bits 
per second, the speed determines how much data your modem can transmit and 
receive in a given period. Many computers sold in the last couple of years have 
modems that operate at 2,400 bps, but there are some big advantages to getting 
a faster modem. It pays to get a 14,400-bps modem and to at least consider one 
of the new 28,800 models.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who uses an on-line service or computer bulletin board to transfer 
files to their computer will soon come to appreciate the value of a faster 
modem. With 2,400 bps, it would take about 11 minutes to transfer a 
200-kilobyte file from one computer to another, while a 14,400-bps modem could 
transfer the same file in less than two minutes. If you're paying for an 
on-line service by the minute, a high-speed modem can pay for itself very 
quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 In theory, higher-speed modems can deliver even better performance, since many 
use data-compression techniques that can boost speed by a factor of four. As 
with gas mileage, your actual performance will vary depending on a host of 
factors, such as the quality of the phone line and the software.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if you don't transfer files, you'll appreciate the benefits of a faster 
modem. Most commercial on-line services now display graphics, including 
drawings, icons and even color photographs. Graphic images take up a lot more 
storage space than text, and you won't be able to see any changes in the 
display until all the data gets to your PC.  
</P>
<P>
 Before you go out and buy the fastest modem you can find, be aware that the 
extra speed won't do you any good if the modem on the other end of the line 
can't keep up. The commercial on-line services always lag behind 
state-of-the-art because it costs a great deal for them to upgrade their own 
equipment and network infrastructure. Prodigy and America Online, for example, 
can't communicate any faster than 9,600 bps. CompuServe has 14,400-bps service 
in some communities, but others are limited to 9,600 or even 2,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Most services plan to add support for 14,400 bps and 28,800 bps sometime in 
the next year or so. But until they do, you'll get no benefit from using a 
modem that exceeds the service's highest speed. Some private bulletin boards, 
which are often operated by individuals, already accommodate 28,800-bps modems. 
</P>
<P>
 How fast you can connect to the Internet also depends on what's offered by the 
company you use as a service provider. If you use the Internet and wish to take 
advantage of the graphics offered by the World Wide Web, you'll want the 
fastest connection possible. Many Web sites display color photographs, and some 
even have sound and video clips, which take up even more storage space than 
graphics. The White House's new web site, http://www.whitehouse.gov, for 
example, displays photos of the First Family, a visual tour of the White House 
and even a meow from Socks the cat. Compatibility is a very important issue, 
but the good news is that there are now international standards to use as a 
guideline. When buying a 14,400 modem, look for the "V.32 bis" standard. If you 
get a 28,800-bps modem, you should seek out V.42. These V.42 modems are just 
hitting the market, so be careful: Some dealers may still be selling older 
modems that don't meet the new standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect to pay at least $250 for a name-brand 28,800-bps V.42 modem, compared 
to about $100 for a similar 14,400. Unless you have immediate plans to use a 
service that actually supports 28,800 bps, you'll save money going with 14,400 
now and buying a faster modem a few months from now when prices will be much 
lower. Because 14,400-bps modems have been around for a while, it's pretty safe 
to buy a no-name model. If you buy state-of-the-art, it's generally wise to get 
a name brand such as Practical Peripherals, Hayes or U.S. Robotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue is whether to go for an external, internal or PCMCIA modem.  
</P>
<P>
 You save between $30 and $50 by getting an internal modem, but you have to 
take the machine apart and hope it doesn't interfere with any other boards 
inside your computer. If you have a notebook computer with a PCMCIA slot, you 
can get one of those credit-card-size modems that plug right into the side of 
the machine. They're more expensive but a lot more convenient. Buying a Modem 
</P>
<P>
 * Speed: Don't buy a modem below 14,400 bits per second (bps). But before 
spending more money for a 28,800-bps modem, be aware that most on-line services 
don't currently operate at that speed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Standards: Look for the V.32 standard for 14,400 bps, or V.42 for 28,800 
bps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fax capability: Most modems can send and receive faxes. Look for Class 1 or 
Class 2 compatibility. Either will communicate with most standard (Group 3) fax 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Internal or external?: Internal modems are less expensive, but external ones 
give you status lights and are easier to install. PCMCIA modems, which plug 
into a slot on most new notebook computers, are convenient to use while on the 
road.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; AT THE HEART OF COMPUTER 
MODELING; DESIGN: NEW PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO HELP CREATE ARTIFICIAL CARDIAC 
VALVES AND POSSIBLY EVEN ENTIRE REPLACEMENT HEARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MUKESH JHANGIANI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three-dimensional computer models of cars and airplanes and other expensive 
machines are old hat for industrial designers, but only recently have 
scientists built such a computer model for the most sophisticated mechanical 
device of them all: the human heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed by two researchers at New York University, the new heart model is 
intended initially to help in the design of artificial heart valves. 
Eventually, doctors might be able to use it to examine your heartbeat and other 
cardiac functions while you're out on the golf course -- or even to build you a 
new heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the right parameters, we can painlessly model any heart we like -- any 
shape, any size," said David McQueen, a computational scientist and mechanical 
engineer at NYU's Courant Institute and one of the heart's developers. "The 
model is a very versatile and valuable engineering tool which will help design 
any artificial device to be used in the heart, including possibly an entirely 
artificial heart." 
</P>
<P>
 McQueen and colleague Charles Peskin acknowledge that they have a long way to 
go before they can design complete hearts on a computer. Many aspects of heart 
functioning are not yet fully understood, and a computer model can only be as 
good as the scientific knowledge used to create it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the model is expected to be quite useful for designing heart valves, 
enabling scientists to create a sort of computerized test chamber for 
mechanical designs that cannot be tested in the real world without putting 
someone's life at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, manufacturers and designers have relied on trial and error to 
build artificial valves, and that has sometimes brought trouble. In the 1980s, 
some valves produced by Irvine-based Shiley began to fracture, resulting in 
deaths and numerous lawsuits against the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Valves that are currently available have been designed empirically, and there 
has not really been an opportunity to design them in a more systematic way," 
said Peskin, a physiologist and mathematician. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying the laws of fluid mechanics to all that is known about the anatomy of 
the heart and the physiology of the muscle, the researchers created a model 
that simulates the mechanical functions of the heart, such as contractions of 
the muscle, blood flow and the opening and shutting of the valves. 
</P>
<P>
 The model consists of a grid -- a regular cubic lattice -- with fluid 
mechanics, through which run rubber-band-like muscular fibers that ordinarily 
make up the heart and its pumping function. The scientists say the key to the 
process is a computational method they devised to determine the pattern and 
volume of the flow of blood inside the heart chambers, with valves posing as 
flexible barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to quantify the interaction of a flexible object -- the heart 
valve -- with the fluid into which it is immersed -- the blood. The researchers 
call it the Immersed Boundary Technique. Already, they have designed a cardiac 
valve with curved leaflets intended to alleviate clotting, a serious problem 
encountered when artificial devices come in contact with blood. 
</P>
<P>
 An existing artificial valve design, which is quite successful, uses two flat 
leaflets. "We studied this in the computer and found that it could become 
better in various ways if we curved the leaflets. We used the computer to 
determine how curved they should be," Peskin said.  
</P>
<P>
 The NYU group has received some inquiries from companies about using the 
system to improve on existing valves, but McQueen declined to divulge details. 
There are about half a dozen manufacturers of artificial valves, with worldwide 
demand totaling about 200,000 units a year.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; 'INK EATERS' COULD HELP RECYCLE PAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KATHLEEN WIEGNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Office workers who faithfully toss waste paper into company-provided recycling 
bins may not know that a vast amount of that paper still ends up in landfills. 
That's because the toners used in copying machines and printers actually melt 
the printed images into the paper, and it's impossible to remove them in an 
economical way through the usual recycling processes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Jeffries, a University of Wisconsin-Madison bacteriology professor, has a 
chemical-scrubbing enzyme that could be used to recapture paper fibers. 
Jeffries and his research team focused on cellulases, enzymes that are used in 
everything from pet food to acid-washed jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the enzymes are commercially available as well as biodegradable, using 
these "ink eaters" could cut recycling costs and greatly reduce the amount of 
chemicals used in the paper-cleaning process. Voith Inc. of Appleton, Wis., 
which tests paper technologies, will begin trials of the new process next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Smog in a Box: As every schoolchild knows -- especially if she grew up in 
Southern California -- smog is produced when sunlight interacts with industrial 
emissions and auto exhausts. At Pennsylvania State University, researchers at 
the Applied Research Laboratory have developed an air pollution control system 
based on the same photochemical process that causes smog. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Advanced Oxidation Technology being examined at Penn State, the 
reactions occur in a series of treatment modules and are allowed to continue 
until the potential pollutants are turned into harmless hydrocarbons, carbon 
dioxide and water. In effect, the researchers have found that by first creating 
smog they can better clean the air of the chemicals that cause it. 
</P>
<P>
 The process involves three steps: irradiation with ultraviolet light, that 
part of the solar spectrum that produces smog; "scrubbing" the air with 
ozonized water, and moving the scrubbed air over activated carbon to remove any 
remaining smog-producing elements. The ultraviolet rays, supplied by UV lamps, 
are more intense than those contained in sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced Oxidation Technology systems are already being used at 10 military 
and industrial facilities in the United States, but the Penn State researchers 
hope their work on "smog in a box" will help bring the cost of these systems 
down and make them more effective, allowing for broad industrial applications. 
(The process cannot be used with automobile emissions.) A Fontana company, 
Terr-Aqua Enviro Systems, is participating in the research.  
</P>
<P>
 Face to Face: A new way to map facial features, developed at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, may lead to cheaper rates for video telephone 
calls. The researchers have developed algorithms that synthesize images of 
facial expressions from the movement of the features rather than the entire 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the complete facial image need be transmitted only at the beginning of a 
call. To update the image, the algorithms select only the facial motion that is 
occurring at the most expressive points on the face, such as the eyes or lips. 
This speeds up transmission, meaning the call can be cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers used a video scanner to map the expressions of a live model 
onto a three-dimensional coordinate system displayed on a computer monitor. 
Then they created algorithms to define and locate the model's key facial 
features and mapped them onto the coordinate system. Other algorithms measured 
how much the facial features moved when the model's expression changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracking algorithms can be applied to video images of any face. In the 
future, a person's head image might be recorded on a telephone credit card and 
the information sent with every call. The technique can also be applied to 
hands to speed up sign-language recognition on video phones.

 Kinder, Gentler Military Maneuvers: Anyone who has watched a 54-ton tank tear 
up the terrain will find the idea of environmentally friendly military 
maneuvers oxymoronic. But managing the land on military training bases is a 
concern of the Army, and software developed at Houston Advanced Research 
Center's Environmental Information Systems Laboratory may make the job easier. 
Using the center's advanced software database and an easy-to-understand visual 
display with icons and windows, military environmental managers can now summon 
up a detailed look at base conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The base is divided into areas, and a manager can look up the condition of 
each area, when training exercises last took place there and the degree of 
erosion evident from using various pieces of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The database is already being used at the Army's training center in Hohenfels, 
Germany. The software may prove useful not only for other military sites, but 
for U.S. Forest Service lands and other branches of government concerned with 
conservation.

THINNER GAS PROFITS HURT CHEVRON, TEXACO; EARNINGS: RJR NABISCO INCOME NEARLY 
TRIPLES ON GROWTH OF ITS FOOD AND TOBACCO BUSINESSES.

<P>
 Slimmer profits from refining and selling gasoline hurt third-quarter earnings 
at Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc., the companies said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's third- and fourth-largest oil companies, respectively, reported 
higher net income, but the figures were distorted by extraordinary gains this 
year and one-time charges last year. Not counting the special items, Chevron's 
earnings were down 28% and Texaco's dropped 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower natural gas prices also affected both companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Phillips Petroleum Inc. said its profit tripled as it boosted 
production and kept expenses to a 1% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based Chevron earned $425 million, or 65 cents per share, on 
revenue of $9.5 billion. A year earlier, earnings were $420 million, or 64 
cents per share, on revenue of $9.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron said its chemicals business rebounded and that higher crude oil prices 
helped its oil-pumping earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco posted net income totaling $281 million, or 98 cents per share, on 
revenue of $8.96 billion. A year ago, the company earned $142 million, or 45 
cents per share, on revenue of $8.49 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Without losses from the sale of the chemical business, the White Plains, 
N.Y.-based company would have earned $317 million, or $1.13 per share, last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips reported net income of $119 million, or 45 cents a share, compared to 
net income of $41 million, or 16 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue was $3.35 
billion, up from $3.19 billion in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. said its earnings nearly tripled in the third 
quarter, reflecting accelerating growth in its tobacco and food businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating profit at the company's tobacco unit, which makes the Winston, Camel 
and Salem brands, rose 54%. The food business, including the Oreo and Ritz 
brands, posted a 24% gain in earnings from operations. 
</P>
<P>
 RJR Nabisco earned $216 million, or 11 cents a share, in the three months 
ended Sept. 30, compared to $76 million, or 4 cents a share, in the same period 
last year. Revenue rose 10%, to $3.97 billion from $3.60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic tobacco operating income climbed 90% from a year ago, when the 
industry was locked in a price war. International tobacco earnings rose 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the food business, U.S. operating earnings rose 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. posted a weaker-than-expected profit of $193 million in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The company earned 57 cents a share on revenue of $3.53 billion. A year ago, 
largely because of $353 million in restructuring costs, it lost $68 million, or 
23 cents a share, on revenue of $3.18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the one-time charge, the Rochester, N.Y., firm's earnings were down 
nearly 31% in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing a year-earlier deficit, Glendale Federal Bank reported a $9.4 
million first-quarter profit with far smaller provisions for loan losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings and loan's profit, the equivalent to 12 cents per share, contrasts 
with a loss of $19.9 million, or 63 cents per share, during the July-September 
quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That loss would have been $34 million except for a $14.1-million gain from the 
exchange of bonds of the thrift's former parent, GlenFed Inc., for common 
shares of Glendale Federal. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Federal Chairman Steven J. Trafton said most operations improved 
during the latest quarter. Net interest income rose to $88.3 million from $71.3 
million, while loan loss provisions fell to $18.8 million from $42.2 million.

COUNTY HOME RESALE PACE IS BRISK, THOUGH TOTAL DECLINES; HOUSING: MARKET WAS 
ESPECIALLY STRONG COMPARED TO THE SAME MONTH A YEAR AGO. NEIGHBORING COUNTIES 
SHOW SEPTEMBER INCREASES.

<P>
 Orange County homes on the resale market moved at a rapid clip in September, 
but figures released Tuesday by the California Assn. of Realtors seemed to 
suggest just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based trade group -- official record-keeper for single-family 
home resales in the state -- said September sales in Orange County were down 
10.6% from a year earlier. By comparison, the group reported, resales were up 
15.4% in Los Angeles County and 15.8% in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 What the trade group didn't explain was that September, 1993, was one of the 
hottest months for resales in Orange County, with 29.6% more homes closing 
escrow than a year earlier. In Los Angeles County, sales were up a mere 2.5% 
from the same month of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Neal, the Garden Grove realtor who heads the state trade association, said 
Tuesday that last month "was the second-best September for Orange County in the 
past five years," with September, 1993, of course, having been the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Other figures released Tuesday by the realtor group showed the average price 
of a single-family resale home in Orange County at $215,990 for September, down 
0.8% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 That put the cost of housing in Orange County in fourth place in the state, 
behind the San Francisco Bay Area ($256,350), Santa Clara County ($251,610) and 
Monterey County ($221,690). Mixed Message 
</P>
<P>
 September's single-family home resales in Orange County declined 10.6% from 
the same month last year. The median price also dipped a bit, but less than 1%. 
Price and sales activity changes are from September, 1993: 04,26,10,08,08

PANEL UPHOLDS CANCELLATION OF HONDA FRANCHISE; AUTOS: MANUFACTURER'S ACTION 
COMES AFTER COSTA MESA DEALERSHIP OWNERS PLEADED GUILTY IN A KICKBACK PROBE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A state auto retailing panel has upheld American Honda Motor Co.'s decision to 
cancel its franchise with Costa Mesa Honda after the owners of the dealership 
pleaded guilty to felony charges in the federal government's ongoing Honda 
kickback probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealership owners, Mark L. Benson of Costa Mesa and Edward A. Temple of 
Newport Beach, have requested a stay while their lawyers prepare an appeal, 
said American Honda attorney Mark Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Benson nor Temple was available for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have been negotiating to sell the franchise to a pair of Los Angeles 
County auto dealership owners. Honda officials reportedly want to pull the 
franchise to block Benson and Temple -- both former American Honda executives 
-- from completing the sale and making a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 If Honda takes back the Costa Mesa franchise, the prospective buyers would 
have to apply directly to the auto company and would no longer deal with Benson 
and Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 American Honda decided to terminate the franchise by invoking a so-called 
morality clause after the men pleaded guilty to felonies. That action was 
challenged by Benson and Temple but was upheld by the California New Motor 
Vehicle Board. The quasi-governmental agency, made up of auto industry 
officials, rules on disputes between dealers and the manufacturers whose cars 
they sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks said that Honda has also canceled the franchise of an Atlanta dealer 
who was involved in the kickback scheme. A total of 13 former Honda officials 
have pleaded guilty to demanding cash, cars and favors in exchange for awarding 
dealership franchises during the 1980s, when Honda was one of the nation's most 
lucrative franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Atlanta case, Brooks said, the dealer appealed the decision. The case 
went to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld Honda's action.

 Landmark Bancorp: The La Habra holding company for Landmark Bank earned 
$585,000, or 31 cents a share, for the third quarter.That was down from a 
profit of $702,000, or 37 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. 
Last year's quarterly earnings, however, were boosted significantly by a 
settlement that added $540,000 to the bottom line. For the first nine months of 
1994, Landmark earned $1.2 million, or 64 cents a share, up from a profit of $1 
million, or 53 cents a share, for the same period last year. Assets rose 26% to 
$264 million at the end of September from $210 million a year earlier.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; APARTMENT OCCUPANCY RATE AT 97.6% IN SOUTH COUNTY; 
IRVINE HAS HIGHEST

<P>
 South Orange County's apartment market is strengthening, according to a new 
report, with both rental rates and occupancy levels on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment occupancy rate for South Orange County now stands at 97.6%, up 
slightly from the 96.1% recorded during the first quarter this year, according 
to Research Network, a real estate data firm in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities with the highest occupancy rates are Irvine at 98.6%, Newport Beach at 
98% and Laguna Hills at 98.3%. Irvine, with a 2.8% increase in occupancy rates 
from earlier this year, showed the biggest jump, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach, with an average monthly rent of $987, is still the most 
expensive place to rent a typical apartment in South Orange County. Average 
rental rates in the area inched up from $856 a month to $858, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While not dramatic, the increase in rates indicates a stability in the South 
County's apartment market," said Pam Wooldridge, author of the study. Another 
sign of improvement: fewer enticements, with only 57% of the apartment 
complexes surveyed offering incentives -- one month rent-free, for example. 
That compared to 75% earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The study tracked 138 South County apartment properties with a total of 31,000 
units.

 Name Change: Koll Management Services Inc., the property management division 
of Koll Co., has changed its name to just plain Koll. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly a publicly traded unit of the Newport Beach developer, Koll will 
become a privately owned real estate services company in mid-November, when 
Freeman Spogli & Co., a Los Angeles investment firm, completes its purchase of 
nearly 50% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, announced in June, company founder Don Koll will sell about 
14% of the 64% stake he has in the company, and public investors will sell 
their 36% stake to Freeman. The company's stock will be taken off the Nasdaq 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll went public in July, 1991, with an offering of 1.1 million shares priced 
at $10 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Koll recently signed a contract to manage The Tower at Shoreline 
Square, a 366,165-square-foot building in Long Beach.

TRUCKERS, FLEET OPERATORS TO GET 1ST GENERATION OF 'SMART' VEHICLES 
</P>

From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 Collision-avoidance radar, night vision and satellite-based navigation systems 
are the newest gadgets designed to make daily commutes safer and easier, but 
auto makers say truckers and rental fleet operators will get them first. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophisticated electronic gadgets are part of Detroit's next generation of 
safety devices, supplementing today's air bags and anti-lock brakes. They are 
largely designed to alert drivers to accident threats, such as a slow-moving 
car hidden by rain and fog. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our aim is to give the driver time. Time to react, time to steer clear," said 
C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive officer of GM Hughes 
Electronics Corp., a unit of General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 GM Hughes' Delco Electronics unit is developing such radar and infrared-based 
warning systems that could reach the consumer market during the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those and other devices will be tested in the commercial truck and auto rental 
fleet markets first, industry executives said at the Convergence '94 automotive 
electronics conference here last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Delco is now selling a version of its radar warning system, called FOREWARN, 
to school bus operators for about $2,000. The system detects objects in front 
of the bus, such as small children or animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, a radar-based warning system will be sold to semi-trailer truck 
operators and will include a critical side-detection function. And GM Hughes is 
testing an infrared-based night vision system, similar to those used in the 
Gulf War, with police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too expensive for consumer consumption, but you've got to start 
someplace to prove it," Armstrong said.  
</P>
<P>
 The commercial users can more easily afford the current systems' prices and 
can see a more immediate economic benefit from their use, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the magic price threshold is about the $500 to $600 range," said 
Roger Stevens, general manager of Rockwell International Corp.'s automotive 
electronics. That's the level Rockwell hopes to bring its PathMaster 
navigational system down to in order to sell large unit volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, now being installed in some Avis rental cars, uses a global 
positioning satellite receiver to determine the vehicle's location and provide 
computerized maps and turn-by-turn instructions to drivers via a small, 
dash-mounted screen and keypad. 
</P>
<P>
 PathMaster will go on sale to the public in several months.

NEWPORT TO ASK HARBOR-AREA BUSINESSES HOW IT CAN HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 City officials are having a meeting today to see what they can do to help 
businesses that operate in and around the harbor here. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose is to gather information from operators of charter boats, boat 
yards, yacht and boat sales lots, businesses that serve other marine industries 
and bay-front property owners, Assistant City Manager Ken Delino said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Newport Beach has sponsored sessions in the past to discuss such topics 
as how retailers can create cooperative marketing strategies, today's meeting 
will have a different goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to go fishing with a hand grenade and see what floats to the 
top," Delino said. "Right now we're not sure what's going on out there. We 
don't have a good feel for what's going on in our own harbor." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's economic development committee, which organized today's session, 
works to promote four segments of the local economy: restaurants, hotels, the 
retail district and harbor businesses. Those enterprises are all interrelated, 
Delino said, but city officials don't have a clear understanding of just what 
those ties are. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers at the meeting will be Newport Beach Mayor Clarence J. Turner, 
revenue manager Glen Everroad, Orange Coast College President David Grant and 
economic development committee Chairman Rush Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is scheduled for 7:30 a.m. in the City Council chambers at Newport 
Beach City Hall, 3300 Newport Blvd.

NOT ALL TALENT SCOUTS BEHAVE LIKE MODEL CITIZENS; ETHICS: THE BETTER BUSINESS 
BUREAU SAYS AGENCIES RANKED IN THE TOP THIRD IN CONSUMER COMPLAINTS LAST YEAR. 
ADS FOR SERVICES MAY PROMISE MORE THAN THEY DELIVER. 
</P>

 Like many doting parents, Robert Bowen always felt his petite, photogenic 
daughter Jenny was destined for stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He thought she had a shot at it after responding to a newspaper ad for models 
earning $1,500 a day, no experience or fee required. Company scouts agreed the 
brown-eyed, brunette preschooler was pretty. They said she was articulate, had 
star potential. They gave her a lollipop. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen says all he got from the meeting two years back was the promise they'd 
provide a list of agencies that might find her work, along with a 
high-pressured sales pitch to spend $300 on slides and photos. The company even 
tried to persuade the 39-year-old computer operator from the Bronx to pursue 
modeling himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected there would be some work involved. I realized I had made a big 
mistake," said Bowen, who complained about the New York company to the local 
Better Business Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of parents each year are attracted to ads promising fame and fortune 
through child modeling, only to find themselves duped by con artists or 
dishonest businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Better Business Bureau says modeling and talent agencies ranked in the top 
third in consumer complaints last year. Officials believe the ranking probably 
would be higher, but many parents are reluctant to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest gripe often comes from people like Bowen who felt pressured into 
buying expensive photos or misled into thinking there would be regular work 
once they signed on. There usually isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The BBB noted the track record of one Fairfield, N.J.-based company, National 
Talent Associates, which it said has a pattern of complaints. Of 23,310 NTA 
clients, only 629 received paid employment, and only 201 of those made more 
than $500 in the last five years, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome P. Ashfield, NTA executive vice president, called the figures 
"accurate," adding that competition is often stiff. He said all clients are 
made fully aware of them before signing up, a requirement of the Federal Trade 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't always think straight when it comes to their children," said 
Lona Lucket, who's heard her share of complaints against modeling and talent 
scouts as director of the BBB office in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Her office, for instance, recently issued reports against two companies run by 
the same person in Beverly Hills. One, Vision Model, had complaints alleging 
"evaded telephone calls . . . unfulfilled contracts and dissatisfaction with 
the photos taken as a requirement of the service." 
</P>
<P>
 Star Production Studios, the BBB office said, advertised for a short period 
recently for children and adults to be cast in a TV miniseries, no experience 
necessary, then vacated its offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to contact either firm were unsuccessful; there was no phone listing 
for Vision Model in the area and a call to Star was answered by a recording 
saying the phone was disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents like to hear that their baby is the most beautiful baby in the world 
. . . and some of these places tell them that. They become star-struck thinking 
their children can become famous," Lucket said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But very few hit it big like Macauley Culkin or Brooke Shields. Even parents 
of children who do get regular work discover it takes a big commitment to come 
out ahead financially in such a competitive field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a full-time job for the parent," said Lori Beebe, of Naperville, Ill., 
who supervised the successful careers of three of her four sons. "If you get a 
call for an audition, you have to drop everything. My kids have gone on about 
1,000. You do have to pull them out of school occasionally. (But) if you get 
one or two (jobs) a month, you're thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
 Beebe, who now runs Beebe's Babies casting agency, says her children 
collectively earned in the "six figures"' over the past nine years, "enough to 
pay for about one year of college for each." (Most recently: Chase, 9, had a 
small part in the movie "I Love Trouble." Carson, 6, did a Fisher Price 
television commercial.) 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Shillingford, an executive assistant from New York, never had the 
patience to get that far. When her son Tyler was 8 months, he was chosen by a 
greeting card company to be photographed for a postcard, earning about $500. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shillingford declined further auditions, or go-sees, from the small agency 
that represented him, feeling she'd end up losing money because of lost hours 
from her job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hassle, really," she said. "It's not a weekend situation. You have to 
be ready when they call, and they'll call you at 10 at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Shillingford said she also was turned off by the agency's push to sell items 
like T-shirts and books. "I got the impression that they wouldn't work quite as 
hard for those who didn't buy them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Natasha Esch, president of Wilhelmina Models in New York, cautions parents 
against spending large sums of money on modeling lessons or big photo packages 
to their get children's careers going, especially before signing a contract 
with an agency or personal manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it costs more than $25 (initially), it's probably a scam," said Esch, 
author of the book "Wilhelmina's World of Child Modeling." "Some will try to 
get you to spend $500 to develop a portfolio. Don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to photos, Esch says, an agency will often just need to see a 
few candid snapshots to determine if a child is photogenic. Parents will have 
to purchase professional pictures after a child is signed up, although some 
agencies will advance the money with the hope of getting repaid once the child 
is working, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agencies usually take between 10% and 20% commission on the gross earnings 
from each job; photos typically cost around $200. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other expenses parents should be aware of. Some companies charge a 
fee to place models in an agency book, which includes photos and a summary of 
basic facts about models they represent. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, any model who makes more than one TV commercial is required to 
join a union, like the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists or 
the Screen Actors Guild. Initiation fees vary from $250 to $500, with 
semi-annual dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the monetary rewards can be great. While models can earn between $50 
and $150 per hour for print work (underwear jobs pay the most), earnings for TV 
commercials can easily reach in the thousands when residuals for each 
additional air play are taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have the right look, you can make a lot of money," said Ward Cottrell, 
33, a successful model for designers like Armani, Christian Dior and Yves St. 
Laurent. He now runs ModelScout Inc., a Winter Park, Fla., modeling agency. 
</P>
<P>
 For children it's not only looks, but part personality and "how well they take 
directions and listen," Cottrell added, noting that some clients prefer working 
with children who look young for their age because they're often more mature. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have a really goofy-looking kid, but you can have a star on your 
hands," agreed Esch. 
</P>
<P>
 In a quest for that right look, many well-known modeling agencies, like 
Wilhelmina, Elite or Ford, periodically advertise open calls for models. But 
out of the hundreds of people who respond, only about 2% are accepted as 
clients, according to Esch.

DISNEYLAND COURT CLOSURE A NET LOSS FOR TENNIS BUFFS; RECREATION: THEME PARK 
CITES LACK OF REVENUE FOR NEXT WEEK'S SHUTDOWN OF 18-YEAR-OLD TENNISLAND. 
</P>

 Tennis, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 Not at Disneyland after Monday, when the theme park will close Tennisland, a 
10-court facility that serves the general public, nearly a dozen tennis leagues 
and guests at several nearby hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland is closing the 18-year-old tennis facility on South Walnut Street 
near Disneyland for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just hasn't been generating enough revenues from club memberships," said 
Disneyland spokesman Joseph Aguirre. "There are little more than 100 members . 
. . and we're making refunds of membership dues." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Tennisland members complained that Disneyland gave them less than two 
weeks' notice of the closing, which came just weeks after a $40,000 
refurbishing.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a beautiful facility and it's such a shame that they're closing 
it," said Anaheim resident Fran Wiseman, who's been playing at Tennisland for 
about eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennisland will be closed to the public as of Tuesday, but leagues will be 
allowed to play through Dec. 12, according to a club spokeswoman. The park has 
not determined what will replace Tennisland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're considering some other options," Aguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tennisland closes, there will still be about 50 tennis courts in Anaheim 
available for public use, said Mark Deven, city director of Recreation and 
Community Services. "What it will mean is court shortages at peak hours of the 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennisland served guests at the Disneyland Hotel, but it was also used by 
guests at the nearby Hilton and Marriott properties, which don't have courts. 
Hotel spokesmen said that closing Tennisland won't generate a loss in bookings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get a great number of inquiries for tennis," said Hilton spokesman 
Patrick Hynes. "We get a lot more requests for golf. We'll have to find an 
alternative tennis facility, though, because our concierge takes pride in 
finding a facility for every possible sport."
